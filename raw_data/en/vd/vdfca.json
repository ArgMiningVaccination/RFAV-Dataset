Diagnostic Medical Sonographer Study Findings Presenter Ms. Jackson Mr. Wells reminded the Committee that the draft of the Diagnostic Medical Sonographer report in the meeting p acket is the final staff draft of the research conducted. Ms. Jackson provided an overview of the repor t and acknowledge d that n o public comment had been received by the deadline. Review of the Criteria The Committee then moved to discussion of its findings and recommendations. The Committee agreed that the profession, itself, did not pose a risk of harm to the public re sponsive to Criterion One. Criterion One: Risk for Harm to the Consumer On properly seconded motion by Mr. Salay the Committee voted that t here is insufficient evidence of harm attributable to the practice of diagnostic medi cal sonography by individuals credentialed to justify regulation by the state . However, the Committee has concerns about the emerging use of 3 -D sonography for \"Keepsakes\" being offered by some photographers and recommends referral of the issue to the full Board for further discussion. All members voted in favor, none opposed. Naturo pathic Doctor Study Findings Presenter Dr. Carter 3 4 Mr. Wells reminded the Committee that the Naturopathic Doctor report provided in the meeting packet is the final staff draft of the research conducted. Dr. Carter provided an overview of the report and summarized the public comment the Board office received by August 17, 2020, 5:00 p.m. Public Comment Review Dr. Carter reported that written comment was received by the Board office from July 27 , 2020 through August 17 , 2020 (5:00 p.m.) and that oral comment was also received during a public hearing on August 11, 2020. All comments have been provided in advance of today's meeting . There were over 170 written comments, with 14 opposed and 15 oral commenters, with nine in favor and six in opposition. Pros of regulation: Over 90 comments in favor were from the patients of the group seeking regulation. Most cited the aid they or their family members had received from NDs, the costs associated with having to go to other providers for physical examinations and testing, and some noted confusion over the different types of naturopathic providers. The remaining comments were from ND st udents, their parents, ND organizations at state and national levels, and individuals from other provider professions. Several commenters noted that NDs could work safely in solo practices and in primary care and integrative care practices. Cons of regula tion: Individuals working as what the report refers to as traditional naturopaths indicated that they are not interested in, nor do they feel it is necessary, to regulate the practice of naturopathy , itself, because it is non -invasive. They referred to t he Board's 2005 study conclusions to that effect. They also cited the concern that those seeking regulation as naturopathic doctors have been evolving their practice s and are divert ing from pure naturopathy to include the allopathic features . This group is very much opposed to state regulation as they feel it will affect their ability to make a living. According to them, they are not causing harm now. Commenters from the Medical Society of Virginia and sever al allopathic specialty organizations expressed converns over eduational training differences between NDs and MDs and the variability among ND education and training, over time, that may not enable each ND to adequately address patient needs, especially children. Mr. Wells entertained a m otion to accept the draft of the Naturopathic Doctor report. On properly seconded motion by Ms. Hershkowitz, all members voted in favor, none opposed. The Committee then moved on to discussion of its findings and recommendations. Review of the Criteria 4 5 The Committee discussed the research and public comment and determined their findings and recommendations responsive to the Criteria, as follows: Criterion One : Risk for Harm to the Consumer The group seeking regulation does present a potential for harm t o the consumer that could be remedied through state regulation. The Committee deemed it important that consumers to be able to readily distinguish among practitioner types . The Committee is also concerned over the potential for harm from delays i n care attributable to the inability of practitioners to conduct physical examinations and certain tests, themselves , often requiring the consumer to go elsewhere for these services. Criterion Two: Specialized Skills and Training The profession has demonstrated requirements for specialized skills and training . Criterion Three: Autonomous Practice The profess ion is practiced within its legislatively focused scope of practice autonomously in some states and in collaborative arrangements in others. Criterion Four: Scope of Practice The scope of practice is distinct although there is overlap with other professions. The scope should be determined by the Legislature taking into consideration the specific e ducational curriculum , training , and competency examination. Criterion Five: Economic Impact Regulatio n of this group is justified to help consumers avoid the cost of duplicated services. Other practitioners of naturopathy could have statutory exemptio ns that continue to permit them to practice. Criterion Six: Alternatives to Regulation The Committee held that all six criteria were met and that consumer redress through the Better Business Bureau and civil remedies do not adequately address the potential for patient harm. State regulation could do so. Criterion Seven : Least Restrictive Regulation The Committee concluded that registration and statutory certification (title protection) do not adequately address the potential for patient care harm. Ms. Hershkowitz moved the following: The Committee recommends licensure of naturopathic doctors, u nder the Board of Medicine, to authorize t he scope of practice that includes physical exams, orders and interpretation of lab tests, orders for medical imaging to be interpreted by an other qualified provider to not include prescriptive authority of pharmac euticals other than those specifically of the naturopathic variety or over the counter. And to include a recommendation to include the following statement f rom 5 6 SB858: Any lay person who is not licensed under this chapter from (i ) providing natural health consulting on ayurvedic medicine, traditional naturopathic therapies, herbalism, nutritional advice, or homeopathy, or (ii) from selling vitamins and herbs, provided the person or lay practitioner does not use any title prohibite d under \u00a7 54.1 -2956.14 . The motion was property seconded by Mr. Salay. Discussion: After discussion, the following amended motion was made by Ms. Hershkowitz. Amended Motion: The Committee moves that licensure of N aturopathic Doctors seeking regulation be recommended. T he scope of practice should include physical exams, orders relating to lab tests and interpretation of lab tests, orders for x-rays or other videography but with the interpretation by another qualified practitioner. Further there should be no prescriptive authority for legend drugs. The profession should be regulated under the Board of Medicine. Also, lay practitioners who are not licensed under this chapter are not precluded from (i) providing natural health consulting on Ayurvedic medicine, traditional naturopathic therapies, herbalism, nutritional advice, or homeopathy, or (ii) from selling vitamins and herbs, provided the person or lay practitioner does not u se any title prohibited under \u00a7 54.1 -2956.14 . The motion carried with all members in favor of the amended motion, none opposed. New Business Presenter Mr. Wells Discussion There was no new business.

Oral comment was also received during a public hearing on August 11, 2020. All comments have been provided to the Regulatory Research Committee in advance of the August 20, 2020 meeting. There were over 170 written comments , with 161 (three duplicates) in favor of licensure and 14 in opposition. There were 15 oral commenters, with nine in favor and six in opposition. Among those favoring regulation, the vast majority (99 written and one oral) indicated that they we re patients. Most cited ND aid in their or their family members' medical conditions, the cost associated with going to other providers to obtain physical examinations and testing, and s ome noted confusion over the different types of naturopathic providers . Among the last group , several had come from other states that regulate the profession. T he remaining comments in favor were fr om NDs, ND students and their parents, ND organizations at state and national levels , and individuals from other provider profes sions, such as physicians, chiropractors, nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral science practitioners who had experience with the profession. Several noted that NDs could work in solo practices or primary care and integrative care practices. Among those oppo sed to regulation, 14 provided written comment and six oral. The chief concerns reported were that naturopathy, itself, as originally defined and practiced by more than 400 practitioners throughout the state does not pose harm. As such, they contend that these practitioners should not be required to become regulated by the state. They also note concerns over the potential impact to jobs and access by consumers seeking traditional naturopathy and other forms of natural healing support. Other concerns relate d to patient safety were that the ND group nationally has departed from original naturopathy by incorporating certain allopathic medicine practices such as vaccinations, minor surgeries, and prescribing label drugs, for example. Additionally, the Medical S ociety of Virginia and several constituent specialty associations, including a representative from the Virginia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics expressed concerns over educational and training differences between NDs and MDs and variability a mong ND education and training over time that may not enable each ND to adequate address patient needs, especially children 8TUESDAY , AUGUST 11, 2020 11:19 A.M.

MORRIS: Can everybody hear me 8 okay? 9 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes sir. 10 DR. MORRIS: Excellent, excellent, 11 okay. I wrote some things down because I want to 12 make sure I get it in, so I will try to be brief. 13 My name is Dr. Cliff Morris, I'm a Board- 14 certified cardiologist practicing preventive 15 cardiology for over twenty-five years in the 16 Richmond area. I would like to share my 17 experience in working with naturopathic doctors 18 in my area and to provide more clarity around the 19 importance of licensing naturopathic doctors. 20 More specifically, I would like to speak to some 21 of the seven criteria purported by the Board as 22 it relates to naturopathic doctors. Licensing 23 naturopathic doctors provides additional safety 24 for the consumer, where the patients have, can 25 have transparency by the practitioner's 11In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 4 10 1 credenti als. It also helps medical professionals 2 like me in knowing basically who I'm dealing 3 with. It's vital that we all hold each other 4 accountable and I think having naturopathic 5 doctors licensed would be the best way to do 6 that, and naturopathic doctors really want to be, 7 they want to be held accountable, and I think 8 that's going to be the best for healthcare in 9 Virginians and everybody in general. In 10 addition, licensing naturopathic doctors would 11 lessen the social and economic burden within the 12 communities. Lack of primary care adds emotional 13 and financial burden on providers and the system 14 as a whole, and due to the lack of primary care 15 providers, patients often show up in emergency 16 rooms in critical condition, you know, in surgery 17 and emergency departments, and this is a 18 financial weight that we all suffer. So much of 19 this is done prior to them coming to the 20 emergency room and you know, be coming in in 21 emergent condition. The extents of secondary or 22 tertiary prevention, including repair and 23 surgeries are more expensive than true 24 prevention, and that's what naturopathic doctors 25 are, they are preventive, they are preventative12 1 this is again what makes them different, and in 2 this COVID-panicked society, this becomes very, 3 very important. I have been working with 4 naturopathic colleagues for over ten years, and 5 my relationship with naturopathic doctors, I'm 6 uniquely grateful that I have the ability to 7 provide collaborative care to my patients. They 8 know when to refer. They work collaboratively 9 and individually, but at the time naturopathic 10 doctors in Virginia, as you know, aren't able to 11 work to the full scope of their training, they 12 are unable to order labs, and not able to get 13 imaging, conduct physical exams, even though they 14 have been trained to do so. You can see in 15 Maryland naturopathic doctors providing these 16 services because those jurisdictions license 17 naturopathic doctors and allow them to function 18 autonomously. When I see that naturopathic 19 doctors are working to the best of their ability 20 without the basic tools of physical exam and 21 labs, not having these basic tools can lead to 22 harm for patients and I think this really needs 23 to change. So in summary, I am in full support 24 of licensing naturopathic doctors and I am 25 encouraging the Board to recommend in favor of 11 1 doctors. That's their specialty. So licensing 2 naturopathic doctors is a preventative measure, 3 it's cost effective, and that same solution for 4 all healthcare sectors. The knowledge and 5 ability of naturopathic doctors enables them to 6 transfer various therapies, individualizing them 7 as needed for each person, they bring a very 8 unique skillset to the existing licensing 9 providers currently in Virginia. Naturopathic 10 doctors also have a limb of compassionate care 11 that any traditional doctor typically cannot 12 provide consistently. This makes them unique in 13 their approach, they treat and see the entire 14 person holistically and in many cases the 15 naturopathic doctor can provide additional 16 services that I personally don't have time to 17 address or nor that I received in my training. 18 More specifically I wish that I had received 19 instruction within therapeutic nutritional 20 counseling during my conventional medical 21 training, but it was not in my curriculum. 22 Knowing that I can refer to them to help my 23 patients, reassure them, because they can spend 24 the time dealing with the psychosocial aspect as 25 they approach the medical disease themselves, and13 1 licensure as well. Let's allow my naturopathic 2 colleagues the ability to work to the fullest of 3 their capability in their training and scope, 4 while delivering humanistic, preventive and 5 individual, personal care to every patient. In 6 over ten years I have experiencing, of experience 7 working with naturopathic doctors, I respect them 8 as just that, doctors. Thank you for your 9 consideration. 10 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, Dr. 11 Morris. If I could ask you to mute so we don't 12 over... 13 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 14 you. Could I ask a question? 15 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure, sure. One 16 thing, let me do one little housekeeping thing 17 here that I should have. In order to gain full 18 information, the speakers, we will allow 19 Committee Members and staff members to ask 20 questions because this is our one opportunity for 21 a little bit of give and take and some 22 information, so Dr. Carter, you have a question? 23 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Are 24 there any Members first, anyone have a question 25 about, okay. 12In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 5 14 1 CHAIRMA N WELLS: Sure. Are any of 2 the Committee Members, do they have a question 3 for Dr. Morris? 4 COMMITTEE MEMBERS: (No audible 5 response.) 6 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, go ahead. 7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: You've 8 been working them for the past ten years? I'm 9 sorry. So the services that they have been 10 providing, have they been able to bill for that 11 through you or is it something that they just do 12 as individuals? 13 DR. MORRIS: No, they just, they 14 do not bill to me, they, they have their own 15 individual service that they bill though in their 16 offices. 17 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Right. 18 And do you have, like for example, for nurse 19 practitioners there would be a, would have been 20 changed recently. A collaborative practice 21 written agreement or is it more a little less 22 formal than that? 23 DR. MORRIS: It's less formal. I 24 have, I have no written agreement with them, it 25 is strictly a trust issue, and you know, I'm a16 1 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Any further 2 questions from any Committee Members or anyone? 3 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 4 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, Dr. 5 Morris. 6 DR. MORRIS: Okay. 7 CHAIRMAN WELLS: We will now move 8 on to Dr. Sarah Garden... 9 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: 10 Giardenelli. 11 CHAIRMAN WELLS: ... Giardenelli, 12 President of the Virginia Association of 13 Naturopathic Physicians. 14 DR. GIARDENELLI: Hello, my name 15 is Sarah Giardenelli, I'm a naturopathic doctor 16 and President of the Virginia Association of 17 Naturopathic Physicians. On behalf of all our 18 members, I would like to thank the Committee for 19 your diligence in researching naturopathic 20 medicine and to see between medically trained 21 naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. 22 It is clear that a great amount of 23 labor went into this, and your efforts are much 24 appreciated. In 2005 the VAANP is the 25 professional society representing medically 15 1 preventive cardiologist, so I'm going to send my 2 folks to somebody who is interested in getting my 3 folks well. You know, in medical school we 4 learned a lot about how to put people on drugs 5 and medications, but very little about how to get 6 people off drugs and medications, and preventing, 7 in my opinion, is the answer, but I think the 8 naturopathic doctors, in my experience, have been 9 very, very useful and effective at that. I like 10 the fact that they, they know when to stop, they 11 know, at least the ones I have dealt with, they 12 know when to back off, and they know when to ask 13 questions, and I think just giving them the 14 opportunity to work collaboratively I think is 15 going to be a great thing, I'm sure, particularly 16 again, I'm seeing more patients today with racing 17 hearts and anxiety because of this COVID 18 situation around us, and you know, the politics, 19 and you know, I've, I've heard, I tell my 20 patients cut the TV off. 21 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 22 you very much, I appreciate it. 23 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, Dr. 24 Morris. 25 DR. MORRIS: Okay.17 1 trained naturopathic doctors, or ND's in 2 Virginia. 3 We have been pursuing licensing 4 since 2005, the same year that naturopaths and 5 naturopathic medicine were first evaluated by the 6 Board of Health Professions. We were the first 7 profession to be evaluated under the standing 8 criteria. We track data on medically trained 9 ND's and to our knowledge, there are currently 10 around forty practice locations of licensable 11 ND's, comparatively there were only sixty genetic 12 counselors total living or working in Virginia at 13 the time licensure was recommended for that 14 profession in 2014. And there are only currently 15 forty-six operating in Virginia. 16 Both traditional naturopaths and 17 medically trained ND's have shared roots, the 18 split between the two groups occurred after the 19 release of the PLSMA Report in 1910. This report 20 spurred a nationwide shift for all healthcare 21 providers to educational, scientific, and 22 professional standards. Safety, accountability, 23 professional standards, this is why we are here. 24 While naturopathic medicine is generally safe 25 there is a risk of harm, just as there is with 13In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 6 18 1 any other health profession. 2 The written comment being 3 submitted by the VAANP provides examples of harm 4 from both medically trained ND's and lay 5 naturopaths, some tragic and heartbreaking that 6 highlight the importance of regulation. One 7 particular example in Virginia Beach still weighs 8 on me, and this ND is still seeing clients due to 9 lack of regulation in Virginia. 10 Finally, in regards to economic 11 impact, our members are often referred the most 12 difficult cases from our medical colleagues. It 13 is common for patients to tell our members, I've 14 seen everyone else, you are my last resort. Many 15 of us have become expert in supporting such folk 16 in redeeming their health, with one hand tied 17 behind our backs given the lack of licensure. 18 Imagine what more we could offer our patients 19 most in need to the healthcare system with a 20 practice license that would increase patient 21 access to a scope of services more in line with 22 our rigorous training and enable us to serve in 23 all our areas. 24 Imagine. Imagine your son or 25 daughter having invested in their passion and not20 1 DR. GIARDENELLI: We have a 2 state... 3 MR. SALAY: How do you see that 4 changing? 5 DR. GIARDENELLI: Yes, already. 6 With the lack of licensure, there's no insurance 7 company that will credential us at this point and 8 we also because of lack of licensure cannot use 9 even a level of service or basic insurance 10 coding, because that would be practicing medicine 11 without a license. So right now our patients 12 just pay us for the time, so it's the personal 13 risk and we can't even get them pills, and 14 licensing would change that because we would be 15 able to provide medical level care that would be 16 able to justify the use of the same codes that 17 other healthcare providers us that would allow 18 for some level of reimbursement perhaps. Thank 19 you. 20 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right. 21 Anyone else? 22 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 23 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Carter? 24 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: 25 Speaking to, I know you mentioned pills, are you 19 1 being able to return to their home state or 2 coming home and then starting to pay off their 3 large medical school loans, because the reality 4 is that it is difficult for our members to serve 5 and to thrive without licensing, and it defines 6 scope of practice and the way ought to be able 7 to. 8 Licensing naturopathic doctors is 9 a benefit for our Commonwealth, for the 10 overburdened healthcare system, for the ND's who 11 lives and work in Virginia, and most importantly, 12 for safe and informed access to naturopathic 13 medicine and care for patients. Thank you again 14 to the Committee for your diligence, time, and 15 effort and consideration of full licensure for 16 medically trained naturopathic doctors. 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, Dr. 18 Giardenelli. Okay. Do any Committee Members 19 have a question for Dr. Giardenelli? 20 MR. SALAY: Yes, I do. 21 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, Mr. Salay. 22 MR. SALAY: Doctor, so what are 23 your current revenue sources? Is it a fee for 24 service, is it, does the client pay out of pocket 25 and...21 1 all seeking prescriptive authority? What's the 2 scope that you all are envisioning for your 3 profession? 4 DR. GIARDENELLI: That's a great 5 question, and I know colleagues speaking out for 6 me that include that in their testimony, and so 7 if it's okay with you for me to defer to them, I 8 will do that. Is that okay? 9 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: That's 10 fine, thank you. And there's just one other 11 point. You aren't the first to have the criteria 12 while we have been doing this since 1986, but 13 anyway, just wanted you to know over a hundred 14 professions have been reviewed using the 15 criteria, so. We didn't pick on you. 16 DR. GIARDENELLI: Thank you for 17 that. 18 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 19 you. 20 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, thank 21 you Doctor. Next, Dr. Robert... 22 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Mr. Chair? Mr. 23 Chair? 24 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes, yes. 25 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: This is Louise 14In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 7 22 1 Hershk owitz. 2 CHAIRMAN WELLS: I'm sorry. 3 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: I did have a 4 couple of questions. 5 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure. 6 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: It was noted in 7 the report that naturopathic doctors, I'm sorry, 8 are trained at primary care providers and primary 9 care physicians. To what degree do you 10 understand that naturopathic doctors can provide 11 the full scope of primary care as opposed to 12 being interactive with other primary care 13 providers? 14 DR. GIARDENELLI: So right now 15 it's my understanding that I believe have for 16 clients, right, there are six states where 17 naturopathic doctors are recognized as primary 18 care providers, and in those states approximately 19 now there are more of those providers seen to be 20 at least in Oregon, I van speak to Oregon, over 21 how this needs to be fulfilling our role, working 22 as a client's primary care providers, and the 23 other half are working more in a specialty role. 24 And Vermont has a similar model where some of the 25 naturopathic doctors participate in a single24 1 you, Dr. Giardenelli. 2 DR. GIARDENELLI: Thank you. 3 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Next, Dr. 4 Robert Kachko. Kachko? 5 DR. KACHKO: That's correct, 6 either/or. Thank you so much for the time. So 7 Dr. Robert Kachko, President of the American 8 Association of Naturopathic Physicians. I just 9 want to start by thanking the Chair, Dr. Carter, 10 and the Committee for the time this morning. I 11 want to briefly cover three key areas, and then 12 answer any questions that you may have. I want 13 to talk about who we are at the AANP as a 14 national profession of naturopathic physicians. 15 I want to talk about why we are working for all 16 this nationally and what we are working for 17 nationally, and then I want to end on why it's so 18 important. So in terms of who we are, the AANP 19 represents several thousand licensed or 20 licensable ND's within four year primary care 21 level naturopathic medical programs, and we can 22 diagnose and treat for truly comprehensive bio 23 sectors. And these are currently licensed or 24 regulated in twenty-five U.S. jurisdictions and 25 we are pending in many more, with pending 23 1 program, and then some of the naturopathic 2 doctors there to focus on specialty care where 3 they are working on collaborating, 4 collaboratively, so it's both, to answer your 5 question, it's both. But we can help fill the 6 gap and we also help work collaboratively. 7 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: My other 8 question had to do with, and this may be 9 something your colleagues will take up, but in 10 examining the broad scope of the states provide 11 access through ND's, is there a model there that 12 you think would be appropriate in Virginia? 13 DR. GIARDENELLI: Yes, and my 14 colleague, Marie, Dr. Marie Rodriguez will be 15 speaking to those points and the model that we 16 are hoping to provide, and also my colleague and 17 you all might be able to answer some of those 18 questions more specifically. I could answer it 19 but I am going to be addressing that in their 20 testimony if you don't mind holding for it. 21 We're also happy to provide it. Thank you. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right. Any 23 other questions? 24 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 25 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, thank25 1 legislation of many more. Nearby as I have 2 mentioned earlier, we are licensed in Maryland 3 and Washington, D.C., which will become pertinent 4 in a moment. 5 Nationally we have three goals as 6 it pertains to regulation. We are working to 7 extend educated access to comprehensive medical 8 care we all know about the shortages of primary 9 care, and how this contributed to difficulties. 10 We are working to insure that medically trained 11 ND's can practice to the full extent of their 12 training and scope, and also to insure that using 13 the title Naturopathic Doctor means that the 14 provider graduated from an accredited 15 naturopathic medicine program. Important there, 16 our goal is not to restrict actual healthcare 17 practitioners from working or to make natural 18 therapy an exclusive province of ND's. In 19 similar testimonies earlier about counseling and 20 mental health. 21 Turning to why this is so 22 important. Quite simply, without it there is too 23 much patient confusion. This becomes an issue of 24 consumer protection. There currently exists in 25 the State of Virginia and other unregulated 15In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 8 26 1 states, a legitimate risk of harm without 2 regulation and general protection. I can give an 3 example of my practice. I practice as a 4 naturopathic physician with full scope in the 5 State of Connecticut, I practice as a separate, 6 licensed acupuncturist in the State of New York. 7 My patients will leave the State of New York when 8 they need comprehensive medical care, because we 9 are not licensed or regulated there. Most people 10 in the unregulated states and unregulated 11 jurisdictions simply don't know to do this, and 12 that brings up opportunity where they might miss 13 a red flag that the patient comes in with. I 14 will give an example of a patient coming in, and 15 this has happened in my practice multiple times 16 concerning chest pain. As a primary care team 17 provider, I'm able both to help them get 18 diagnosed, I'm able to run an EKG and interpret 19 an EKG, and I'm able to refer for appropriate 20 acute care. 21 If that red flag of chest pain is 22 mismanaged by someone who has not had the 23 appropriate training, for example, mismanaged as 24 a musculoskeletal injury, I don't have to tell 25 you about the imminent threat that that provides.28 1 Leah Hollen, Hollen? 2 DR. HOLLEN: (No audible 3 response.) 4 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: She's 5 muted. 6 DR. HOLLEN: Can you hear me? 7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Here 8 she comes. 9 CHAIRMAN WELLS: There you go. 10 Yes ma'am. 11 DR. HOLLEN: Hello, everyone. My 12 name is Leah Hollen, and I am a naturopathic 13 doctor. I live and work in Richmond, Virginia, 14 but before I started my actual comment. I am 15 happy to answer any questions about what ND's are 16 envisioning for this global practice at the 17 appropriate time, and so I just wanted to offer 18 that I served as a legislative chair and I can 19 speak to that happening with many other people to 20 crack the right kind of scope in Virginia, so. 21 If it's okay I will go ahead though and provide 22 my actual verbal testimony now, if that's okay. 23 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Go right ahead. 24 DR. HOLLEN: So my passion has 25 always been around prevention. Yes, can you hear 27 1 As a provider in Connecticut that's particularly 2 concerning, but we have the same, the same 3 challenge in Maryland and D.C. As everyone 4 knows, people can live in Virginia and work in 5 D.C., they might know what a naturopath is, what 6 a naturopathic doctor is, and it's expected that 7 they have that four year medical training under 8 their belt. Unfortunately that's not always the 9 case, and our primary concern is to mitigate that 10 problem, but also to prevent chronic disease and 11 to do a truly comprehensive bio synthesis. Thank 12 you to the Committee for your attention, and I'm 13 happy to answer any questions. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Any 15 questions folks? 16 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Clark? 18 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: No. 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. 20 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 21 you. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, 23 Doctor. 24 DR. KACHKO: Thank you. 25 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Next, Dr.29 1 me? 2 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes. 3 DR. HOLLEN: Okay, sorry. My 4 passion has always been around prevention, this 5 is what led me to obtain my Master's in public 6 health and to naturopathic medicine. This is 7 because naturopathic doctors specialize in 8 prevention. We educate and empower patients as 9 well as communities to shift from disease into 10 health. We work holistically to encompass the 11 mind, body, and spirit, to also not just address 12 the physical ailments, but also complex issues 13 that we face as a society, including issues of 14 addiction, pain, and even imprints of 15 transgenerational trauma. We incorporate aspects 16 of the whole person and whole systems. In 17 addition to prevention, many of us see patients 18 that have failed multiple lines of therapy and 19 don't fit into a box, therefore we specialize in 20 restoration, and for some of the most vulnerable 21 patients. A large amount of my work includes 22 putting people back together after surgery, 23 radiation, chemotherapy, and we see some of the 24 most challenging cases because we are trained to 25 look at the deepest roots of illness to find the 16In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 9 30 1 me chanisms back to wholeness. And due to this, we 2 see those who are lost in the system, despite 3 their best efforts and those of their doctors. 4 For some patients there is nothing 5 else to be offered. I cannot begin to tell you 6 the number of people that share with me that I am 7 their last hope. These words bring a level of 8 discomfort, and the reason is because working in 9 an unlicensed state is a heavy responsibility. 10 We have few resources to monitor the most 11 vulnerable patients because we cannot perform 12 physical exams, or run basic labs or imaging. 13 Yet they have been entrusted to us. Without the 14 scope of practice, monitoring becomes challenging 15 trying to consistently coordinate with other 16 physicians to run labs is insufficient, it comes 17 with a burden, and that burden is often to miss 18 multiple patients. It is not ethical and it is 19 not in line with our Hippocratic oaths. Everyone 20 suffers. This is harm. But let's factor in 21 something that is no in the criteria, a pandemic. 22 This pandemic is amplifying the gaps in our 23 system, our primary care has been overburdened 24 for years, as many of our specialists. With 25 COVID, many have left medicine altogether, and32 1 importantly that our gifts will be accepted. I 2 thank you for your time and I ask that the Board 3 vote in favor of regular licensure. 4 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. Any 5 questions from the Board? 6 BOARD MEMBERS: (No audible 7 response.) 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: From the 9 Committee Members? 10 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Mr. Chair? 11 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes ma'am. 12 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Mr. Chairman? 13 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes ma'am. 14 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: This is Louise 15 Hershkowitz. Dr. Hollen, how as a trained 16 naturopathic doctor do you determine when to 17 refer? 18 DR. HOLLEN: Great question. So 19 honestly, you know, based upon that person, we 20 require that all of our patients have a primary 21 care on board, and if they have cancer they are 22 required to have an oncologist, if they are a 23 child they are required to have a pediatrician, 24 so I just wanted to kind of share that we have, 25 we try to pull as many supports in, and help in 31 1 now the gap is widening for patients. 2 Six weeks ago I had a patient on 3 the brink of psychosis, I called two offices, I 4 couldn't get her in for a psychiatric consult for 5 seven weeks. One person offered me four months. 6 My choice was to figure it out on my own or send 7 her inpatient. She's a mother of four, and the 8 ethical dilemma of not being able to have a 9 license was amplified. I have no prescribing 10 rights and no hospital privileges. Another 11 patient progressed to pyelonephritis after being 12 turned away by her PCP. She sat in an ED waiting 13 room for four hours during the pandemic. But if 14 I suspect the patient has COVID, I'm unable to 15 even run basic testing. I must refer them with 16 the hopes of the testing that they're going to is 17 efficacious. And these cases present moral and 18 ethical dilemmas in patient care around 19 monitoring and prevention. This is also harm. 20 Maybe with this pandemic it is 21 time where we can now make a different choice, 22 one that chooses to lessen the pain, to prevent 23 further harm, and to engage in restoration. 24 Maybe at this time we, as naturopathic doctors, 25 can be more fully seen, recognized, and most33 1 with that. So just with any patient is that 2 within primary care or within any type of 3 profession that is seeing patients, we are 4 trained, and that's why we also take licensing 5 exams that we know are going to refer. 6 So if we have a patient that is not 7 responding to therapy, we have, I mean I have 8 over, about six hundred individuals in my 9 database of referrals, whether it's for 10 psychiatric, like the person that I shared with 11 you today of, you know, I had to do a lot of work 12 to get that patient appropriately seen. So it 13 obviously is person-specific as to what's going 14 on, if they're not responding, we know that 15 that's an issue, but we're also trained if 16 somebody comes in and we suspect appendicitis, we 17 know exactly what to do for that. I don't know 18 if that, does that help? 19 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: It helps. A bit 20 of follow up. If you should be licensed, would 21 that change how you consider referral? 22 DR. HOLLEN: It could, depending 23 on the scope that is, and I can speak a little 24 bit to the scope since there's a few questions 25 about that. Within, when we put forward 17In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 10 34 1 leg islation this past session, we worked with a 2 lot of other stakeholders to come up with 3 language and to also have, you know, a lot of 4 good dialogue and we recognize as, as a 5 profession that hopefully will be licensed in the 6 State of Virginia in the coming years, that we 7 want everyone to recognize that we are serious 8 about this. 9 We want people to have faith in us 10 and to know what we are doing, so with that scope 11 we crafted that with a number of different 12 stakeholders within medicine to basically provide 13 the basics so, or the structure of, we think at 14 least having some form of scope that includes 15 physical exams and also imaging, and also labs is 16 a basic, right? So those were some of the things 17 that we crafted, not on our own, but also in 18 collaboration with other providers out there. So 19 our goal is to, in other states, we, you know, we 20 work together, this is what we do, we're all in 21 this together, so we need to keep crafting that 22 and, and, and realize that this isn't just us 23 putting this, this is many stakeholders coming 24 together and that's what we did within our 25 language, and that was the most updated language36 1 And then for the counselors and things like that, 2 we have so many counselors that are sending 3 patients to us and we send them also plenty of 4 patients. 5 We work with a lot of people with 6 a lot of trauma because that's a need of that we 7 know. So much of trauma shows up on the physical 8 manifestation of a person, and so we, we are 9 trained in some counseling course, there are 10 those crossovers, but when there's lots of people 11 who are trained with pharmacotherapy or drug 12 therapy hitters, nurse practitioners, PA's, 13 PASMD's, even, of course, pharmacists, and also 14 ND's. So it is, you know, there's lots of things 15 that are shared by many different physical 16 partners and that's what makes medicine the 17 greatest, that network of providers to help one 18 another. We haven't had the pushback, you know, 19 we had a lot of physical therapy, occupational 20 therapists who see a lots of children with 21 disabilities and/or developmental delay, so we 22 work with a lot of different pediatric, you know, 23 a lot of families, and knowing also if there's an 24 issue we, we of course, refer as somebody touched 25 on earlier, but hopefully that helps. 35 1 at the last session in SC-858. Does that help? 2 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Okay, thank you. 3 CHAIRMAN WELLS: She's shaking her 4 head yes. 5 MR. SALAY: I have a related 6 question. 7 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure, John. 8 MR. SALAY: In, maybe this should 9 have gone to the president of the association, 10 but so with the overlap in the duties of 11 scheduled practice with other professions, when 12 you go through the licensing process in different 13 states, is there pushback from say, I'm a social 14 worker, LCSW's, or the AMA or it's a pretty well 15 recognized that you're in the greater part of 16 them? 17 DR. HOLLEN: I would say that, and 18 that's a great question, I would say that in 19 different states it does vary, in Idaho and some 20 of the other states that have recently gotten 21 licensure, even New Mexico, the, their medical 22 societies were definitely on board and they were 23 also part of crafting a structure that everyone 24 felt comfortable with. And you know, they 25 realize that they need more providers, and so.37 1 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, anyone 2 else? 3 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 4 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, thank 5 you Doctor. 6 DR. RACKETS: This is Martha 7 Rackets. 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Oh okay. I'm 9 sorry. 10 DR. RACKETS: I had a question 11 as well. 12 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure. 13 DR. RACKETS: So my question was 14 around the, specifically the treatment of trauma 15 inside of the scope of practice. I think what 16 was stated earlier is that the training, kind of 17 the standardized training that naturopathic 18 doctors engage in is what allows for them to 19 provide the services that you do in the scope of 20 practice with their license, so I'm curious about 21 what that educational training looks like for the 22 treatment, the psychological treatment of trauma, 23 or if there are certain modalities that all ND's 24 are trained in at points, and what that looks 25 like. 18In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 11 38 1 DR. HOLLEN: So that's a wonderful 2 question. Obviously, now we, because we work 3 with the persons as an individual and looking at 4 trauma there can be lots of different imprints 5 and I kind of alluded to that in my statement 6 about transgenerational trauma where, you know, 7 it could be alcoholism, or it could be poverty, 8 those kinds of things that show up for people. 9 So because we are trained in holism and 10 prevention we are aware that instead of a woman 11 having pelvic pain and they have seen seven 12 different specialists, you know, that may, or 13 eighteen multiple primary care doctors, or her 14 OB/GYN, and maybe even seen a pelvic floor 15 therapist or that kind of thing, sometimes they 16 will come to us and we're like, well what else do 17 we not know? We have a lot of time with 18 individuals, you have at least one or two hours 19 in most cases, and some of our colleagues won't 20 have that privy of that time, so we can kind of 21 really dig into things where people share things 22 with us that they might not have shared. So what 23 that means is, is that we recognize in our 24 training that it's not just on their physical 25 body that the manifestation happens, it may be40 1 physical presentation, so you do a more 2 comprehensive, like biopsychosocial, and then be 3 able to give a more informed referral for trauma 4 treatment as opposed to the ND doing the trauma 5 treatment themselves? 6 DR. HOLLEN: Correct. And some 7 people may have additional training, like they 8 might also have a secondary degree, like a 9 counselor, with my Master's in public health 10 right, you know, I can do a fair amount within 11 other pieces of public health, but yes you are 12 correct. We have some of the basics that allows 13 us to recognize that that's what's going on 14 versus I just don't know why you're not 15 responding. 16 DR. RACKETS: Okay, thank you, 17 that's helpful. 18 DR. HOLLEN: Yes, thank you 19 Martha. 20 MS. JACKSON: Who was that, 21 Martha? 22 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: That 23 was. Martha Rackets. 24 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Martha 25 Rackets. 39 1 something emotional that needs to be worked with. 2 And so we might use botanical medicine if they're 3 having issues with sleep or pain, we might use 4 homeopathy, we might do some things to counsel, 5 but usually for the time that we have, you know, 6 we have to, we have to refer out, we have people 7 who are trained in EMDR, we have tea, those kinds 8 of things. Getting down with someone that they, 9 that can give them more specialized care, but we 10 don't ignore that and just say oh I don't know 11 why you're not responding, and not dig a little 12 bit deeper. And we're not seeking, actually 13 we're not seeking this as a reserve or a valley, 14 we just want you to know that we see a lot of 15 people because they have had lots of different 16 therapies, they show up and they do have trauma 17 and it has never been explored, and then in that 18 way we can give them additional support, whether 19 it's with a counselor or a psychiatrist, and, and 20 referring them appropriately to have a whole 21 system, whole. Does that help, Martha? 22 DR. RACKETS: Yes, it does. So 23 if I'm hearing you correctly its more than you 24 are able to give the time, the time and attention 25 to a client that perhaps has some confusing like41 1 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Dr. 2 Martha Rackets. 3 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, any other 4 questions for Dr. Hollen? 5 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 6 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, thank you, 7 Doctor. 8 DR. HOLLEN: Thank you. 9 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Dan Seitz? 10 DR. SEITZ: Hello, I'm here, I 11 hope that you can hear me. 12 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes sir. 13 DR. SEITZ: Great. Well thank you 14 very much for this opportunity to testify on 15 behalf of licensing naturopathic doctors in 16 Virginia. My name is Daniel Seitz, I have served 17 for sixteen years as the Executive Director for 18 the Counsel on Naturopathic Medical Education, 19 the U. S. Department of Education, and recognized 20 the accrediting agency for doctoral programs in 21 naturopathic medicine. Previously, I served as a 22 member and board chair of the Accreditation 23 Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, 24 the U. S. Department of Ed recognized accrediting 25 agency for acupuncture. I also have formerly 19In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 12 42 1 w orked for the Massachusetts Board of 2 Registration and Medicine, where I wrote the 3 regulations for licensing acupuncturists. So I'm 4 very familiar with what is needed to responsibly 5 license a healthcare field. My educational 6 background includes a law degree and a doctorate 7 in higher education. I would like to share a few 8 observations. The field of naturopathic medicine 9 has the structures in place where a state or 10 commonwealth be able to license naturopathic 11 doctors responsibly. The CNME, which establishes 12 the educational standards for the field and 13 inspects the accredited naturopathic doctoral 14 programs to make sure that they meet the 15 standards, is recognized by the U. S. Department 16 of Education, which means that we have undergone 17 a rigorous review by the Department to make sure 18 that we meet its stringent regulations for 19 accreditors. I just want to say that the CNME 20 standards include required biomedical and 21 clinical science subject matter, clinical 22 training requirements, as well as how to refer 23 out for conditions that are beyond the scope or 24 ability of naturopathic doctors. The other 25 structure that we have is the NPLEX exam,44 1 Commonwealth, which could both lead to lower fees 2 and greater accessibility of their services. 3 This is because ND's are often hesitant to 4 establish practices in unlicensed jurisdictions. 5 Finally, it is difficult for the public to 6 distinguish who is a legitimate naturopathic 7 doctor and who isn't, in the absence of 8 licensure. There is still diploma mill programs 9 out there, some of which are entirely online, and 10 accreditation mills that purport to accredit 11 them. These substandard programs pose another 12 risk to the public in the absence of licensure. 13 I find that I often that I would receive phone 14 calls from confused consumers, asking questions 15 about credentials. On a personal note, I would 16 like to say that I have been thirty years 17 involved with natural medicine education, 18 regulation, and accreditation because I feel that 19 it is an important and perfect complement to what 20 conventional medicine as to offer to the public. 21 Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. Any 23 questions for Dr. Seitz? 24 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 25 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Seitz. Ms. 43 1 referred to previously, that the national 2 licensing exam for naturopathic doctors. It is 3 well established and has a successful track 4 record of use in licensed jurisdictions in the 5 U.S. and Canada. All of the ND programs in the 6 U.S. are housed within colleges and universities 7 that have institutional accreditation by a 8 recognized accreditor, which means there is in 9 place an important additional oversight mechanism 10 to insure quality education. In Canada, ND 11 programs are in institutions approved by their 12 respective provincial departments of education. 13 Finally, doctoral degrees are all state approved. 14 While there is less, there is somewhat less risk 15 that naturopathic medical therapies may cause 16 harm to patients due to the generally less 17 invasive nature of natural interventions, 18 nonetheless any therapies can cause harm, harm to 19 patients if misused by practitioners with 20 inadequate training. Harm is also possible when 21 naturopathic medicine is practiced by 22 inadequately trained individuals who fail to 23 deliver the benefits of effective therapy. 24 Licensing ND's will likely lead to an increase in 25 the number of naturopathic practitioners in the45 1 Carter? 2 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: I'm 3 good, I'm good. 4 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Thank you, 5 sir. 6 DR. SEITZ: You're welcome. Thank 7 you. 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Next we will hear 9 from Dr. Marie Rodriguez. 10 DR. RODRIGUEZ: Can you hear me 11 now? 12 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Yes. 13 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes ma'am. 14 DR. RODRIGUEZ: My name is Dr. 15 Marie Rodriguez, I'm the Vice President of the 16 VAANP, and I'm a native of Fairfax, Virginia. 17 Thank you to the Board for your volume of work 18 report and for the opportunity to speak about my 19 profession today. I completed a Bachelor degree 20 and graduated from the University of Virginia in 21 1995, and my doctorate in naturopathic medicine 22 from Bastyr University in 2002. I have been in 23 solo private practice in the District of Columbia 24 since 2004. For the past sixteen years I have 25 practiced NDC while residing in Arlington, 20In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 13 46 1 Virgi nia. I choose to do business in D.C. as a 2 nonresident because of the benefit the practice 3 makes in a licensed jurisdiction. In D.C. I can 4 order labs and I can perform routine physical 5 exams. I also have a scope that includes some 6 prescribing rights. With licensing, I have been 7 able to practice the important scope of my 8 domain. We are therefore able to offer more to 9 my patients. I don't have to tell my patients go 10 get this lab done elsewhere, or to go see this 11 doctor for a basic prescription for diagnostic 12 imaging. It saves times, it lowers costs, and it 13 enables me to do my job thoroughly and therefore 14 it improves patient outcomes. I am one of close 15 to ten ND's that live in Virginia, yet commute to 16 a practice. This is taking away from the local 17 economy in Virginia, and it will only continue to 18 do so as naturopathic medicine continues to grow. 19 The legislative got behind our license to operate 20 in 2020 interlaced organically with the criteria 21 set forth by the Board. To expand that class of 22 naturopathic medicine reliant people medically 23 trained as doctors who commonly diagnose and 24 treat under a defined scope of practice. To 25 protect public safety and promote transparency, I48 1 naturopath. I wanted to also add a quick 2 response about the areas of focus withstood by 3 the Board on Page 11. This is expanded upon 4 further in our comments. ND's are trained in a 5 variety of healthcare services, however, given 6 the current restrictions in Virginia, and the 7 lack of a defined scope of practice, those 8 services outside of current parameters are only 9 handled with referrals to and discussed in 10 collaboration with other licensed healthcare 11 partners. Thank you so much for your time. I 12 ask the Board to recognize and license 13 naturopathic doctors in Virginia. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. 15 Anyone have any questions for Dr. Rodriguez? 16 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Yes, Mr. Chari. 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes ma'am. 18 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: This is Louise 19 Hershkowitz. Dr. Rodriguez, you were one of 20 those that I was suggested to ask about this, so 21 I will. One of the questions I have more broadly 22 is among, and I suspect you have looked at other 23 states and what they permit, is there a model 24 that you think would be most appropriate in 25 Virginia? 47 1 differentiate in regulations between a medically 2 trained naturopathic doctor and traditional or 3 lay naturopath. And to protect the public from 4 risk by, recourse is available if we would harm 5 for any practical matter. To recognize that why 6 the training of ND's are reserving the 7 naturopathic doctor title for those who have 8 earned doctoral degrees for naturopathic 9 medicine, medical programs accredited by bodies 10 recognized by the U. S. Department of Education. 11 I would like to take the opportunity to state 12 that licensing naturopathic doctors will not 13 prohibit traditional or lay naturopaths. They 14 will be able to do their work and consult them 15 about natural therapies. The VAANP recognizes 16 that many of the modalities used by medically 17 trained naturopathic doctors are also used widely 18 and by medically traditional healers. These 19 modalities are not exclusive to medically trained 20 naturopathic doctors. We are mindful and 21 respectful of the importance of place in 22 accessing traditional healing for community 23 health, while at the same time we acknowledge 24 that ND's have a scope of training and education 25 that sets us apart from the traditional49 1 DR. RODRIGUEZ: I believe that the 2 outline of that in SC-858, and we can bring that 3 to your attention through our written comments. 4 In Virginia, to my knowledge, we are, we are 5 asking for a scope that is more limited that 6 actually what we or Maryland have, where we will 7 not be primary care providers and all that, my 8 colleagues can get into that in more detail and 9 like I said, all of your, all of that we are 10 asking for is detailed in the legislation 11 involved in the last session. 12 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: And you talked 13 about your ability to prescribe in D.C. being 14 limited, what kind of limitations are there and 15 what again do you anticipate in Virginia? 16 DR. RODRIGUEZ: So I understand 17 that we won't, to my knowledge, we won't have 18 prescribing rights. In D.C., I mean when you 19 prescribe thyroid hormone, thyroid replacement 20 and bioidentical hormones. 21 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: So you use other 22 naturopathic items that you are able to 23 prescribe, or are they basically all over the 24 counter? 25 DR. RODRIGUEZ: Primary all over 21In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 14 50 1 the counter, though the medicines that I, the 2 botanical medicine coming out I would prefer to 3 refer my patients to sources that I trust and 4 that their quality has been tested, many of which 5 are found at a CVS or a local grocery store. 6 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Thank you. 7 DR. RODRIGUEZ: You're welcome. 8 MR. SALAY: I want to follow up on 9 that. Why are you all taking the less, the more 10 restrictive path in Virginia? 11 DR. RODRIGUEZ: The more 12 restrictive the path in terms of licensing, 13 right? 14 MR. SALAY: The scope of practice. 15 DR. RODRIGUEZ: We work alongside 16 with other, other parties, and, and determine the 17 best path forward for us at this time. And we 18 can elaborate in more detail if that's needed. 19 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: This is Louise 20 Hershkowitz, I would like you to elaborate, 21 please. 22 DR. RODRIGUEZ: So, as you know we 23 have been working on this effort since 2005 and I 24 am a longstanding, or a member of the Virginia 25 Association of Naturopathic Physicians, and in52 1 well. Obviously if something comes in with 2 cellulitis, they're going out to the ER or to an 3 emergent care facility. I don't know if that 4 helps or if that was a little bit more confusing. 5 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Thank you. 6 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. 7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: This 8 is Elizabeth Carter, just asking, you know, so 9 many of the states do have a very specific 10 formulary, whether its prescription drugs or 11 whether it is botanicals. Do you all recommend a 12 specific formulary or are you asking for it to be 13 just broader? 14 DR. RODRIGUEZ: I'm sorry, I'm 15 not... 16 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: I'm 17 sorry, let me get the. As you know, many states 18 actually have a listed formulary and that 19 includes not just prescription drugs, or legend 20 drugs, but also the botanicals, and other things. 21 Would you, are you recommending consideration of 22 a formulary or are you, does this group just want 23 to leave it more broadly? 24 DR. RODRIGUEZ: We're not 25 recommending, at this time we're not recommending 51 1 speaking with other parties or different 2 organizations, whether it be the Medical Society 3 of Virginia, chiropractors, counselors, 4 nutrition, lay naturopath, we have determined 5 that our, we negotiated this, this path, and 6 that's how we determined for that word being that 7 if we were asking for a doctor's scope it 8 wouldn't be efficacious to getting licensed at 9 the time. Right now we can do a lot, we would be 10 able to do a lot more with being able to order 11 routine bloodwork, be, or were able to order 12 diagnostic imaging, to be able to legally touch 13 our patients. There's so much that we can do 14 within the breadth of a naturopathic, our, our 15 range of prescribing within what we already have 16 that's not restricted through prescription is 17 very vast, and there's a lot we can do without 18 the use of pharmaceutical drugs. I rarely need 19 to use those in my practice, or if it's needed, 20 then I would usually refer somebody out. I have 21 actually found over the eighteen years of my 22 practice of botanical medicine is, is really 23 powerful and when we take a first, you know, 24 pharm, why could somebody want an antibiotic 25 when a botanical prescription works for them as53 1 a formulary. 2 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 3 you. 4 DR. RODRIGUEZ: Thank you. 5 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, any further 6 questions? 7 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Thank you, 9 Doctor. 10 DR. RODRIGUEZ: Thank you. 11 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, next we 12 will hear from Dr. Carrie Runde, Runde? 13 DR. RUNDE: Hi, good morning, can 14 you hear me? 15 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes. 16 DR. RUNDE: Hi, thank you. My 17 name is Carrie Runde and I'm a naturopathic 18 doctor practicing in Baltimore. I hold licenses 19 to practice naturopathic medicine in Maryland as 20 well as in Washington, D.C. I have worked in a 21 variety of outpatient settings including very 22 large and great medical practices with many 23 providers, other specialists, counselors, and 24 psychologists, nutritionists, chiropractors. 25 Currently I work in smaller practice with another 22In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 15 54 1 nat uropathic doctor and a psychologist. 2 I have served on the Board of the 3 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians 4 as well as being a past vice president of the 5 Maryland Naturopathic Doctor's Association. I 6 wanted to offer the experience we have here in 7 Maryland. I've been highly involved in this 8 since it started about ten years ago. 9 I was a participant, I was in 10 licensure as well as the summer study process, 11 licensure process as well as to writing our 12 regulations and now as their, in advisory and 13 regulatory roles. Licensure is working very 14 well. It has benefitted the public so there's 15 clarity around training and our role. When they 16 come to see us they know our face, actually. 17 It's also educational for 18 healthcare because it provides a very clear and 19 legitimate cleanup where other healthcare 20 providers confidently refer for naturopathic 21 healing, and in my practice this has really, we 22 passed our licensure in 2014 and started issuing 23 those in 2016. The most important reason is 24 public safety. Without license, there were these 25 vast differences in the clinical training, more56 1 course with a full year in an accredited medical 2 school, but without regulation the public has, 3 doesn't see anything different. So here in 4 Maryland it's turning to be a public safety 5 issue. Not regulated, it allows us, it allows 6 people that use naturopathic titles and lay 7 naturopaths have a very standardized training in 8 school. It also gives us this frank, to regulate 9 the profession, whereby we have disciplinary 10 action, this benefits the public and it benefits 11 the healthcare system. Again, there's confusion 12 about what we do and how we fit in. 13 I also want to verify one thing 14 that came up that in Maryland a naturopathic 15 doctor to work to work independently in practice, 16 work autonomously as do the other licensed 17 jurisdictions. Trying to operate within the 18 existing healthcare, I have to refer when I need, 19 as I mentioned, in Maryland we have this very 20 unique collaboration agreement with the 21 conventional medical division, and what this is, 22 is an ND on his license has to list an MD who is 23 willing to serve as a clinical resource, not 24 supervision. It's simply an MDPO and he or she 25 has physical contact information for aggregated 55 1 people advertise themselves using alphabetic 2 titles in there. 3 This was a significant issue on 4 cases for me to no to try, but it's still a big 5 issue for patients who moved to or from another 6 state that the patient does not have a doctor. 7 We have, our doctors have this very unique 8 skillset and it is in demand, framed a bridge 9 between the world of conventional medicine and 10 the natural world of naturopathic and holistic 11 medicine, and the efforts to appropriately 12 utilize lifestyle and natural medicines to treat 13 health conditions within the nexus of one's 14 overall health, including understanding their 15 piece in that. And these skills are very 16 necessary when they have clients who do this. 17 Patients are searching online for providers in 18 their area trained in holistic medicine. 19 They want to treat things like 20 allergies and hypertension, and without 21 regulation they just end up seeing a provider who 22 could have different providers who could have the 23 same public-facing name or have an ND, which have 24 this vastly different level of training, right. 25 There was an online sixteen hour naturopath57 1 consultation. 2 The MD or DO's referenced there 3 were at least indirectly in the care of the 4 patient and there are no requirements around 5 often an ND with their collaborating MDPO and if 6 they have to. And so the requirement, I want to 7 say that those who are seeking naturopathic 8 medical care, we see that they travel to our 9 practice, even Baltimore, because they know I 10 have a license and what role I can play in their 11 healthcare. However, I believe that the patients 12 are staying locally in Virginia where there is 13 now over forty trained naturopathic doctors. So 14 thank you for your time and I would be happy to 15 answer questions. 16 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, 17 Doctor. Dr. Carter? 18 MR. SALAY: I want to know... 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Go ahead. 20 MR. SALAY: ... that presentation, 21 thank you for the, do you indicate that the ND 22 have a bigger role in the consulting realm? 23 DR. RUNDE: Regarding the 24 collaboration agreement? I do not, I think that 25 the collaboration agreement here was created with 23In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 16 58 1 thi s idea that a naturopathic doctor, or this, I 2 think kind of admits that's been a confusion that 3 naturopathic doctors would exist almost like an 4 island, or that we wouldn't refer, we wouldn't 5 have a reason to collaborate when, you know, as 6 someone who has been licensed in the State of 7 Maryland would have, I haven't consulted with my 8 collaborating physician once, not because 9 clinical patients don't arise, so because I'm 10 directing them to a specialist or a provider, or 11 urgent care, or the ER, so I think it's a little 12 bit administrative. We don't recommend 13 collaborations because I don't think they are 14 actually serving very good. Did I answer your 15 question? 16 MR. SALAY: Yes. Yes, thank you 17 very much. 18 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Carter? 19 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Yes, 20 this is Liz Carter again. In terms of 21 accountability, I think with the collaborative 22 practice typically there's malpractice insurance 23 that's covered by one party versus another, 24 that's just in other professions, but so do ND's 25 in Maryland have malpractice coverage for60 1 students. 2 The Medical Society has clear 3 policy imposing licensure for naturopaths and 4 naturopathic doctors. During the legislative 5 session we raised great communications safety 6 concerns to the legislators as well as the 7 Department of Health Professions, and those most 8 certainly remain. 9 Looking at the DHP report for us, 10 there were two areas we believe naturopaths are 11 in the criteria for licensure. First, by rule, 12 licensure in the Commonwealth of Virginia 13 requires highly specialized post-secondary 14 education and clinical efficiency, and clinical 15 efficiently certified by an accredited body. 16 Stated in the 2020 report, the Department of 17 Education does accredit the natural, the National 18 Naturopathic Medical Association but recognition 19 as an accrediting agency by DOE does not 20 constitute endorsement of the educational 21 institution or program. 22 The medical community maintains 23 that the lack of accountability and transparency 24 in the training of naturopaths and naturopathic 25 doctors has a high potential for risk for patient 59 1 themselves? 2 DR. RUNDE: Yes, I can remember, 3 there's insurance. 4 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Okay, 5 thank you. 6 DR. RUNDE: Um hmm (indicating 7 affirmatively.) 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, any further 9 questions? 10 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 11 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Thank you, 12 Doctor. 13 DR. RUNDE: Thank you. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Our next speaker, 15 Dana Kleinschuster? I hope I got that right. 16 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: I 17 don't see Dr. Kleinschuster on the list. 18 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. All right, 19 we will move forward to Clark Barrineau. 20 MR. BARRINEAU: Close enough. 21 Good afternoon, everyone, this is Clark Barrineau 22 of the Medical Society of Virginia. Thank you 23 for having us today. As you well know, the 24 Medical Society represents Virginia's physicians, 25 physician assistants, residents, and medical61 1 safety by the nature of the practice itself. 2 Naturopathic examinations and courses are not 3 externally audited by professional organizations 4 other than other naturopathic associations. 5 Numerous other health professions have rigorous 6 due processes to insure their curriculum and 7 testing meets the standards to insure providers 8 are adequately trained to deliver safe and 9 quality care. 10 To that end, as stated in the DHP 11 report from 2005, ND's have an insufficient 12 amount of hours providing hands-on care for 13 patients under teaching supervision. Nothing in 14 DHP's 2020 report contradicts or refutes that 15 fact. The second issue of concern for the 16 criteria set forth by DHP is the issue of skill. 17 As the report clearly states, the scope of any 18 practice is quite variable between twenty-three 19 licensing jurisdictions and much of the scope of 20 practice of naturopathic doctors overlap with 21 other established practicing practitioners. 22 Naturopathic doctors do not have a distinctive 23 scope being compared from the other professions 24 enforceable in legal terms. 25 As listed in the study, 24In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 17 62 1 counselors, psy chologists, dieticians, 2 nutritionists, physical therapists, 3 acupuncturists and chiropractors are all already 4 living and working in the Commonwealth, 5 regulating license of ND's is the equivalent of 6 these professions. As there are already existing 7 legal protections for patients who are in 8 treatment by doctors the MSV maintains the 9 licensure communicates an inaccurate picture of 10 legitimacy in the patient community and does not 11 increase accountability to protect public health 12 and safety. The Medical Society is fully opposed 13 to the licensure of naturopathic doctors and the 14 physician community looks forward to commenting 15 further as the process moves along. Thanks. 16 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. Any 17 questions? 18 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Yes. Mr. 19 Barrineau, you talked about outside, the due 20 processes for curriculum and testing, what kinds 21 of sources are you talking about? 22 MR. BARRINEAU: We are just 23 looking at the one we know well, which is 24 physician education, physician testing, it is 25 vetted by a great many third party sources,64 1 of the case just as easily, that the practice is 2 potentially harmful and if it's not licensed then 3 we have no oversight of it? 4 MR. BARRINEAU: To your point, you 5 know, we brought the issues of education and its 6 scope per the way the report was written. The 7 report says in order to obtain licensure you need 8 a highly specialized and accredited education, 9 and you know, it defines scope. We, we're, we 10 will give away the ghost on the first 11 requirement, patient harm, however, we believe 12 that if we are saying the education is deficient 13 to treat patients, the question that I think is 14 not necessarily explored in the 2020 report, and 15 one that we would take umbrage with. Certainly I 16 think the existence of patient harm does exist, 17 but as I mentioned towards the tail end of my 18 testimony, there are already patient protections 19 from, from receiving inadequate care through the 20 legal process. 21 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, any 22 further questions? 23 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 24 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Thank you, 25 sir. The next speaker is John Hanks. 63 1 including the government and national 2 associations representing not just physicians but 3 insurance and hospitals, who traditionally, the 4 government, and the education is vetted about as 5 much as any level of education and craft besides 6 a lawyer, and so when we look and say there is 7 accreditation for these, we need to know really 8 what that is other than what it appears to be, 9 which in my mind is just a simple blessing of the 10 program itself and not a blessing of curriculum, 11 and training, and patient safety. 12 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: And are you 13 aware of, since you are clearly opposed to this, 14 are you aware of situations in which there have 15 been demonstrated problems with safety in the 16 public? 17 MR. BARRINEAU: We are aware of 18 other licensed naturopathic doctors who have 19 administered treatments in other states that were 20 not scientifically proven to be correct, you all 21 made some mention of that in the 2020 report and 22 we can certainly pull those together, I don't 23 think will help the Board at all. 24 MR. SALAY: I have a question too. 25 Wouldn't your arguments hold for the other side65 1 MR. HANKS: Can you hear me? 2 CHAIRMAN WELLS: We can, sir. 3 MR. HANKS: Okay, thank you. 4 Well, my name is John Hanks, I am with Virginians 5 for Health Freedom and I have a comment regarding 6 the licensure of naturopathic doctors regarding 7 two of the seven criteria. 8 The first criteria, one, the risk 9 for harm to the consumer. The current natural 10 health activity in Virginia not licensed as we 11 feel it should be. Practitioners are limited to 12 suggesting herbs, vitamins and natural remedies 13 to consumers and this does not pose a risk of 14 harm to the public. 15 These traditional practitioners 16 cannot diagnose illness or disease, prescribe any 17 drug or medical treatment, or otherwise practice 18 medicine. All of their interactions with 19 consumers are voluntary. The consumer chooses 20 whether or not to seek advice on natural products 21 or remedies, and whether or not to purchase any 22 natural product, natural health product. 23 Products and remedies that are available through 24 natural health practitioners are legal and 25 readily available for purchase over the counter 25In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 18 66 1 f rom any retail businesses, including Walmart, 2 CVS, Costco, via the internet, et cetera. 3 Manufacturers of these products 4 are required by the FDA to insure they are safe 5 before they become available to the public. The 6 unregulated practice of traditional medicine or 7 natural health does not harm or endanger the 8 public health, safety, or welfare. There is no 9 harm, they are simply out there for natural 10 products and remedies. 11 On Criterion 5, economic impact, 12 in Virginia today all natural health 13 practitioners do essentially the same thing, they 14 can suggest and/or sell natural health products 15 and remedies without the need of a license. A 16 license is recommended and became law in 17 Virginia, the small group desiring licensure 18 could result in a restriction of the supply of 19 practitioners for the consumers and the general 20 public. For example, Trinity School of National, 21 Natural Health, just graduated one hundred and 22 fifty-one traditional naturopathic doctors in 23 Virginia alone, more than three times the number 24 requesting licensure. 25 In addition, they have a program68 1 hearing you say that you want to assure that 2 traditional natural health providers continue to 3 be able to do what they do and not be restricted 4 in the legislation? Is that the position you are 5 advocating? 6 MR. HANKS: I'm sorry, I only got 7 the last bit of that. 8 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Okay, I will 9 repeat my question, it's a little long. 10 MR. HANKS: Okay. 11 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: I'm hearing you, 12 can you hear me now? 13 MR. HANKS: Yes. 14 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: I'm hearing you 15 advocate that the traditional naturopathic health 16 providers in Virginia not be restricted if there 17 is any legislation regarding naturopathic 18 doctors, is that correct? 19 MR. HANKS: Yes, yes. 20 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Are you also 21 opposing the licensure of naturopathic doctors, 22 and if so, why? 23 MR. HANKS: We oppose it if it 24 does not have protection for the, public. With 25 protection, we do not oppose it. 67 1 that produces certified natural health 2 professionals and have graduated four hundred and 3 fifty-eight of those in Virginia also. And there 4 are also a number of health coaches from various 5 schools in Virginia. All of these traditional 6 naturopathic doctors are natural health 7 professionals and health coaches exclusive for 8 natural health. They have no need or desire to 9 branch into the medical practices. Their 10 training is also extensive. 11 If you choose to recommend 12 licensure, we request that you mandate protection 13 for the unlicensed practitioner in the state 14 today. We have negotiated language in SB-858 15 that helps protect the unlicensed practitioner 16 and their livelihood. Thank you. 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, sir. 18 Are there any questions? 19 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Mr. Chair, I do 20 have a question. 21 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes ma'am. 22 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: This is Louise 23 Hershkowitz. 24 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure. 25 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Mr. Hanks, I'm69 1 MS. HERSHKOWITZ: Thank you. 2 MR. HANKS: You're welcome. 3 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Are there any 4 other questions? 5 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 6 CHAIRMAN WELLS: I do have Leah 7 Hollen, Dr. Leah Hollen, who would like to 8 respond, and I'm going to allow that so that we 9 don't hold her to the very end. Go ahead, 10 Doctor. 11 DR. HOLLEN: Sorry for that, it 12 might have been from earlier, I was just going to 13 let you know that one of our people that was 14 testifying had to pop off when you called them, 15 but I guess that was from a while ago that a hand 16 was raised, but I will say we have worked with 17 and, and Mr. Hanks presents one of the state 18 groups and we did craft language to NSB-858 to 19 make sure that we did accommodate or not 20 restricting lay providers, we just wanted to be 21 mindful of that. Thank you. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, thank you. 23 DR. KACHKO: And Dr. Hollen, if 24 that was me, this is Dr. Kachko, if that were me 25 you're referring to, I'm back, I'm just popping 26In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 19 70 1 in and out with patients, I'm sorry. 2 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Would you 3 identify yourself, the person who just spoke? 4 I'm sorry, would you identify yourself, the 5 person who just last spoke saying you were back? 6 DR. KACHKO: Sure. Dr. Robert 7 Kachko, American Association of Athletic 8 Physicians, I'm popping in and out with patients, 9 so I don't know if there was a question earlier 10 that Dr. Hollen had alluded to, but I'm happy to 11 answer that now if there was. 12 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: I 13 think we're just doing it for the record to make 14 sure who was available. 15 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Yes. Yes sir. 16 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 17 you. 18 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, John, is 19 that? 20 MR. SALAY: Is it okay if I ask 21 Dr. Kachko a question? 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Sure. 23 MR. SALAY: Okay. What do, I 24 don't know if you heard when you were out with 25 patients that the Medical Society is concerned72 1 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, Dr. 2 Decker Weiss? 3 DR. WEISS: Hello everybody, I 4 appreciate everybody taking time to look over the 5 professions and really get an opportunity for the 6 people of Virginia to experience naturopathic 7 care, the level of which these doctors are 8 accredited for. My background real quick is, I 9 graduated from Southwest College, one of the 10 accredited schools, in 1997. I went on to do a 11 conventional internship and residency and 12 fellowship. My fellowship was in cardiology and 13 noninvasive cardiology, although I, a lot of 14 practicing cath labs, when you are a resident or 15 a fellow you do whatever is needed. And so I did 16 a residency, fellowship in cardiology and I 17 stayed on staff with the Arizona Heart Hospital 18 for ten years as a cardiologist. I had a very 19 big practice, cardiovascular based for twelve 20 years in Scottsdale, I sold it and I launched a 21 nonprofit called Peace Possible, which has now 22 worked into something called Global Medical, 23 where we have researched radicalization cycles of 24 violence, cycles of poverty, and administer care 25 of refugees, recovered sex workers and so on, so 71 1 about there not being an oversight body 2 independent of your profession that looks over 3 the graduate programs, or the education programs? 4 DR. KACHKO: Sure. So that might 5 be a question, if Dr. Seitz is still on, he might 6 be able to better address that from the CNME 7 perspective. What I can say is that, you know, 8 in many states the medical society sometimes, you 9 know, poses the question on whether there should 10 be licensure, but we work in a very collaborative 11 settings, we work with ND's and DO's all the time 12 and so there, there should not be any concern 13 over infringing on scope or anything like that, I 14 have mentioned earlier, we refer regularly to 15 providers. As far as education, I would defer to 16 Dr. Seitz if he is available. 17 DR. ROBERT SEITZ: I am available 18 if the Committee would like me to participate. 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Can you remain on 20 the line Dr. Seitz? I would like to get through 21 everyone's initial comments first and then we 22 will circle back, if that's okay, and Mr. Salay 23 if that's okay, we will... 24 DR. KACHKO: All right, sure. 25 MR. SALAY: Sure.73 1 I am often now in places like Erbil, Iraq and 2 the, the, to Thailand and other places like that. 3 My legislative experience is 4 minimal, but I think that maybe I would draw some 5 interest for this committee. We had, we had a 6 long, expensive while in nineteen, since 1985 7 that's worked really, really well in the State of 8 Arizona. In the mid-nineties, in the early two 9 thousands it came under challenge. The 10 Legislature was faced with the challenge and it 11 basically said, it's okay but they shouldn't 12 prescribe. And so the Legislature kicked it off 13 to the Boards, and the Boards basically said we, 14 it's just more of an infighting, no but it might 15 be, you know, more of a turf war. You know, as 16 you know you have to maintain your independence, 17 and you have to look at everything thoroughly. 18 So I was appointed to a committee 19 body or legislature, along with the head of 20 Palmer College, it's the University of Arizona 21 medical doctors, to look at whether we should be 22 prescribing. And one of the interesting things 23 that came out of it, we never had any complaints 24 in all of that time. And another thing that came 25 out was, you know, naturopaths that didn't want 27In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 20 74 1 to use pharmaceuticals didn't, and the ones that 2 did, did it quite well and quite safely, and that 3 is with over fifteen years of experience, so it's 4 not that small of a size. So we don't keep up 5 with Chris Lucci because everybody hated him. 6 Nobody liked this, my colleague stated that we're 7 going to have to remove the, but basically it was 8 is we reviewed all of, all of them, and those 9 that wanted to prescribe but had to meet some 10 educational or government acid test, and if they 11 did that then they got to prescribe. And they 12 found about thirty percent of naturopaths had no 13 use in prescribing, but wanted to do the 14 diagnostics, the physical exam skills, all of 15 those things. They proved their expertise to the 16 Legislature and passed that. 17 Recently, I've been also in two 18 sessions, one is going to do about this for 19 COVID-19 relief, I have not only been 20 instrumental trying to set up Arizona policy for 21 COVID-19, and reviewed the natural protocol, 22 which is an agreed protocol including ascorbic 23 acid IV's, melatonin, Vitamin D used in emergency 24 rooms and in ICU's, but I was called into review 25 that to see if that was safe, and effective, more76 1 equally by medical doctors as naturopathic 2 doctors. 3 Medical doctors gave me more 4 opportunity to become a cardiologist, that wasn't 5 something that was available for a naturopathic 6 physician. I'm indebted to everybody and 7 thankful to everybody in the medical profession, 8 and I just hope that we see fit for the good 9 people of Virginia to get naturopathic care. And 10 I will take time for any questions and any 11 available if anybody wants. 12 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you, 13 Doctor. Any questions for Dr. Weiss? 14 MR. HANKS: Can I clarify a 15 question that came up earlier or a confusion? 16 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Who is 17 this? 18 MR. HANKS: We... 19 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: I'm 20 sorry, identify yourself. I'm sorry, we're 21 recording this, please identify who you are. 22 MR. HANKS: This is John Hanks. 23 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 24 you, sir. 25 MR. HANKS: I was just speaking, 75 1 importantly, and effective, and agreed use of 2 dollars, and those things. And also recently I 3 have been called to Health & Human Services to 4 testify on some of the research I have performed 5 in human trafficking and you know, chronic 6 inflammatory states, I've been in that as long, 7 and to answer, we were resistant. So my input 8 for this Committee is who really, it's very hard 9 when you have all these organizations in front of 10 you to really sort it out. 11 Really, to figure out what it was 12 to be a naturopathic medical student in the day 13 in their life while they are in school, it's a 14 long training process, it's for school for, 15 working with a fifth intern year, running through 16 the summers and then after, and a good chunk of 17 all are all residents at this. And so the, the 18 training aspect I think would be something that 19 might be worth looking at. 20 The last thing that I have to say, 21 if I can be of any use to this Committee, to Dr. 22 Carter, Nurse Hershkowitz, in helping craft, you 23 know, where did Arizona go with this, why did 24 they have this, how did they go through this on 25 this exposed, I'm available. And I was trained77 1 I'm sorry. 2 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: That's 3 all right. 4 MR. HANKS: Leah mentioned that 5 we've worked together and we have, and we're very 6 thankful for her efforts for protecting the 7 unlicensed folks and SB-858, because one of the 8 concerns we have is there a companion bill in the 9 House, HB-1040 that has no protective language in 10 it. And this would be incredibly harmful for the 11 thousands of unlicensed workers. So if that 12 clarifies it. I do appreciate what Leah Hollen 13 and her group have done in SB-858 but we were not 14 as successful on the other side. Thank you. 15 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Dr. 16 Barbara Boardman? 17 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: For 18 Dr. Weiss, then they can go back in. 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, I'm sorry. 20 Dr. Board Members, I keep saying that. 21 DR. BOARDMAN: Hello? Hi. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Hi. 23 DR. BOARDMAN: This is Dr. 24 Boardman. Can you hear me? 25 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Stop. 28In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 21 78 1 CHAIRMA N WELLS: Hold on just one 2 second, Dr. Boardman. 3 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: One 4 second. 5 CHAIRMAN WELLS: I'm dropping the 6 ball here. 7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: No, 8 you... 9 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Are there any 10 Committee questions for Dr. Weiss before we move 11 on to the next speaker? 12 DR. WEISS: I answered all the 13 questions. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. 15 DR. WEISS: Thank everybody so 16 much for taking the time to really give our 17 profession this shot, I thank you from the bottom 18 of my heart. 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, thank you. 20 Okay, Dr. Boardman, I'm sorry. 21 DR. BOARDMAN: That's fine. 22 CHAIRMAN WELLS: You're on deck. 23 DR. BOARDMAN: Okay, hi, I'm Dr. 24 Barbara Boardman, I'm with the Virginia Chapter 25 of the Academy of Pediatrics, I'm on their Board,80 1 visits the children currently receive with their 2 pediatrician, that these are critical and insure 3 that families receive important preventative 4 care, including vaccinations, developmental 5 milestones training, screening for mental health 6 issues, nutrition, sleep, behavior, and physical 7 issues. We are concerned that children would 8 instead be taken by their parents to naturopathic 9 providers who are not trained to provide this 10 care and potentially serious medical issues could 11 be overlooked. We respectfully ask that as you 12 conduct this study you consider how treatment of 13 patients under age eighteen would be included 14 with any recommendations. If you have any 15 questions, I'm willing to answer them. 16 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Anyone with any 17 questions? 18 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Dr. Boardman, I 20 do have one. I understand your regard for 21 pediatrics specialization. Do family 22 practitioners, nurse practitioners, and physician 23 assistants receive that same, or do you have 24 concerns about those folks treating under 25 eighteen? 79 1 and we wanted to come in and say first of all we 2 agree with the comments provided by the Medical 3 Society of Virginia and join them in opposing 4 licensure for naturopathic providers. The 5 Virginia AEP has serious concerns about patient 6 safety, specifically for patients under age 7 eighteen. Treating children is much different 8 than treating adults. As pediatricians, we are 9 required to do our residency in pediatrics for at 10 least three years after our four years of medical 11 training. Pediatric specialists undergo 12 additional one to two, three years of training 13 beyond this. With that said, we believe that 14 training naturopathic providers, that the 15 training naturopathic providers receive is 16 considerably less rigorous than the training for 17 pediatricians in allopathic and osteopathic 18 medicine. There is no standardized admission 19 testing or postgraduate residency training in the 20 field of children other than that that is 21 optional. Our concern is that if the 22 Commonwealth chooses to license this profession, 23 parents will falsely believe that this type of 24 care is sufficient for their child. We view it 25 as very important to have annual visits, well81 1 DR. BOARDMAN: We have worked on 2 those issues separately. I actually do training 3 for PA's for Eastern Virginia Medical School, and 4 I think you need to be aware that the primary 5 concern is making sure that people get in for the 6 full pediatric well visit, and that they don't 7 get confused about where they can get one. The 8 family practice training is significantly closer 9 to our training than the, that this would be. 10 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, thank you. 11 All right, anyone else with any questions for Dr. 12 Boardman? 13 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, thank you, 15 Dr. Boardman. 16 DR. BOARDMAN: Okay. 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: All right, next 18 is Cassady Morris. 19 MS. MORRIS: (No audible 20 response.) 21 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: There 22 we go. 23 MS. MORRIS: Are you able to hear 24 me? 25 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Yes. 29In RE: Board of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 22 82 1 CHAIRMA N WELLS: Yes. 2 MS. MORRIS: Okay, I apologize, I 3 am not able to put my. Give me one moment. 4 Thank you. This is Cassady Morris, I'm a third 5 year student at the National University of 6 Natural Medicine, an accredited naturopath, 7 natural medical school. As a Virginia native, I 8 do request the Board recommend licensure for 9 medically trained naturopathic doctors. As a 10 naturopathic medical student, I studied, I 11 studied my undergraduate, and at the age of 12 thirteen began attending physical assistant 13 school. I do believe I can speak to the limits 14 of the four year graduate level curriculum ND's 15 undertake. Prior to coming to medical school, I 16 worked for a top doctor based out of Vienna, 17 Virginia with a concierge practice that focused 18 heavily on individualized medical treatments. 19 While working for this internal 20 medical doctor, I helped research and make 21 recommendations for specific health ailments 22 that, that were provided in detailed reports to 23 patients. With the different modalities that 24 ND's produce that align with evidence in case 25 status, I believe the healthcare system and care84 1 provide the specialized attention and care needed 2 with as little red tape as possible. Currently 3 there are eighty-two, of students at the various 4 naturopathic medical schools that have expressed 5 interest in practicing in the State of Virginia, 6 that I know not only myself requests the Board to 7 recommend licensure for medical training of ND's 8 and know that you will be hearing from other 9 medical students and graduates as well. Thank 10 you for your time and I hope you will be able to 11 recommend my friends and family to go see a 12 licensed naturopathic in the area soon. Thank 13 you so much. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. 15 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 16 you. We also had some first. 17 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Community 18 Members, do we have any questions for Ms. Morris? 19 ATTENDEES: (No audible response.) 20 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, Dr. Carter? 21 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Ms. 22 Morris, would you consider only working in the 23 integrative medical setting so you would be in a 24 team setting, or are you expecting to practice 25 solo? So that's, you know, there's a little, in 83 1 provided the patients would greatly increase for 2 treating underlying conditions and allow patients 3 to get individualized care if in the, if indeed 4 we are licensed and provided a regulated scope of 5 practice. In hopes of potentially moving back 6 home after graduation, it would be a dream to be 7 able to work as an equal healthcare partner in an 8 integrative medical office that would allow 9 multiple medical providers to serve the health 10 needs and desires to each patient. In addition, 11 with the years and hours spent on higher 12 education and the amount of debt that is 13 accumulating in medical school, I finally desired 14 to be able to use the title and credentials of 15 being a naturopathic doctor, act in my name, and 16 have them be as meaningful in Virginia as they 17 are in licensed states. 18 Naturopathic doctors study both an 19 intense curriculum and take two standardized 20 exams to be eligible for a licensure. Using the 21 title naturopathic doctor should relay to the 22 public that the individual has undergone this 23 rigorous training and education and patients 24 have, should have the confidence that the person 25 that they are choosing their care from is able to85 1 terms of the public protection that could be 2 something you need to consider. 3 DR. CASSADY MORRIS: Yeah, most 4 definitely. I would be happy to do a private 5 practice, I though have spent the majority of my 6 background in conventional medicine, but I have 7 great relationships with, in these DO's that the 8 way that I see conventional medicine being 9 necessary in the world, I just think ND's would 10 be a great collab with that, but I, I would like 11 to work in integrative practice, but if I wanted 12 to work individualized, I would also wish to do 13 so as well, you know, in the State. 14 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Thank 15 you. 16 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. All 17 right, Julie Coombs? 18 MS. COOMBS: Can you hear me okay? 19 Hi. Good morning, thank you. My name is Julie 20 Coombs and I'm here today representing the 21 American Naturopathic Medical Association, ANMA 22 represents the majority of naturopathic 23 practitioners in the United States. 24 Our membership includes 25 naturopaths, naturopathic doctors, traditional 30In RE: B oard of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 23 86 1 nat uropaths, as well as licensed MD's, DC's, 2 DVF's and RN's that include naturopathic 3 modalities in their practice. We agree with the 4 Virginia Medical Society. ANMA does not support 5 licensure for a few practitioners attempting to 6 monopolize the profession. 7 In study after study, naturopathy 8 when practiced correctly, that means by the 9 definition is bound not to be a threat to the 10 public, in fact, licensing these graduates from 11 Bastyr, National, Health West and Boucher 12 Institute in Canada. By the way, none of these 13 seen are recognized as real medical schools, even 14 though they would lead you to believe so, 15 allowing them to practice outside of the scope of 16 the definition of naturopathy and practice 17 medicine without going to medical school is 18 essentially giving them a license to kill. 19 They think if they put a natural 20 substance, such as turmeric, in an IV that that 21 makes it naturopathy, when in fact it does not, 22 and a patient was killed in California by a 23 licensed naturopathic doctor with a turmeric IV. 24 None of the therapies that they have made up by 25 mixing allopathic and naturopathic medicine are88 1 commonly called integrative medicine, by mixing 2 allopathy and naturopathy together, and you 3 should address them as such and avoid the 4 confusion and protect the public. Thank you. 5 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Thank you. All 6 right. Do any of the Committee Members have any 7 questions for Ms. Coombs? 8 MR. SALAY: So I take it you have 9 no members that are actually licensed in any 10 state? 11 MS. COOMBS: No, we don't seek 12 licensing in any states. Several states that 13 license these AANP naturopaths say that we don't 14 have to be licensed because we don't, we're not a 15 threat to the public, and they are allowed to 16 practice with the terms naturopath, traditional 17 naturopath, naturopathic practitioner. In Idaho 18 we're allowed to call ourselves naturopathic 19 doctors without a license required because we 20 don't present a threat to the public. 21 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Anyone else? 22 Okay. Would any Committee Member like to 23 redirect a question to any of the speakers? Mr. 24 Salay, did you want to ask Dr. Seitz regarding 25 the accreditation or the curriculum? 87 1 tested or approved by the FDA, or anyone, not 2 even by them. 3 They will present to you a list of 4 states that license them and they never talk 5 about the fact that there is no naturopathic 6 standard of practice or title between these 7 states and these states allow them to do nothing 8 more than practice naturopathy by the definition. 9 We come to you saying that you must protect the 10 public when really licensure is the problem. 11 Clients think they are going to someone who 12 practices real naturopathy and they get 13 experimental treatment from other countries or 14 concocted by the practitioner, or prescription 15 drugs. This is very confusing to the public. 16 We all know that there are plenty 17 of laws to protect the public, and just like 18 having DOE-approved E-2 credit says nothing about 19 the quality of the education you provide. A 20 state license does nothing about the quality of 21 the practitioner, and it takes a very special 22 person to practice real naturopathy, and the 23 citizens of Virginia deserve access and 24 knowledge. Furthermore the ANMA would suggest to 25 you that these practitioners practice what is89 1 MR. SALAY: Yes, he's still on? 2 DR. SEITZ: Yes, I'm still here. 3 And let me just say that there was an assertion, 4 I'm paraphrasing, that somehow there's no 5 oversight of the actual education of naturopathic 6 doctors, and I just want to offer some 7 observations about that. 8 So first of all, all of our 9 programs in the United States are in 10 institutionally accredited colleges and 11 universities, institutional accreditors certainly 12 are concerned that the academic programs can be 13 demonstrated to be rigorous and at the 14 educational level that the degree is offered. 15 There are states, boards of higher education that 16 have to approve the degree programs. 17 Also, the naturopathic programs 18 are not solely taught by naturopathic doctors. 19 Every school that offers the program has PhD's 20 and bio, in the biosciences, also MD's who teach 21 as part, clinical courses, so these are programs 22 where you have an interdisciplinary group of 23 people all with terminal degrees in various 24 natural medical fields. And they certainly 25 contribute to not only quality teaching but they 31In RE: B oard of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 24 90 1 also contribu te to an understanding of what needs 2 to be offered in doctoral level education. 3 I'm not sure if people are aware 4 of this, but the University of California, and I 5 believe the branch is in Irvine, actually has an 6 integrated medicine clinic that's part of its 7 medical school, and it has naturopathic doctors 8 who provide clinical services, in fact that's a 9 residency site for naturopathic doctors. And 10 that's another indication that people who get to 11 know naturopathic doctors and work closely with 12 them understand that they really operate at a 13 fine level of medical integrity. It is true that 14 in accreditation most fields are largely peer 15 reviewed and peer developed, as for chiropractic 16 and acupuncture, true of naturopathic medicine, 17 but we are part of this larger ecosystem and 18 involved and guided by that as well. 19 MR. SALAY: Thank you. 20 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. Do the 21 Committee Members have any further questions? 22 COMMITTEE MEMBERS: (No audible 23 response.) 24 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay, if not we 25 have heard comment from all persons who contacted92 1 University, and at the University of Virginia. 2 My, my oncologist at the University of Virginia 3 actually worked for me to see a naturopathic 4 doctor because I am suffering with some 5 complications to long-term radiological 6 surveillance and, and there, you know, the 7 traditional system, which I credit for giving me 8 these many extra years of my life, and I'm 9 extremely grateful to them for that, but also, 10 you know, at the time, unknowingly, you know, 11 caused me additional harm in the imaging process 12 because they didn't have that information at the 13 time that it would be potentially damaging to me. 14 So there's nothing that those teams of doctors 15 can offer me to be helpful and so they 16 recommended that I see a naturopathic doctor and 17 it has been really helpful in supporting me and 18 my body in trying to just deal with the effects 19 of that and manage them without doing any harm, 20 additional harm to me, which people, they see 21 chelation therapy, which can be very dangerous if 22 it's not managed properly, and I am very grateful 23 to know enough about natural, naturopathy 24 training to find someone who I know has an 25 extensive understanding of just physiology and 91 1 the Board of Health Professions office in advance 2 regarding the naturopathic doctor review, so this 3 concludes today's oral public comment. 4 MS. GARNETT: Excuse me? Hello? 5 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Who is 6 that? 7 MS. JACKSON: Please identify 8 yourself. 9 MS. GARNETT: Yes, hi, this is 10 April Garnett, I contacted you in advance, I've 11 been here since 9:00 this morning. I have not 12 been called to testify. 13 MS. JACKSON: Okay. 14 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. We all 15 make mistakes, so could you spell your, okay. 16 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: It's 17 up there. It's up there. 18 MS. GARNETT: April Garnett. 19 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. 20 MS. GARNETT: G-A-R-N-E-T-T. 21 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Okay. All right, 22 go ahead Ms. Garnett, or Dr. Garnett. 23 MS. GARNETT: Okay. I'm here to 24 give a patient perspective. I am a cancer 25 survivor, I've been seen at Johns Hopkins93 1 biochemistry, and I know that they can support me 2 through this process without risking, doing 3 additional harm with these processes. And that, 4 you know, it's not, this isn't, I'm not going to 5 just walk into a health food store and ask the 6 person working there to help me out. So that's 7 my testimony if anyone has any questions for me. 8 CHAIRMAN WELLS: Do any of the 9 Committee Members have any questions? 10 COMMITTEE MEMBERS: (No audible 11 response.) 12 CHAIRMAN WELLS: And we apologize 13 that we didn't get your name on the list, we 14 would have gotten to you sooner or in the 15 rotation. 16 MS. GARNETT: It's okay. 17 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: Yes, 18 and Ms. Garnett we have you down as... 19 MS. GARNETT: I just wanted to 20 make sure that you didn't end it without, without 21 me... 22 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CARTER: No. 23 We have you on the list for written comments, as 24 we had gotten an email from you and we had this 25 written comment, so I will take the blame for not 32In RE: B oard of Health Professions August 11, 2020 VR # 10789-1 Page 25 94 1 ma king sure tha t you were on this other one. 2 MS.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have suffered with debilitating symptoms for 30 years, and none of the conventional physicians I saw was able to help. In fact, some of the attempts at treatment have left me in worse condition. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. Specialized skills.are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. For me, that means treatment for chronic Lyme, for which Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. Years of being treated with other/better answers for me. My naturopathic doctor does. Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services -- including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti- hypertensives. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. 3Economic impact. (Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. Many of us who must see NDs are going broke trying to pay for our care entirely out of pocket. In this era of chronic disease, where its burden and impact fall disproportionately to the medically underserved, Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I am almost 65. I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor (NP) for over a year. So, I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. My experience has been extremely beneficial. I really do not want to use conventional meds and methods which have so many side effects. Finding a medically trained naturopath was a godsend for me. Some of the homeopathic remedies and supplements have helped conditions I had. Here are some things to note: 1)Specialized Skills -NPs are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug nutrient interactions. They are extensively trained in both conventional methods and natural medicine which bridges the gap between conventional and traditional medicine practice. 2)Scope of Practice -Currently NPs can't offer physical exams or order labs or imaging. They can't even order labs or imaging. Also they can't test for COVID or run a complete blood count. Therefore, patients have to get them on their own or schedule additional appointments with their primary care doc. Medically-trained NPs would be well equipped to provide these practices. Currently they can order labs in 25 jurisdictions where they are regulated and prescribe meds in 13 states. Also they are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states and credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states.

Regards, Grace L. Keenan, MD August 3, 2020 Grace L Keenan, MD 40310 Hurley Lane Paeonian Springs, VA 20129 Dear Members of the Committee, I am writing this letter in support of the full licensing of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. I would like to share a few relevant points regarding my career and experience with naturopathic doctors. In 1988, I moved to Northern Virginia and opened a practice in Sterling, VA. I was a newly graduated, Board Certified Internal Medicine Physician. I began a solo practice and it was not long until I realized the challenge of managing patients with chronic conditions. I shared the patient s disappointment with the results obtained from standard of care treatments for many chronic conditions, particularly fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine and obesity, to name a few. In 1995 I underwent a 5 year saga of reproductive endocrinology treatment in an effort to conceive. Complications from these procedures led to me being confined to bed for over a year. During this time of stress and tremendous boredom, I read many books and took an extension course from Harvard in Complimentary Medicine, now called Integrative Medicine. I learned the history of medicine, the birth and subsequent role of the American Medical Association, the fact that more patients were treated for cholera in America with homeopathy than Western medicine and the systemic rejection of herbal and natural therapies with the discovery of antibiotics, insulin, advancements in anesthesia, etc. I learned about the Flexner Report and the resultant redirection of delivery of healthcare in America and change in Hahnemann University Hospital from a Homeopathic to Western Medicine Hospital. When I returned to the practice of medicine in 2000, the success of modern medicine and the birth of a healthy daughter, I embarked upon working with integrative providers. By this point my practice had expanded from a solo practice to a patient-centered, multi-disciplinary, primary care medical home with four different locations in Northern Virginia. My clinic was the largest integrative, primary care, medical home in Virginia, until being acquired by Inova in 2016. For 18 years, I worked with naturopathic doctors who were also licensed in acupuncture I hope that my lifetime career allows me to speak to the seven criteria used bythe Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: Autonomous practice. The naturopathic doctors worked autonomously in this model, yet in collaboration with thehealthcare team. In all 25 jurisdictions that regulate, naturopathic doctors practice patient care independently. Over these years, we helped thousands of patients in a team-like manner, merging the best of Eastern andWestern medicine with the patient truly at the of Many patients would come to see me as a last resort. Having failed to gain relief after seeing multiple specialists, physicians would advise them to see Grace Keenan and her team.e cannot claim curing everyone, it was a rare patient that we did not help. I have learned so much from my patients 6 c approach that is crippling healthcare today. They functioned in a superior manner . They were able to empower the patient to make necessary lifestyle changes rather than treating the symptoms alone or adding another drug to the mix.. Many patients were cured by merely reducing the expensive and dangerous poly-pharmacy that we see so frequently today. In addition, the focus of dietary causes and natural supplements allows the patient to be involved in their healthcare and has less side effects than the plethora of prescriptions used so routinely. I rarely saw a patient that was not grateful for the opportunity to work with a naturopathic doctor. Since retiring, many desperate patients have reached out to me, saying that there is no place to turn. Risk for Harm. Licensing of naturopathic doctors will provide safe access to the care they provide. The onus of sorting out who is a medically-trained naturopathic doctor from someone who took online correspondence training should not fall to the patients. Licensing will help draw more medically-trained naturopathic doctors to Virginia, increasing patient access to care. While I have never seen one patient harmed by the experience, all medically-trained professionals pose some degree of risk of harm. Regulation helps to ensure the safety of patients while holding medical professionals accountable. I recently read that 75% of oncology patients seek alternative medicine and most patients do not tell their oncologist. Licensing would help lessen this issue. Economic Impact. Licensing create a framework for medically-trained naturopathic doctors to be able to participate in the greater health care system. While I understood the value for naturopathic doctors, they functioned under the scope of their acupuncture license. Larger medical systems are unable to credential unlicensed providers. Without access to insurance coverage many patients are unable to access the preventative medical care that naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. Lack of licensing reduces the number of medically-trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia and increases costs to patients. Specialized skill and training . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors training is unique. While elements, such as basic sciences are similar between various medical program, their approach to care is fundamentally different from other medical providers and from lay naturopaths who are not medically trained. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a 4-year, in residence, medical program and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, minor surgery, nutrition, botanical therapies and physical medicine. They are credentialed by the CNME (Council on Naturopathic Medical Education) which is recognized by the US Department of Education. Naturopathic doctors also have residency training opportunities. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition and botanical medicine. Scope of Practice. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of cost effective primary care and preventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained to provide. Naturopathic doctors work collaboratively with other providers and can serve an important role in the provider shortage in Virginia. Please feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have. I urge you to support the full licensing of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Regards, Grace L Keenan, MD 7August 5th, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you very much for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Dr. Teerawong Kasiolarn, and I have been a naturopathic doctor for over 15 years. I am writing in support of full licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have been practicing in Virginia since 2006 after finishing up my medical residency in Connecticut. I had been working at Nova Medical Group and now Inova Medical Group for over 13 years. Without Naturopathic licensure in Virginia, it is very difficult for me to order diagnostic lab tests for my patients even though I had been properly trained to order comprehensive diagnostic laboratory tests. Patients have to make additional medical visits to get lab orders from their doctors with extra costs and increase burden on the medical care visits especially with COVID-19 pandemic. Also, without proper Naturopathic licensure in Virginia, patients and medical doctors are confused about online Naturopathic degrees and medically- trained Naturopathic doctors. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework, will provide claritywhile almost promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the titleIt is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presentsthemselves as a has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trained professionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access to 8 35specialized professionals who have expertise in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctorspractice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with theircollective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained to provide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help us deal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope of their training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) into bordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the preventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide.6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic 9doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process offer any objective, and distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I am writing to you to support full licensure for all medically-trained naturopathic doctors. As examples, I have learned a lot about genetic testing, as well as found out that I had a couple autoimmune disorders that went undiagnosed with conventional doctors. This has benefited me greatly and I have been able to learn how to treat the CORE of those issues, not just cover up the issues/symptoms. I have a huge compassion for these doctors and the long hours of medical training with a serious congenital disorder, having these doctors to fall back on helps me to understand why and how some of these illnesses occur and whether they are related to my congenital disorder or if they are hereditary. I am a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors; therefore, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria: 1) Risk of Harm: Due to my congenital issue, I have to be very careful the conventional medication that I am prescribed which could very easily kill me if I take for long-term. I could get to a point where I could lose all bodily function due to some medications. I have already had many negative issues with medications and vaccines. Some which were needed to live/work overseas. 2) Specialized skills: I trust the naturopathic doctors because they have gone through many years of medical training and understand how to correlate conventional medicine with naturopathic (holistic) approaches to help the patient FEEL better and heal from the chronic illness. They are the only medical professionals who understand the drug-herb and/or drug-nutrient interactions and can suggest the best treatments, NOT just cover up symptoms of chronic disease. 3) Economic impact: Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the impact of our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road for insurance coverage which would give greater access for all citizens of Virginia. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for patients most in need. I, respectfully, urge the board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Shelly R.

My name is April Sharp Garnett, and I have been a student of natural healing remedies for nearly thirty years. I not, however, a naturopathic doctor, nor should I be able to refer to myself as one. I am writing in support of full licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors. About twenty years ago, I seriously considered pursuing an ND degree, but I decided not to do so because of the lack of licensing in my home state of Virginia. I believe my perspective as both a patient of ND, Dr. Leah Hollon, and my knowledge of the stringent pre-requisites and curriculum to become an ND uniquely qualifies me to opine on this matter. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. The process for renewing my Massage Therapy license in Virginia is difficult, but I could call myself a doctor of naturopathic medicine without any basic science knowledge, including basic human anatomy and physiology. This discrepancy in policies baffles and troubles me. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm.

My name is Liana Chen and I am actively practicing family medicine as a nurse practitionerfor the past 5 years. My practice and I have been working collaboratively with medically trained naturopathic doctors throughout this time. The value we place on our referrals to naturopathic doctors is due to their primary focus on the underlying causes of the illness, not just the symptoms, which aides my patients in a faster recovery from numerous disease and ailments.Their emphasis on preventionusing a non- pharmaceutical approach has the ability to better connect with patients who are otherwise non- compliant with Western medicine techniques. However, I urge you to understand that I emphasizemy use and full support of nautropathic doctors, not naturopaths, who have received doctoral degrees from federally recognized accredited programs and who are well versed in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies and physical medicine With the pandemic, there is an increased need to combat this new disease and an even greater need to strengthen the immune system using adequately trained professionals. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide a way to have not just greater access to healthcare but safe healthcare for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Liana Chen FNP 51 Catoctin Cir 1083084776 17150 Dunns VA 23192 503-680-4684 August 5, 2020 EsteemedDelegate/Representative or to Whom it May Concern, I am writing to support current Legislative action that allows the licensing and registration of Naturopaths in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I moved to Virginia two years ago from Oregon. Everything about my transition to this beautiful state has been truly wonderful. I am proud to now call Virginia, home. Coming from a state that has licensed Naturopathic doctors for many, many years, I was completely shocked and surprised that I was unable to use my traditional health insurance for this most importa licensed in this state was a very unwelcome surprise. I have chosen Naturopathy for my primary healthcare for over ten years. In those ten years I have had life changing physical health challenges that were successfully resolved using naturopathic intervention. Without surgery, without expensive pharmacology, without expensive specialty visits. This alternative means of healthcare is more successful and far less expensive that traditional healthcare. Health insurance companies cover naturopathy as a covered benefit in Oregon. I fully believe and have personally experienced that the specialized skill set of Naturopathic Doctors leads to better health outcomes primarily because this approach utilizes functional medicine treating the body as a whole, living, inter-related system vs. the traditional medical approach of individual body system specialty which is frankly, counter-productive and creates more side-effect and illness than a more integrated approach. I strongly urge you to support Legislation that ratified and licenses Naturopathic Doctors who have achieved verified credentials through an approved school of Naturopathy. The education is rigorous. Those who choose topractice in this way are holistic, comprehensive and professional in their delivery of healthcare that in my experience, far surpasses what traditional medicine can and does offer. Thank you for your support. In these challenging times it is even more important to support alternative healthcare that treats the whole person body, mind and spirit.

Though I am licensed as a naturopathic doctor in both Washington and Connecticut, I am currently practicing in Virginia.

I also refer many of my complex patients to these naturopathic doctors for personal attention that they sometimes do not get with traditional medicine. I trust the NDs that I work with they are very knowledgable with diagnosis, plan of care, and research-based treatment. As a medical professional who works under specific guidelines for state licensing and scope of practice, I believe these regulations and guidelines are important for any aspect of medical care to reduce risk of harm to potential patients. The general pubic does not know the difference between someone who has appropriate education and training and someone who uses the same marketing but it is not supported by the education and training. The government needs to protect the public by who are medically-trained and those who are not. Scope of practice should also be defined as it is with physical therapists, chiropractors, medical doctors, dentists, nurses and other disciplines under the Board of Health Professions to provide regulations for the protection of patients. I have many patients that see NDs regularly as their primary care doctors, both by choice for natural intervention that does not include prescription drugs and because traditional medicine failed to resolve the problem. I have seen naturopathic treatments improve symptoms in patients with cancers, Graves disease, anxiety, gastrointestinal disorders, multiple sclerosis, POTS and others. The NDs are trained to serve such a primary care role but currently patients must pay out- of-pocket to do so and many have limited access. Many patients with chronic pain or chronic illness of any kind can be helped with naturopathic treatments as a primary or in combination with other treatments. With regulations and licensure, qualified NDs will be available to more people and the cost will be less burdensome. This will alleviate some of the stress in the current medical system and allow patients more choice and voice in their care. Licensing of medically-trained naturopathic doctors from accredited programs will enable improved access to healthcare, improved safety through guidelines and regulations, increased education and choice by patients and reduced economic burden for the residents of Virginia. I respectfully recommend that the Board implement licensure for naturopathic doctors.

My name is Liana Chen and I am actively practicing family medicine as a nurse practitionerfor the past 5 years. My practice and I have been working collaboratively with medically trained naturopathic doctors throughout this time. The value we place on our referrals to naturopathic doctors is due to their primary focus on the underlying causes of the illness, not just the symptoms, which aides my patients in a faster recovery from numerous disease and ailments.Their emphasis on preventionusing a non- pharmaceutical approach has the ability to better connect with patients who are otherwise non- compliant with Western medicine techniques. However, I urge you to understand that I emphasizemy use and full support of nautropathic doctors, not naturopaths, who have received doctoral degrees from federally recognized accredited programs and who are well versed in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies and physical medicine With the pandemic, there is an increased need to combat this new disease and an even greater need to strengthen the immune system using adequately trained professionals. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide a way to have not just greater access to healthcare but safe healthcare for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Liana Chen FNP 51 Catoctin Cir NE Leesburg, VA 20176 NPI: 1083084776 27August 3, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is April Sharp Garnett, and I have been a student of natural healing remedies for nearly thirty years. I not, however, a naturopathic doctor, nor should I be able to refer to myself as one. I am writing in support of full licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors. About twenty years ago, I seriously considered pursuing an ND degree, but I decided not to do so because of the lack of licensing in my home state of Virginia. I believe my perspective as both a patient of ND, Dr. Leah Hollon, and my knowledge of the stringent pre-requisites and curriculum to become an ND uniquely qualifies me to opine on this matter. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. The process for renewing my Massage Therapy license in Virginia is difficult, but I could call myself a doctor of naturopathic medicine without any basic science knowledge, including basic human anatomy and physiology. This discrepancy in policies baffles and troubles me. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework, will provide claritywhile almost promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the titleIt is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trained professionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have expertise in prevention. Naturopathic doctors 28 40are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with their collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically-trained naturopathicdoctors are trained to provide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help us deal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope of their training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) into bordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the preventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide.6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process offer any objective, and distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, 29which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, April S.

I am writing to you to support full licensure for all medically-trained naturopathic doctors. As examples, I have learned a lot about genetic testing, as well as found out that I had a couple autoimmune disorders that went undiagnosed with conventional doctors. This has benefited me greatly and I have been able to learn how to treat the CORE of those issues, not just cover up the issues/symptoms. I have a huge compassion for these doctors and has spent four decades in the conventional medicine system with a serious congenital disorder, having these doctors to fall back on helps me to understand why and how some of these illnesses occur and whether they are related to my congenital disorder or if they are hereditary. I am a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors; therefore, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria: 1) Risk of Harm: Due to my congenital issue, I have to be very careful the conventional medication that I am prescribed which could very easily kill me if I take for long-term. I could get to a point where I could lose all bodily function due to some medications. I have already had many negative issues with medications and vaccines. Some which were needed to live/work overseas. 2) Specialized skills: I trust the naturopathic doctors because they have gone through many years of medical training and understand how to correlate conventional medicine with naturopathic (holistic) approaches to help the patient FEEL better and heal from the chronic illness. They are the only medical professionals who understand the drug-herb and/or drug-nutrient interactions and can suggest the best treatments, NOT just cover up symptoms of chronic disease. 313) Economic impact: Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the impact of our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road for insurance coverage which would give greater access for all citizens of Virginia. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for patients most in need. I, respectfully, urge the board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Shelly R.

I have been consistently seeing changes for the (For example: hirsutism, hormone imbalances, bad skin, stress) As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Specialized skills - Anytime I visit my doctor, I cross-check all of my labs and any information I receive with my licensed naturopath. Not only is he able to give me the same exact information the doctor gives me, he is also able to dive in with deeper detail and give me ways that I can fix and prevent the issue - whether it be through food or a natural herb. Something my doctor has no idea how to do. (For a simple example - I had an ear infection and was not allowed to take antibiotics, my doctor bas days. Not only curing my ear-infection but also giving me a way to not have to use antibiotics which wreak havoc on your system). I urge the board to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I would not want anyone less qualified to be considered a naturopathic doctor. 2) Scope of practice andEconomic impact - So far my naturopathic doctor has been more knowledgeable, helpful, a(including an endocrinologist and other specialists I have seen). He has given me more knowledge of how to fix and prevent my issues in the future. It is frustrating that they still cannot directly order many of the labs and prescriptions that the other doctors throw around like candy - as I greatly believe most naturopaths would be smarter about. I also know many people with autoimmune disease, leaky gut.. who would go to a naturopath if they were partially or totally covered by insurance. To the board - please listen to the recommendations of licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors as it is one step closer to getting insurance coverage!!! Let's get Virginia healthy!!!

My comments are based on recent and personal experience. After seeing numerous physicians around Richmond for conditions such as rashes, weight gain, moodswings, and insomnia, I found myself frustrated and undiagnosed. Each specialist would offer me a new prescription drug to try to see if it would ease my symptoms, as opposed to finding the root cause of the ailments. I decided to try another route to healing based upon recommendations from others in my personal network. My comfort level was greatly increased in trying a specific practice knowing they were recognized in their field as ND's. A lot of people masquerade as naturopathics, but knowing that the official ones have received specific education, training and experience to hold the ND status is very important to trusting you will receive beneficial care. Licensing naturopathic doctors provides additional safety to the public so that consumers and patients can find credentialed naturopathic doctors vs. lay providers if this is their choice. In my own experience, a naturopathic doctor was able to get to the root of what was causing many of my symptoms by understanding how they were related to each other. As we have continued to work together, it has been a much more efficient process (with both time and money) to be able to order recommended supplements directly through the practice. It has actually saved me hundreds of dollars of having to research brands and prices on my own. Some brands are obviously much higher quality and therefore more effective than others. Licensing naturopathic doctors provides cost savings and preventive medicine due to finding the root cause assisting with financial savings to patients and helping to restore health. My health has benefitted so much in the past five months after turning to a ND that I would be hopeful that the scope of their practice could grow to include physical exams, additional labs, and imaging on site as they have been trained to provide and offer in other licensedstates. Their knowledge and specialized skills of looking at pharmacotherapy, botanical and nutritional interactions would cost an unbelievable amount of money (and time) if you had to search each out in a conventional manner. It is my great hope that ND's will be supported and protected by DHP. Thank you, Kristen Costello 34 35 36 42This Page Intentionally Left BlankFrom: Frank Kilgore <frank@fkilgore.net > Date: Thu, Aug 6, 2020 at 1:53 PM Subject: Naturopathic study To: <elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov > Dea r Ms. Carter, As an advocate for better health care and preventive care in improvised regions of Virginia I have visited two fully accredited ND schools, one in Washington state and the other in Arizona. Just as schools of osteopathy faced similar challenges to be accepted years ago we now know that ODs are well trained and the graduates are much more likely per cent wise to become family physicians in lower income areas. The added benefit of properly educated NDs from accredited schools is that most impoverished areas, such as Appalachia where I live, need a laser focus on preventive care and community education to help reduce and avoid rampant obesity, diabetes, tobacco, alcohol and illegal drug abuse, coupled with exercise. The stats in Appalachia are very similar to the situation in inner cities. NDs, and the ND students that are matriculating now and those to come, have and will have a much more pro-active mission to serve as role models for healthy living. Millions of children who are caught up in generational unhealthy eating habits and are particularly exposed to the diseases above, can benefit greatly if specialized health care professionals advocate and represent better lifestyles for emerging generations to help change their deadly trajectories. ND student rotations in public schools, preventive health clinics and fairs, social media campaigns and other such measures can significantly show underserved children that there is another path and when the person advocating that path is living a healthy lifestyle credibility takes hold. such schools be allowed in every state, including Virginia, that those states should recruit and encourage the ND decision makers to place the schools in the worst of the worst poor health outcome venues to make a difference. The shocking stats of self sourced bad health worsen each year so the question is does anyone have a better idea to change this course? Or should we just let each generation fall into the continuous spiral of early onset of disability and premature death? I hope not. I can be reached at 276-608-0839 if anyone wishes to further discuss this potential role for properly sanctioned ND schools. The return on investment to improve young lives will be richly rewarded.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have greatly benefitted from my naturopathic doctor because she takes my entire health into consideration especially related to diet and natural approachesfor my health. Here is why I support licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors: I benefit from the fact that my naturopathic doctors consider the health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. I want mynaturopathic doctor to provide me more services that she is frankly trained to do! Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID- 19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates anadded burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 2 years now and I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. As a patient of Dr., Leah Hollon and Dr. Sarah Giardinelli for over two years now, I have experienced relief from chronic health issues that I was unable to address with western medicine and traditional physicians. Healing and wellness from a patient centered and holistic approach has allowed me to address physical, mental, and emotional healing I was unable to find with other doctors. These two wonderful doctors have spent time listening to my fears, my medical troubles, and my personal concerns. Without their caring and knowledge I would not be able to live the fullest life that I am living today. My nine year old has also been visiting these two doctors for almost two years now. He was born 11 weeks premature and has struggled with medical respiratory and gastrointestinal problems his whole life. Traditional medications and procedures only caused more internal damage and put him at great risks. Natural and holistic healing with NDs has been a blessing for our family and I can't imagine where we would be without them. Their licensure is so crucial so that Virginians can receive quality, safe, and licensed care under these amazing practitioners. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to some of the seven criteria: 1) Risk of harm- Just as my son was at risk under traditional care, I fear the same without licensure in Virginia for NDs. There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from licensed naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. 2) Specialized skills- NDs are the only practitioners that have ever looked at my son and myself as a complete human being from physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual viewpoints. The countless hours they have spent specializing care-plans is not able to be accomplished in allopathic medicine under our current healthcare system. hey are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. 3) Scope of practice- I feel that it is important for NDs to be licensed so that they are able to include comprehensive care that traditional practitioners provide everyday without all the information NDs have. NDs are certainly in a position to be able to include these practices while still viewing the patient holistically. Currently, medically- 39trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services -- including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti-hypertensives. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. 4) Economic impact- Let's face it..... the healthcare system is overwhelmed! They clearly are not able to meet all the needs of the public. Why are we getting \"more knowledgeable\" as a society but yet our people are getting sicker and sicker by the year? Something doesn't add up.... we need alternative medicine practitioners and NDs who are licensed and regulated to help view healthcare from another angle. The impact, ripple effect, could be huge and could spread a wellness trend across the world. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. In this era of underserved, Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Our family would be lost without NDs. I am thankful that I had the knowledge to find licensed and trusted NDs to work with. But it wasn't easy. The people need to have a regulated profession they can follow and get on board with. Everyone's health can stand to benefit from licensure. Thank you for your consideration on this matter and best wellness wishes to you.

For the last twelve months I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor, Dr Leah Hollon. I write to you today to support the full licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors. For the following reasons I support licensure. 1) Specialized skills: Dr Hollon is the first to treat me and my ailments in a holisitic manner and taking into account all aspects of my life, health and general well-being and in other words it is a holistic approach. After receiving treatment by conventional physicians my entire life I find this type of practice far superior for addressing the issues I have. Her methods get directly to the root cause instead of merely treating symptoms. I am certain that if I had been under naturopathic care all my life, I would have far fewer health concerns and crises throughout my many years. 2) Scope of Practice: Every doctor wants the most tools possible to care for their patients and Naturopathic doctors are no different. Dr Hollon could certainly use a full tool set available to licensed doctors to order labs, take images and give physical exams. Under the current scheme she can not. Having these tools will give her and all Naturopathic doctors the ability to enhance their practice and improve patient care with a more comprehensive treatment. 3) Doctor shortage: Within the next ten years two out of five doctors will retire. In another three years there will be an estimated doctor shortage of nearly 140,000. This will have the most detrimental effect among lower income patients and the elderly since both groups generally have a greater need for medical care. We need to have as many doctors in practice as possible to avert this looming crisis. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional healthcare access for patients most in need. Additionally I want to state that the care received through Dr Hollon has been nothing short of miraculous. After stage 4 cancer treatment, I was alive but my body was severely broken. In fact for over two years I could not swallow food and had to feed myself with a gastro-tube. The licensed doctors, including specialists, basically told me \"it happens\" but could not help me. Dr Hollon has gone above and way beyond both my expectations of care and treatment in order to get me back to one hundred percent functionality again. In light of my personal experience and the compelling reasons listed above, respectfully, I urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in our state. Give them the tools they need and make Virginia an even better place to live. Sincerely, Michael Sandy 804 912 9250 41August 6, 2020 Dear Dr. Elizabeth Carter, I am writing in support of regulation of the practice of Naturopathic Doctors in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I was first introduced to naturopathic medicine in 2016, after my own personal health began to decline. I had been seeing many specialists over a 10-year period of time with no one able to determine what was going on with me. I was at a point where I was chronically sick and getting sicker every year. It was greatly affecting my job and my personal life. A friend recommended naturopathic medicine and I'm happy to say, that my ND was the one that put all the pieces together that lead to my diagnosis. Now that we know what is going on, we know how to treat it. I'm so unbelievably thankful for my ND's knowledge, training and commitment to me as her patient. I credit her with helping me get my life back! I consider my ND as one of my primary physicians, but she is not licensed to run labs and other tests in Virginia. I'm incredibly thankful for the collaboration and teamwork that occurs between my ND and my PCP, but I with other physicians. My ND and PCP communicate regularly and work together to care for me. We need more of this in today's medical field. We need patients that do not fit into any box, like me, to have access to a wider scope of health care which should absolutely include medically-trained and regulated naturopathic doctors. If we do not regulate who can practice as an ND in the state of Virginia, then we jeopardize the care that is provided to patients and ultimately, their health. I personally work as a pediatric physical therapist and therapy director and I treat patients with many complex needs. On a daily basis, I use every bit of my education and training to provide the most evidence-based care to my patients. I am finding that more and more patients do not fit into \"the box\" of just one route of medical intervention. I personally have referred patients to ND's in order to gain a more holistic view of my patient and their complex needs. ongoing training to provide the highest level of care to the patients I refer to them. In closing, I strongly support the regulation of naturopathic medicine in Virginia. This will enable safeguarding public health and creating transparency.

As a patient who supports licensu re for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are some concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1. Specialized Skills: When I first sought care from my medically-trained naturopathic doctor, I had experienced severe and chronic knee pain for ov er 5 years. I saw multiple orthopedists, two rheumatologists, and had more X rays and MRIs than I can count. I had 3 knee surgeries with at least 6 months to a year of physical therapy after each procedure and was given numerous diagnoses, that were actually more like \"best guesses\" from th e orthopedists, and no one gave a clear cause or consistent diagnoses. I would sp end months trying every treatment recommended by these doctors and have to take a break after no progress and endless frustration from these specialists telling me they couldn't do anything else for me before passing me off to the next specialist. My naturopathic doctor listened to my extensive history, and stuck with me to rule out multiple chronic illnesses, making connections from medical history during my teenag e years that not one other doctor even bothered to ask about. I was diagnosed by my naturopathic do ctor with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and the acupuncture she provides for me regularly is the only thing that has had any success in reducing my pain levels. She didn't stop there, she took a holistic approach of my entire medical history, and has sincehelped me get rid of a year long chronic cough wi th no prescription medications with serious side effects, only additional supplements and acupunctu re treatments for my sinuses. Since she first addressed my cough with me, I have had such minima l seasonal allergy issues (that I believed may have attributed to 6 months of coughi ng) and by taking her recommended supplements, I have been able to prevent and/or significantly shorten the length and sev erity of colds. I am confident that given my past experience with traditional MDs, no one else would have paid attention to, or been able to help thisissue as thoroughly, quickly and effici ently. It is this consistent, proactive, holistic care that has built such trust in my naturopathic doctor that she is always the first person I go to with any medical concerns. 2. Scope of Practice: My previous points lead me to my next concern. When my naturopathic doctor was helping me determine what she eventually diagnosed as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, all blood work and other tests or prescriptions had to be submitted to insurance through my Primary Care Physician, who I only see for my annual physical exam. My PCP spends about 10 minutes in the room with me, while she reads her standard check list of medical questions and barely makes eye contact, and she certainly does not establish a relationship wher e I feel comfortable brin ging up any additional concerns. When I have brought up concerns, she has pr escribed medication that is risky and not helpful, or often asks me if I've already spoken to my n aturopathic doctor, knowing full well that the ND has a more comprehensive understanding of these issues a nd how they impact me personally. I am fortunate that my PCP has a strong working relationship with my ND and trusts her, bu t I can only imagine how 43challenging this gets for those who aren't as lucky. Further, as a patient, I do not want to have to schedule an additional appointment with an addition al cost, just to have the recommendations carried out by someone less knowledgeable about my medical history and my needs. This is an unnecessary financial and scheduling burden not ju st to me as the patient, but to th e healthcare system as a whole. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors wi ll provide additional, safe healthcare access for patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

Given my personal experience with two vastly different individuals that both use the term Naturopath, I think this is of utmost impo rtance in ensuring Virginians have full transparency about the services they will receiv e. I have complex chronic health issues, and sought the help of a Naturopath in improving those conditions. The first Naturopath I worked with was a lay Naturopath that provided me options to the best of her abilities, what I did not realize was how limited those abilities were. After working with this particular Naturopath for about a year, and having limited progress and some set backs, I inquired about her training. When I found out she earned her degree online I was deeply disappointed. My expectations for quality of care could not be met with an online trained lay Naturopath. I did not realize that people could legally use the term Naturopath without medical training I later did my own investigation and foun d a Naturopathic Doctor who had attended medical school, who has helped me achieve a level of healing that is nothing short of miraculous. I ask you to please have Naturop athic Doctors licensed in Virginia so that citizens can make an informed choice. I didn 't know what I didn't know, and it cost me. I hope that greater transparency can be achieved through licensure. This would not only achieve cost savings for the public ( I incurred significant costs for ineffective treatments with the lay Naturopath) but prevent harm and confusion to the public. Regards, Cathy Connell, Roanoke, VA 45\u0001 August 7, 2020 Virgi nia Board of Health Professions Attn: Laura Jackson 9600 Mayland Drive, Suite 300 Henrico, VA 23233 Dear Members of the Virginia Board of Health Professions: On behalf of the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH), I am writing to urge the Board to recommend licensure of Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) in Virginia. ANH is a nonprofit organization representing one million consumers and healthcare practitioners across the U.S. ANH protects the right of natural health pr actitioners to practi ce, and the right of consumers to choose the healthcare option s and treatment modalities they prefer, including complementary and alternative medicine. We believe a system that is single-mindedly focused on \"treating\" sick people with expensive drugs, rather than maintaining healthy people, is neither practical nor economically sustainable. NDs directly support this aim, working with patients to support long-term health by focusing on the root causes of illness, as opposed to simply treating the resulting symptoms. As so many Virginians suffer from acute and chronic illnesses that require personalized, holistic treatment, the need for access to licensed NDs in Virginia is clear. NDs who have graduated from accr edited, four-year naturopathic medical schools, are educated and trained to practice naturopathic medici ne to a scope that meets each of the seven criteria used to evaluate the need for a health profession's regulation in Virginia. Consumers demand access to various type s of practitioners, and they should have the ability to choose the practitioner that fits their unique needs, including licensed NDs and traditio nal naturopaths. ND licensure should allow NDs to use their full education and training by permitting a defined scope of practice that includes diagnosis and treatment. Importantly, ANH supports the licensure of NDs to practice to the level of their skills and training, while still preserving the rights of traditional naturopathic practitioners with alternative educational backgrounds, other than naturopa thic medical school, to continue to practice as they have been in Virginia. As the Virginia Department of Health Professions' preliminary report on ND regulation states, \"If practice is limited in the Commonwealth to only those naturopaths able to be licensed in the state, there may be an increased cost to the consumer based on the simple economic principle of supply and demand.\" By permitting access to both licensed NDs and 46 45traditional naturopaths, consumers woul d be better equipped to distinguish between NDs who have gone through formal training and those who have trained more informally, and they would have the right to decide the health professional that best meets their individual needs. Open and fair markets, in which consumers can decide what credentials and level of education they seek in healthcare profe ssionals, guarantee the best outcomes. ANH urges the Virginia Board of Health Profe ssions to recommend ND licensure to the Virginia General Assembly. Respectfully submitted, Gretchen DuBeau, Esq.

This will, without a doubt, significantly improve the health of Virginians, prevent the public from unsafe practices, give Virginians better access and choi ce to unique, quality, more holistic healthcare, and reduce the cost burden of healthcare overall. I am a firm believer in the multitude of benefits for our society as a whole with the preventative nature of naturopathic medicine, but I will keep my comments to within three of the criteria of why this profession absolutely needs to be regulated by the state of Virginia: RISK FOR HARM TO THE CONSUMER: The current unregulated practice of naturopathic med icine in our state can, and will, harm many Virginians' welfare! Appropriately trained naturopathic doctors provide a safe, effective, and affordable means of health care; and licensure of naturopathic doctors helps provide the assurance to the consumer that their ND has undergone the rigor of one of the four naturopathic medical schools in the United States. Many state s already regulate naturopathic doctors with boards that ensure patients receive safe and ef fective treatments from qualified doctors. When one moves to Virginia, many do not realize that al most anyone can claim to be a \"naturopathic\" practitioner! SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND TRAINING: Naturopathic doctors are unique in their approach and provide a WEALTH of benefits to their patients. They combine the scientific rigor and evidence-base of conventional medicine with nutrition, stress management, and therapeutic lifestyl e changes to help patients prevent, treat, and reverse the epidemic of chronic diseases afflicting our country today. The evidence is clear that our current healthcare system is lacking when it comes to chronic disease. Naturopathic doctors are skilled in preventing and treating chronic disease. Appropriately trained naturopathic do ctors provide a safe, effective, and affordable means of health care; and licensure of naturopathic doctors helps provide consumers more reliable choices in their health care. There is no doubt in my mind that many chronic diseases are preventable and are linked to lifestyle choices. Our top priority should be a health system with interventions that will improve the effective delivery and other preventive services in order to prevent disease and reduce or eliminate risk factors due to chronic diseases. I personally have benefitted from working with a qualified ND as I navigate my own health concerns and family history through a more preventative and holistic approach. 48 SCOPE OF PRACTICE: With the current state of things, I need to jump through hoops and unnecessary visits to other physicians just to get simple but important proced ures like blood labs done. The NDs in Virginia under our current status are functioning in a very limited capacity -far narrower than their education and training. Licensure will help Virg inia NDs be able to offer the highest level of wellness care for our citizens, a particular bonus d uring things like the current Covid crisis, as well as the fact that many physicians are leav ing primary care practice, and currently leaving consumers who need a healthcare practitioner with far less choices. The support of Licensure presents clear benefits to the health of Virginians. I hope I can count on you to support a solution to something that is currently harming our health status and healthcare freedom. Thank you for your consideration.

It is a huge thanks for the ND to care for me more than my previous primary doctors . As a patient who supports licensure for medica lly-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the two criteria. 1) Scope of practice. Currently, medic a lly-trained na turopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; th ey cannot even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. I strongly believ e that the BHP needs to grant naturopathic doctors access exactly the same way as the primary care providers due to the emergency of the pandemic and shortage of prim ary doctors. It is up to the patients to choose their own doctors who care for them and the family in a safe natural way. There are too many abusive drugs with side effects th at kill people every day. How do you feel if it is your own child, parents, or your loved one? I urge YOU as a member of the Board to recommend licensure for a naturopathic doctor. 2) Economic impact. Licensing m edically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creat ing additional access for patients. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. This is not fair that naturopathic doctors who fulfill their dreams as spending the same amount of school as other doctors to help the patients that the state of Virginia denies licensing that the insurance denies the coverage. This is human life not a competition between docto rs. My family and I have been treated by ND with their NATURAL heart for years without insurance coverage. I highly recommend the Board to approve this practice with their PURE heart as well. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic docto rs will pro v ide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need.

I don't know where I would be without their guidance and support. Have a wonderful weekend, Ari Julius August 7, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, I am personally writing in support of licensing of naturopa thic doctors. My name is Ar istides Julius and I have been a patient of Naturopathic medicine for over 3 years. Risk of Harm : Creating a licensure for \"naturopathic doctor\" will go a long way to legitimize this group of medical professionals in the eyes of the public , government official, and insurance companies. Specialized Skill and Training : Due to a naturopath's unique trai ning, they have a clearer understanding of the human body and how it works. Naturopathic doctors go through a four-year medical program and complete board exams in basic sciences. Economic impact : Currently, seeing my naturopathic doctor i s expensive with neither Supplements nor the time with the practitioner being covered by insurance. In an ideal world, \"medical grade\" supplements would become available and be covered by insurance as well as the visit. My personal experience: Over the years, I have seen many doctors and I have given them the same list of concerns . I can summarize the typical doctor's process as follows: they half listen to the patient, waiting for key words which allow them to bill the insurance company for Test A or write a script for medicine Y. I went to a neurologist about headaches and the neurologist did not care if it could be caused by muscle tension, their solution was to inject you with Botox, or give you a pill. Another time, my Primary Care Provider gave me muscle relaxants because my jaw hurt from grinding my teeth. He did not give me an exam and did not follow up with the Oral/Facial Surgeon who also told me to take muscle relaxants. Instead, he just gave me a generic dosing which did not work to alleviate any pain or stress on my jaw. When I met my naturopathic doctor and told her my story, she mapped out a whole-body therapy for me which included tinctures, supplements, mindfulne ss, and specific workouts. Months later, I am feeling great. I am getting the best sleep I have had in years, the pain in my jaw has reduced significantly, and I have better range of motion of my shoulders and neck. Licensing medically training naturopathic doctors will create additional safe healthcare access for all Virginians. I urge the board to please consider licensing naturopathic doctors.

My ND has been so beneficial to my overall health, I can't imagine not having her in my life. Thank you, Mary Claire Julius August 7, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, I am personally writing in support of licensing of naturopathic doctors. My name is Mary Claire Julius. I have lived in Virginia for 33 years a nd have been a patient of Naturopathic medicine for over 7 years. Risk of Harm : The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically trained na turopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Creating a licensure for a \"naturopathic doctor\" wil l go a long way in legitimizing these professionals within the state of Virginia. Specialized Skill and Training : Naturopathic doctors complete a four-year medical program and complete board and licensing exams. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies and understand the interactions within other forms of medicine such as nutritional and botanical medicine. Scope of Practice : Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers and can serve as additional providers for chronic disease, addiction, and mental health illnesses. Economic impact : Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in the state of Virginia, which will increase patient access and reduce overall costs. Currently, naturopathic patients are having to pay for health care services out of pocket which costs hundreds to thousands of dollars a year. All Virginians should have the right to access this form of medicine and have their insurance cover it. My personal experience: Through the years, I have seen many healthcare professionals. I floated from one doctor to another without getting a clear answer to my needs. Over 7 years ago, I was in a minor car accident. A friend told me about Naturopathy medicine when I complained of muscle strain and tension. She said I should research it to see if it would be a good fit for my needs. It led me down a rabbit hole of information and I became interested in holistic healing. 54 47Unfortunately, I did learn through research that ND's are not licensed in the state of Virginia and insurance does not cover this form of medicine. In order to afford care, I had to continue to live with my parents for 3 more years as I could not afford shared rent with a friend and naturopathy medicine. This decision changed my life, as I finally found a doctor who was caring, compassionate, and interested in helping me instead of feeding me pain pills. My naturopathic doctor helped me get off of medication that was prescribed to me years prior for a childhood diagnosis of Dyslexia. When I had previously visited my primary care physician and expressed interest in weaning off the medicine, the response I got was, \"That has never happened before for one of my patients.\" Due to the care of my naturopathic doctor helping me become more healthy, I was able to wean off these medications. My PCP was surprised that the hard work we have done allowed to me to get off of my medications. Since then, my naturopathic doctor has worked wi th me on losing weight and balancing my hormones. I had previously been told by anothe r medical professional that I may be unable to bear children. Thankfully, my naturopathic doctor didn't believe that was the case at all. With her help, my husband and I welcomed our sweet baby girl in 2019. My naturopathic doctor was there to help with lactation support, pain manage ment, and supplements to ease the post-partum sleepless nights we experienced. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide Virginians with addition and safe healthcare access to all. I urge the board to please recommend licensure for Naturopathic doctors.

Thanks for your attention, and that of the Board for your consideration.Sincerely Theresa J Niemeier Alexandria, VA August 7, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Theresa Niemeier. I have been a Virginia resident for 35 years and I have been under the care of a medically trained naturopathic doctor In Virginia for two years.(I have been under the care of medically trained naturopathic doctors in other Statespreviously -i t ' s just hard to find one in Virginia!). I am writing in support of full licensure fo r medically trained naturopathic doctors. Having run the gamut with other licensed professionals for my care, including\"traditional Medical Doctors, Integrative Doctors and other specialists\", Ic o n t i n u et ob e at a loss for the plethora of testing and prescription medication and supplements thatwere being prescribed for me and, after fifteen years of \"care\", not making enough progress to allow my body to operate efficiently and to return to stasis -full health. I and my body have been screaming for help for quite some time. The most criticalcomponent for me in choosing a medically trained naturopathic doctor is that theyunderstand BOTH allopathic medicine and can prescribe medications when necessary along side natural remedies and lifestyle choices, diet and exercise. Balance. Fortunately, I kept pursuing options for \"holistic\" care by a medically trained naturopath. Finally, all the stars aligned for me in Virginia and I have come across a practice that has helped and is continuing to assist me with my goal of restored health. The primary adjunct for me with this relationship is that, as an adopted at birth adult, having no family history or any idea of a family history, yet having struggled with auto- immune related dysfunction most of my life, we started with my blood type and my DNA.It'sfascinating the for me, as I am sure is true for many who do not know it, the \"less is more\" approach is much more effective and my body is much more responsive. It's providing support, but not reprogramming or remapping my body due to a prescription that causes my body to stop doing it'sjob and letting the drug take over. Disharmony at work and not a long term solution. In fact, likely creating a slippery slope. Ha! With over fifteen years of \"traditional\" care, every doctor seemed to disregard the fact that I had no family history to look at and, even worse, each experience (while there 56 were benefits), seemed to discount what I would tell them about my symptoms and my lack of history. And, how I was feeling. What my body was telling me. I was listening, but could not find anyone else to listen along side me.The primary distinction for me is that in e ach of these instances the doctors instead chose to run more tests than I can remember, but the stack of test results and papers is at least three or four inches thick. It cost me and my insurance many thousands ofdollars. And, no recommendations for care. Except, in a few instances, some type of prescription medication. Or, more medical testing. What about the Hippocratic oath? For me, that's where the medically trained Naturopath comes into play. The body is, next to nature and trees, one of the most amazing and dynamic entities and it is actually designed and wants to heal itself and to maintain constant stasis. Sometime, we just need a little help and/or direction. That's where the medically trained naturopath comes into play. But, it is a partnership between the doctor and the patient. We need to work together for our success in restoring health. The body, mind and spiritwork towards it every second of every day. Provide it support, give it direction, goals,knowledge. All powerful healing. One of the most amazing aspects of the human body is its ability to heal itself. My experience with naturopathic doctors is that this is first and foremost on their mind. Focus on care that allows the body to heal itself! With as little synthetic intervention as possible. As a patient who supports licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Specialized skills -- Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. 2) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. In this era of chronic disease, where it'sburden and impact fall disproportionately to the medically underserved, Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. 57Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. Ult imately, costing patients and insurance compaies less money AND getting much better results and outcomes.

Up here in Massachusetts our bill was signed into la w in 2017, followed soon by Rhode Island, completing all New England states. There is clear risk to public health by not licensing naturopathic doctors as many individuals, without any medical training hold themselv es out to be naturopathic doctors. Clear harm has been done and will continue to be done if licensure does not take place, as ther e is no way an uninformed public can appreciate the difference. Licensable naturopathic doctor s work independently, and follow indicated referral patterns both to and from our licensed medical colleagues. ND have unique skills that encompass whole person, natural medicine, the capaci ty to diagnose and treat disease. We are specialist in preventi ve care and work to help patients reach optimal health. A large percent of chronic ailments in this country including heart disease , diabetes and cancer are lifestyle-preventable and license naturopathic doctors are uniquely trained and qualified to deliver medical care to manage treatment and where possible, reverse these ailments. There is economic harm to Virginia as at this time , many patients see NDs licensed to practice in nearby jurisdictions such as Maryland and Washington DC. Similarly, there are many NDs who live in Virgina, but practice across state lines in order to practice in a state where they are licensed, thus income tax loss to Virginia. But most importantly, preventive, natural and whole-person many has the capacity to save health care dollars, often one of the largest line items in any state budget. During this time of COVID-19, we need more medically trained individuals , especially those who can help people address underlying ailments which have them more susceptible to severe reactions to this virus. Additionally, Virginia, like many states is facing a severe shortage of primary care doctors in the coming decades. Naturopathic doctors can help fill that gap. The MSND strongly supports licensing of medically-tr ained naturopathic doctors by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and encourages the Board to make a strong and well informed recommendation for licensure. 59If you would like to speak with me on any of the above points, please do not hesitate to reach out.Thanks for your time and consideration.

I'm a woman who has been on a lo ng and painful Journey. Part of my Journey lead me to Richmond Natural Medicine. This happened because I was in Elwood's Thompson a local health store in Richmond, Virginia. I met a young nutritionist who suggested Richmond Natural Medicine. So my Journey began with NP doctor Hollon . Let me stat e I'm a nanny so financially not the easiest to pay for any medical stuff. So worth going to See NP Hollon out of pocket. She was thorou gh and tested me for things Doctors had never considered. I was treated as an individual with indivi dual problems. Yes i truly believe that is a MAJOR problem in our healthcare today , along with cost. At this point you maybe wondering wh at my painful and long journey was and is??? Well let me tell you, Infertility. Through all the testing we figured out I had a lot of food Intolerances and MTHFR. Huge information I needed to know so I could change how I eat and live my everyday life. One of my intolerances is fruit, ha ha raised a Vegetarian. Even though we pulled out all the stops I st ill was not able to get pregnant at that time. So being a very responsible NP , NP Hollon suggested I see a Infertility's Specialist. After crazy testing from the Infertility Doctor . We were sa id to have unexplained infertility. Might I add at first the Doctor said everything we wanted to hear, seemed caring. After that I felt like a numb er. Worst feeling ever to be ignored and treated as a number. Story is getting longer but nothing should be left out. So before first infertility treatment, what !!! I'm pregnant !!! We are over the moon . 7 weeks in start to bleed , yep first Miscarriage. Okay we actually go to doctor for infert ility treatment, First Huge mistake fo r my own personal body was taking clomid . First hint of a major problem were the huge toad bumps emerging out of my elbows. I keep going I want to get pregnant right?????? Suck it up buttercup it's all part of what you have to do right???? Well it's even more fun near the end taking Clomid my vagina would burn. I tell the Doctor, looks directly into my face and says that not a side effect. I take his cold answer because yet again I just want to get pregnant right?????? Outcome after several procedures no pregnancy and a lot of money. Left feeling like a number and uncared for. Go to NP Hollon who thank goodness checks my hormone levels . My estrogen is skyhigh at this point. No baby and having high estrogen at this point. She immediately puts me on a plan to lower my estrogen. Then another side effect of taking Clomid shows up. I start literally pooping in my pants. My lowest point of this was when I was walking down the hall leaving from babysitting and I literally pooped in my pants the only thing that saved me was I was wearing thinks underwear. I'm headed to my next job so I have to drive in my car with poop in my underwear and quickly clean up before the girl I watch gets off the bus. At this point I contact my NP. NP Hollon knew exactly how to treat this problem I was now having. After a month of very safe natural medicine for my individual body, it was cleared up. Wow what a difference, to be heard , to be treated properly and not like a number. Who wants to be a number???? I still continue to see my NP Hollon and she continues to watc h over my overall health and wellness. She assess me each time to make sure that there's nothing new going on in my life that needs to be taken care of or dealt with. Again she's very honest and very thorough.

My name is Lea Christy Sloan and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor since 2013. As the board considers licensure, I am writing in support of fully licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors (NDs.) As a licensed psychotherapist in private practice, I am committed to the importance of oversight and accountability. The majority of the public does not know the difference between a licensed and non- licensed professionals and it is my concern that Virginians are protected by the assurance of medical education, training and continuing education. This will create safe medical care for the residents of Virginia who seek out naturopathic doctors. As you know, medically trained naturopathic doctors require rigorous education and training as well as the requirement for licensing exams in various therapies in cluding pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapy and physical medicine. Particularly, but not only, in this ti me of this widespread pandemic, skilled NDs can provide preventative care which will increase the health and wellbeing of the community as well as assist individual patients with protocols that ensure the best response given particular underlying conditions. It is particularly important for Virginians to have access to more care given the shortage of medical professionals. As a matter of public health, licensed NDs can provide widespread care independently but also in conjunction with other licensed health professionals in the state. In addition, because naturopathic doctors in VA are not licensed they are unable to use coding so that patients can submit their services to insurance companies which results in higher costs for health ca re. With licensure, this will change and the economic impact will be widespread as health care costs will not dominate Virgin ians' spending ability when they require medical care. Given the community spread of the pandemic, more Virginians often have to choose between medical care and other expenditures bringing hardship to them and limiting their ability to purchase other goods and services. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe, affordable healthcare across the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Dr. Hollon is probably the most thorough, empathetic, knowledgeable, plugged in doctor I have ever had in my life - I am 73 years old! This is the whole premise behind naturopathic treatment. The entire person (physical, mental, emot ional) is treated rather than just throwing prescriptions at symptoms. I would like to address criteria #1 as well as #2 for the purpose of this letter. More people than ever before are now turning to naturopathic med icine. It offers the patient a much needed alternative to standard western medical practices. Western medicine certainly will always have a prominent place in the healthcare of Virginia re sidents, but naturopathic practitioners go well beyond in their search for answers than what most western doctors are willing or able to do.It is imperative that naturopathic doctors be licensed in the state of Virginia so that the residents have a clear choice for their healthcare needs without worrying whether or not their caregiver is properly trained and licensed. I think the paragraphs above adequately address cr iteria #2 as well as #1. The specialized skills and expertise of a naturopathic doctor are a welcome and necessary addition to healthcare in the state of Virginia. Naturopathic doctors must be allowed to perform physical exams, order labs, and execute any number of procedures with full licensure in Virginia.

There are many reasons to support licensure under the propos ed legislation, but I will focus on 3 of the \"criteria\" that I believe are most critical to patients like myself. While living in California in 2012, I started experiencing a vast number of symptoms and health problems that were seemingly unrelated. I visited my PCP, my gynecologist, my dermatologist, an endocrinologist, a neurologist, a pain specialist, etc., and proceeded to have numerous procedures, injections, treatments and medications that did nothing for my pain or my overall health. After a couple years, I finally asked myself, \"Is it possible all of my symptoms are somehow related to one or two issues instead of the 10-12 issues I was being treated for with west ern medicine?\". Nothing was helping or alleviating my symptoms and I was getting worse, not better. So, I started seeking answers outside of western medicine. In late 2013, a friend with Lyme disease referred me to my first Naturopathic Doctor (ND). This is the beginning of my journey to getting to the bottom of my deteriorating health that has continued to this day with a naturopathic doctor that I have seen since moving to Virginia. My naturopathic doctor looks at the entire picture of my he alth, not just her specialty, as with a western doctor. This speaks to a NDs specialized skill. She has been able to id entify illnesses and symptoms that are related to food, medications, environmental and other agents almost immediately. Her wide scope of seeing the body as a whole is unique and frankly, the only one I trust over countless western medica l doctors. She sees the whole me and treats me as such. I had a procedure years ago that was causing symptoms of a condi tion I now have under control th at caused me to have to give up my ability to have children. Had I been working with an ND at the time instead of a MD (who took maybe 15 minutes to determine what was going on), I probably would not have had to have the procedure to cure my symptoms. This is critical for people like me who have multiple issues that a MD does not have the time (due to insurance constraints), to work with and address the whole picture of health. 64 2 When moving to Virginia from California, I struggled for months to re-establish my healthcare. This caused my health to decline because I had to not only find a new ND, but also had to find the releva nt doctor to do updated testing and lab work. As you know because NDs are not licensed in Virginia they cannot do physical exams or do lab testing. But in California like other states, NDs can order labs and issue prescriptions so this came as a shock to me that it was so complicated here in Virginia. I had to locate a new endocrinol ogist, PCP, gynecologist, and rheumatologist before I could even just figure out where my health stood. My naturopathic doctor helped refer me to these specialists so that I could be assessed and monitored. But this took months to get th e appointments, testing done from them, and then have my labs returned. Of course, I had to find doctors that would also work with my more holistic treatment of my health conditions which added to the frustration. This, along with the move, set me back 6 months in my recovery and could have easily been avoided if my naturopathic doctor had been allowed to perform to the scope of their training. They could have assisted with my medications, or at least ordering labw ork to be able to adjust care where it was needed. It is imperative that NDs are able to order testing at a minimum for their patients as we ll as physical exams. The complication of getting a western medical doctor to understand why you (or your ND) want a certain test should not be in the way of getting effective care in a timely manner. This de lays care and increases suffering for Virginians. This leads to the third issue that people like me face with their healthcare. The cost. Not only do we have to pay out of pocket for a doctor who is trained holistically (as insurance do es not cover), but we have to pay the costs of appointments and testing with our western medical doctor s as well here in Virginia. This places even more of a financial burden that a person with multiple chronic conditions already faces. It is unnecessary, and in my opinion, discriminatory. Why should I have to face increased costs for the only care that is he lping me? Not a single western medical doctor has prescribed, offered opinions, or diagnoses that have helped me. None. The tens of thousands of dollars that I (and my elderly parents) have had to pay to work to get me better was wasted on pr ocedures, tests, exams, radiology, etc that ultimately did nothing. Licensing naturopathic doctors lowers the costs beca use they are the experts in provide preventative medicine. Additionally, licensing naturopathic doctors is the first step to possible insurance coverage as is in other states. I am pleading for your attention to this ma tter and to bring true holistic and preven tive medicine in Virginia into 2020. Not everyone can benefit from western medicine and the importan ce of licensing and permitting NDs to perform exams and testing would be a game changer. My ND , has done more to help me both fina ncially and health-wise than any western medicine doctor has in the last 7 years. Please pass le gislation for licensure for NDs in the State of Virginia.

I was born and raised here and have been in Virginia for 46 years. I have been seeing naturopathic doctors for nearly 10 years for myself and my family. I was fortunate to find a naturopathic doctor, as I was experiencing many heal th conditions. I had many years of infertility and have suffered with autoimmune problems ever since I was about 34 years of age. I wanted to find a doctor that would not just treat my symptoms. I needed a doctor to look at my whole body (mind, body, and spirit connection) and also dig into my ba ckground. I come from a long line of women in my family having fertility issues al ong with autoimmune problems. I had seen many medical doctors for my health issues and was not receiving any concrete answers as to why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I was miserable because I knew that something was wron g, but no doctor could pin point a problem. I was desperate to find someone to help me. Once I established care, my naturopathic doctor had the ability to help me due to my unique situation and take care of me as a whole person. Naturopathic doctors have a special ability to put many pieces of the puzzle together \u2014 they have specialized skills and training that allows them to see a fuller pi cture. This is what makes them different from other providers. Naturopathic doctors have been able to help me through so me very trying medical issues. I have also had years of stomach pr oblems and with time I've gotten much better from dealing with my stomach issues. I'm very grateful for these doctors because they worked tirelessly to find the answers to my medical mysteries and they continue to help me. They work with my other health providers to address the body as it is ever changing and my pr oblems are also changing. More recently, I've had problems with major anxiety and not being able to sleep. My naturopathic doctor went above and behind to pin point my issues and c oordinate with my PCP. She is working hand in hand with my PCP to make sure I'm getting the necessary care and proper drug therapy, nutrition and supplements. I am doing better but it was a scary time. Having lice nsed naturopathic doctors is common sense because they bring a unique skill to the table to look at pati ents as a whole person and work with those that have not responded to normal therapies in colla boration with the entire medical team. I also have 4 children now and have taken all of my ch ildren to be seen by naturopathic doctors. My son had relentless stomach pains where he was unable able to eat and he had severe anxiety. He wouldn't go to school because he was so anxious which impa cted his social well-being. Through supplements and nutritional support we have seen a tremendous improvement. He is eating now and is not anxious and is a completely different child. I am grateful for the field of naturopathy. I felt st uck and frustrated because I had health struggles that traditional medicine was not able to accommodate. I am so appreciative for this field of medicine 66 50because I have seen first hand through my own health struggles and the health struggles of my family that there is a way to find relief. I ask that the Board provide a recommendation for licensure of naturopathic doctors because they provide unique and specialized skills that provide Virginians a way forward towards improved health.

Sincerely, Natalia Tajibnapis August 8, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Natalia, I have been living in the United States and namely in Virginia for 12 years. I have been seeing a naturopathic doctor for about seven years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically- trained naturopathic doctors.Moving to the United States from overseas wher e I grew up in a small village where my family grows their own food and breathing the freshest air, I experienced multiple physical changes. The change in my diet and my lifestyle caused my body to break down. Coming from a country where even conventional doctors use traditional methods to cure patients due to inaccessibility to medications and their high cost which many people cannot afford-I was surprised to learn that here in the United States when I had issues that could be fixed with diet, lifestyle changes and supplements the physicians prescribed medications as a remedy and had no grasp of basic alternatives. After seeing many types of conventional specialists for many years without any changes, I had to look for alternat ives. The perfect alternative was a naturopathic doctor who analyzes the whole person, takes into account all the aspects of his life and provides an individualized treatment plan. However, in the process of getting well with the help of a naturopathic doctor, was not without stumbling blocks. Only with my commitment and my belief in the particular doctor, I got my health back and the understanding of the causes th at lead to my sicknesses. However, it was time consuming and at a high out of pocket cost, due to lack of insurance coverage (due to lack of licensure of NDs in Virginia). I had to schedu le multiple additional appointments with my primary care provider just to get recommended labs (also due to the lack of licensure of NDs in Virginia). After getting healthy again and gaining my ener gy, mental clarity and clear skin, I had a lot of people asking me how I achieved it. I recommended them my naturopathic doctor. Even though 68 some of my acquaintances are experiencing simi lar to mine and other health issues that cannot be fixed by consulting a conventional practiti oner they are taken aback to see a naturopathic doctor due to the high costs and the fact that they are not licensed.I urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. By being fully licensed, people will gain confidence in their knowledge and guidance, and the process will be a lot easier and at a lower expense.

In this era of chronic disease, many primary healthcare providers are retiring (or moving to other states), and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are specifically trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine and are well equipped to provide medical services. The medically-trained naturopathic doctor can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regu late them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by healt h insurance companies in 6 states. Patients who access care from medically-trained naturopathic doctors expect the same level of regulation and prof essional accountability as the other regulated health professions in Virg inia. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for patients. I respectfully urge the Board to recomm end full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Suzanne McWilliams August 8, 2020 To Whom It May Concern: I want to thank the Board of Health Professi ons for looking at the possible licensure of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Suzanne McWilliams and I se rved as an educator for 40 years in the City of Richmond, Chesterfield County as well as within private education. I have supervised students and other academicia ns. Education is the primary method of science and discovery where academic standa rds are imperative to progress. As an educator, I am keenly aware of the various disciplines that require standardized educational requirements and the importance of accreditation and oversight through the United States Department of Education. I would li ke to touch on two of the \"7 Criteria\" adopted by the DHP to assess various providers: Public safety/potential harm and specialty skills. Licensing naturopathic doctors provides added safety to the public. At this time, there is confusion among consumers, patients and ev en other medical providers of the term naturopathy but more specifically the differ ences between medically trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. These are two distinct and different disciplines and groups of people. They may use similar therapies such as herbal medicine, but they have different training and educational standards. Naturopathic doctors' education is overseen by regional accrediting bodies and individual graduate and medical accrediting bodies that are all recognized by the US Department of Education. Bu t this is not the case for lay naturopaths. The majority of lay naturopaths go through what we may term \"diploma mills\" and thus their education is not recognized by the United Stat es Department of Education. Medically trained naturopathic doctors also undergo basic scie nce examinations after their second year of education and then complete licensing exams similar to MDs and DOs. Continuing medical education hours are also required for naturopathic doctors in order that they remain current in the field of medicine. None of this is the case for lay naturopaths. Thus, for consumer safety and appropriate understanding to the public at large, licensing naturopathic doctors provides transparency of those that have been trained medically versus those that have received a certificate or correspondence coursework. It is important to have choice but it is responsible 71and ethical to provide transparency of these di fferences. Licensure is the only vehicle that provides this level of transparency, safety and professionalism. Licensure for naturopathic doctors should be av ailable because they bring a unique set of skills to the table. They are trained in primary care where they learn physical exams, ordering labs and imaging but they also are experts in bota nical medicine, nutrition and pharmaceuticals. This provides a unique set of skills where they can weave together the best of the multiple medicines we have available today and cater it to each person. They also are based deeply versed in prevention. Their goal is to identi fy imbalances before they become disease. It is for this reason, that I chose to see a naturo pathic doctor - I wanted to remain healthy. At the age 65 years I chose to start training as a tr iathlete. I had been physically fit throughout my life but after working with my naturopathic doctor , I realized there were imbalances in my life that were there without my full knowledge. My health has further improved due to support from my naturopathic doctor. In fact, my sleep is better, as is my energy and I can focus more clearly on the tasks throughout the day. Even my exercise endurance has improved. I see my naturopathic doctor as part of my medical te am and thus they care about all of my regular appointments including ob/gyn and annual exams. They work with my other providers to make sure I am as healthy as possible and to preven t possible setbacks. They are looking out for me and working to keep me healthy now as I just turned 71 years young. We all need someone looking out for us - we want someone being pr oactive to help us be our best selves. It is for this reason that I ask for a recomme ndation from the Board to license naturopathic doctors. I am grateful for all my medical provider s that have helped me stay active and healthy and I hope that others may also be afforded the same care I have receive d .

Thank you so much! Kelli Olson Virginia Department of Health Professionals, I am writing in support of licensure o f naturopathic doctors in the state of Virginia. In 2012, I wa s diagnosed with Graves Disease. My endocrinologist informed me that I had a 10% chance of responding to the medication, otherwise I would need my th yroid irradiated. Being onl y 24 at the time, the prospect of being d ependent on hormones and having the many issues resulting from thyroid problems was distressing, so I sought out a trained naturopathic doctor in Virginia. She was conf ident that my condition could be treated non- invasively, a nd I hav e for many years now been officially in remission with completely no rmal thyroid levels. I have had a healthy pregnancy, w hich is something that may not have been possible otherwise, and I am grateful for my ND's continued care. I believe my stor y add resses several of the key criteria used to evaluate the need for regulation and speaks to the need to license trained naturopathic doctors: It was the specialized skills of my ND, the holistic approa ch th at involved pharmocatherapy, botanical, and nutritional therapies, that my bod y responded to when traditional medicine proved insufficient. I stron gly feel that the scope of practice in Virginia should be broadened for naturopathic doctors so that they can better treat their patients. I consider my ND to be my primar y care doctor, and I b elieve she should be able to perfor m physical exams and re quest labs or imaging. When undergoing tr eatment for my th yroid, it w ould have been benefic ial and convenient for my ND to perform the lab work directly, instead of relying on a separate endoc rinologist. Naturopathic docto rs practice autono mously in all other states, and I suppo rt NDs to opera te and regulate independently in Virgi nia as well. I have the highest respect for the highly qu alified team of NDs that have treated me over the ye ars and I ur ge you to support them so that they m ay provide increasingly more effective medical care in the state of Virginia.

Thank you! Greg Olson Virginia Department of Health Professionals: I am writing to support the licensure and regu lation of Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia. I have been a patient of a ND practice for a year. Primarily, this is helping treat my elevated blood pressure. Due to natural medicine, I am optimistic about getting my blood pressure completely under control without the need of ongoing medication. From my experience, I believe that naturopathic doctors meet many of the criteria used for evaluating the need for regulation. Specialized skills : While many of my ND's recommendations overlap with my primary care (exercise, sleep, diet, etc.), their ability to consider the interactions and combinations of more natural nutritional supplements in addition to my curren t medication is helping me to treat high blood pressure with lower levels of intervention. Autonomous practice : It is my understanding that naturopath ic doctors practice autonomously in all other states, and I would desire and support that naturopathic doctors operate and regulate independently in Virginia as well. Scope of practice : I support the scope of naturopathic doct ors including physical exams and labs. My treatment would be much easier if my ND could administer their own labs, instead of having to back- and-forth with my primary care.

I have been a Virginia resident for nearly 30 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for almost a year. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically- trained naturopathic doctors. Prior to working with Dr. Robert Boyd, I had been struggling with a chronic condition and regular infections due to medical issues and related surgeries I underwent shortly after birth. I was referred to Dr. Boyd by my primary care physician because she believed he might be able to help my condition in ways my M.D. and other specialists had not, over the last 50 years. The advice, science-based nutritional and supplementation guidance, and DNA and biome testing I received from Dr. Boyd revealed aspects of my health condition and treatment options that not only reduced my pain and improved my health, but also informed the care I receive from the rest of my med ical team. One of my specialists was startled to find that some of the anatomical issues where surgery had recently seemed indicated had entirely reversed themselves, such that no surgery was required. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are three concerns I have as it relates to the key criteria. 1. Risk of harm . I have come across \"traditional\" naturopath s who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who offer advice to clients that is neither sc ientifically nor medically-based. Without licensure, you are lumping together medically-trained naturopathic doctors who went to medical school with those who may be offering treatments ranging from silly to inadvisable. I was very fortunate to be referred by my PCP to what I think of as a \"for real\" naturopathic doctor. We need that huge di fference to be reflected with formal licensure. For the sake of public safety, we need the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. 2. Specialized skills . My naturopathic doctor focuses on my health in an entirely different way than the remainder of my medical team. This is why my PCP referred me to him and coordinates with him, and it's why my specialists at both VHC and Johns Hopkins fully support his treatments. It is crucial that I have someone on my team who is specifically trained in dru g-herb and drug-nutrient inte ractions. This likewise relates to criteria 3, Autonomous practice, since my other medical providers do not have the same training and knowledge that Dr. Boyd has in both conventional and natural medicine. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia, so that other residents of the state may receive the life-changing sort of care I have received, with the safety and confidence that licensure provides.

Thanks, ~Dr. Pylypko August 9, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee: I am writing this letter in support of licens ing Naturopathic Doctors (NDs') in Virginia- specifically bill HB 1040 and SB 858. I am a Family Medicine doctor practicing in Ashburn, Virginia, and I have had the fortun ate experience of working with ND 's over the last six years. I found them to be very knowledgeable and helpful to patients and I was grateful that they could provide alternative solutions to medical problems for which traditional approaches had failed. Additionally, while working with ND's I was particularly impressed at their breadth of knowledge regarding the many uses of natural supplements as well as their potential side effects. They ordered the appropriate labs under MD supervision to monitor for adverse reactions and studied the current scientific litera ture to ensure proper dosing and frequency of supplement regimens. I have found medically trained naturopathic doctors extremely competent at working safely and collaboratively with all medical providers. I was reassured that one of the core tenets to their practice includes the 'Do No Harm' policy which guided them to always err on the side of safety in an emerging field where large randomized control trials are sometimes lacking. I was very touched by their commitment to the overall well-being and health of our shared patients and I looked to them as valuable players on our health care team. Moreover, I became comfortable referring patients to ND's after learning about their rigorous four-year degree program. The first two years of their education are dedicated to the medical sciences and include courses in biochemistry, anatomy, pathophysiolog y, and neuroanatomy that are similar in content and length to the courses required for tradit ional medical doctors. During their second two years they undergo systems and population studies (gynecology, cardiology, gastroenterology, geriatrics, etc.) Throughout their training they focus on the application of natural therapies such as bota nical medicine, clinical nutrition, physical medicine and health counseling. Some go on to complete additional training in acupuncture. Additionally, all ND's co mplete a board exam in basic scienc es, and they have the opportunity to complete residencies to further master their practice. They are credentialed by a committee (Council on Naturopathic Medical Education) which is recognized by the US department of Education. Finally, the licensing of naturopathic doctors would allow them to practice within the full scope of their abilities and would provide an immense service to patients. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. I value the critical ro le that ND's play in the field of integrative 7721785 Filigree Court, Suite 100, Ashburn Virginia 20147 medicine and I recognize that they are an essent ial part to our multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. The naturopathy has helped me in healing my gut and instestinal issues tremendously. Most importantly, I don't have to worry about any side effects. Also, following naturopathy has opened a wide opti on of healthy food choices (gluten free, dairy free) that I can incorporate in my diet. As a patient who supports licensu re for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the criteria. I was surprised how much role simple food choices can play in improving one's health. One doesn't have to solely rely on synthetic medicines to treat or cure any illness. There are multitude of healthy and natural options available but a large number of people don't have access to this knowledge. Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient in teractions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine , they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. Economic impact obviously is a concern for most people, including myself. While the benefits of naturopathy are countless, many can't take the advantag e of this knowledge as it is expensive to get consultation with naturopaths. The underlying reason is because naturopaths are not licensed. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. In this era of chronic disease, where it's burden and impact fall disproportionately to the medically underserved, Virginians as well as people from other states need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trai ned naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provid e additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need.

Thank you for your time.Best regards, Jeffrey Weiseman August 9, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,I am personally writing in support of licensing of na turopathic doctors. My name is Jeffrey Weiseman, and I have been under the care of independent naturopathic doctors for just under two years. I am a type 1 diabetic with asymmetric psoriatic arthritis for over fifteen (15) years and I also developedgastrointestinal issues around May 2019 which precipitated symptoms akin to ulcerative colitis.After years of traditional NSAID therapy for my arthritic pain, I engaged a naturopathic doctor and began to implement turmeric supplements as an alternative to long-duration use of NSAIDs. I experienced a very quick response to this supplemen t therapy which resulted in the alleviation of my pain. Due to the success of this alterative therapy, I no longer require NSAIDs to manage mydiscomfort.For my gastrointestinal issues, I consulted both a local endoscopist as part of my routine endoscopyand a naturopathic doctor regarding my gastrointestinal issues. As an alternate to conventionalpharmaceutical therapy suggested by my endoscopist, I was prescribed probiotic supplements and afood allergy test by my naturopathic doctor. The food a llergy test pinpointed several dietary conflicts for which a food strategy was developed to compliment the probiotic therapy. After only six (6) weeksof compliance to the diet restrictions my gastrointestinal issues have been effectively eliminated,although I will continue the dietary guidance for its duration as directed.The standard of care demonstrated by my naturopathic doctors and their ability and willingness towork in conjunction with my traditional medical care givers unequivocally supports that naturopathic doctors are specifically trained and competent in preventative work aimed at restoring health. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and publicsafety. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe health careaccess for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

Sincerely,Kim Villar-Weiseman August 3, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,I am personally writing in support of licensing of naturopathic doctors. My name is Kimberly Villar-Weiseman, and I have been a practicing registered nurse for over 14 years. Approximately seven years ago I was told I needed a hysterectomy to resolvedifficulty with ongoing menorrhagia and uterine fibroids. I visited a naturopathicphysician in Blacksburg, Virginia for a second opinion. Through a combination ofsupplements and dietary changes my bleeding issues greatly improved and I canceledmy hysterectomy. I have worked with other naturopathic physicians in the following years and have always been very happy with my treatment. I have found medically- trained naturopathic doctors extremely competent at working safely and collaborativelywith all medical providers. Naturopathic doctors are specifically trained in preventativework aimed at restoring health. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as theyrelate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathicdoctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework, will provide clarity -while almost promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have receiveddoctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be ableto use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trainedprofessionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and should be held to account 83 by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medicalprofessionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctorsare seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained natur opathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentallydistinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to laynaturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams inbasic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition,botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, incombination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access tospecialized professionals who have experti se in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natur al therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with theirpatients' collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of providershortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care andpreventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained toprovide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help usdeal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronicdisease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as anothersafety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District ofColumbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope oftheir training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) intobordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some levelof insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are notallowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit toinsurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurancecoverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the preventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. 6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 847)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't offer any objective, and doesn't distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe health careaccess for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Kimberly Villar-Weiseman 85 55From: Marisa Schmader Naturopathic Doctors)To: <elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov> in 1040/SB 858 (licensure for medically-trainedNaturopathic Doctors). Best,Marisa Schmader August Dear Members of the Committee,My name is Marisa Schmader, I have been a Virginia resident for 17 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 5 months. I am writing in supportof full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have been seeingnaturopathic doctors to assist with my infertility and have greatly increased the quality ofmy life in a very short period of time. They have taken the time to truly try andunderstand my health and any underlying issues that impact my ability to have abiological baby. Having access to this type of care is vital to addressing the healthneeds that often get overlooked by traditional western medicine. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. Risk of harm. (There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically- trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia). Virginia should elevate it'sstandard of protection and support for its residents to ensure the safety, security and health of its citizens. Specialized skills. (Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice.) This is a huge gap in the healthcare system today. If 86more Americans were to approach their healthcare by considering their entire person, their health and welfare would significantly improve. This type of healthcare support would not only safe lives, but save money. Scope of practice. (Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and ba sic medications. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especiall yf o r mental health support), means that patients are now requiring m ore access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services -- including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti-hypertensives. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states.) It is unclear why Virginia would want to limit the impact these doctors can create in the marketplace. Allowing naturopathic doctors the ability to practice in this manner would ease the burden on an already overtaxed healthcare system. In closing, I strongly urge the Board to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors.

My name is Shelly Clevide nce, and I have been a naturopathic doctor for over fourteen years. I am writin g in support of full licensing for medically- trained naturopathic doctors. \u0003 \u0003 As you know, medically trained naturopathic do ctors are distinct as a group of providers. As a graduate from the National University of Naturopathic Medi cine I took the same basic classes as a traditional medical student. As a licensed naturopathic physician (I hold my license in Vermont) I have completed a national board exam in basic medical sciences, pharmacology, nutrition, botanical and physical medicines. I also complete yearly continuing education to maintain my license. \u0003 \u0003 When I practiced as a primary health care provider in Oregon I was able to provide care for patients and get reimbursed by Blue Cross Blue Shield and other insurance plans. Because I had my own practice I was able to spend the time I needed with patients to answer their questions in a thorough manner. This greatly increases patient compliance and also a patient's sense of responsibility toward their own health. When we understand the reasoning behind our phys iology and the treatments we use, we can engage and support our bodies more effectively. \u0003 \u0003 When I moved to Virginia Beach I was able to support people's health through education on how our bodies work and suggesting nutrition, diet and lifestyle changes. Idefinitely have helped people here. However , not being able to order lab work, diagnose illnesses or prescribe treatments ha s greatly impacted my ability to track their progress and help them. I am trained in giving annual exams, performing minor surgeries, performing intravenous and intramuscular injections to name a few of my skills. I haven't done minor surgeries since finishing medical school but I had been supporting healing using IV therapies when I worked in Oregon. I miss being able to take a thorough physical exam and share and explain my findings. Of course my greatest hurdle in being able to help people obtain optimal health in Virginia is the fact 88that I am not licensed. I have a clear unde rstanding of what is needed to be a competent and effective health care provider but without licensure I have struggled with the frustration of only being able to provide the expertise of a health coach. \u0003 \u0003 I have worked with military clients here in Virginia Beach. They are familiar with naturopathic medicine from being stationed in Washington state and other states where our profession is licensed. They typically are expecting a practitioner who has graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't distinguish between medically -trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purpos es of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopat hic doctors. There is a lay naturopath who practices in Virginia Beach and advertises that she is a naturopathic doctor. I think this is confusing for the consumer and damaging to my medically trained and accredited naturopathic profession. \u0003 \u0003 I believe licensed naturopathic doctors are needed in Virginia, especially in this critical time of provider shortages. We could serve as additional providers to help deal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. One example of where naturopath ic doctors can shine in this state today is with Covid-19. The majority of our nation is overweight or obese. Covid-19 impacts overw eight, obese and diabetic people more severely than healthier people. We are excellent in our training in health optimiza tion and maintenance. We are well trained in prevention and patient education. During this pandemic is the best time to lean in and find effective ways to decrease stress, shed excess weight, reverse metabolic syndromes and optimize our immune system s. A compassionate, patient and skilled health care provider can be instrumental in providing the support and guidance required. Naturopathic doctors provide these skills. \u0003 \u0003 I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure so that medically-trained naturopathic doctors can become licensed and provide additional, safe healthcare access for the state of Virginia. \u0003 89 56From: Anita <agarland@hsc.edu > Date: Mon, Aug 10, 2020 at 8:38 AM Subject: Licensure of Naturopathic Doctors - Letter of Support To: elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov <elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov > 8 August 2020 Dr. Elizabeth A. Carter Executive DirectorVirginia Board of Health Professions Dear Dr. Carter, I am writing in support of the licensure of Naturopathic doctors. I appreciate the opportunity to do so. I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for two years. I went to her practice after having been ill with an upper respiratory probl em for three months, having seen allopathic doctors throughout that time, having been prescribed drugs and other therapies, but having received no relief from my symptoms. I felt that my doctors had given me their best efforts, so Iwanted to pursue another avenue. That pursuit led me to naturopathic medicine. Following the treatment plan of a naturopathic doctor, I was healed of that respiratory problem in a few weeks. I have continued to see that doctor for my general well-being since that time. I am a strong proponent of the work my doctor and the doctors in her practice do. Let me also state that I believe in the value of allopathic medicine and the extraordinary merit \u2014 even the great miracles \u2014of pharmaceutical drugs, yet I do not believe that they are the only way that healing can occur. The knowledge of that and the doctors who espouse it need to become more widespread and available in Virginia. For your purposes, then, I would like to address three of the seven points for licensure of NDs, using my personal experience with my naturopathic doctor as an example. 1.Specialized skills . Prior to my initial meeting with the naturopathic doctor, I filled out a 10-page questionnaire required by her practice detailing my medical history, while also giving reflections on my life and well-being. Then, in the first hour of my two-hour meeting with her, she listened \u2014really listened \u2014as I described other aspects of my life and health. She had a comprehensive v iew of my health like no other medical professional. It was during the second half of our meeting that I found my naturopathic doctor's insight to be extraordinary. She evaluated where I was in my health, why my illness could have persisted as long as it did, what I needed to change to bring my body into balance, and how I might make those changes. She then gave me an extensive 90Personalized Care Plan, which included suppor tive therapies (vitamins and supplements) along with self-care and lifestyle suggestions. I was astounded. I had never had a doctor listen to me in the same way, or take such a holistic approach to my health. This is not to demean the hard-working doctors I have, whose time per patient is tightly-regulated, but rather to proffer that the value of naturopathic medicine can extend beyond the purview of what may be possible by allopathic medicine and enhance it. 2.Scope of practice . At our initial meeting, my naturopathic doctor wanted to evaluate past and present results from my laboratory testing with my other physicians. However, since she could not order those tests, I had to request them from my allopathic doctor,which took time from that doctor for a perfunctory request. That was regrettable andfurther extended the length of time between appointment and outcomes. My naturopathic doctor, like any allopathic doctor, was able to come to conclusions regarding my care by listening to the description of my symptoms. Sherecommended supportive therapies to aid in my recovery. If she had had more flexibility in the scope of her care, she could have gi ven me an appropriate physical exam and, if warranted, prescribed pharmaceutical drugs. The breadth of the medical service that an N.D. is qualified to provide through their training and education is hampered by th e current restrictions on their practice. Licensing would allow them the opportunity to more comprehensively treat those under their care. 3.Economic impact . The burden on our current medical establishment is overwhelming. I do not know how the profession is holding up, especially given the added weight of the COVID crisis. To give you one example\u2014last year I was having another medical issue for which I saw my naturopathic doctor. She suggested that I see a specialist in that field. However, my naturopathic doctor could not be the referring doctor for a specialist, so I went to my allopathic doctor, who examined me, and then referred me to the specialist. (So, two appointments instead of one.) I called the specialist's office in October 2019. I was not able to get an appointment until the following May 2020. Due to this lag in time, my naturopathic doctor was proactive in helping me with my symptoms with supportivetherapies. She was working with the best tools she had, given limited resources because of the lack of licensing. Thankfully, within a few months my symptoms began abating.By the time I went to the specialist, my symptoms were slight. His advice was, \"Continue what you are doing.\" So, I have continued my supplements and my treatment through my naturopathic doctor, which are keeping me stable. Fortunately, I was in the financial position to receive \u2014and had the knowledge to seek\u2014medical advice from another doctor outside traditional medicine. That doctor was able to treat me and to find a resolution for me, and I was able to pay her. I am not quite sure what I would have done with this medical condition for 7 months until the specialist could see me had I not had my naturopathic docto r. The worry alone would have cost me a great deal of mental stress. Too, the condition may have gotten even worse than it was. All others need to be aware of and have the same opportunity that I have had to receive this level of care from a licensed professional. 91 I could write a great deal more about my experience with this exceptional N.D. \u2014from detailing the oasis of serenity in her office, which takes you to the happiest of places in your mind, to the friendliness and professionalism her staff, which make you feel better just walking in the door \u2014 but I am sure you have many other letters to read. I hope my brief descriptions above give support to your study. I see licensing Naturopathic Doctors as only a win-win for the medical profession and for the citizens of our great Commonwealth. I hope that the Commission and the General Assembly agree. Their approval would be the greatest medical benefit that the people of Virginia couldreceive. Sincerely yours, Anita H.

In my experience, they have always worked with my family doctor in bridging the gap in care, an d in fact, my doctors have always relied on their additional expertise. Scope of practice and economic impact. Many times I have wanted to see just my ND, but was required to see an additional do ctor, since certain tests, etc require that authorization. This is a time and money burden for me personally, and overall reduces access of other patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage, which would further ease the overall economic burden for many.

I feel grateful to have found a practice that has providers that are educated in both the conventional medical model and Naturopathic Medicine. To boot, Dr. Hollon is likable, relatable and has the ability to relay medical concepts to lay people so that they can understand it better. That has been my experience in the 8 mo nths that I have been a patient at Richmond Natural Medicine. I started seeing Dr. Hollon because I was getting al most no relief from the anxiety, sleep issues and digestive troubles that I was experiencing for about a decade. I was told by numerous primary care doctors in the 15 minutes that they allotted me, to take an SSRI, not watch screens at night and take more laxatives. Needless to say, these \"interventions\" did nothing to address the root of my issues. Finally, I decided to schedule an intake session with Richmond Natural Medicine. After our two-hour intake, I was blown away. We reviewed family history, chronicled the symptoms I was experiencing, re viewed diet and lifestyle habi ts extensively and Dr. Hollon thoroughly explained blood work that a convention al doctor had previously order, but had never taken the time to explain to me. As Primary Care Doctors become increasingly overwhelmed, the amount of time that is allotted for each visit and the quality of the attention given to each patient is diminishing in my opinion. Richmond Natural Medicine take s the polar opposite approach. Richmond Natural Medicine and other Naturopathic Doctors are not a luxury. They are a necessity. They fulfill a need that is expanding by the day in our society. The mind and body are not disconnected, as we all know by now. The dividing line between the two is completely arbitrary, just as the dividing line between \"human\" and \"nature\" is completely arbitrary. Naturopathic doctors take this into account and it is often the missing link in addressing lifelong symptoms that some of us experience. Physical exams, imaging, labs, these all should be at the disposal of Naturopathic doctors. Coverage for those that cannot afford it could ch ange the quality of life for countless people. Please utilize any influence that you have to help these practices do their work more effectivelyand effectively. Encourage your colleagues to do the same. Your actions will make a difference. I wrote this letter because I feel this strongly about this issue. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns.

While my experience may be solely limited to my personal care with my naturopathic doctors, the impact on my life has been profound. So much so that I have encouraged loved ones, friends, colleagues, my hairdresser, and even people I've met while running errands to make an appointment with her. My personal journey with my naturopathic docto r began in 2013 in the months following the loss of my mom. I sought naturopathic care because conventional medicine wasn't working for my depression. I felt defeated. After my first appointment with my naturopathic doctors, however, I left feeling full of hope and promise for my future. I realized that I was exactly where I needed to be. In the months and years that have followed, her wisdom has supported me through a cancer diagnosis, thyroid and hormone issues, trauma, and indescribable loss. The scope of her healing has gone far beyond natural pharmacology. Never have I been to a more thoughtful, compassionate, knowledgeable doctor, nor have I ever felt so genuinely cared about by a medical professional. My only regret is that I didn't seek a naturopathic doctor's services sooner so that my mom, who suffered from severe fibromyalgia, could have benefited from her naturopathic, whole body approach to wellness. It may be too late to help my mom, but I am taking the opportunity to voice my suppor t so that people with chronic illnesses who are forced to live in a fog of opioids and other narcotics could be one step closer to gaining access to alternative means of pain management. Additionally, with the current pandemic and primary care physician shortages across the Commonwealth, it is more important than ever to embrace the opportunity to have more doctors. We also live in an area that is heavily saturated by military families and individuals relocating to Virginia from states with already licensed naturopathic doctors. Thereby, it's imperative to discern bona fide naturopathic doctors from lay healers, consultants, etc. to alleviate confusion and minimize the risk of harm. Naturopathic medicine and the knowledge, trainin g, and skills of my naturopathic doctor have changed my life for the better. It is wit hout hesitation that I wholeheartedly support the licensure and regulation of Virginia's naturopath ic doctors so that others may benefit the way I have. Thank you for your time and consideration in this very important endeavor.

As a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and someone who has faced difficult health challenges, I believe that it is important to provide licensure for Naturopathic Doctors with the necessary medical training to provide a necessary level of health care to all Virginians. There currently exists a Risk of Harm for th ose people searching for alternative answers to medical challenges. I personally spent more than seventeen years attempting to identify the cause of different medical co nditions. Prescription medicine would give some relief, but they then affected my body in other ways. After multiple failed therapies, I was told by doctors that there was no known cause for my condition and that I would have to live with the issues. I searched for alternative medicines but had no idea how to know if those advertising their serv ices were really trained or if they simply read a book and decided to try to help others. I did a lot of research before finding a Naturopathic Doctor who had the medical training and years of experience to help me. We were able to identify environmental and food issues that were affecting me and adjust my treatments, in tandem with my primary care physician in order to find the answers. It has now been more than two years since I have had to take the prescription drugs to help me live with my condition. My concern is that if I had called one of the many people trying to provide holistic medical advice without being properly trained and licensed, I may not have found the answers that I need. In fact, I might have been harmed. I have encouraged others who face the same frustrations with mysterious illnesses or those simply trying to lead a lifestyle to prevent il lness instead of treating it after the fact. Many of them have been confused by the number of people out there in the community and on social media claiming that they can help. Of course, I recommend my doctor if they live nearby, but every time I speak to someone they reply that the Economic Impact for them is just too much. Naturopathic medicine is simply not an option for them due to the fact that in Virginiathese services are not covered. Actually, my brother and his wife wanted to relocate to Virginia after receiving an exciting job offer from an employer in the state. However, my sister-in-law is currently receiving health care from a Naturopathic Doctor in Connecticut. One of the biggest factors in them not accepting the job was because the Naturopathic Doctors here in the Commonwealth are not currently licensed. She was very surprised to learn this and they decided that they would not choose to live in Virginia. Decisions like this have to affect the economy of the Commonwealth ofVirginia.

I was born in Virg inia and have lived in the Commonwealth all my 51 years. I have been under the care of a Naturopathic Doctor for over 6 years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically trained Naturopathic Doct ors because my ND saved my life. She advised my then new MD on certain tests to run and discovered underlying causes that my previous MD had missed for years. She truly listened to me. She was the only doctor who did. My ND was my second opinion doctor that so many MD advise us to get. Below are two specific reasons why, as a patient, I am in full support of licensure for Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia. Specialized skills : Naturopathic doctors consider the patient' s health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As Naturopathic doctors are both extensively trained in both conventi onal approaches and natural medicine, they help to bridge the gap that exists between conventional and tr aditional medicine practice. This specialized skill benefits me as a patient. It allows me to discuss what drug options are most beneficial to treat my condition and provides me with confidence that I am doing what is best for my body. Economic impact: Licensing medically trained Naturopathic Doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage which would provide an additional option for patients to get treated. Currently, medically trained Naturopathic Doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. As chronic diseases continue to rise, this burden and the impact fall disproportionally to the medically underserved especially considering many pr imary care providers are retiring thus creating a shortage of physicians. As a lifelong Virginian, we need increased access to preventative healthcare services that medically trained Naturopathic Doctors are more than capable of providing. Licensing medically trained Naturopathic Doctors w ill provide additional, safe healthcare access for patients of all walks of life. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Beverly Sheffield Leesburg, Virginia Mon, Aug 10, 2020 at 3:21 PM Subject: Naturopathic Doctor Licensing To: elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov Aug ust 7, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Cindy York, I have been a Virginia reside nt for 39 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for 5 years. After a 10-year stru ggle with various health difficulties and seeking care from primary care and specialist doctors, with temp orary remission of symptoms at best, I sought out the care of a medically trained naturopathic doctor. After making the prescribed lifestyle and specific nutritional changes, my symptoms significantly dimi nished within a 6-week period of time. I am delighted to say that as of today, 5 years later, my symptoms have not returned. For perspective, I was a middle-aged, full-time employed, \"healthy\" endurance runner prior to my decl ine to a barely able to climb a set of stairs, 16-hour work week employee. I believe it was the education and training that is unique to medically trained naturopathic doctors, and not the incompetence of previous healthcare practitioners that has provided my amazing long-term health turn-around. As a patient who supports licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors, I do have a few concerns as it relates to their lack of licensing. 1) I see my medically trained naturopathic doctor specifically because she is extensively trained in both conventional and natural medicine, thus pr oviding substantial long-term holistic results that I have not been able to achieve through other medical providers alone . However, when seeking the care of a naturopathic doctor th ere is no compass for knowing if a particular \"doctor\" is professionally trai ned and educated. I believe there needs to be standards and accountability as with other health professionals. 2) Additionally, it is an added burden that I must make separate appointments with a primary care physician to have basic labs (CBC or COVID-19), imaging, or a physical exam. Medically trained naturopathic doctors could competently provide me with these basic health care services. 3) Finally, it would be my hope that licensing me dically trained naturopathic doctors would be the next step to insurance coverage. The synergistic preventive care that medically trained naturopathic doctors are equipped to provide is a cost-effective approach to health care and patience should be afforded the opportunity to use our health insurance benefits to subsidize the cost. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Burma Klein, I have been a Virginia resident for 40 years and under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over one year. I am 75 years old. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, which would allow them to offer physical exams, order lab tests and cat scans, and write prescriptions, which I have to get through my primary health plan. I want them recognized as primary care providers. Traditional medicine has let me down. All they do is prescribe anti-biotics, which I find difficult to recover from. My naturopath doctor suggests supplements that work much better for me. Here's why I support licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors: Naturopathic doctors, with their specialized skills, consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, can prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by crea ting additional access for patient s. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Licensing medically-trai ned naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients who seek their help . I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Burma Klein Falls Church, VA Aug 10, 2020 at 3:55 PM Subject: letter in support of full licensure for NDs To: elizabeth.carter @dhp.virginia.gov August 9, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,My name is Elizabeth Rodriguez, I have been a Virginia resident for 45 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 20 years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors. I have had several health issuesthat were never taken seriously or addressed with any real advice or protocols from traditional medical doctors. These medical issues have included insomnia, anxiety, unexplained weight gain, knee pain, hair loss, mild depression as well as chronic andpersistent stye infections. I sought help from MDs and specialists who were coveredunder my medical insurance but after being exhausted and frustrated with no resolutionfor these conditions for which I sought help I turned to a naturopath for a secondopinion. These visits were successful in that I always received a thorough evaluation, arecommended regime and ultimately a resolution. I paid out of pocket every time to getrelief for these issues in order to take care of my physical and emotional well-being. If Ihadn't followed the advice of a naturopath, I wouldn't have been able to solve any of these issues. The advice I was given by traditional doctors included suggestions to stopdrinking caffeine for insomnia or a hot compress and washing my eyes more frequentlyfor my stye condition, it was frustrating to be given advice that was basically no more than what I would have received with a simple google search. Naturopathic medicine has significantly improved my quality of life. As someone who has been in support of licensure for naturopathic doctors, here are a some of my concerns: First off, there are practitioners who call themselves naturopathic doctors who have not attended naturopathic medical school. This is extremely confusing, misleading and even risky for the public. We need to know what type of practitioner we are seeing. With more and more people tuning into holistic methods- the demand as you know, has increased considerably in recent years - there needs to be a level of transparency in this arena. This will prevent harm and ensure that constituents are clear about the type of provider that they are accessing. Right now in Virginia, licensable naturopathic doctors can't perform physical exams, or order labs or imaging - they cannot not even test for COVID-19. There is a shortage ofprimary care providers in Virginia, and m edically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need foradded appointments. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave 117 63the road to insurance coverage. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use the codes needed to gain access to insurance coverage. We are living in a time of chronic disease, and the burden and impact fall on those who are underserved. All Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained to provide. Through licensure of medically-trained naturopathic doctors, Virginians will have added access to safe healthcare. I urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.Sincerely, Elizabeth Rodriguez Elizabeth Rodriguez 118From: Neva Morrison, LCSW <neva@sweetgrasstherapy.com> Date: Mon, Aug 3:59 PM Subject: Support letter To: <elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov August 10, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,I am personally writing in support of licensing of naturopathic doctors. My name is Neva Morrison, LCSW, and I have been in private practice as a mental health therapist forover 5 years. I am Board Certified in Social Work. I have worked with several naturopathic doctors in Virginia, one in Richmond, one in Middleburg and one in Fredericksburg. I would have loved to have been able to easily distinguish who isproperly trained from who is not, and licensing I feel is necessary to protect those of usseeking a naturopathic doctor. I have found medically-trained naturopathic doctorsextremely competent at working safely and collaboratively with all medical providers.Naturopathic doctors are specifically trained in preventative work aimed at restoringhealth. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as theyrelate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathicdoctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework,will provide clarity -while almost promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have receiveddoctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be ableto use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trainedprofessionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and should be held to accountby a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentallydistinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to laynaturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctorscomplete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams inbasic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition,botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, in 119 combination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access tospecialized professionals who have experti se in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand theinteractions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with theirpatients' collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of providershortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care andpreventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained toprovide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help us deal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as anothersafety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited,and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closestlocalities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District ofColumbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope oftheir training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) intobordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some levelof insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are notallowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking availablecare -- are unable to access the preventative medical services that naturopathicdoctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. 6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't offer any 120objective, and doesn't distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe health careaccess for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I have been under the care of a naturopa thic doctor for over 2 years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. Now, as a M aryland resident, I can access licensed naturopathic doctors and get my visits reimbursed by insurance but because my naturopathic doctor is based in Virginia, where there is not yet licensing, they are unable to properly code my visits, so I am unable to access insurance coverage, which creates additional out of pocket costs for my preferred form of healthcare; not to mention theadditional time and coor dination required. As a patient who supports licensure fo r medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Risk of harm. There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the diffe rence between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licen sed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically-trained naturopathic doctor(s). A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virg inia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. Th ere is risk of harm in all medical professions. While medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low ri sk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as other regulated health pr ofessions in Virginia. I believe this so strongly not only for the continuity of care, but also for patients like myself who choose to take this path for care to ensure we have doctors with the appropriate level of oversight and accountability. 2) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. This has been the biggest game changer for me in my search for proper care. T he training my naturopath has received has made a monumental difference in my care. However, without licensing, naturopathic doctors are unable to: perform physical exams, order labs, order any pharmaceuticals, or order imaging - even though they are well trained to provide these healthcare staples. This creates extra expense for me, the patient, because then I am forced to schedule additional appointments with other doctors for these services rather than have \"one stop\" shopping with my naturopath. Outside of a financial constraint (I pay way more out of pocket), there is always the potential in communication breakdown between myself, the licensed physician and the naturopath which could easily result in incorrect testing or procedures. Bottom line, I should not have to serve as the go-between for medical professionals, because of the limited licensing for naturopaths. And naturopaths should not have to pull double duty by intervening between multiple healthcare providers for their patients. The licensing practices in Virginia should evolve to support the health and needs of patients. The lack of licensing limits my choice for my preferred form of healthcare. Naturopathic doctors a re specialists in prevention using the foundational approaches of lifestyle and natural medicine - which is i nherent to their training and essential for addressing the epidemic of chronic disease we have in the United States. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide addit ional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommen d full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I have been seeing my naturopathic doctor for 7 years. She has not only helped me through rough patches in my health and wellness journey but educated me on creating a better environment for my mind and body and for my family as well. One of my many reasons for visiting my naturopathic doct ors has been due to suffering with anxiety issues all my life. I continue to take prescribed medications. Sh e has addressed all the side effects and their possible complications. Through her assistance we realized that hormonal aspects were also impacting my anxiety. The risk of harm by not licensing ND 's is scary to me. People need to have access to naturopathic doctors for their health and well-being. With my naturopathic doctor's sp ecialized skills she has been able to help me with my hormonal imbalances which were contribu ting to my anxiety. I feel so much better because of her continued care and concern. Dr Hollon has also helped my 2 daug hters with food sensitivities, digestive issues and their monthly periods. Without her vast expertise and knowledge we would only be able to rely on MD's treatments; however, I feel MD's don't look at the whole picture. Naturopathic doctor s have the ability to look at the holistic picture of each person. I would hope the scope of work by ND's could be broadened and supported so we could have lab work done like physical exams, basic CBC and other te sting as they do in other licensed st ates. The work done by naturopathic practitioners offers a different perspective to the allopa thic medicine practiced by most medical professionals in America. The public should be given the opportunity to make considered choices in meeting their medical needs in a variety of sanctioned ways.

I would specifically like to address the criterion of Risk of Harm. I have used naturopathic doctors several times since the 1990's, in several states, as a complement to allopathic medicine and ha ve found it most useful. I would like to share with you the most recent issue, which has brought me again to a naturopathic doctor. In 2007 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was found to have a BRCA mutation that made my chance of recurrence or a second breast cancer quite high. Having lo st family members to this disease, I opted to have a bilateral mastectomy. I had done all I c ould to reduce my risk, I lost weight, I changed my diet, and exercised regularly. Unfortunately, this is not 100% effective in pre vention and in 2019 I received a second breast cancer diagnosis, unrelated to my first diagnosis.At this point, I was well educated in breast cancer tr eatment and side effects from treatments. As much as I knew, I needed help to coordinate the management of my side effects and to make sure the supplements I was taking were the right ones given my health conditions. That is when I began to utilize the services of a naturopathic doctor again. I had asked my radiologist oncologist what supplements I could take during my course of 33 radiation treatments. I had been taking several prior to my treatment, and she said it was ok to take most of them. However, my naturopathic doctor took me off most of th em and put me on a different regimen during my treatment time that was relatively simple. My doctor and nurses were amazed at how well my skin did through treatment, as it wasn't the norm. As I moved on to recovery from radiation, and began my 5-year treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, I relied on my naturopathic doctor to help me de velop a plan to deal with the after affects of treatment and side effects of the aromatase inhibitor. My plan has been shared with my medical oncologist who has been quite supportive of my treatment and willing to work with my naturopathic doctor. Having this option has greatly helped to heal my whole body. I am confident in the knowledge of my naturopathic doctor, as I know she has had appropriate training. But I have had to rely on my own research to make sure of this. Regulation of naturopathic doctors ca n only serve to ensure that doctors are licensed and practicing safely and appropriately, and it has my full support. Thank you, Susan Siegel 2524 Straw Bridge Chase ERichmond, VA 23233 129 66From: Cla ra Sartor <c.sartor@scnm.edu> Date: Aug 10, 2020 at 4:58 PM Subject: Public Comment/BHP Study Letter August 10 th, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in the great state of Virg inia. My name is Clara Sartor and I have been a naturopathic medical student for the past 2 years. I was born and raised in Virginia, have a sister finishing her MD residency in North Carolina, and plan to return to the East Coast to practice when I graduate. I am writing to you today in support of fully licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I was starting my medical journey following a traditional allopathic route, majoring in pre-med, and preparing for the MCATs when I discovered naturopathic medicine. I had struggled with insomnia and chronic back pain since I was a child, and while I had tried numerous allopathic doctors and specialists, the only modalities that helped me were acupuncture and herbal supplements. Growing up in Virginia, I never had access to a naturopathic doctor. I didn't even know this me dicine existed or that it had been what had helped me when other branches of medicine had failed. Naturopathic medicine is not only effective, but it can treat a variety of conditions given that a naturopathic doctor is trained as a primary care provider. As my sister complete s her residency in family medicine, also for primary care, it has never become clearer to the both of us the need for primary care physicians on both a national and global scale and the plac e naturopathic medicine and medically-trained naturopathic doctors have in the healthcare industry. To Prevent Risk of Harm to the Consumer: Undoubtedly the most important reason for licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors is to prevent the risk of harm to the pa tients and public. The general public is unaware of the difference in levels of education, training, and clinical experience between a medically- trained naturopathic doctor and a lay naturopath . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors must graduate from an accredited naturopathic medica l school, requiring two yea rs of basic sciences including anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology am ong other subjects followed by two years of clinical training, similar to the education of a medical doctor. Additionally, a certain number of patient contact hours must be met and the naturopathic student most pass numerous examinations by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners on structure and function, disease and disorder, pharmacology, nu trition, botanical ther apies, and physical medicine in order to receive their degree. This is of course on top of the pre-requisites needed to enter admission into the naturopathic medica l school. Furthermore, the medically-trained naturopathic doctor must keep up with their license by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education via continued education courses. I'm sure you were already aware of the ri gor of training and regulations set by numerous factions to ensure a naturopathic medical doctor stays up to date and certified; so 130why mention them? At present in Virginia, lay naturopaths may use the term \"naturopathic doctors\" without having gone through that medica l training or regulation. We ask for licensure and regulatory framework to provide clarity to the patients, which at present is lacking, as it is confusing to the public that non-medically trai ned naturopaths may use the term \"naturopathic doctor\". More concerningly, it poses a great threat to patients as non-medically trained naturopaths do not have a medical degree or the training as that of a medically-trained naturopathic doctor. Only medically-trained natu ropathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\" and they should be held ac countable by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical prof essionals, and it is accountability that medically- trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. Economic Impact: The econ omic impact of licensing medically -trained naturopathic doctors is both essential and beneficial to practitioners and pati ents. The demand for primary care physicians has been increasing for years and it has never been truer than with the COVID-19 pandemic. Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors, and thus primary care physicians, in Virginia, which will give patients increased ac cess and decreased costs. Naturopathic medical doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scop e of their training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are currently being driven to put their financial resources into bordering jurisdictions. This resonates with me on both levels as I did not have access to a naturopathic medical doctor as a pe diatric patient, and I desire the opportunity to come back to my home state after receiving my degree to practice fully. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are no t allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the pr eventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to prov ide. This particularly impacts the elderly, the patient population whom I most want to help, yet whose incomes, often fixed, do not allot for the fees of uninsured health care. The elderly population, as well as the general public, often faces medical concerns such as chronic pain , just an example of a malady which the naturopathic medical community is so equipped to treat. If licensed, insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid could help cover these services providing natural and effective forms of medical treatment to the community. Specialized Skill and Training: Naturopa thic doctors have an array of tools to treat conditions on both the preventative and intervention levels of action. Regarding COVID-19, naturopathic doctors help with the preventative aspects in both immune health as well as with the prevention of the comorbidities, such as Diabetes Mellitus and ca rdiovascular disease, that put individuals at higher risk of catching and dying from the disease. One of our natural therapeutics is intravenous (IV) vitamin C, which is now being used by medical doctors including accredited, allopathic schools such as Eastern Virginia Medi cal School (EVMS) where my sister earned her 131 MD degree. At EVMS, protocols are in place for oral Vitamin C as both a prophylactic, preventative measure as well as IV use at high er dosages for those experiencing severe COVID- 19 symptoms. Licensing naturopathic medical doctors is essential for these proven, effective natural remedies to be made more available to the public. In conclusion, I hope you find that licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors is essential for patient protection from those lacking medical training and for public health so that Virginians may have access to affordable, effective naturopathic treatment options. As a Virginia native, my desire is to come back to my home state and provide patients with the care and treatment options that were never made ava ilable to me as a child but that helped me significantly so much so that I wanted to become that kind of doctor myself. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will prov ide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. For all of these reasons, I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Thank you.

My name is Mary Lynne Schmohl, and I was diagnosed with anaplastic ependymoma of my spine 2.5years ago. Prior to my diagnosis, I was in and out of the ER with various things related to my cancer, felt exhausted all the time, and was having a lot of stomach issues. Even once I had my diagnosis, I needed a lot of supplemental support for surgery, radiation,and every day to feel more normal. My naturopathic doctor helped supplement meappropriately during treatment to feel healthy, while communicating with my medicalteams at NIH and the University of Maryland Proton Treatment Center to make sure thatthere would be no counter-interaction with my treatments. I had appropriate testingdone through my naturopathic doctors to understand my stomach issues, and my NDhelped me build a plan to decrease my exhaustion. I have found medically-trainednaturopathic doctors look at the patient more holistically and make the experience moreseamless working collaboratively and safely with medical providers to make sure that Ihave the right support in whatever period of treatment (or non-treatment) that I am in.Naturopathic doctors are specifically trained in preventative work aimed at restoringhealth. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as theyrelate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathicdoctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Licensure will provide clarity -while promoting safety and access to patient desired care. At present, lay naturopathsare able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to laynaturopaths and other medical providers. The COVID-19 pandemic, incombination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access tospecialized professionals who have experti se in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand theinteractions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 133 673)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with their patients' collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect this. In this critical time of provider shortages,Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care andpreventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained toprovide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help usdeal with the crises related to pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental healthillness. They work collaboratively with all providers. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia. There are a number of naturopathic doctors that travel to DC orMaryland in order to provide care which detracts from our local economy. 6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. Currently, there resources are limited which includes submitting a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, or filing a lawsuit. But it doesn't protect others from future harm. These alternatives are inadequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. Registration in the State of Virginia has decreased in its usage and is not adequate when you are referring to medically trained providers. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe health careaccess for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I was always reluctant to use naturopathic treatments on my own. In the past few years my Family Doctor has become certified in Functional Medicine which helped break down my apprehensions. Then, two and a half years ago I developed a very serious and painful autoimmune condition and I finally turned to a medically-trained naturopathic doctor. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. As I have experienced my own care and treatment under a Naturopathic Doctor I have learned much about the profession that speaks to the seven criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors. I address two below: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework, will provide clarity -while promoting safety and access to pa tient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be as sured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and 135 training. All medically-trained professionals pose some possible risk of harm, and should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medical training of naturopathic doctors provides distinct skills that are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. Naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medi cal program, and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies and they understand the interactions betweenpharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. The other points under consideration are all important. I will confine my input to the above two. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe health care access for the Commonwealth. It will be good for the profession, for our State and for our citizens. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I have been a patient of a naturopathic doctor in Richmond since September 2013. The purpose for me finding a naturopathic doctor in 2013 was because I was coming off of hormones, had severe hyper thyr oid issues, and my blood pressure was dangerously high. I was at my wits end as I had been to several doctors and tried a host of blood pressure and other medicines that my body could not process which was manife sted in allergic reactions. My doctors had nothing else to offer me and so this is when I tur ned to a naturopathic doctor. The good news is that our work together was successful where my body was able to reset and stabilize. Over the years my naturopathic doctor has worked in partnership with al l of my doctors which included my primary care doctor, endocrinologist, gynecologist, and ca rdiac specialist to provide the right natural therapies for me. I continue to see my naturopa thic doctor today and I am 66 years old and in very good health. I don't think that my health would be as good without access to naturopathic medicine. Establishing a responsible licensing framework for the practi ce of naturopathic medicine in Virginia is a strong promotion of patient access to safe and quality healthcare of their choi ce. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) are medically-trained and educated prof essionals who are well-qualified to help meet the growing demand for expanded options in heal thcare and the much needed options in heal thcare. They are able to find alternatives for those that don't respond to typical therapies and serve a niche in our current medical system. Licensing naturopathic doctors fosters increased safety by providing transparency to the public and other medical providers. More specifically, licensing naturopat hic doctors is the only way to adequately distinguish medically trained naturopathic doctors from lay provid ers or lay naturopaths. Without this measure of transparency and public knowledge- it provides confus ion between the two. This impacts safety and the professional standards of medicine. As you are most likely aware, naturopathic doctors are tr ained in primary care but are unable to work to the full scope of their training within Virginia. In other stat es they work autonomously where they can to perform physical exams, labs or run imaging. Naturopathic doctor s should be able to work within our state as they do in almost half the country. I have a good team of doctors and I am grateful for each of their support. In my case it took my naturopathic doctor and my traditional doctors to ge t me to the best possible outcome. I am strongly in support of licensing naturopathic doct ors and hope that you will give your support as well. Please let me know if I can answer any questions or provide additional information.

McDyre <mcdyre@comcast.net> Date: Mon, 8:27 support of liscensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors To: elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov August 3, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Margaret McDyre, I have been a Virginia resident for 20 years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. Recently, I started seeing a naturopathic doctor to help find natural solutions to a few of my medical problems '. After my initial appointment my naturopathic doctor suggested a short list of medical tests that would be beneficial for me to have done, to see if thesupplements they think I need (by the symptoms I have), would be a good option forme. They do not want me to take the supplements if the symptoms I am presenting areactually a medical condition, not a lack of a nutrient in my body. When I went to mymedical doctor for my annual physical, I discussed with her the list of tests that thenaturopathic doctor suggested, and she refused to write an order for me to get some ofthem, even after I said I would pay out of pocket out of them, and would not need to gothrough insurance. I explained the reasoning behind the tests and she said she was notcomfortable writing the order and would not do it. When I went back to my naturopathic doctor, they explained that they were not able to write an order for medical tests in the state of Virginia. To say I was surprised by this is an understatement! I am not interested in replacing my medical doctor, just supplementing and accentuating my medical 'tools' in my toolbox, to speak metaphorically. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power and allows one to make so und and logical decisions regarding their life and their health. Currently, I feel as thought my hands are tied and I am unable toget the best medical care possible, as my natu ropathic doctor is limited in their abilities to best assess my personal needs. I am not upset with my medical Doctor's unwillingness to sign the order, but I do feel like her lack of understanding andknowledge of the naturopathic way's has made her a bit shortsighted. I would assume many medical doctors feel this way, which in turn is detrimental for the overall healthand well-being of the patient. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Please take serious consideration on allowing naturopathic doctors to have licensure in the state of Virginia. It will only allowfor choices for your residents. Sincerely,Margaret McDyre 138 On Mon, Aug 10, 2020 at 8:44 PM Cassady Morris < Cassady.Morris@nunm.edu > wrote: August 10, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,Thank you for your thorough work regarding regula tion of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Cassady Morris and I am wr iting to you as a current naturopathic medical student in my 3 rdyear at the National University of Natural Medicine, known as NUNM, in Portland, OR. I grew up in McLean, Virginia a nd was born in Alexandria, VA. I am writing in support of full licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors.By establishing licensure for naturopathic doctors in the state of Virginia, not only would patients benefit from the modalities in which NDs are trained but those patients that want a more directed and supported health plan can choose to work with an ND to provide effective support and education desired by the patient. Confident that their ND is providing the best and most effective scope of practice that they are trained to offer and without having to make unnecessary appointments with other providers for basic needs. If NDs were recognized in the state of Virginia, there is no doubt in my mind that majority of my friends, family, and neighbors would seek out their care. As a naturopathic medical student that studied biochemistry in my undergraduate, and at the age of 13 planned on attending physician assistant school, I do believe I can speak to the legitimacy of the four-year graduate-level program NDs undertake. Prior to coming to medical school, I worked for a top doctor based out of Vienna, VA with a concierge practice that focused heavily on individualized medical treatments. While working for this internal medical doctor, I helped research and generate recommendations for specific health aliments that were provided in detailed reports to patients. With the different modalities that naturopathic doctors are trained in that align with evidence-based medicine, I believe the healthcare system and care provided to patients would greatly increase focus on treating underlying conditions, that is chronic illnesses, and allow patients to get individualized care if NDs were licensed and allowed a regulated scope of practice. In hopes of potentially moving back East after gra duating, it would be a dream to be able to work as an equal healthcare partner in an integrativ e medical office that could allow multiple medical providers to serve the health needs and desires of each patient. In addition, with the years and hours spent in my education, and the amount of debt that is accumulated in medical school, I strongly desire to be able to use the titling a nd credentials of being a Naturopathic Doctor, after my name, and have them be as meaningful in Virgin ia as they are in licensed states. Naturopathic doctors' study both an intense curriculum and tak e two standardized exams to be eligible for licensure. (The first taken after the first two year s of basic biomedical sciences for a half-day, and the second taken after graduation for three da ys on the clinical sciences.) Using the title, \"Naturopathic Doctor\" should relay to the public that the individual has undergone this rigorous training and education, and patients should have confidence that the person they are choosing for their care is able to provide the specialized attention and healthcare needed, with as little red tape as possible. 139Currently, there are 82 students at the various ac credited naturopathic medical schools that have expressed interest practicing in Virginia after graduation. I request the Board to recommend licensure for medically-trained NDs, and I know other ND medical students and recent graduates are submitting written comment in support of licensure as well. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven cr iteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1.Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medic ally-trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework, will provide clarity - while also promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopat hic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doct oral degrees from federally-recognized accred ited programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trained professionals pose some degree of risk of harm and should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trai ned naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2.Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doc tors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19pandemic, in combination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have exper tise in prevention. Na turopathic doctors are experts in their field relat ed to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3.Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration w ith their patients' collective care teams. 4.Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained to provide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help us de al with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trai ned medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 140 695.Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access a nd reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope of their training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) into bordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insura nce coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allo wed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the pre ventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. 6.Alternatives to regulation. Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protec t Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revo ke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7. Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty -two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physician s or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor re gistration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certif ication, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing proc ess, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Vi rginia BHP registration process does not offer any objective, and doesn't distin guish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purp oses of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors w ill provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge th e Board to recommend licensure. Thank you.

I am a native Virginian and pro ud to also be a Traditional Naturopath. My education consisted of many years (hundred of hours) of classroo m training, online training, internships, and mentoring. I have an office in central Virginia and my clients come from all over the state. Instead of telling you my reasons for not voting yes on licensing naturopaths, I am going to share what my clients have to say. Please take a moment to hear their hearts and what their lives might be like today without the services we offer in my office. S.B.In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer and after having surgery I discovered swelling in both of my legs that was not there before. The swelling of Lymphedema is excruciating and I would just lay in the best resting up to do one thing ea ch day. It was not until I met Cindy Stillwell Chronister, that my life would change for th e better. After each appointment of electo lymphatic therapy I saw the swelling go down and my energy level increase. Cindy is the reason I can now walk three miles every morning. She gave me hope and a return to myself that I never thought possible. I have more confidence in myself now and want to give back to others. I am so thankful to have Cindy in my life and I share the hope that she has given me with others. B.Y. Cindy and Core Health helped so much through a really difficult time with Evox and Bach flowers. My daughter was struggling with some anxiety while her dad was on active duty military and sleep and Cindy was able to provide some holistic solutions that really helped our family. She has been able to approach my health from a foundational aspect rather than just seeing a bunch of individuals about symptoms bu t never really addressing the actual cause or roots. The office is gorgeous and feels safe and warm. T.W. Cindy Chronister, owner of Core Health and Wellne ss, is a miracle worker and a true blessing. I met Cindy a few years ago after suffering from a series of health crisis: thyroid cancer which lead to an extensive bilateral neck dissection and a stroke a year later. I was initially diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011 and had a total th yroidectomy. The cancer continued to grow and the following year a bilateral neck dissection was performed. The doctors removed 38 lymph nodes (some cancerous) from around my ne ck. Missing so many lymph nodes caused lymphedema and limited neck mobility. Discover ing Electro Lymphatic Therapy at Core Health has truly been life changing. Thanks to Cindy and her extensive knowledge of the lymphatic system, she is able to decongest the stagnant lymph. The treatments have made such a significant difference with increased energy and mobility! Core Health also offers several other 142 services I personally have be nefited from namely Breast Thermography and the IonCleanse Foot baths. I plan to visit Core Health for many years to come. Many thanks for all you do, Cindy Chronister! I don't go by doctor and I don't practice medicine . We offer a service for lymphatic therapy that has literally changed people's lives. I share clie nts with medical doctors, nurse practitioners and naturopathic doctors alike. We have a deep respect for each other and work well together in making sure my clients and their patients get the results they deserve. I am asking that you vote NO, not because I wa nt to hold back the rights for Naturopathic PHYSICIANS to enjoy the rights of medical profe ssionals, but to maintain my right to help my clients and offer them options for their well being. Thank you for taking time to consider the desire s of all those involved.. .I venture to say that there are many more Traditional Naturopaths in Vi rginia who would be harmed by this than the number of Naturopathic Doctors that may benefit.

I am wr iting in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. A Naturopathic Doctor helped me by looking at me as a whole and recommended additional testing. With the help of additional testing, my Primary Care Physician was able to diagnose the problems. Working with an MD, they were jointly able to develop a treatment plan with prescription drugs and supplements. Although not required by legi slation, I have reported the supplements to my pharmacist also so that it is coordinated with prescription drugs for any interactions. As a patient who supports licensure for medicall y-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to me: 1) Risk of harm. There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. In the interest of the sa fety of the residents of Vi rginia, it is best if only qualified ND are able to call themselves Naturopathic Doctors for their practice. 2) Specialized skills. Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug- herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are trained to provide are shar ed with other medical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain areas t hat aren't included or emphasized in other practices. 4) Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they can not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. They are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosi s for my medical records, and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential healthca re services that I would otherwise choose to receive from an ND. 5) Economic impact.

The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically- trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Vi rginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath w ho has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while me dically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low-risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. As a patient, I also want to know that if an ND causes harm, they will be disciplined by a regulatory board with the authority to restrict a practice license -not just sued in civil court or reported to a business bureau.) 2) Specialized skills.

Many primary careproviders are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This,combined with the increasing needs of t he public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services. 5) Economic impact. (Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creatin g additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use pr oper coding that would enable insurance coverage.

I have been under the care of a couple of different naturopathic doctor since approximately 2010, approximately 10 years. I am writing to let you know that I su pport the licensure of naturopathic doctors. Both of my daughters, my husband and I have all benefited from naturopathic care over the last decade. Generally, whenever I have a medical issue th at seems particularly difficult to solve, and I have had little to no luck with traditional medicine, naturo pathic medicine has helped us get to the root of our problems and get healing. I have used naturopathic doctors to assist me in hormone balancing, digestive issues, and chronic pain following a car acci dent to name a few. My husband has gotten help in lowering his cholesterol. My older da ughter received help with skin rashes. As a patient who supports licensure, I have a couple of concerns. First, I am concerned with economic impact. I believe that licensure would pave the way for coverage by insurance companies, thereby making care much more affordable. This would be hu ge, as it would allow many more people to have access to this wonderful, holistic care. It would provide another avenue for care and would relieve overburdened traditional care routes. I know that, even though we live a fairly comfortable life, I do not feel that I can always get care from naturopathic doct ors as much as I would like due to the great out of pocket costs, as I have no insurance coverage for such care. I support licensure so it could lead to insurance coverage and better and more afford able access to care for all Virginians. My second substantial concern relates to scope of practice. I think it would be so beneficial for naturopathic doctors to be able to perform physical exams and test ing/testing referrals. Allowing naturopathic doctors to perform these basic services would avoid duplicative appointments with traditional primary care doctors. Quicker, more stream lined access to health ca re would be achieved for Virginians. I know that I have had to seek medi cal care by a naturopathic doctor in a different jurisdiction in the past to be able to get simple blood work performed. Increasing scope of practice in the construct of licensure would help keep patients seeking medical care in their own cities and towns instead of elsewhere. I respectfully urge the strong consideration and reco mmendation of licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. I know that my family and I have seen significant health improvements in seeking such care, and I think that for the above-stated reasons, licensure would help deliver this important care to more Virginians. Sincerely, Melissa Mortimer Alexandria, Vir 154August 12, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Carolyn Wolfe. I am a license marriage and family therapist who has coordinated with natur opathic doctors in both my professional and personal life over the past decade. I am writing in support of full licensing medically- trained naturopathic doctors. I wish to continue successfully coordinating with naturopathic doctors. The current lack of official licensure is a barrier to the safety andease of these interventions. Knowing a regulating board was overseeing the qualifications and practice of naturopathic d octors not only provides peace of mind, it ensures the safety of my clients. Having seen and experienced the offerings ofnaturopathic doctors I can attest to the uni que and valuable skills they bring to their work and the specialized training they pursue in addition to the requirements necessary to pass medical board exams. Their perspective and specialized training are not being utilized to the fullest during the current medical, national crisis because of the lack of validation of their skill set. At this time, my understanding and opinion is that licensing is appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturop athic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certifi cation nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't offer any objective, and doesn't distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I have worked in the natural field for 30 years. I am a pioneer in working with Medical Doctors to help patients to learn how to help themselves and their families maintain good health. I have seen over 4,000 people and either I have helped them or I have not, but I have never hurt anyone with my advice. Natural remedies go with exercise and diet to balance the individual body. Natural health is a responsibility of the person to take time to investigate their health. I have owned six health food stores and my responsibility to the public was to educate them with research material. And find supplements for the public that are safe and effective. This Bill is restrictive of these stores and the in dividuals who are Traditional Naturopaths. This group wishes to take the title of Naturopathic Doctor away from individuals who have dedicated their lives to helping people stay healthy and work as consulta nts to medical professionals. They say we do not deserve to work with medical professionals be cause we do not come from their schools. I was educated in Washington DC at the Advanced In tegrative Institute. We were trained to work along side MD's from all over the world, I trained with MD's from Johns Hopkins UNV. In DC in the year 2000 we were licensed under the board of nursing. This gave us the ability to work along side the medical field. I do not know who this group of Naturopaths will be license under. I think they need to look at this Bill closely and sit with the group of Naturopaths who have been working in the Traditional field for the past 30 years and obtain recognition from the medical establishment as I have for the past 25 years. My work is my passion not for profit. I educate people on their health and I am a consultant to a prominent doctor in Richmond. I work along side Dr. John Verheul,MD., MPH HealthvisionsMD. If you would like to see my Bio you can go to HealthvisionsMD look under \"Providers\". I work with Dr. Cynthia Bettinger, MD and Sheri Payne Tignor. C-FNP. I have supported Dr. Verheul in opening a practice to integrate the Natural and Conventional medicine. We have made great advancements in the past three years. I am an licensed ordained Minister a Pastoral Counselor. I wish to see Naturopaths working along side the MD's helping people. There is room for everyone. In the Medical field the doctors become MD's and then go to a specialty fields. There is room for ND's to be just teachers, counselors and store owners. Why shou ld there be a demanded license for the Traditional Naturopaths who under the constitution of 1950 stated we did not have to be license in this country as we do no harm. In closing I would like to see the Naturopaths who wa nt to be licensed to work in hospitals and with doctors, come up with a license that would not make them the only resource to the public in natural healing. The Lord is the great healer. We just help guide his people with food. It is up to them to take the responsibility to learn how to take care of themselves. Its about the people, passion not profit.

Regards, Niranjan Dinesh 157 74August 13, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Robert Ciprian, DC, DIBAK, I have been a District of Columbia resident for ve years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over four years in DC and over 15 years previously in Oregon. I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have benetted form medically-trained naturopathic doctor care and I will continue to use them as my primary care providers. Along with their standard medicinal training, they are also very well trained and aware of lifestyle, environmental, nutritional, and mental causes of ill health and in turn are well trained to oer solutions to these issues that conventional medical professionals do not embrace. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have. Scope of practice in Virginia. Medically trained naturopathic doctors are not allowed to oer exams, to do labs or other testing. They are not allowed to diagnose conditions for my medical records and I have to go to a conventional medical profession who I would not go to for the type of care I am seeking in the rst place. From their education and training, medically trained naturopathic doctors are trained to do all of this and form personal experience are much better at nding problems that may not be picked up by conventionally trained medical professionals. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide much needed, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. We are in a crisis in this country because the general primary practice medical practitioner is becoming a thing of the past. Medically trained naturopathic doctors are a wonderful source to ll this upcoming void in healthcare. And with our current pandemic, there is no better time to have medically trained naturopathic doctors on the front line in primary care to help the public with testing and care. During twenty years of experience as a doctor of chiropractic, I have witnessed rst hand the knowledge, skills and capacity of medically trained naturopathic doctors to not only work eectively within the current healthcare model, but to oer important and lacking options for treatment of individuals who are not served by this model. I trust their work and eectively collaborate with them in the most complex of cases because we are complementary providers and this is what good health care is all about.I do urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Robert Ciprian, DC, DIBAK Washington, DC 158August 12, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Ekaterina Khoreva, I have been a Virginia resident for _10__years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 4 years. I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have been suffering from back pain my whole life. Naturopathy and Acupuncture are the only measures that work to maintain my condition under control. In addition, myoverall immune system support is coming from supplements and tinctures from my Naturopathic doctor. There is a lot of value in preventative measures. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here area few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. [ choose a few of the criteria below to focus on, and personalize as much as possible ]. 1) I would like to enjoy naturopathy and be confident that my doctor is medically- trained. I would not want a person without a license to be able treat me in the state of Virginia. Naturopathy takes a special place in my heart and I believe that in combination with medical training, great results can be obtained. 2) ) I currently do not have a primary care provider and would like my medically- trained naturopathic doctor to be able to do a physical exam and refer me toother specialists if needed. I do not want to seek another primary care provider. I would prefer my medically-trained naturopath to treat me. 3) I woukd like to be able to use my health insurance at the office of my Nauropath. I am paying every month for the health insurance that I don 'tget to use. 4) There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice inVirginia. While some alternative options may consider the real risk of harm thatexists, they will not appropriately examine or take into consideration the othercriteria that warrant licensing for naturopathic doctors. As a patient and aconsumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that bestaligns with my health needs and priorities. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommendlicensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Ekaterina Khoreva Alexandria, VA 159 charm city natural health Tuesday, August 11, 2020 My name is Carrie Runde and I am a naturopathic doctor (ND) practicing in Baltimore. I hold licenses to practice naturopathic medicine in Maryland and Washington DC. I have worked in a variety of outpatient settings, including large integrative practices with primary care providers, medical specialists, counselors, nutritionists, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and chiropractors. Formerly, I served on the Board of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and was the Vice President of the Maryland Naturopathic Doctors Association. I was highly involved in the licensure process in the state of Maryland, which started 10 years ago. I was a participant throughout the pre-licensure and summer study process, licensure process, writing regulations, and nally in advisory and regulatory roles. Maryland passed its ND licensure law in 2014 and began issuing licenses in 2016. One of the most important reasons was public safety. Without licensure and a set scope of practice in Maryland, there were vast dierences in the level of medical training among people advertising themselves using naturopathic titles. This was a signicant issue for patients new to naturopathic care as well as for patients who moved to Maryland from another state where regulation existed. The licensure of NDs in Maryland is working well. It has benetted the public by providing clarity around the training and role of NDs so they know what to expect when they come to our oces. It has benetted the healthcare system by providing a clear and legitimate path for other healthcare providers to condently refer for naturopathic care, which they do regularly to my practice. NDs have a unique skill set that is in-demand. We are trained as a bridge between conventional medicine and \"alternative/holistic\" medicine, with the ability to appropriately use lifestyle and natural medicines to treat health conditions within the context of someone's overall health, including conventional treatment. These skills are particularly necessary for chronic disease management. Patients are searching the internet for local doctors who are trained in \"integrative/holistic/alternative\" medicine to treat their chronic conditions like allergies, irritable bowel, and hypertension, just to give a few examples. Without regulation, these patients could see providers who have the same exact public-facing name, but who have vastly dierent levels of training (16 weeks of online, non-accredited courses vs 4 years of in-person, accredited medical training). This is a public safety issue. 4800 Roland Avenue, Suite 201, 844.654.7169 info@charmcitynaturalhealth.com www.charmcitynaturalhealth.com 160charm city natural health Now with regulation in Maryland, we can make sure that people using naturopathic titles have a standardized training and dened scope. We have the framework to regulate the profession, take disciplinary actions, all of which are benecial for the public and the healthcare system. There is less confusion about what NDs do and where we t into the existing health care system. Medically-trained NDs need a dened scope of practice in order to serve patients and help the healthcare system. Without it, we can not perform physical examination, order diagnostic labs or imaging, or make disease-specic treatment recommendations. There are no alternatives to regulation that would solve this fundamental problem. Having a license in Maryland has allowed the NDs to use a fuller scope of our medical training, which helps patients and decreases duplicative care and costs. For example, before having a license, I would have to send a patient to another provider to get labs performed. This was inecient, slowed down the patient's workup, and added unnecessary costs due to additional provider visits. I would also like to clarify that, in Maryland, NDs are trained and independent to work independently in practice. We work autonomously, as in all of the other licensed jurisdictions. We are trained to operate within the existing healthcare system and know when to refer to medical specialists and other providers. In Maryland we have a very unique \"Collaboration Agreement\" with a conventional medical physician. An ND must list an MD or DO who is willing to serve as a clinical resource. It is not supervision. It is simply an MD/DO who is willing to give his or her contact information for as-needed consultation. The consulted MD/DO does not direct patient care or engage directly in the care of the patient. There are no requirements around how often an ND must consult with the MD/DO or if they have to at all. Finally, Virginians are seeking naturopathic medical care. I know this because they travel to my practice in Baltimore because I have a license and my role is clear. However, these patients would be better served seeing a local ND in Virginia, where there are now over 40 medically trained, potentially licensable, naturopathic doctors.

As a Licensed Massage Therapist in VA for the last 16 years, I have seen the standards of my industry become more consistent and have enjoyed the benefits that my license personally and professionally affords me. A well-defined scope of practice, standards of conduct, etc would greatly benefit the naturopathic doctors and their patients as it has done for the massage practitioners and their clients. For the naturopath ic doctors I have used, met, and witnessed my clients using, to not be given the tools from the commonwealth do do their jobs to best of the scope they have been medically-trained to do is a misstep and a shame. I have met and worked with naturopathic doctors who are frustrated to have to hold a license in a nearby state when the commonwealth should be fostering their skill-sets and allowing them to work from their home base(s) in VA. These doctors want to give great care, take the load off of the sometimes overburdened medical facilities and traditionally accepted doctors, and happily pay VA to be licensed. Not being allowed to do physical exams, run blood labs, give diagnoses, or otherwise properly legally conduct their medical skills is really quite sad. The NDs should be considered a medical asset! For VA to not be supporting this community with proper licensing is allowing other states to receive money that should otherwise be circulated to and through VA. As a patient and consumer, I want to know that when I see a Naturopathic Doctor in VA, certain standards are being adhered to. Until recently, I was unaware that NDs I had seen in VA in the past were UNLICENSED! They were good doctors, I respected them, I am glad to have seen them. Had I known that VA did not license th em and demand they adhere to VA standards, I likely would not have gone to see them.

As a patien t of a naturopathic doctor, I will speak to the value and community need for having NDs regulated. Perhaps most important, NDs provide services that patients do not find in conventional medicine. NDs are interested in how and why illnes s occurs with the goal to resto re health by addressing the root causes of disease with a treatment plan personalized for each individual. They are often focus on preventive care and are willing to try botanical and/ or nutritional solutions to solve a wide array of problems. For example, my daughter is a competitive athlete and needed help regulating her hormones. The only solution given to me through conventional medicine was the birth control pill. Birth control pills give a range of side-effects incl uding weight gain, which would have been problematic for my daughter. Instead, my naturopathic doctor wa s able to regulate and fix my daughter's hormonal problems within a few months only using nutritional supplements and herbal remedies with no side- effects. Personally, I know that NDs are far more knowledgea ble when it comes to nutrition. Conventional doctors have limited to no education in this area. In addition, conventional doctors focus on a single condition rather than consider the entire body. However, NDs consider the patient's lifestyle and the biochemical factors underlying their problems. They consider how the physical, mental, social, emotional, and environmental influences might be wo rking (or not working) together. In fact, NDs spend a lot of time assessing these factors from the st art (a first visit can take up to 2+ hours). And the natural health treatments often incorporate diet, meditation, exercise, nutritional supplements, and herbal treatments. In my personal experience, this is also what limi ts a conventional doctor's understanding of women's hormones. Conventional medicine relies on a few tricks: birth control pills, hormone replacement, or strong prescription medications (often with a host of side-effects). However, many of these remedies have shown to be ineffective as well as have long-term health consequences. Unfortunately, the NDs are limited in their scope of prac tice. They cannot do physical exams, imaging or lab-work. Therefore, patients and NDs must outsourc e this work - which also delays the timing of the reports. It is also more costly for the patients. And it makes simple follow-up tests less likely. The economic impact of licensing NDs could be hug e and might one day allow everyone access to their services; currently, NDs can only help people who ca n afford the out-of-pocket expenses. Individuals, families, and businesses are continuing to face mount ing healthcare costs. The number one expenditure as we age is healthcare expenses. With proper natu ropathic care and interventions, as get older we could avoid many of the expensive procedures and lif e-long prescription medicines. This would allow for conventional doctors to focus and treat the more acute conditions; perhaps even in conjunction with NDs like they do in other states. Our healthca re system is struggling - and given our growing 164understanding of epigenetics - the conditions people are facing are unique and do not have a one size fits all solution. Our current COVID crisis is eviden ce of this. We need to find ways to support our doctors, all of our doctors - bringing as many tools to the table as possible. As an educator and member of our Virginia comm unity, I value the educational requirements for accreditation to ensure adequate training and licensing exams. While I am in strong support of seeing the profession of NDs grow and expand, it is imperative that all professions have oversight and supervision; allowing for consistency and promoting ongoing safety and accountability. Therefore, I am in support for the licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in the state of Virginia.

I have been a Virginia resident for 53 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for the past 9 months. I am writing in support ofa recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. My experience working with my naturopathic doctor has been overwhelmingly positive. I was given time to provide a full background, including life circumstances that haveaffected my health. This provided an opportunity previously unavailable to me with my regular GP who is only able to give me 15 mi nutes to get to the bottom of my issues. My naturopathic doctor is not merely treating symptoms, but seeking to determine andtreat the root cause of my health issues. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Specialized skills. Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. This approach has been a huge improvement in the care I was receiving from my GP. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are trained to provide are shared with other medical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain areas that aren't included or emphasized in other practices. 2) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my m edically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. I also trust my ND to refer me to a specialist or another healthcare provider, in order to ensure the best care possible. 3) Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. They are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosis for my medical records, and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential healthcare services that I would otherwise choose to receive from an ND. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments which is an added cost to my already substantial medical bills. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic, especially for mental health 167 support, means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well- trained to provide medical services. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommendlicensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Tammy M. Ewen Daleville, VA 168 MMisra Chiropractic Clinic at The OM Center Bibhu R.

My name is Dr. Hannibal Hervey, and I have been practicing chiropractic medicine for over 9 years. I am Board Certified Chiropractor. I attended National University of Health Sciences withoverlapping core classes that were required by the Naturopathic program. I have also worked with several professionally and referred patients over the past few years. Rather than just suppressing symptoms, Naturopathic Doctors work to identify underlying causes of illness, and develop personalize d treatment plans to address them. Their therapeutic approach identifies the natural o rder in which all therapies should be applied to provide the greatest benefit with the least potential for damage. I have found medically-trained naturopathic doctors to be crucial in the conservative care model.Primary care Physicians (PCPs) agree that people are over medicated and obesity is onthe rise. Naturopathy is a crucial piece to this puzzle of health care and I have seenproviders take the time to review health histories and underlying environmental factors in patients in order to assist the patient in achieving health goals. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as theyrelate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathicdoctor and a traditional or lay naturopath; licensure, and a regulatory framework,will provide clarity -while also promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally-recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\" . It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically-trainedprofessionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and should be held to accountby a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical 169 77MMisra Chiropractic Clinic at The OM Center Bibhu R. Misra, D.C., M.Sc., Dr. Hannibal Hervey, DC Suite 200 i 21785 Filigree Court i Ashburn, VA 20147 DrMisra@theOMcenter.com i 703.724.9899 i www.theOMcenter.comprof essionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams inbasic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition,botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, incombination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access tospecialized professionals who have experti se in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand theinteractions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with theirpatients' collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of providershortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care andpreventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained toprovide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help usdeal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronicdisease, and mental health illness. They w ork collaboratively to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited,and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closestlocalities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District ofColumbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope oftheir training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) intobordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit toinsurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurancecoverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available 170 MMisra Chiropractic Clinic at The OM Center Bibhu R. Misra, D.C., M.Sc., Dr. Hannibal Hervey, DC Suite 200 i 21785 Filigree Court i Ashburn, VA 20147 DrMisra@theOMcenter.com i 703.724.9899 i www.theOMcenter.comcare -- are unable to access the preventat ive medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. 6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequa te to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't offer any objective, and doesn't distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors.

I am wondering if it is necessary to outreach for co mments from the general public to the BHP. I know a lot of people in Blacksburg, VA that are environmental and social activist and would probably contribute greatly. I was an orga nic farmer in Blacksburg for 5 years and graduated from Virginia Tech prior to that. If so, does a template exist for Virginia ci tizens that want higher quality Naturopathic Medicine? And what address would you like these letters funneled to? Thank you for your work! Ben Wilke Naturopathic Student Yoga Awareness Teacher 647-676-2183 172August 14, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Ben Wilke, and I am a 2 nd year student at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM). I am writing to urge the Board to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I was born and raised in Williams burg VA and graduated with a Bach elor of Science degree from Virginia Tech in Biological Systems Engineering. My passion afterwards was to discover how I could help make changes in the professional lands cape so that citizens could more easily support their own health, as well as environmental, as a part of their daily consuming habits. This was practically applied by through design and appl ication of sustainable agricultural systems. However, there was not enough financial support to continue this venture, so Naturopathic Medicine was the next step up for me. I built stro ng bonds in the local community of Blacksburg, VA while I was a farmer there. Most recently I got a comment from a past dedicated customer, who has young children and is also actively involved in the community, \"I see the need for a naturopathic doctor in Blacksburg. Are you coming back to fill the void? The one I saw outside of town was not so helpful. The need for quality is here.\" I feel that this comment accura tely expresses the need for more professional recognition of the quality of health care that exist within the Naturopathic Profession. This thought, I imagine, lay dormant in the minds of many Virginia citizens se eking a health care that allows them to talk about their health concerns for more than 10 minutes with a scientifically trained and licensed health care practitioner. It should come to no surprise to any trained medical clinician that oversight and guided treatment of an individual's imbalanced emotional response to stressors in life can have a profound impact on their capaci ty to develop illness or even manage current chronic states of disease. Simply said, an indivi dual that has confidence in their daily lifestyle habits as being healthful and supportive of their lif e will have a lesser risk of becoming ill. This has been well recorded in the study and practice of orthomolecular psychiatry and needs to be recognized as a viable practice that reduces th e load for Medical Doctors (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathy (DO) attempting to decode chronic illness in short visits that need to be addressed via a well-established therapeutic relationship. The ability for a patient to engage in a therapeutic relationship with a licensed Naturopathic Doctor will, hands down, reduce health care cost and increase revenue by keeping people with chronic conditions (no matter at onset or thereafter) out of hospitals and more effective in the work place. We will see a reduction in obesity, heart disease, ch ronic pain, addiction, digestive disorders, allergies, psoriasis, infertility, and relap ses of cancer and lyme s disease. We will see people being more immune to mutations of viru ses and bacteria. This can all be the achieved under the supervision of a Naturopathic Doctor, working in conjunction with MD's and DO's if need be, that is allowed to apply their astute knowledge in biochemistry, physiology, nutrition, botanical medicine, diagnostics, and psychiatry. Naturopathic Doctors are trained to understand 173 78the human condition at a personal level and this personal engagement with patients is what the current medical landscape is lacking. My own in abilities to connect with conventional doctors about my own disorder is why I was inspired to join the Naturopathic Medicine. As a result my own conditions are under control and no longer interfering with my mental capacity to engage with the work I do. So it is harmful and a breach in public safety for the citizens of Virginia to not have access to this and be confused about how to find it. It may not be apparent that health providers currently practicing some inadequate form of Naturopathy are causing direct harm to the public. This is concretely because the harm is indirect. The further development of a patients onset of a chronic condition will more subtly get worst and they will most often blame it on their own behavior or habits. The inadequate practitioner of naturopathy is deemed a \"quack\" or simply not helpful and the profession is handicapped as a result. Akin to an athlete breaking their leg because they were forced to perform on an improperly managed playing field, and now has to expend all energy in rebuilding their own capacity to perform. We are expe nding energy on fixing a brokenness in our practice that is present because inadequacy is allowed. Licensed Naturopathic Doctors, who truly want to be a team player, need other health care professionals to recognize the impo rtance of this niche that the Naturopathic Doctors fills. We need you to take a moment, look beyond the aspect of competition, and find the place in your own internal self that believes, \"When I take care of myself, I fe el better\". The nuanced effect of Naturopathic Medicine integrated in public health is beyond the notion of lifestyle management, as I hope is articulated in the scope we wish to oper ate, but it is this very node of intuition that Naturopathic Medicine pins downs and strengthens in the patient so they are less apt to make choices in their unique life circumstances that are degrading to their physiological system. It is key that licensing and appropriate scope of practice be moved forward on as soon as possible so that Virginia can stay on the fron t line of an evolving health care system. Without your capitalization on the unfilled areas of health care I elucidated on they will continue to be occupied by subpar versions of who we are. Virginia will inevitably fall behind in the quality of health care that it provides because of this, and the negative impact on public safety and state revenue will be entirely implicated . I, respectively, implore you to let go of and see beyond the unjustified criticism placed on modern day Natu ropathic Medicine that has emerged because of the freedom for inadequately trained people to practice exists. Please shake the hand of the Naturopathic Doctor that wants to be licensed, regulated and aid in increasing the quality health care that currently exist, we all know that these chronic conditions are on the incline. We absolutely can and want to help!

Naturopathic doctors have a unique set of skills and therapies that makes their discipline holistic and reparative. They look at the whole picture to help each person and family systems. As an exampl e, I would like to share a little bit of my family's experience being treated by our naturopathic doctor. Our naturopathic practitioner has been addressing issues with the four of us (two adults and two children) that no other MD was able to. I was put in remission of my autoimmune and haven't been taking ANY medications thanks to my naturopathic protocol. My biggest concern and obstacle is that every time we need to see how my CPKs are doing and how my inflammation markers are behaving I have to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist only fo r his ability to run my labs. I pay for an extra appointment for something my naturo pathic doctor should be able to do herself. I feel I am not being fair to th e doctor who is NOT treating me but only running labs and I feel my naturopathic doct or is taking longer to help me because she needs to wait for my tests from a diffe rent MD. It is not efficient and has the ability to stall my progress and healing. My children's' conditions were also highly improved by their naturopathic protocol. My son has PANDAS and NO pediatrician gave me ANY solution until I started with my naturopathic practitioner. My daughter's anxiety, ADD and overall health was also not efficiently addressed by pediatricians of all sorts and practices and she feels way better on her naturopathic protocol. I also believe their practice should be licensed so I can safely recommend their services to my friends, many of who are no t finding relief from their MDs and are in search of more modern and humanized options. Without licensure, we may risk being in wrong hands where lay providers can be confused with naturopathic doctors. Thank you for your consideration and I urge the Board to vote in favor of a recommendation for licensure.

Although I am not an advocate of licensing regulation for every field of employment, the protection of the public is a paramount concern in the fields of medicine and health care. Here are three reasons for implementing ND licensing requirements: Patient identification of qualified NDs Beginning about five years ago, I have received health care support from an ND in the Richmond area. The experience has been remarkably beneficial both in receiving remediation of illness and in guidance for a healthy and improved quality of life. Notwithstanding, the experience has not been without unnecessary complexity and frustration. When I first considered the services of a naturopathic doctor, the process of identifying a qualified practitioner was frustrating because there are no clear standards for separating lay healers or lay naturopaths from the re al thing. An inordinate amount of time was required to research the industry and universities to make a selection with confidence. If they were a regulated group, the process would be simpler because of a licensing credential. This is especially important sinc e many of us seek a doctor when we are sick and suffering. It's not a time when you want to spend hours on research to find a qualified doctor. Unique skill sets of NDs 181 80My initial contact with my naturopathic doc tor was the result of a debilitating and maddeningly painful autoimmune disorder. I had consulted with four MD's and not one was able to make a diagnosis. Three of the four MD's were competent and trusted medical professionals. But because of the particular scope of their training, and the difficulty inherent in diagnosing my illness, they could only scratch their heads and continue to refer me to another doctor. I could not work, I could hardly eat and lost much weight, and worst of all I suffered the most excruciating pain constantly. I was desperate for a diagnosis so I'd have a treatment plan. Finally, at my wife's repeated urging I was able to gain an appointment with a naturopathic doctor. Within the first hour of my two-hour appointment my naturopathic doctor was suspicious of the possible diagnosis. Because she could not diagnose me in the State of Virginia and no other doctor was able to provide me with a diagnosis- I found myself in a bit of a quandary. (By th e way, I've never in my life had an opportunity to spend one or two hours with a doctor. It is a wonderful experience to have a doctor patiently listen to your experience and to consider you as a whole person and not just a set of symptoms.). But because naturopathic doctors are trained to look at the cause and improve general health to restore function- she was still able to craft a plan to work on lifestyle, inflammation and manage my pain. Through this my health was restored. There is no doubt that it was the unique training of my naturopathic doctor and her experience that enabled her to put a concentrated plan together to put me back together. No one else was able to do this for me. Authority to practice as other medical professionals An impediment to receiving prompt treatment at minimal expense is the constraints placed on Virginia NDs because of a lack of state regulation. I have often had to incur additional expense of money and time because something was needed that my naturopathic doctor could not do in Virginia . For example, the prohibitions against 182physical examinations, lab tests and imaging. These restrictions hinder my doctor in the provision of care when I am ill, and they place an unfair burden on the patient. Thank you for considering my input.

I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors. The support received until now help me a lot where I cannot find any improvement with the conventional way. I think both are very import ant for the healthcare access for the patients. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are few concerns I have. Specialized skills: naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are only medical providers specialized in drug-herb and drug-nutient interactions. They help bridge the gap that exists between conventional and traditional medic ine practice. ND are trained to provide and share with other medical professions. I personally experimented this a number of times. Also ND have specific education in certain areas that are not in other practices. They provided relief where the conventional medicine could not. Autonomous practice: I see my ND because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and na tural medicine. I also trust my ND to refer me to a specialist or another provider to ensure my best care possible. This happens twice this year. Scope of practice: ND cannot offer physical ex ams or order labs or imaging. They cannot even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. They are not allow by law to give a medical diagnosis for my medical records and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential healthcare services that I would otherwise c hoose to receive from my ND. This will eliminate the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic means that patients are now requiring m ore access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services. Economic impact: licensing would pave the ro ad to insurance coverage. Currently ND are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage so needed. In the era of chronic disease it is particularly a burden. Alternatives to regulation: as a patient and a consumer I want access to safe, regulated and holistic care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respect fully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

The main reasons I believe licensure for trained naturopathic doctors is important are the following: 1) Without licensure, anyone could call themselves a naturopathic doctor. For safety and we ll-being, all those who seek health care from a naturopath need to know their doctor is medically trained and legitimate. Imagine conventional medical doct ors not being licensed. It's the unthinkable. Naturopathic doctors shou ld be held to the same level of accountability and standar ds as other regulated heal th professionals which will only give confidence and secu rity to the population at large. 2) Today more than ever, individuals ar e interested in forming a health care team that addresses heath issues from BOTH a holistic and a conventional medicine perspective. Both are vital be cause they approach health care from different perspectives. Natu ropathic doctors are trained in specific areas that other doctors are not. It becomes a complete health care package to have traditional medical doctors and a naturo pathic doctor looking at the \"whole self\" from the outside in and the inside out. 1853) Naturopaths are limited by law from executing basic services for patients such as physical exams, ordering la bs or imaging, and running a basic complete blood count. For individuals who prefer to use a naturopathic doctor exclusively, this is quite unfortunate and it k eeps patients running from doctor to doctor. Allowing natu ropaths to offer these basic services would considerably cut cost s for patients and better serve all Virginians by increasing legitimate access to other options. I would briefly like to tell you an expe rience I had as an example of what a naturopath can do that some medical doctors are not able to do. Over a period of about 6 months I had some gut issues which consisted of a constant ache in my gut, loss of appeti te and lethargy. Over that time period I consulted two different medical doct ors, had two endoscopies and it was determined I had acute gastritis and ga stro-esophageal refl ux disease. I was told and I quote, \"You'll prob ably have to stay on Prilosec for the rest of your life.\" With that information, I went directly to my medically trained naturopath and she was able to dete rmine that the real problem was a histamine build up in my gut. I chan ged my diet, my gut gradually healed and I have not taken Prilosec since. My heartfelt plea is that you and memb ers of the Board will see an important need here and recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in the state of Virginia. Regards, Martha H.

This is required today. The desire to be licensed is to allow them to perform some additional medical procedures, order certain tests and x-rays and most important, to bill insurance for their fees. The only states where working in natural health, performing consultation on or providing suggestions for natural products and remedies is illegal are states where naturopathic doctors have been licensed and the legislation provide s no exception for the existing natural health workers. In other words, the law to license naturopath ic doctors in some states is the very law that made the exact same things they did legally prior to licensure, illegal after licensure was granted . It can create a monopoly for the few that are licensed while the competition is eliminated. At least eleven states have proactively had their legislators pass safe harbor laws to keep licensing laws from making their natural health activities illegal. And in at least two states, the Naturopathic Doctor organiza tion pursuing licensure attempted to have these laws repealed after passage in their own efforts to become licensed themselves. We attempted to pass a Safe Harbor law in Virginia in 2006 and the same folks seeking licensure now stood against us then. Some folks have insinuated that having naturopaths be licensed and 'regulating' natural health would somehow make the customers safer. Th at is a false argument. Herbs and natural remedies have been around for centuries and centuries. They were used by people in the bible and throughout history. Generations of Virginians ha ve used and worked with natural health and continue today. And they are safely used by increasing numbers of people every day. They are available over the counter and are not unsafe. There are concerns with licensing folks to be naturopathic doctors. There are clear established paths to become a medical doctor in Virginia. Licensure of Naturopaths would lower these existing standards. If someone wanted to become licensed under the requirements in the legislation as submitted, they would need to go to a school in Washington State, Canada or other location, not in Virginia. This seems to be a significant barrier to entry for most Virginians to achieve, and creates monopolistic control. Also, with an autonomous practice, a white coat, a stethoscope and the title Doctor, the public coul d be led to believe that these Naturopathic Doctors were actually MDs. Unless a person meets the established criteria to be an MD, maybe it would be more appropriate to have them work under the direction and supervision of an actual MD as they stated they have been required to do in other states. But my biggest concern is that licensure could be granted without mandating exemptions and protection for the thousands of Virginians working legally in natural health in Virginia today. There are reportedly less than 50 people who are seeking licensure as naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Trinity School of Natural Health ( https://www.trinityschool.org/ )h a s graduated 151 Traditional Naturopathic Doctor s (now called Certified Holistic Health Practitioner) and 458 Certified Natural Health P rofessionals in Virginia alone. This does not include any other schools' graduates, students curr ently enrolled in these programs but who have not yet completed, Health Coaches, or the many who have simply learned on the job working in 187the hundreds of herb shops and natural health stores around the state. Their livelihoods could be negatively impacted or their jobs eliminated. And they have done nothing wrong. Enforcement against Virginians working in natural health stores, a Mom and Pop family business or a consultant working from home would be relatively easy. However, it would be nearly impossible to stop the millions of articles available on the internet recommending natural health products, remedies, diet and nutrition. I support the thousands of natural health workers in the state that simply want to keep their jobs, to keep helping customers and clients with suggestions for natural products and remedies. I do not believe natural products and remedies are unsafe (Criterion One). The FDA makes product safety a requirement of the manufacturers. And I do believe that licensure without protections could do irreparable financial harm to other Virgin ians and severely impact access to natural health products and suggestions by Virginians (Criterion Five). If you choose to recommend licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia , please also recommend exemptions and protections be included in the law to protect our citi zens earning their living in the natural health world in Virginia.

My name is Dr. Tonya Noel Traas, and I have been a pharmacist in Virginia for over 19 years. I have held positions in hospital and community pharmacy, earning my 10 year certificate of service with Walmart this coming September. I also served as Director of Experiential Education at the Appalachian College of Pharmacy in 2008 and 2009. During my employment with the college, I worked with two naturopathic doctors. I also attended health coaching classes at Duke University in 2008 and 2009 where I interacted with medically trained naturopathic doctors. Through these experiences, I came to appreciate and understand the rigorous training required of them and their breadth of knowledge. Prior to these experiences, my knowledge of naturopathic doctors was limited and, like many lay people, I did not understand the sco pe of their practice. During my training, in pharmacy school, I discounted naturopathy because most of those I encountered had earned a \"doctor of naturopathy\" degree through an unaccredited online diploma source. The practitioners I encountered in 2008 and 2009 were competent medical professionals who were residency trained to work both independently and in collaborative relationships with all medical providers. Licensure would mark the necessary distinction between those who are actually medically trained as naturopathic doctors and those who earned their \"degree\" from an online unaccredited course. Due to the cu rrent shortage of general medicine practitioners and primary care providers, particularly in remote and rural areas of Virginia, the competency and re sourceful ways in which natur opathic doctors practice is much needed. The most notable addition to our healthcare system that can be made by recognizing through licensure of naturopathic doctors is their focus on prevention of healthcare issues. Instead of waiting for a disease to present, naturopaths focus on the whole patient; their body, their environment, their past traumas, etc. This approach could greatly economically impact the whole of the healthcare system by circumventing disease entirely through prevention. They us e the same approach to restore those with disease. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and 191botanical medicine. Licensure is necessary to protect the public from those who are not properly trained to collaborate with other medical professionals and refer when necessary. Oversight would prevent unnecessary harm to the public from those who are untrained. Licensure would allow this accountability portion and protect our citizens of the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. I am so grateful for the healing treatments and on-going immune support I received from my naturopathic doctor. Conventional doctors prescribed conventional medicines which did nothing to heal my respiratory issues, nor support my immune system.

I have two hard-to-diagnose conditions that went undiagnosed by medical professionals for years and caused me a lot of pain. But over time, using holistic methods, my ND was able to determine the causes of my symptoms and offer some solutions. My relationsh ip with her has been life altering. It has been frustrating that I have had to make additional appointments with my primary care doctor to order lab tests or imaging, causing me extra time and expense, when my ND is perfectly knowledgeable and capable of ordering the required tests. And since primary care doctors are overburdened and pr essed for time, allow ing NDs to provide more services could relieve some of that burden. And of course, if licensure could lead to in surance coverage for ND services, that would be a huge plus. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on ND appointments and supplements, and while my health was worth it, it was a burden. I understand there are no alternatives to re gulation that would address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia. As a patient and a consumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic care that best aligns with my health needs. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic docto rs will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I re spectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Please!

I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically- trained naturopathic doctors. When traditionally trained medical doctors could not provide any relief or stabilization formy autonomic dysfunction and MTHFR epigenetic mutations that have no FDAapproved drugs to treat I sought out a naturopathic doctor to help me. The naturopathicdoctor has helped me stabilize my health problems as best they can be and helpedobtain me a higher quality of life while living with my conditions. When a person has a problem that has no FDA approved drugs to treat medical doctors are often left with little to help their patients. I have two of the many problems that have no FDA approved drugs to treat. I have tried \"off-label\" medication prescribed by a medical doctor but it either did not help or all too often made me sicker. Working with my naturopathic doctor in conjunction with my medical doctor has been better than my medical doctor alone. The naturopathic doctor has different training and approaches that work extremely well for stabilizing my health problems. I will continue to see both medical doctors and a naturopathic doctor simply because both kinds of doctors are needed for me to obtain and maintain a good quality of life. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. My naturopathic doctor has referred me to other doctors and I have valued her experience to recommend the kind of doctor I need to see. Currently, if my naturopathic doctor would like any kind of test done I must go to my medical doctor and request it. Thankfully my doctors work together but it requires me to make and pay for another doctor's appointment. Medical care is expensive enough without having to see two different doctors for required testing because the naturopathic doctor cannot order testing. Not once has my medical doctor thought the requested testing was not called for or unnecessary and it usually offers them an additional incite to my current health status. I have always paid for great medical insurance coverage and I should be allowed to use this coverage that will best serve my needs. I am healthier seeing a naturopathic doctor and I should be able to use my medical insurance to pay for the appointments. 200 85As a patient and a consumer, I want access to safe, regulated, and holistic healthcare that best aligns with my health needs and are provided by a medically-trained naturopathic doctor. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for all patients in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure fornaturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors.In frustration with the diagnosis of a life-time chronic autoimmune disease I reached out to a naturopathic doctor. She met with me, listened to my concerns and put into place a long term action plan. Most importantly we worked with my endocrinologist. Together traditional and naturopathic medicine brought me to remission. I don't believe I would have achieved this without my ND. As a patient who supports licensure, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. I am most concerned about working with a trained ND. I was fortunate to have received excellent personal recommendations from others who worked with this practice. There needs to be the same level of professiona l accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in VA. Specialized Skills: As I said, my ND listened - my particular autoimmune disease is almost all stress induced and she addressed every aspect of my life. Regarding Economic Impact: I am a retired person and for me going forward finances are a concern. Being able to have insurance coverage would be so helpful. I paid out of pocket because it has offered me a way to heal that traditional medicine alone could not do.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I began visits with my Naturopathic doctor over 5 years ago because I was struggling with my weight and other issues. This doctor took the time to really analyze the symptoms I listed and came up with a detailed plan for me to follow. Without the dedication of this doctor and colleagues alike, I feel I would have never been given the care that was needed! I would like to focus on \"scope of practice\" for a moment. As I started to receive care from my Naturopath I was still needing to see my primary care doctor for basic lab work as well as more focused lab work to explore underlying causes for my symptoms. Why is the doctor that is doing the research not able to execute the labs and other possible tests for diagnosis? The extra time I had to spend seeing a different doctor to provide lesser care, took time away from a treatment plan that was extremely needed. They too are trained and are fully capable of ordering labs and providing a physical exam. I feel the time has come for Naturopathic doctors to be able to provide the same medical services such as their colleagues provide in other states. I urge the Committee to support full licensing of medical-trained naturopathic doctors.

I have been a practicing licensed nutritionist and clinical herbalist in the state of Virginia since 2012, and have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor as needed for 8 years. I am writing to urge you to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. As a patient of naturopathic doctors myself, I have never been more seen and heard, cared for and supported by any health care provider. Their wellness plans were successful and personalized for me, research based and clearly communicated, and I will always continue to seek out licensed naturopathic doctors for my health care. I have also had the privilege to work alongside several Naturopathic Doctors within a clinical practice to provide nutrition and herbal medicine support for the patients within the practice for 6 years. This collaborative healing environment was quite rare within the state of Virginia, and extremely well utilized by people even within 200 miles of the practice. The naturopathic doctors I worked with - all medically trained and licensed within accredited states including Oregon, Vermont and Arizona - were exceptional health care providers. They practiced with considerable care, constant professionalism, and a high degree of knowledge that their skilled profession requires. In the practice, we kept a lengthy referral list for additional practitioners who could serve our patients for specific needs, including acupuncturists, dietitians, massage therapists, health coaches, and other trusted, well trained lay professionals. Within alternative health care, our community of healers and healthcare colleagues are essential to patient care. Likewise, other lay practitioners in our community retained a referral list for trusted naturopathic doctors to refer their clients, as we (other natural practitioners), must 205practice within our limited scope of practice, and rely on the skill and training of licensed naturopathic doctors in Virginia to provide the highest level of holistic care. Recognizing licensure of Naturopathic Doctors will in no way keep other natural practitioners from providing care. On the contrary, their recognized licensure would bolster my confidence in my referrals, and give my clients the confidence that their naturopathic doctor had the appropriate training, education, experience and accreditation they require. It is confusing and frustrating that the state of Virginia has no regulation regarding who can call themselves a naturopathic doctor. In Virginia, there are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they have been able to safely access care from medically-trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low-risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. I strongly encourage you to recommend licensure for Naturopathic Doctors in the state of Virginia for the health and safety of all who seek professional holistic care. In gratitude, Lindsay Kluge, MS, CNS, LDN Clinical Herbalist & Licensed Dietitian Virginia Board of Health Professions Attn: Laura Jackson 9600 Mayland Drive, Suite 300 Henrico, VA 23233 Dear Members of the Virginia Board of Health Professions: As a resident of Virginia and a member of the Alliance for Natural Health USA, I urge the Virginia Board of Health Professions to recommend licensure of Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) who have been educated at accredited, four-year naturopathic medical schools. This would expand consumer options beyond medical doctors to include those who use a more natural approach. Licensure for naturopathic physicians is a huge step forward for public health in the state. Virginians demand access to various types of practitioners, and they should have the ability to choose the practitioner that fits their unique needs, including licensed NDs and traditional naturopaths, who focus on the root causes of illness. It is also important that ND licensure not come at the expense of traditional naturopaths - those educated at non-accredited institutions or via apprenticeships. Traditional naturopaths must be allowed to continue practicing to the extent of their training and ability and to use the title \"traditional naturopath.\" I believe in the consumer's right to select whatever practitioner - naturopathic doctor or traditional naturopath - that fits his or her needs. An ND licensure program ultimately protects patient choice in health care by allowing citizens to receive a more holistic system of care from a naturopathic doctor. As a growing number of Virginians suffer from acute and chronic illness and the state has an insufficient number of primary care providers, there is great need for consumers to have the option to receive personalized, holistic treatment from NDs educated at accredited, four-year naturopathic medical schools. 211Open and fair markets, in which consumers can decide what credentials and level of education they seek in healthcare professionals, guarantee the best outcomes. Please recommend ND licensure to the Virginia General Assembly and reserve a title allowing traditional naturopaths to continue to practice under the title \"traditional naturopath.\" Sincerely, The Alliance for Natural Health USA The undersigned 95 individuals: Jennifer Donner 88061-9347 Jerry Zephyr Circle Se Floyd, VA 24091 August 16, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee: Thank you for your perseverance toward regul ating naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Cloe Franko and I am a third year student at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. I was born and raised in Floyd, Virginia, attended the University of Richmond, and hope to return to Virginia to practice naturopathic medicine. I am writing in support of full licensing for medically trained naturopathic doctors with degrees from CNME accredited institutions. My decision to pursue naturopathic medicine was a big one, made particularly challenging because Virginia, the state to which I hope to return and practice, remains unregulated for naturopathic doctors. I found naturopathic medicine through my own health journey when conventional medicine was unable to support me. I believe deeply in its effectiveness and potential to greatly improve the lives of many Virginians. I am taking on significant debt to pursue my degree. The risk associated with my student debt is increased due to my intent to practice in a state where NDs are currently unlicensed. For instance, I will not be able to practice the full extent of the medicine I'm being trained in if I cannot carry out physical exams on my patients, cannot provide naturopathic diagnoses to my patients, and cannot order labs. Each of these limitations has the potential to reduce my effectiveness, make my practice less accessible and appealing to patients, and reduce my earning potential and subsequent ability to pay back my student loans. Naturopathic medicine, just like all other medical professions, should have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Below I share my insights regarding some of the criteria used by the Board: 1)Risk of harm. As you know, medically trained naturopathic doctors receive four years of onsite medical training at institutions accredited by the Council onNaturopathic Medical Education (CNME), complete with hands-on practicals, board exams, and a full year internship. Without licensure or a regulatory framework in Virginia, it is extremely difficult for the general public to distinguish our levels of training from those of a lay naturopath whose education is not monitored for quality assurance and provides nowhere near the depth of medical training I am receiving. The lack of clarity on the medical background of their providers creates additional risk for patients who seek naturopathic care. Only medically trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally recognized accredited programs should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who 215presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically trained naturopathic doctors go through a rigorous and fundamentally distinct type of education that sets us apart from lay naturopaths and other medical providers. We receive training in the complex interactions between pharmaceut icals, supplements, and botanical medicine in a way that no other medical provider does. As more and moreVirginians are seeking alternative and preventative medicine, it is crucial they have access to practitioners who can advise them on the safest and most effective ways to do so. The current and growing crisis of chronic disease,exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have expertise in prevention and holistic care. Moreover, medically trained naturopathic doctors would benefit from the true distinction, which will encourage more NDs to move to and practice in Virginia, bolstering the health of the population (and economy). 3)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers as well as in a number of modalities from nutrition and botanical medicine to acupuncture and physical medicine. Our scope of practice should reflect the depth and breadth of our training. Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically trained naturopathic doctors can provide, from pain and addiction to chronic disease and mental health illness. We are trained to work collaboratively with other healthcare providers and bridge the gap between conventional and alternative medical approaches. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 4)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. If Virginia has not passed legislation to license and regulate NDs when I graduate in two years, Iwill consider moving to Maryland or the District of Columbia (the two closest regulated regions) to set up my practice . This not only fails to serve Virginia's population, but also fails to bring resources and taxes into Virginia's economy.Moreover, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. At least six states currently allow for health insurance coverage of naturopathic care by licensed NDs. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. This makes naturopathic care available only to those who can afford to pay entirely out-of-pocket. Many of the Virginians who need this care most and would benefit most greatly are unable toaccess the services that naturopathic doct ors are so well positioned to provide. It is critical to me that I am able to make my practice financially accessible to patients regardless of wealth. The ability to accept insurance coverage for the care I provide is a critical piece of ensuring my practice is accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. 5)Alternatives to regulation . Licensure and a framework should exist for accountability of the profession of medically trained naturopathic doctors to ensure the protection of the public. Without regulation, citizens who are harmed 216 89by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate redress. The current alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and make that information available to the public. 6)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically trained health care professionals. Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. Fortunately, no states offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states functions like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can register and call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the existing Virginia BHP registration process does not distinguish between medically trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide a range of benefits to Virginia's residents and economy without changing the ability of lay naturopaths to provide the services they currently provide. This decision has a huge impact on my future and I appreciate your attention. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Cloe Franko 217August 16, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, I appreciate your thorough evaluation of the regulatio n of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Mandy Reckers, and I have been a naturopathic docto r practicing in central Virginia for over 10 years. I am writing in s upport of full licensing of medically trained naturopathic doctors. I have found over the past 10 years that the care of my patients has been frequently disrupted, delayed, and limited due to the inability of me to practice to the full extent of my training. Because my appointment times are long, I am able to take a very thorough history, but I am unable to complete that evaluation with physical exams and laboratory testing (as I am trained). I frequently refer to general practitioners and specialists, but this would be greatly streamlined for the patient if I were able to send them with an appropriate assessment already completed. I understand that over the years, licensure has been denied to NDs due the idea that there is not enough risk of harm. I recall in 2010 when I moved here from Oregon, where I attended naturopathic m edical school and where NDs have a broad scope of practice, how patient after patient who sought my care claime d they had seen a naturopathic doctor in the past. Upon further investigation, the vast majority had seen a practitioner who called himself or herself a naturopathic doctor, despite having only done a short correspondence or online training. Not a single person knew that these \"NDs\" did not go to medical school and assumed they were being guided by a thoroughly trained professional. Another issue is that naturopathic doctors, like any other medical professionals, need to do regular c ontinuing education to assure that they are up- to-date on the latest medical research. Currently, there is no assurance that this happens. Over the past decade, natural medicine has become incr easingly sought-after, and I strongly believe that the public deserves to have a reliable way to asse ss whether their naturopathic doctor is not only properly trained, but doing their due diligence to keep their knowledge current. Thank you for taking the time to receive my opinion. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Mandy Reckers, ND 218 MONICA D. K LISZ, LPC Counseling for Recovery, Growth & Wellness 3111 Northside Avenue, Suite 101, Richmond, VA 23228 804.366.4330 TO: Dr. Elizabeth Carter, Department of Health Professions FROM: Monica D. Klisz, LPC RE: Licensing Naturopathic Doctors DATE: August 16, 2020 I am a psychotherapist in Richmond, VA writing in support of licensing Naturopathic doctors as full physicians with the ability to diagnosis and treat patients, provide complete physical exams and authorize labs and imaging for patients. In my work with clients I often have the honor and privilege of collaborating with local naturopathic doctors. In my experience naturopath's broad and holistic view often allows for solutions to complex and troubling medical conditions that are misdiagnosed or under treated by traditional Western medicine. I have also found naturopathic doctors to be quite adept in assessing for mental health issues, triaging and referring patients out for counseling to augment the medical treatment. This has consistently led to better outcomes for my clients. I would like to provide some important aspects related to licensure in reference to the seven criteria established by the Department of Health Professions. 1)Harm/risk of harm: Licensing naturopathic doctors provides a framework to differentiate lay healers from those that have been trained as naturopathic doctors. Other states within the US license naturopathic doctors. If a person moves to Virginia from a state that licensesnaturopathic doctors, they should be assured that they are getting a medical trainednaturopathic doctor. At this time due to Virginia not licensing naturopathic doctors, any layprovider or citizen is able to use the term \"naturopathic doctor\" without the appropriateeducation and training. This is an ethical issue and has the ability to lead to harm. 2)Specialty training: Naturopathic doctors have special training and skills not only in pharmacy but also plant medicine, homeopathy, counseling and nutrition. These individual skills may overlap with other disciplines within medicine, but naturopathic doctors know themcollectively and thus are aware of potential interactions and side effects of the combination ofsuch therapies. Additionally, naturopathic doctors are focused on prevention and holismwhich is also what makes them unique. 3)Scope of practice: Because naturopathic doctors are trained as medical professionals, they have the ability and competence to provide physical exams, order lab testing and imaging as well as in certain states prescribe drugs and even perform minor surgery. As with any 219MONICA D. K LISZ, LPC Counseling for Recovery, Growth & Wellness 3111 Northside Avenue, Suite 101, Richmond, VA 23228 804.366.4330 profession, each state has different scopes of practice that is set up. This should not be alarming. This should be catered to the population and needs of each state as long as the professional has the adequate training and has performed competency through licensing exams or other professional standards. There are times when a drug is warranted. Additionally, there are also times where patients have improved where they can be appropriately monitored and weaned off of pharmaceuticals. In order to provide this, you must also have prescribing privileges. Thus, having an appropriate scope of practice including pharmaceuticals, can be judiciously and ethically overseen to make sure patients have appropriate access to therapy just like other medical professionals within the Commonwealth. It is also important to note, there are many providers leaving medicine and without having some prescription authority could be detrimental to access to care for patients. One of the areas in medicine most lacking providers at this time is in mental health. Having additionally trained providers to adequately assess patients holistically when they are suffering with mental health concerns could reduce harm and delay of treatment. Given the robust and thorough approach of naturopaths, as well as the holistic and patient- centered nature of these providers I can only imagine how much it would enhance patient care and access to provide a licensure process and broaden what a naturopath can provide for patients. With this, I ask that the Board vote in favor of recommending naturopathic licensure within the Commonwealth. 220 90On Sun, Aug 16, 2020 at 4:43 PM Natalie Brock < natalie.b.brock@gmail.com > wrote: Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Natalie Brock, I have been a Virginia resident for 6 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 5 years. I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors. My naturopathic doctor takes such a well rounded approach to my health and never makes me feel rushed or insignificant. She was able to analyze my medical history, labs and genetics in order to support my many layers of underlying issues. I've never felt better and I credit it all to my naturopathic doctor. As a patient who supports licensure for medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria.1) Specialized skills. As someone who makes my health and wellness a priority I rely heavily on Naturopathic doctors as they consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are trained to provide are shared with other me dical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain areas that aren't included or emphasized in other practices. 2) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical provide rs do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medi cine. I also trust my ND to refer me to a specialist or another healthcare provider, in order to ensure the best care possible. 3) Scope of practice. As a working mother, now more than ever, I do not have the time nor childcare resources to run between multiple providers when my ND can provide the care I need. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. They are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosis for my medical records, and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential healthcare services that I would otherwise choose to receive from an ND. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well eq uipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring (I have lost 2 primary care doctors over the last 4 years), and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to providemedical services. 2214.) Alternatives to regulation. There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection re quirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia. While some alternative op tions may consider the real risk of harm that exists, they will not appropriately ex amine or take into consideration the other criteria that warrant licensing for naturopath ic doctors. As a patient and a consumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic docto rs will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I re spectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Natalie Brock Ashburn, VA 222 August 11, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Joseph Trindal, I have been a Virginia resident for 63 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 12 yea rs. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. Naturo pathic medical protocols help me manage a medical condition through supplements and diet wi th progress verified by a medical doctor. However, the medical doctor states that while my condition is managed, her practice requires recommendation of pharmacological treatment over supplement regimes. Virginia needs to recognize and legislatively allow the balance options of both allopathic and naturopathic treatments for its citizens. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopa thic doctors, here are a few of my concerns. As medical care commonly requires specialized expertise in a wide range of fields, licensure inclusion of naturopathic medi cal should be allowed in the Commonwealth. Failure to so license naturopa thic d octors, who have attain ed naturopathic medical degree cred entials from accredited U.S. universities, is a gross disservice to Virginia's citizens. 1) Risk of harm. There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never attended or graduated from medi cal school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. The lack of clarity in this distinction poses a risk to Virginians. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically-trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expe ct the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. The Commonwealth needs to adopt accountability standards of many other states in which medically-trained naturopathic doctors are licensed for the safety of their citizens. 2) Specialized skills. Naturopathic doctors consider the pa tient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approa ches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between co nvention and traditional medicine practice. 3) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice auto nomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor spec ifically because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowle dge in both conventional and natural medicine. It is the same as seeing other medically trained specialist doctors, like Doctors of Osteopathy (DOs). 223Letter from Joseph Trindal re: Support for Medically-Train ing Naturopathic Licensure 4) Scope of practice. Currently, Virginia's medically-train ed naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even te st for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointmen t with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. Medically- trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are re tiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that pa tients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provid e medical services -- including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti-hypertensiv es. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care provider s in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. 5) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained natu ropathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating addi tional access for patients. Naturopathic medicine promotes holistic wellness through medically proven standards. Wellness prevents and mitigates disease thereby lessening the over all burden on our strained medical systems. Licensing would also pave the ro ad to insurance coverage as it has in licensed states. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are una ble to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage.

Why should Virginia 's citizens be denied a ccess to levels of care afforded to citizens of so many other states? Medical doctors no more be expected to develop expertise in integrative care than they can be expected to have expertise in multiple medical disciplines. Licensure of medica lly-trained naturopathic doctors is right for the Post-COVID period and right for Virginia.

Given my personal experience with two vastly different individuals that both use the term Naturopath, I think this is of utmost impo rtance in ensuring Virginians have full transparency about the services they will receiv e. I have complex chronic health issues, and sought the help of a Naturopath in improving those conditions. The first Naturopath I worked with was a lay Naturopath that provided me options to the best of her abilities, what I did not realize was how limited those abilities were. After working with this particular Naturopath for about a year, and having limited progress and some set backs, I inquired about her training. When I found out she earned her degree online I was deeply disappointed. My expectations for quality of care could not be met with an online trained lay Naturopath. I did not realize that people could legally use the term Naturopath without medical training I later did my own investigation and found a Naturopathic Doctor who had attended medical school, who has helped me achieve a level of healing that is nothing short of miraculous. I ask you to please have Naturop athic Doctors licensed in Virginia so that citizens can make an informed choice. I didn't know what I didn't k now, and it cost me. I hope that greater transparency can be achieved through licensure. This would not only achieve cost savings for the public ( I incurred significant costs for ineffective treatments with the lay Naturopath) but prevent harm and confusion to the public.

I am currently in residency specializing in Lyme Disease in Vermont where we arelicensed to practice as full primary care physicians, and I hope to return to my home state where my entire family currently resides to open a private practice.

I grew up in Loudoun County, VA and attended the University of Virginia inCharlottesville, VA before heading to Bridgeport, Connecticut to pursue my doctorate.My parents, grandparents, and extended family all live across the Northern Virginia area. I plan on returning to my home state to practice medicine in the future. I amwriting in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I am currently in medical residency in Vermont specializing in Lyme Disease. I chose to go to Vermont due to the licensure and scope of practice in Vermont. I can practice as a primary care physician and prescribe basic pharmaceuticals. I am hoping to return to Virginia to bring what I'velearned and my specialties to the community I grew up around. Medical licensure to doctorate level trained Naturopathic Physicians would have immeasurable positive impacts to Virginia on a public health, economic, and societal level. As a patient, student, and now doctor who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 2271) Risk of harm. (There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically- trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low-risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. I am pursuing my residency in Vermont where I have been rigorously subjected to examinations and certifications to practice medicine at a doc torate level, Virginia would benefit greatly from creating distinction between doctors like myself, and practitioners without the same training I have received but using the same name. \u0015 Specialized skills. (Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. \u0003 They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient \u0003 interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and \u0003 natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and \u0003traditional medicine practice. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are \u0003trained to provide are shared with other medical professions, NDs do have specific \u0003education in certain areas that aren't included or emphasized in other practices.) Scope of practice. (Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer \u0003physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run \u0003a basic complete blood count in the state of Virginia. They are not allowed by law to\u0003 give a medical diagnosis for medical records, and must refer to another medical practice \u0003to access essential healthcare services that a patient would otherwise choose to receive \u0003 from an ND. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide \u0003 these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many \u0003 primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care \u0003 providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic \u0003 (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more \u0003 access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services. I can currently do \u0003 all the above-mentioned things in my current state of practice (Vermont) but also in the \u0003 District of Columbia and Maryland. I believe, Virginia should be next to benefit from \u0003what medically trained naturopathic doctors have to offer to my home state. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need, including my friends and family who reside in Northern Virginia and my Alma Mater in Charlottesville.

I fully support and hope that your committee will support licensure for medically trained Naturopaths. Our daughter, Cloe Franko, is a third year student at Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. She is pursuing a Doctor of Naturopathic me dicine degree specifically because of her understanding and belief in the modalities used by NDs to care for patients' health. As her parent I always knew Cloe had the inte lligence and aptitude for medicine. Her academic career has been stellar. She graduated as the Vale dictorian of her high school class. Later in College she excelled in sports and student go vernment graduated Summa Cum Laude and a Phi Beta Kappa member. It is important for Virginians have access to NDs. Licensure would encourage more NDs to practice across the state. I live in a very rural area and we ar e in need of NDs in this region of the state. I would be well cared for if Cloe could be my physician. I know many others in our region will have faith in her and choose to see her for healthcare. Since licensure is the first step toward enabling in surance to support visits with NDs, your action will allow this excellent form of care to many more citizens. I hope that you will support the licensure so Cloe can move back home to Virginia to pursue her vocation as a Naturopath able to practice with the full scope of skills used in her training. Not only is this advantageous for the community but will allow her to repay her st udent loans. Students who fund their education should not be at a disadvantage when their motivation is to serve others. Your support of licensure will affect a multitude of individuals and families, supporting NDs so they can support community health. As I better understand the differences between la y NDs and Medically trained NDs I am in full support of that distinction be established so that the public can recognize the differences when choosing their healthcare professional. Healthcare is technical and I am not willing to trust my medical professional unless they are highly educat ed and trained in their field. Lay NDs do not meet the criteria that should ever be considered comparable to medically trained NDs. Medically trained NDs should be licensed in order to reduce risk of harm to the public and increase accountability. Their specialized set of training and skills should be recognized and differentiated from other healthcare providers, in cluding and especially lay naturopaths. Enabling NDs to practice the full extent of their training will meet the needs of many who do not choose conventional western medicine thereby increasing the wellness in our state. Naturopathic medicine, just like all other medical professions, should have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. I salute your dedication to heal th and hope you will choose to support Medically trained NDs to be licensed in Vi rginia. It will be a great day when this is so. With respect, Jody Rose Franko 229 Brian Keenan, N.D. Magnolia Natural Medicine 434 Bridgewater Street Fredericksburg, VA 22401 T: (540) 324-8614 www.MagnoliaNaturalMedicine.com August 14th, 2020 To the Board of Health Professions, My name is Dr. Brian Keenan, I am a naturopathic doctor who enjoyed working in Fredericksburg Virginia. I made the decision to move to Maryland to continue to build my practice because of the legal recognition and scope of practice that is available in that state. I believe this is a disservice to the people of Virginia, who desire and will benefit from working with naturopathic doctors who are clinically trained to work within the current healthcare model and offer their expertise in the increasingly utilized world of naturopathic medicine. In order to understand naturopathic medicine's role in the conventi onal medical model, it is paramount that naturopathic doctors understand the conventional system as well as the evidence relating to natural products and their employment in the overall health and treatment of individuals seeking this care. This can only be achieved through the current educational parameters that are in place for accredited naturopathic medical schools. By choosing to license this profession in the stat e of Virginia, we will be expanding the group of providers that are able to diagnose and treat illnesses, as well as protect patients from the confusion between \"lay naturopaths\" who do not have any medical training, and naturopathic doctors who do. Additionally, licensure will allow naturopathic doctors in the state to finally be able to practice to the full scope of their training. Thank you for your time and consideration reading this note. On a personal note, I hope that you decide in favor of licensing naturopathic doctors in Virginia so I can return home and practice in the state that I love and hope to serve to the full extent of my abilities as a naturopathic doctor. Sincerely, Brian Keenan, ND. 230 Dear Member of the Committee My name is Lorraine McCarthy, I have be en a Virginia resident for 30 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 8 years. I am writing in support of recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I saw a rheumatologist for undifferentiated connective tissue disease. They prescribed medication, but the side effect s were way worse than the symptoms. I found a naturopathic doctor who listened to my concerns and conditions. My conditions improved tremendously with supplements and dietary recommendations. If naturopathic doctors could order lab work, I wouldn't have to go my rheumatologist just for lab work which puts unnecessary costs onto me as a patient. Although seeing a naturopathic doctor has be en very helpful to me, without insurance coverage it's been a financial challenge. Licensing naturopathic doctors serves as the first step to reducing the out of pocket exp enses for me in order that lab work can be ordered as part of my visit and possible office s visits may be partially covered if I submit a superbill to my insurance company. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic docto rs will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need, due to their role in preventative medicine. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia Sincerely Lorraine McCarthy Aylett, VA 231August 16, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,My name is Moira Tokarick, I have been a Virginia resident for 6 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 5. I am writing in support of a recommendation forlicensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors. I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with a medically trained naturopathic doctor as I have many adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals, which many primary care physicians seem toreadily prescribe. I have through the last 20 years had several prescriptions written only to find Iwas severely allergic to them after taking one or two doses (e.g., vomiting, dizziness, tachycardia, ...to name a few of the side effects). It is a necessity to be able to work with a doctor who can find alternatives that I am able to take to support wellness. As a patient who supports licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors, here are specifics as it relates to two of the seven criteria. 2) Specialized skills. My medically trained Naturopathic doctor considers my health holistically. As previously mentioned, I have severe allerg ies to pharmaceuticals, specifically morphine and codeine derivative a well as pseudoephedrine. As an example, any time I have a cold and require medicine I am unable to find anything over the counter -this is also true for allergy medicine as I am only able to tolerate basic Benadryl. My naturopathic doctor recommends supplements and or changes in diet to enable my body to work for itself. I feel that she truly bridges the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice to support my care. 4) Scope of practice. While my medically trained naturopathic doctor cannot offer physical exams or even run a basic complete blood count, she is the one that I take my results to for discussion about what may need to be altered in terms of diet or supplements. Neither my primary care physician nor my gynecologist for women's wellness exams (both of whom have order blood work for me in the past) have ever taken time to talk through the result with me. I must schedule with these doctors, get my lab work done, and reschedule with my medically trained naturopathic doctor to follow up. It is inconvenient and my wellbeing and overall health does not seem to be their priority. If I do try to engage in discussions with them, I am put off as I am not a doctor. I am an educated woman however and do take a very proactive role in my health. My naturopathic doctor understands this and respects this. That is why she is always my first call. I am requesting that medically trained naturopathic doctors have the same rights and privileges of other medically trained docto rs. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

Sincerely, Chris Gilson Moseley, VA 236 94This Page Intentionally Left BlankAugust 1 6, 2020 Virginia Board of Health Professions Regulatory Research Committee Dear Members of the Committee: The District of Columbia Association of Naturopathic Physicians (DCANP) is writing to support licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Naturopathic Doctors (ND) have been licensed in the District of Columbia since 2007. NDs are licensed by the Board of Medicine, a division within the D.C. Department of Health, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (HRLA), which has the responsibility to regulate the practice of medicine in the District of Columbia. Our scope of practice is comprehensive to include complete physical evaluation, laboratory assessment, diagnosis and treatment, including minor surgery. We maintain our license with required continuing education. Currently, we are working with the D.C. Board of Medicine to expand our current prescriptive formulary to reflect our pharmacology education and training as primary care physicians. As a jurisdiction that attained licensure for naturopathic doctors over 13 years ago, it is concerning to us that our counterparts just a very short distance across the border are unable to practice in accordance with their scope of training. Lack of licensure creates public confusion and poses a safety issue; consumers seeking an ND would expect the same level of care in Virginia that they would receive in D.C. from a licensed naturopathic doctor. At present, because licensure is lacking in Virginia, lay practitioners with no clinical diagnostic or laboratory training call themselves a naturopathic 'doctor'. There is currently no way to distinguish levels of education, training and experience between provider types. Licensure is the only means capable of both ensuring the necessary clarity about provider type, as well as promoting safe access to care. There are many licensed naturopathic doctors who live in Virginia, but then have successful practices in D.C. due to its scope of practice. It is also important to note that naturopathic medicine has a unique and specialized scope of practice. It is for this very reason that licensing is warranted. In practice, naturopathic medicine is a hybrid of conventional medical diagnosis with the application of natural therapies for treatment. NDs draw from a broad range of therapies that may overlap with other health professions, as is the case with many other licensed providers within Virginia. What sets a naturopathic doctor apart is their clinical diagnostic training, which is comparable to that of a medical doctor. NDs are well qualified to be able to identify when patients require a referral for emergency intervention, or to a specialist. Furthermore, it is this unique training and scope that make NDs fully capable of interacting cohesively within the healthcare system and only licensing would enable them to do this. The DCANP, representing 61 naturopathic doctors, strongly supports licensing of medically-trained naturopathic doctors in the Commonwealth of Virginia and respectfully urges the Board to make a recommendation for licensure. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I was having severe and painful skin allergies, hair loss, hormone imbalance and mild depression. Once we got the skin allergies under control everything seem to start falling back into place. For my daughter, when she was an infant she had constant ear infections where the pediatrician suggested one more ear infection and we would need to put tubes in her ears. I consulted a naturopathic doctor and every time my daughter got the slightest cold, which would normal bring on a terrible ear infection, I followed the advice of the naturopathic doctor and her ear aches went away. I wouldn't have believed it myself if I had not lived through it. My mother was even amazed.

Sincerely, Megan 304-920-9896 | danielpuckett2012@gmail.com Dear Members of the Committee: My name is Dr. Daniel J Puckett and I am a pharmacist in the New River Valley. I have been practicing in Virginia for over 8 years and have worked in the field of pharmacy for over 12 years in rural areas across our country. I had a career change two years ago because I needed to get out of the chain setting and back to my roots to practice more as a \"hometown pharmacist\". I took this jump because I felt as a country, a state, and a corporation my previous employer had lost touch with the reason for my profession and healthcare. I am currently working in an independent pharmacy setting which allows me to provide direct consultations, medication therapy management appointments, immunization screenings and so-forth. I grew up in the poorest of poor towns. I lived learning the health disparities rural people face. I know what it is like having your parents drive over an hour to their doctor. Currently, my parents drive almost two hours to their primary care physician. I chose a small pharmacy school in Oakwood, Virginia with their goal of improving access to rural Americans. While obtaining my doctorate, I was able to work with and learn from two wonderfully amazing Naturopathic doctors for three years. They were beaming lights of alternative therapies and provided great hands-on teaching behaviors that really honed my skills to be a direct patient care pharmacist. Being new to the healthcare team, I saw the benefit to these healthcare professionals as they had a diverse knowledge base ranging from natural remedies, nutrition and traditional drug therapies. My newest job allows me to provide more access to patients, but sad to say, even after 8 years, things still aren't great in our area. I know our problem isn't just related to the New River Valley or Virginia for that matter. I have patients waiting weeks, months even before they can get to see a primary care provider. At my age, I am shocked that after 30 plus years, providers are still simply not easily available. For these reasons, and those listed below, I am advocating for Naturopathic doctors to be allowed to be licensed within the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is imperative that Virginia join the other 25 states or provinces that have recognized the specialized skills that Naturopathic doctors have developed. They have an initial mindset of preventative medicine and practice with a whole-body approach. As I am sure you are aware, they graduate from a 4-year medical program and take a national licensing exam. Their education consists of nutrition, botanical therapies, and typical pharmacology. In addition, they are given the opportunity to commit to 242 2 residency training that can range from 1 to 3-year programs. In addition, they can and do work with patients that have rare illnesses or those who have failed multiple therapies. I have had patients fail more traditional therapies and were forced to travel to northern states to seek alternative treatments. This brings me to my second point, the economic impact paid by the patient and lost by the state. As in the aforementioned patient, they were forced to drive five to six hours one way to seek the alternative treatment. Virginians are paying more money for fuel and lodging because they can't obtain these visitations locally. Considering the healthcare crisis our country is facing, the system is under extreme stress. Many primary offices in my area are closed to routine visits and the ones open are backlogged for patients. If Virginia were to open the doors to allow Naturopathic physicians to become licensed, Virginia could see an uptick of revenue and patients could spend less money traveling and more money in Virginia. Patients may be misled to think their provider is an officially trained individual due to the state not having a licensing protocol. By licensing Naturopathic physicians, we also better ensure that Virginians understand the difference between a \"lay healer\" and a true medical professional who has un dergone rigorous education and training. By doing so, we can limit the risk of harm that may be done by someone who has no official degree in medicine. Lastly, when considering COVID-19, if a Naturopathic physician was licensed and practicing in the scope of physical exams, imaging and labs, they could be utilized to lighten the load across the state and provide better access to care and diagnostics. Let us recognize the benefits of providing access to an additional medical source. A source which has undergone extensive medical education and training. A source which has a history of safety, efficacy, and cost savings through preventative treatments. Our healthcare of Virginia requires a multifaceted approach. Will you help us achieve our goal, a better, healthier Virginia through improved access? Thank you for taking time to read and consider my letter. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have further questions or concerns.

For over 10 years now, I, as well as my immediate family have pers onally benefited from using naturopathic medicine from a trained naturopathic doctor for various medical ailments and conditions preventing visits to traditional Medical Doctors. When I was 16 years old I was under the care of a naturopathic doctor who developed a systematic plan in dealing with a chronic fatigue, digestive, and blood sugar issues. It is my personal opinion that ND licensure in Virginia would benefit the public greatly in these areas: 1. Naturopathic doctors consider their patients health holistically. They bridge the gap between conventional and traditional medicine practice. 2. Naturopathic doctors offer treatment/ holistic services not offered by traditional medical doctors. 3. Naturopathic doctors could assi st medical doctors and many basic functions such as physical exams, laboratory testing, and testing for COVID-19. This will alleviate much to the burden of other medical providers which are in shorthand. 4. Allowing naturopathic doctors licensure would also pave the way for insurance coverage of their services. In an era of chronic disease, Virginians need increased access to preventative healthcare services that medically trained naturop athic doctors are suited to provide. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will help provide safe health care for patients in need.

I am a recently graduated naturopathic doctor from the N ational University of Natural Medicine, the oldest accredited naturopathic medical university in the United Stat es of America and considered a medically trained naturopathic doctor. I have also be en under the care of a medically tr ained naturopathic doctor for over 4 years. I am writing in support of full licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors, because my purpose for going to naturopathic medical school has always been to return to Virginia and serve my community with this much needed medicine. The ch ronic disease burden is just as high in Virginia as it is all over the country, and there is no reason in my mind to limit our community's health options. I have many friends and family members eagerly awaiting naturopathic me dical care in Virginia and wish to provide them with the best care possible in line with my skills and training. And I have p ersonally been successfully treated for migraines naturally under my medically tr ained naturopathic doctor in Oregon, without the use of pharmaceuticals and surgical implants as previous conventional doctors had tried to recommend. I have spent the last 5 years completing a rigoro us medical program in the state of Oregon, where naturopathic physicians have full scope to practice primary care medicine, prescribe legend drugs, and more. While that is only a compon ent of what we do, I mention that to illustrate the breadth of our scope in a fully licensed state. Naturopathic doct ors are trained in botanical medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, lifestyle/behavioral medicine, hydrotherapy, and physical medicine extensively, with the same depth and rigor as any other medicine/modality. We are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. And as we are extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, we help bridge the gap that exists between conventional (MD/DO/NP etc) and traditional (ND/Chinese Medicine/Ayurv eda/DC etc) medical practice, improving care coordination and reducing harm for our patients, es pecially those already under the care of several types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they have been able to safely access care from medically trained naturopathic doctors. These patients - who expect the same level of regulation and scope in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically trained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. As a naturopathic doctor, I want to know that if a colleague causes harm, they will be discip lined by a regulatory board with the authority to restrict a practice license - not just sued in civil court or reported to a business bureau. Currently, medically trained naturopath ic doctors in Virginia cannot offer physical exams, or order labs and imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. We are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosis for a p atient's medical records and must refer to another provider to access essential healthcare services that I would otherwise have been able to offer them at the time of their visit. Medically trained naturopath ic doctors are well equipped to provide these basic health care services (annual visits, physical exams, ordering lab work, etc.), eliminating the need for 245added appointments and reducing barriers to care. Ma ny primary care providers are retiring, increasing the shortage of primary care providers in the state of Virginia. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for me ntal health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-t rained to provide these medical services. Now more than ever we require medically naturopathic doctors to be able to help during this national healthcare crisis. There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia. While some alternative options may consider the real risk of harm that exists, they will not approp riately examine or take into consideration the other criteria that warrant licensing for naturopathic doctors. As a patient and a consumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for medically trained naturopathic doctors in the state of Virginia. Licensing will allow for additional healthcare access and safe, natural medicine options for all.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained na turopathic doctors. My natu ropathic doctor is wonderful in that she looks at all aspects of my health and well being. As a patient who supports licensure for medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Risk of harm . Of course, I would expect that my doctor has been trained and has a license. I am surprised that to learn recent ly that there are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but wh o never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers.

There is risk of harm in al l medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia). 2) Specialized skills . I love the fact that my doctor does not automatically turn to the latest designer drug. Naturopathic doctors consider the pa tient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. 3) Autonomous practice. I love knowing that my doctor is trained in both conventional and wholistic practice. Naturopathic docto rs practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medically prov iders do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. 4) Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; th ey cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. From the patient perspective this creates an added burden - as patients need to then schedule an additional appointment with their primary care provider in order to access labs and basic medications. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these basic health care 247practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical serv ices -- including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti-hypertensives. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. 5) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creat ing additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insuranc e coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use prop er coding that would enable insurance coverage. In this era of chronic disease, where it's burden and impact fall disproportionately to the medically underse rved, Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide.

I am the founder and head PT of Total Health Physical Therapy, offering physical therapy ser-vices in both Herndon, Virginia and Washington DC. I am writing today to support theregulation of medically-trained naturopath ic doctors in Virginia through licensure. As a PT trained in an advanced and highly specialized form of physical therapy knownas Integrative Manual Therapy (IMT), I am often consulted with in chronic complex con-ditions that have not resolved with conventional western medicine alone. For the past 10 years I have found myself working in collaboration with naturopathic doctors, as our work dovetails nicely, and together we are able to offer solutions in themost challenging of clinical cases. Because NDs understand that human organ sys-tems operate holistically, they are also awa re of the importance of addressing structure in treatment -for this reason we have a natural synergy in our approaches. It is much easier for me to collaborate with my ND colleagues in DC where NDs are reg- ulated through licensure as their scope enables them to order labs and the appropriatediagnostic imaging tests. In Virginia, we need to seek out a third party for these basicand common tests. Because this is cumbersome, costly and time inefficient, it is a dis-service to the constituents of Virginia. As you are most aware naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. Licensing is the most appropriate level of regu-lation for medically-trained health care professionals. I urge the Board to vote in favor of licensure for naturopathic doctors during their review process, and I look forward to being able to support them again in the 2021 legislativesession. Sincerely, Lisa Klein, PT 249August 16, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Sarah Guidry, I have been a Virginia resident for 1.5 years and I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor for over 20 years. I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. Receiving naturopathic care has helped me more than any Primary Care Physician or Specialist ever has. When I was 8 years old, my parents brought me to a medically-trained Naturopathic Doctor after years of suffering through chronic migraines and visiting countless Doctors and Specialists. It was only after undergoing the care of my ND that my chronic migraines finally found relief. When I was 18 years old, I had a very traumatic near-death experience with MRSA Staph Infection. For two years after this experience, I continued contracting this infection. Through years of intense antibiotics, my physical health and mental health reached an all-time low. I visited many Doctors to address my issues, only to be given more drugs that caused me more harm than good. I developed a plethora of crippling ailments. It wasn't until I visited my ND that I finally cured my many severe internal issues due to years of antibiotics destroying my system. Lastly, one year ago, after suffering through extreme depression and anxiety caused by both PCOS and PMDD, I once again found relief and optimal health through the care of a medically-trained Naturopathic Doctor. My whole life Doctors practicing traditional medicine have failed to improve my health or made matters worse. Naturopathic work has been the only practice to actually help me and optimize my well-being. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. Specialized skills - After being diagnosed by an OBGYN with both PCOS and PMDD, I felt very unsupported by my conventional Doctor. I was told the only way to help my symptoms were to take anti-depressants and simply \"eat a healthy diet,\" which I was already doing. This did not work for me. This level of \"care\" brought me to my most recent medically-trained ND. Her expertise in hormones has helped me tremendously! Both my mental health and physical health has drastically become stronger since being under my ND's care. I truly believe that I wouldn't receive the same results with someone who wasn't a specialist in the very complicated and fragile field of hormones. It would be very frightening to think what my outcome would have been if I became a patient for a Naturopath who wasn't medically trained or hadn't had the education/training in the field of hormones. Economic impact - Being that Naturopathic doctors cannot be properly coded for possible insurance coverage, patients are forced to choose between conventional forms of care or paying out of pocket for naturopathic care. By making alternate forms of care available provides the first step for coverage by insurance companies; the patient could now spend their hard-earned money on other healthy lifestyle choices. This could free up funds for gym memberships, a healthy diet, or a new outdoor hobby; all of which would benefit the individual as well as the community. 250 Additionally, I have a personal example. After losing a job, I was forced to postpone my appointment with my ND by a month and a half due to financial constraints. Within this 45 day period, my mental and physical health plummeted dramatically. Even though I knew I needed the care from this appointment, I could not realistically afford to go. Had my care been covered under insurance, I would have been able to see my ND at the opportune time and not experience a major health set-back that has now elevated the level of care that I require. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I have since returned to my home in Virginia and am anxious to begin practi cing my profession and offering my care to the residents of Virginia. I currently hold a license to practice naturopathic medicine in Washington D.C. and must have patients tr avel from VA to DC in order to receive care. Without licensure in Virginia, naturopathic doct ors and their patients will continue to take their business out of state. However, with lic ensure of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, I could more readily serve the people in my local community while also promoting the growth of small businesses and our local economy. Please help me help our residents and our economy by licensing naturopathic doctors! Additionally, the student loans associated wi th any medical training are significant and play a large role in determining where a naturo pathic doctor practices upon graduation. Many new doctors, such as myself, have no choice but to work in a licensed state where they can earn an income sufficient enough to pay back their debt. I love my hometown and I am proud to be a resident of Virginia. All of my (very large) family lives here and I would love nothing more than to get to stay here and support myself. As both a patient and a provider who su pports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Risk of harm.

Sincerely, Bridget Vander Woude, ND 2531215 Mall Dr. Richmond, VA 23235 Re: Letter of support for Naturopath Licensure Greetings Dr. Elizabeth Carter, & Committee Members: I am a board certified licensed clinical psycholog ist practicing in Richmond, Virginia as well as Washington DC and North Carolina. I have been a reside nt of the great Commonwea lth of Virginia for 10 years. While attending graduate school in Washington state, I had the wonderful experience of being treated by a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) for approximately five year s. She served both as part of an overall team and as a singular contributor to my health. Her name was Dr. Molly Brignall and she saved my life. To explain, for a few years I suffered with th e effects of hypothyroidism. I saw several allopathic physicians during that time and they completed all of the various tests. Repeatedly, they ignored the constellation of symptoms as well as the test results that showed my TSH levels did indicate hypothyroidism, but it was still near the range of normal. They kept suggesting that I was psychologically depressed and I only learned about my results after pressing the allopath ic physician to review the l ab results with me. It was around this time that I learned about the existence of Naturopaths. I saw Dr. Brignall and she completed a thorough examination and outline d a holistic treatment plan that inc luded addressing the true root of my physical complaints. Her treatment process worked quickly and wonderfully. Of note, Naturopaths are licensed in Washington and were covered by my insuran ce. She had a full caseload, but she took the time to review everything with me. With in a very short time of addressing the real issue my life began to change substantially and it is my firm belief that Dr. Brignall saved my life in more ways than one. While traditional approaches are valuable and useful to address the broad array of issues, there is a need for a diversity of perspectives when addressing the unique needs of the population. The need for a diversity of perspectives and approaches is highly im portant and could not be more evident than now- given the zeitgeist. I am sure that you all are as aware as I am that not all patient issues will conform to standard avenues of practice and not all patients are comfortable with traditional approaches of practice. It is my firm personal and professional opinion that this great Comm onwealth would be served well when it embraces the naturopathic field and allows them to appropriately practice as a valued member of the treatment team! I fully support licensure for medic ally trained ND's. I also understand th at there are six criterion that are reviewed when considering the path for licensure of health professions. 1)Risk of harm: There are folk healers and herbalists wh o call themselves ND's, but have had little to no formal medical training and have not attended a medical school. Given that I know the public frequently confuses psychiatry with psychology, their ability to understand the lack of qualifications of such people is likely limite d. They may falsely believe that such individuals are safe and have been appropriately vetted by Commonwealth authorities. Additionally, if and when a person is harmed by such poorly tr ained practitioners there is little to no recourse Advanced Behavioral Health Services, LLC Mental health care for many concerns 254 for them to address the issue and protect others. Furthermore, such practitioners have no oversight and very limited guidelines for practice . Also, it is highly impo rtant to consider that many residents of Virginia, like myself, come from states that license ND's and automatically assumes that those calling t hemselves ND's in the Commonwealth are licensed, had been vetted, and are monitored here as well. I have a serious concern both as a consumer of the naturopathic services as well as a health pr ofessional that we do not have this oversight in Virginia. 2)Specialized skills : From my experience, I benefited greatly from the naturopathic approach. Dr. Brignall considered numerous aspects of my physical, psychological, and sociological symptom profile and was able to holistically arrive at an accurate case conceptualization. When I questioned my allopathic physician why we were not addressing the hypothyroid issue, he focused on only one aspect of my symptoms and that was that the lab result was close to the normal range. Like all the other allopathic doctors before him, he ignored all other aspects of my clinical picture and exp lained away the lab results and continued to insist that I was psychologically depressed and pressed me to take antidepressant medications, which I did not need. Dr. Brignal l's knowledge base also included an awareness of drug/herb and drug/nutrient interactions an d how such things can bring about beneficial change for her patients. I benefited greatly fro m this knowledge, which is unique to ND's. She had an in depth knowledge of medical conditions and bodily processes and a perspective that substantially added to my ability to not only recover from my condition but to improve/thrive in my life in other ways not emphasized in other approaches to medical practice. 3)Autonomous practice : In my experience, Dr. Brignall pr acticed autonomously and actively participated in my overall treatment team alongside other providers to include allopathic physicians to address all of my healthcare needs . While I preferred to see her as my primary care physician, she did not hesitate to refer me to a specialist to address a unique issue. I chose her because she could conceptualize my conditions through a unique and morecomplete/accurate manner than my previous, mo re traditional, physicians did. I trusted her to guide me to the appropriate trea tment options and she never failed me. 4)Scope of practice : Currently, appropriately trained ND's can't order specific labs or imaging services. Additionally, they cannot even test for the coronavirus or run a basic blood panel. In the Commonwealth, they are not even allowed to offer a diagnosis for medical records. From my experience with Dr. Brignall and ot her members of her naturopathic clinic in Washington, she was well-equipped and trained to provide the full scope of services and did so without the need for added steps or oversight . This substantially im proved my ability to receive care in an appropriate amount of time. Wi th so many providers being stricken by the coronavirus as well as retiring from service the need for appropriately licensed ND's has never been greater. Many providers, including myself, are facing added burdens because of the pandemic and given ND's have more training and understanding of the intersection of psychology and physiology, their unique perspective and skill set is highly needed to reduce the burden on all of us, including the general public. 5) Economic impact: Allowing the licensure of appropriately trained ND's would easily improve access to care and contribute to a reduction in overall costs in care. When more providers 255are available, it is easy to understand that economic competition can reduce costs as well as improve efficient service provision. A licensed ND's could bill insurance for their services and this would substantially reduce the economic burden on those seeking their unique skill set. Additionally, ND's hold the firm belief that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and this is also very co st-effective. With licensure, Commonwealth citizens will have increased access to preventive healthcare services that are emphasized by the unique skill set of ND's. Additionally, they are more tra ined in the use of, and also prone to utilize the services of mental health providers that num erous studies have shown substantially reduces overall cost to insurance companies and the community when addressing chronic diseases like diabetes that almost always needs a behavioral health type intervention. 6)Alternative t o regulation: I do not know of any other alternative to regulating the licensure of ND's. As mentioned, I had no idea that ND's we re not licensed in this great Commonwealth until I recently sought out their services and I do not understand the reasoning behind not licensing them previously. I just assumed that they had this needed level of oversight because their usefulness has been proven bey ond all doubt to me from my experience as well as my review of the avail able literature. As a consumer of such services as well as a behavioral health provider, I think there is a very real harm in not regulating this much- needed avenue of healthcare provision. As a prof essional, I also want to be able to know that when I refer an individual to a naturopath, which I have done numerous times, that such an individual has been appropriately vetted and has ongoing oversight by our government. The licensure of appropriately trained Naturopathic Doctors who have completed accredited medical programs is sorely needed in our great Commonwealth. Our health system is being su bstantially stressed by this pandemic and there is no end in sight. Even before the rise of the coronavirus, the need for their unique perspective and skill set was high. L icensing them will provide additional vetted/safe healthcare options for Virginians. I respectfully request that you Dr. Cart er, and the other members of the board of health professions, recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in the great Commonwealth of Virginia. Please feel free to contact me at my clini c's number of (804) 594-3690 should you have any additional questions. Respectfully submitted, Alan T.

My name is Hanna Schmittat ND, LAc, Dipl Ac (NCCAOM). I have been a naturopathic doctor for over 4 years. I am writing in support of full licensing of medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I have been practicing in both Virginia and Maryland for the past 2 years. As a Licensed Acupuncturist, I have had the opportunity to help people in acute and chronic pain using Acupuncture; but with it's limitations. If any of my patients needed lab work, I'd be able to order them easily in Maryland, as a licensed naturopathic doctor. You can imagine the the frustration and disbelief of my patients when I tell them to schedule a visit with their other licensed doctor, who may or may not decide to run their labs for them. If the primary care doctor has a difference in view, it is often the case that they refuse to order the labs or will only run a portion - providing an incomplete picture. It is not uncommon for it to require 2-4 additional visits to get the needed labs; costing time, money, and creating additional frustration in the patient's busy life. Oftentimes, the patient will have to drive up an additional hour or hour and a half to my Maryland office - for me to run the appropriate labs. Licensing would help increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. As I described above, due to limitation of access to licensing, many of my patients w ill drive 1-1.5 hours to visit my Maryland office, when they could be visiting my Alexandria VA office within 15 min of a drive. As a naturopathic doctor who wishes to practice to the full scope of my training, and provide the help that patients need and deserve, I find myself having to ask patients to put their time and financial resources into bordering jurisdictions. As an Acupuncturist who takes insurance, I understand the desire for people to run their labs and their visit through insurance, especially if they have checked and know that insurance would cover a lab test, if scripted by a Licensed Naturopathic doctor in Maryland. Without the ability to obtain insura nce coverage, many Vi rginians (including many who don't have access to available care in Virginia), are unable to access -or will have to drive up to 1 - 1.5 hours across neighboring jurisdictions to get access to the preventative services of the naturopathic doctors in those licensed jurisdictions where they are so well positioned to be able to provide the necessary preventative care. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Sincerely, Dr Hanna Schmittat, ND, LAc, Dipl Ac (NCCAOM) 257August 16, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,My name is Shelley Painter, and I am a Virginia resident.

Why should I have to travel an hour plus or as many as 4-5 hours to a state that has medically trained naturopaths? The state of Virginia has sadly not recognized the bene ts of a non pharmaceutical approach to medical conditions. Recently, I learned that I have the genes that do not tolerate medications well. Naturopaths (a 4 year degree) are extensively trained in conventional and natural approaches and speci cally trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient modalities. Hopefully living in a free country with the freedom to select the holistic methodologies (allopathic, naturopathic, and/or homeopathic) that I feel will best bene t me, I respectfully ask that you urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I also believe Natural Health does not pose a risk to the public. Our position is that any law creating licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia must provide exceptions and protection for those unlicensed workers who do not pose a risk of harm to our citizens This bill wants to give the designation of Naturopathic Doctor to certain individuals and to license them. Many of us Virginians have had the Naturopathic Doctorate for many decades before these schools were even around. This bill is negating my degree that I earned and only giving credence to the individuals who have been to school recently. If you want someone to license, please give them a different title. Perhaps a Holistic Naturopathic Doctor is a better title to be licensed. Requiring traditional naturopaths with a doctorate to have to go to one of these expensive schools to learn drugs and procedures that we don't believe in just so we can keep our degree title is unrealistic. It is also unrealistic and unfair to take away the designation we were granted after fulfilling the degree requirements of our schools. Requirements that were around before legislators decided to get involved. There are doctors of education, doctors of business and doctors in many other areas and their degree titles are not being threatened. The past studies have shown that lic ensing naturopaths is not necessary. If these \"new naturopaths\" wa nt to play doctor, then give them a different title and have them licensed under the medical authorities (either the nursing board or doctor board) but leave the traditional naturopaths who only use alternative health practices alone. If you are determined to license these folks, then allow for exceptions to protect those of us who \"do no harm\" with our natural health practices and supplements.

I could spend a lot of time going over all the reasons they should be licensed, but to me it all boils down to what I believe are human rights. To me, people have the basic right to autonomy. They should have easy access to the care provider of their choice. Licensure ensures th at people know if they are currently hiring a licensed naturopath, or someone who works in nat ural medicine, but isn't a medically trained naturopath. There is a big difference and people have the right to know. Anyone who goes to school long enough and trains hard enough to have \"Dr\" i n front of their name deserves the respect of a state license. Please support the right of people to make their own health care decisions and with the provider of their choice. Thank you for reading my letter.

I have lived here for 28 years and have a long and complex medical history. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors have proven to be most valuable in my health journey. But I had to drive to Washington, D. C. to find such a naturopathic doctor who was licensed to practice. There are naturopaths in my area, whom I know and respect, but since Virginia does not license them, th ey are not able to provide many services, such as blood work and other tests. They have many areas of expertise that are not addressed by allopathic physicians, espec ially non-pharmaceutical approaches. I have learned that I am extremely sensitive to drugs and only take them as a last resort, which requires a doctor with well-rounded expertise, such as a naturopath. I have had to juggle my needs among many allopathic doctors who cannot meet my needs for holistic approaches, such as nutrition, herbology, homeopathy, recommendations for bodywork and emotiona l and spiritual work, etc. This adds additional stress to my already complicated heal th challenges. If I want to avail myself of the expertise of a medically-licensed natu ropath, I have to drive to another state. I have wondered for many years why Virg inia does not license medically-trained naturopaths. Is it because the licensure ag ency supports the pharmaceutical industry? Please urge the Board to recommend that medically-trained naturopaths be licensed. Such licensure will provide safeguards for those of us who require a more wide-ranged approach to healthcare.

I was previously licensed in Missouri and Puerto Rico. The focus of this letter is to support and recommend licensure for naturopaths who are medically trained in accredited naturopathic medical schools. Over many years in practice and in personal experience, I have learned that medicine is an art as well as a science. I have also learned that there are many modalities to approach \"the healing process.\" Recently, I have used a number of homeopathic remedies for allergies, sleep, and a canker sore, with very good results. Naturopaths are more acquainted with homeopathic remedies than are allopathic physicians. The naturopathic doctor would also have the training to refer the patient to the appropriate allopathic doctor, if needed. In a climate of reduced medical staff and greater need for medical care, Virginia can only bene t by licensing the naturopaths in its state.

I am writing in support of arecommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. My health and quality of life has improved immensely from working with a medically- trained naturopathic doctor. My naturopat hic doctor not only helped me regain health after cancer but helped me achieve a higher level of health than before. I no longerneed or use the five prescription drugs I was taking. I cannot say enough positive thingsabout how my life has changed and improved. I know this would not be possible withoutan ND with the medical training and skill that mine has. I feel fortunate to be under hercare and wish for others to have the same opportunity. As a patient who supports licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1) Risk of harm. There are traditional practicing naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who have no medical school training. Most people do not know the difference between these two types of providers. I find this all the time when I talk to friends and acquaintances about my experience working with my naturopathic doctor. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from a medically-trained naturopathic doctors. The issue becomes that many of these patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low-risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. As a patient, I also want to feel confident that if an ND causes harm, they will be disciplined by a regulatory board with the authority to restrict a practice license -not just sued in civil court or reported to a business bureau. 2) Specialized skills. Naturopathic doctors look at the whole person and consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. Given they are extensively trained in both 264 101conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap between conventional and traditional medicine. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are trained to provide are shared with other medical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain areas that aren't included or emphasized in other practices and therefore not available through conventional medicine. 3) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors are able to practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I s ee my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine and therefore cannot offer me the same care and results. I absolutely trust my ND to refer me to a specialist or another healthcare provider, if needed in order to ensure the best care possible. 5) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing, overextended healthcare system by allowing access to more patients. Licensing would also pave the way to insurance coverage not currently available. Given the amount of chronic disease in this country, often disproportionately affecting those least able to afford healthcare, the health of Virginians could be significantly improved with access to medic ally-trained naturopathic doctors, ultimately reducing the cost and burden on the healthcare system. My own experience proves this. All Virginians deserve access to the preventative healthcare that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. 6.) Alternatives to regulation. There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia. While some alternative options may consider the real risk of harm that exists, they will not appropriately examine or take into consideration the other criteria that warrant licensing for naturopathic doctors. As a patient, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. For the benefit of many, I respectfully urge theBoard to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

Wh ile I have been a resident of Maryland for over 25 years, I have been under the care of a naturopathic doctor who resides in Virginia for over 10 years. I am writing my support for the recommendation of licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors for Virginia. I started my search for a naturopathic do ctor that was medically trained about 10 years ago. I found that many naturopathic doctors in Northern Virginia were in better proximity to my residence than many of those in Maryland. I was looking for a naturopathic doctor who treated the whole body holistically instead of compartmentalizing a specific a rea without concern as to the cause. I was not interested in simply covering up the symptoms. I am very interested in preventative and maintaining my health as I get older. I appreciate the fact that my naturopathic doctor understands the me dical terms of my reports, and I only wish she could order labs fo r me so I could avoid extra visits to my internist. I also trust my naturopathic doctor to the point that I have recommended her to other family members and they are patients as well. It is so important in today s climate that we have licensed naturopathic doctors in Virginia as they can provide support and preventative health care.

I have been a Virginia resident for 49 years and I was under the care of a naturopathic doctor for about two and a half years. I appreciated working with this medically-trained naturopathic doctor because of the extended time she was able and willing to spend asking questions and listening to my concerns, and also because I was able to be helped without resorting to pharmaceutical means. Unfortunately, I was not able to continue to choose a naturopathic doctor. Several factors figured into this, and points 1, 2, and 3 below played a major part in my decision. I am therefore writing to recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. Here are the concerns I have as they relate to the seven criteria. 1) Specialized skills. An aspect that is very important to me is that while many of the healthcare services that naturopathic doctors are trained to pr ovide are shared with other medical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain areas that are not included or emphasized in other practices. NDs are extensively trained in both conventional approach es and natural medicine; thus, they help bridge the gap that exists between conventional and traditional medicine practice. Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug- nutrient interactions. 2) Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic do ctors can't offer physical exams, order labs or imaging, or run a basic complete blood co unt. This was a particular problem and inconvenience for me, especially since I lived an hour away from the doctor. NDs are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosis for my medical records, and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential healthcare services that I would otherwise choose to receive from the ND. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are well equipped to provide thes e basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Also, many primary care pr oviders are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers, especially in rural and small town areas -- all the more reason to license already-well-trained naturopathic doctors who can fill this need.. 3) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently, medically-trained naturo pathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. This is a major hardship financially, particularly when it means that I am spending money on health insurance that I cannot fully use! 4.) Alternatives to regulation. There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that ad dress the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of pr actice in Virginia.

We appreciate the opportunity to submit a written public comment in opposition to the application for licensure of Naturopathic doctors (NDs) in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Virginia has previously issued licenses for NDs and ceased doing so in 1980. In 2005, the Virgin ia Department of Health Professions once again evaluated this profession for licensure and found criteria was not met. The undersigned maintain that NDs fail to meet the cri teria as defined by DHP to license a health profession, and therefore oppose the regulation and licensure of NDs in Virginia. Addressing the Failure to Meet Criterion One The application for licensure fails to meet Criterio n 1. Sufficient evidence has not been presented that the threat to public health, safety, and welfare would be reduced by regulation and licensure, as the harm results from \"(a) practices inherent in the occupation\"1. The Virginia Department of Health Professions 2005 evaluation of Naturopaths found that, \"When considering the actual instance in which individuals had been harmed by persons claiming to be naturopaths, the opinion expressed was that the issue was of unscrupulous, incompetent practitioners that were NOT naturopathic physicians, the group seek ing licensure. Thus, regulating naturopathic physicians would not achieve protection from such practices which could not already be provided in Virginia through criminal prosecu tion for unlicensed practice of medicine, chiropractic, osteopathy, etc.\" No information in DHP's 2020 report refutes or negates this finding. Regulation and licensure for NDs would not further protect the public from harm. Furthermore, there are already codified legal prot ections for patients against medical bad actors. Any individual who harms another individual by practicing medicine without the proper licensing or qualifications can be prosecuted under current Virginia law, making the regulating and licensure of NDs unnecessary to protect patients 2. Virginians who are harmed by an ND practicing medicine can currently pursue legal recourse, and licensure of these naturopathic 1 Board of Health Professions Guidance Document 75-2 Appropriate Criteria in Determining the Need for Regulation of Any Health Ca re Occupations or Professions 2 Title 54.1.

General Provisions; \u00a7 54.1-2902. Unlawful to practice witho ut license 275physicians would not prevent or protect patients who received care from individuals falsely claiming to be NDs . Addressing the Failure to Meet Criterion Two The medical community maintains that the lack of acc ountability and transparency in the training and education of NDs has a high potential for risk by nature of the practice of naturopathy, thus failing to meet both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2. As stated in the DHP report from 2005, NDs have an \"insufficient amount of hours providing hands- on care for patients under teaching supervision\" and no substantive updates to that training curriculum have been made that cont radicts that finding in DHP's 2020 repor t. The Department of Education does accredit the national naturopathic med ical association but \"Recognition as an accrediting agency by the DOE does not constitute an endorsement of the educational institution or program.\" Additionally, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) that is presently accepted as the programmatic accrediting agency has been \"in and out of favor with the Department of Education\" as of 20183. In the 2005 study conducted by the Virginia Board of Health Professions, they reported \"there has been no independent policy- related research on naturopathy as a system of medicine.\" The full Board unanimously approved to NOT license and regulate \"naturopathic doctors.\" To date, the educational standards for naturopathic exam inations have still not been externally or independently reviewed by any organizations ot her than naturopathic associations. Other currently licensed health professions such as medical doctors (MDs), doctors of osteopathy (DOs), Pharmacists, and Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have rigorous interdisciplinary review processes to ensure their curriculum and testing meet standards that adequately train them to deliver safe and quality care. This audit of both education standards and clinical practice standards of care are non-existent for NDs. Furthermore, questions have been raised as to the extent to which the NPLEX (the Naturopathic Licensing Examination) effectively measures competency for Naturopathic doctors. Unlike the NPLEX exam for NDs, the USMLE (U.S. Medical Licensing Exam) has a third section (USMLE Part III) designed to test clinical competence and \"assess whether medical graduates can apply medical knowledge ... and clinical science es sential for the unsupervised practice of medicine.\" As of a 2018 data collection by the American Medical Association, there is \"not sufficient evidence that the NPLEX Part II clinical licensing examinations actually measure clinical competence\" for Naturop athic doctors 4. The undersigned view the absence of a reliable compet ency evaluation for entry into the practice of Naturopathy, and the lack of mechanisms to ensure continuing competence, a failure to meet Criterion Two by DHP's definition of specialized education and training. Addressing the Failure to Meet Criterion Four Criteria four states licensure is only appropriate for \"a specific professional whose practices are well defined\". As the 2020 DHP report states clearly, \"The Scope of ND practice is quite 3 U.S. Department of Education.

As listed in the study, counselors, psychologists, dieticians, nutritionists, physical therapists, acupuncturists, and chiropractors are already living and working in the Commonwealth making the regulation and licensing of NDs duplicative. The design of the health care system relies on car e teams to specialize patient care and treatment options in the health care marketplace. With n o universally agreed upon definitions of the practice of naturopathy, and no consistent sta ndards of care in practice, the application for licensure fails to meet criteria four. Conclusion Our health care system relies on proven, tested, and scientifically rigorous training and education, and Virginia's patients rely on the leade rship of agencies like the Virginia Department of Health Professions to evaluate these criteria to distinguish medical validity. We would like to thank the DHP staff for their meticulous research and thorough study, and for the opportunity to provide feedback on behalf of the physicians, PAs, medical students, and patients in Virginia to the members of the committee and the Board fo r consideration. The Medical Society and the undersigned specialty societies are fully opposed to licensure of Naturopathic doctors and maintain that NDs fail to meet the criterion as set by DHP.

I am writing in support of full licensure for me dically-trained naturopathic doctors. My daughter, Cassady Morris, is currently a naturopathic medical student in her 3rdyear at the National University of Natural Medi cine, an accredited naturopathic medical school. The time and dedication that she ha s devoted over the years has established a strong foundation that she continues to build on through the graduate-level naturopathic doctor program. Knowing the rigorous and demanding education and training my daughter has chosen as a career and the happiness it brings her, it is my hope that the titling and credentials of being a Naturopath ic Doctor after her name be as meaningful in Virginia as they are in licensed states if sh e were to move back home. By recognizing the commitment to attaining a naturopathic do ctor education further supports the ability for my daughter to repay her student loans, which is a significant known burden of the medical profession debt. As a parent of a naturopathic medical st udent who supports licensure for medically- trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few co ncerns I have as it relates to the seven criteria. 1.Risk of harm. There are traditional naturopaths who call themselves naturopathic doctors, but who never went to medical school or received a rigorous graduate-level education. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-t rained naturopathic doctors are generally low risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. Additionally, adding Virginia to the list of states, whic h includes the District of Columbia and Maryland, that regulate naturopathic doctors. 2.Scope of practice. Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors cannot offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be well equipped to provide these bas ic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primar y care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services -including prescriptions, such as basic antibiotics and anti-hypertensives . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors can order labs in all 25 jurisdictions that regulate them, they are able to prescribe 279medications in 13 states, are recognized as primary care providers in 12 states, and are credentialed by health insurance companies in 6 states. 3.Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverage. In this era of chronic disease, where it's burden and impact fall disproportionately to the medically underserved, Virginians need increased access the pr eventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic docto rs will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respec tfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Sincerely, Kelly Morris 280 105August 16, 2020 Members of the Board: My name is Theresa Collier. I am a naturopathic doct or and a long-term resident of Virginia. I obtained my naturopathic doctor training at Bastyr Universit y in 2002 at which point I moved back to my home state of Virginia. I was the founder and first Presid ent of the Virginia Association of Naturopathic Physicians (VAANP). We have gone from less than 10-1 2 naturopathic doctors in 2005 to over 40 in the state. We have added residency training within the Commonwealth and it is at times hard to believe that we are still working towards licensure in Virginia. Our doctors work hard and have provided quality of care for years. Over the 18 years since I returned to Virginia after naturopathic sc hool our other medical colleagues have understood the value that we provide to the current system, but we hope that the St ate of Virginia will also finally recognize the skills and support we bring to our community. We are willing to serve and have training in various landscapes including urban and rural settings. Licens ing naturopathic doctors is ethical and provides additional access to care. It is vital to have oversight as does every other profession within medicine. Even outside of medicine, beauticians and even barb er shops, not only have business licenses but must have a license to provide services. The time for licens ure of naturopathic physicia ns is far past due. We can do better for our patients and the Commonwealth as a whole. I would like the opportunity to speak more directly to the seven criteria put forth by the Department of Health Professions: 1) Harm/risk of harm- There are individuals that use the title of naturopathic doctor who did not go to medical school. This is confusing to the public. Some include lay healers or health coaches and unfortunately this coursework is not even recognized by the Department of Education. This confusion impacts consumers/patients and also other providers wishing to refer their patients to naturopathic doctors. There should be distinction between the two. Additionally, in every form of medicine there is oversight. The same should be within naturopathic medicine. This can lead to risk of harm without appropriate professional oversight. 2) Specialized skills- I often receive challenging case s where patients have failed various therapies. They have been to their PCP and also specialists where there is little left to offer. The reason that myself and other naturopathic doctors are referred challenging cases is due to our specialty skills in prevention and also repair of health. We also have a variety of therapies to offer outside of drug therapy. We are trained in drug therapy but try to use various therap ies if appropriate. We not only have competency in drug therapy but also herbal medicine, physical me dicine, nutrition and homeopathy. We have lots to offer patients outside of pharmacological agents. We also have the ability to lo ok at the patient as a whole person -thus we specialize in whole system or whole person care. We realize that illness is not just on the physical level it also exists on the emot ional, mental and spiritual level. Leaving this out is why many patients fail modern medical therapies. 3) Autonomous practice- There is no state or prov ince that provides supervision of naturopathic doctors. They are a distinct medical provider and are doctors where supervision by other doctors or physicians would be impractical and not congruent with O*Net provider specifications and professions. 4) Scope of practice- Naturopathic doctors are traine d as primary care providers. We have the ability to provide the needed resources and therapies for the most common concerns or illnesses. But 281functioning without a license in Virginia prevents us from providing physical exams, running laboratory testing or imaging and even prescribing necessary drug therapy for patients. Our goal is to use the least invasive therapies but if a patient needs a pharmaceu tical, it is unethical to not provide this for the patient. Common drugs such as antihypertensives, antibiotics and even drugs such as metformin or insulin are imperative to have access to as a primary care provider. In various states throughout the US, each state must carve out the scop e most relevant for their citizens. With the lack of primary care providers, it makes ethical sense to include ph armacotherapy into a formulary for naturopathic doctors. The same applies to minor surgery and IV th erapy. We are trying to provide the best therapy for our patients. 5) Economics- Due to the fact that we see patients with complicated illnesses at times there can be a lag of time for patients to get their labs run. We have to contact the physician or the patient has to contact the doctor. This is inefficient and a waste of resources. Additionally, we often keep people out of the hospital and keep them well which saves insu rance companies financial resources. Patients will often have to pay for two appointmen ts in order to get laboratory test ing or imaging run. It makes the entire system less efficient which also wastes financial resources. 6) Alternatives- No alternatives currently exist to licensure that provide adequate transparency and safety to the consumer. Consumer agencies such as the BBB are housed more in commerce versus patient care and safety. They know little about medical ethics and have no medical training or oversight. They can't prevent future harm of patients either. Again, it seems confusing that licenses can be provided for many service industries but not for naturopathic doctors. This is incongruent but we are at a place where we can make it right and more congruent across various services and disciplines of medicine throughout the Commonwealth. Licensure provides that congruence. 7) Least restrictive- There is no other option that provides safety and occupational standards outside of licensure for naturopathic doctors. At this time, I ask that the Board vote in favor of recommending naturopathic licensure due to us fulfilling all 7 criteria laid out by the Department of Health Professions. Thank you for your consideration.

Throughout my years of practice, I have worked collaboratively wi th medically-trained naturopathic doctors and have them to be extremely competent and to provide care that is not only safe but also effective, especially in the areas of prevention and health restoration. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven safety criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: Risk of harm . The general public does not know the differen ce in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopath ic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Licensure of medically-trained naturopathic doctors and a regulatory framework, will provide clarity while also promoting safety and access to patient-se lected care. At present, lay naturopaths are also able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medicall y-trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally recognized accredit ed programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education an d training. I would also submit that all medically- trained professionals pose some degree of risk of ha rm, and should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals, and it is accountability that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. Specialized skill and training . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally sp ecialized type of training: skills they acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are most likely already aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program and complete board exams in basic sciences. They also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the crisis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have expert ise in prevention. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natura l therapies where they und erstand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. Autonomous practice . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors practice independently in twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with their patients' collective care teams. Scope of practice . Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers and their scope of practice should reflect such training. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically-trained 283naturopathic doctors are trained to provide. Medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors can serve as additional providers to help our society deal with the many medical crises now prevalent in the United States be it chronic pain, addiction, chronic diseas e and mental health. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors work collaboratively within the health care sy stem to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limite d and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of me dically-trained naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reduc ing costs. Currently, the closest localities that license medically-trained naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia. Medically- trained naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope of their training and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medici ne, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) into bordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need of care but lacking access to that care -- are unable to receive the preventative medical services th at naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. Alternatives to regulation. Without regulation, citizens who are ha rmed by naturopathic doctors do not currently have adequate redress. At this time, the best they can do is to contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse because there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. juri sdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty- two (22) of them license medically-trained naturopath ic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few stat es that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process does not currently distingu ish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purpos es of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure of medically-trained naturopathic doctors because this will provide additional and safe health care access for the Commonwealth.

My name is Mary Mielke, and I am licensed as a naturopathic physician in the District of Columbia. As a citizen and a naturopathic doctor, I support full licensure of medic ally-trained naturopathic doctors in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I believe that Vi rginians deserve greater access to important health and medical services, especially primary care. Safety is of paramount importance to the Commonwealth and consumers. Medical professionals should be regulated and accoun table in their practice to ensure that safety. The following comments address the standards the committee uses in considering professional regulation: 1)Risk of harm. There is a degree of risk in the practice of medicine and therefore licensing and oversight of mo st practitioners. Most consumers do not know the difference between a medically-trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Medicall y-trained naturopathic doctors have attended a 4-year post-graduate medical education recognized by the US Department of Education and accredited by conventional education accrediting bodies. By contrast, there are online programs promoting \"Doctoral Degrees\" and \"Board Certification\" for traditional naturopaths and advising in which states individuals can safely market those terms when advertising to the public, and Virginia is on that list. Licensing of naturopathic doctors delineates the difference between medically-trained naturopathic doctors and lay practitioners and would take Virginia off that list of vulnerability.2)Specialized skill and training. 4-year, accredited naturopathic medical schools train students who have met the same pre-requisite education as conventional medical students. The education includes conventional diagnosis and treatment and prepares doctors as primary-care providers. What sets naturopathic doctors apart from conventional doctors is learning how to safely prescribe nutrition, botanical medicine, and other supplementation and how to avoid harmful interactions. We are trained to monitor chronic conditions and when to refer to advanced specialties. We are trained to work as part of a complete medical system, and provide specialized knowledge within that framework. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with other medical professionals.4)Scope of practice. To improve access to primary care, naturopathic doctors should be licensed to their full scope of training. This includes scope of practice to conduct physical examinations, order me dical tests, and prescribe necessary medications for acute and chronic conditions. 292 1085)Least restrictive regulation . I believe that licensing is the only path that provides adequate oversight and mitigation of risk to the public. Certification and registration continue to leave it up to the public and consumers themselves to evaluate credentials. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure.

I am writing in support of licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. As a patient of a naturopathic doctor, I have the be nefit of someone who attends to me as a whole person, and who wants to work in conjuncti on with my medical team. My naturopathic doctor never contradicts my medical doctors. Instead, she obtains the full diagnoses from my medical doctors so we can thoroughly discuss the complementary treatment options. Unfortunately, none of these treatments or visits are covered by insurance because NDs are not recognized by the Commonwealth. Licensure in Virginia would be a step towards obtaining insurance coverage. Naturopathic medicine should be available to anyone - not just those that can afford it. There are a lot of complementary treatments that can really help with various illnesses. We should join the 22 other states that license or regulate naturopathic doctors. Frankly, we are a bit behind the times here in Virginia, but now is the time to bring us into the 2020s by forward-thinking on the overall health and wellness of our population. Naturopathic medicine should be a regulated industry so that patients do not unknowingly end up under the care of a traditional naturopath with no medical training. Regulation would also bring the NDs under the purview of a regulatory board, which is important for public health and safety. There are no alternatives to regulation that will ensure pa tients have access to safe and holistic care by naturopathic doctors. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

My name is Dr. Christopher A. Losch iavo, and I'm currently on my fourth year of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery residency. I moved to Virginia from Arizona where Naturopathic medicine is fully licensed and strongly integrated in the medical treatment of those with a multitude of ailments. During my time as a doctor I've had the opportunity to collaborate with Naturopathic Doctors and witness the positive, transformative potential they offer in re gards to patient care. Each collaboration in Arizona has been a positive one where I've been able to appreciate the highest degree of competence in providing patient care, determining the requirement for specific diagnostic exams, and identifying cases best treated with referral. Naturopathic doctors are specifically trained in preventative work aimed at restoring health. This has been made apparent to myself through the different perspectives with specialized approaches to patient care that I have witnessed. Tr eating medically complex patients with a multifactorial, alternative approach in collabo ration with allopathic doctors has yielded overall better outcomes for all of my pati ents who prefer a naturopathic approach to their health. I originally was not aware of the rigorous tr aining medically-trained Naturopathic doctors receive. I've learned through multiple consul tations and collaborat ions that medically trained Naturopathic doctors receive training eq ual to that allopath ic doctors receive, with the addition of alternative and distinc tly unique approaches to care. Not only do they receive the basic sciences training al l doctors do, but also complete licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanic al therapies, and physical medicine. I've personally collaborated with medically trained Naturopathic doctors in Arizona specializing in men's health, endocrinology, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiology and hepatology in the form of preoperative cons ultation and risk stratification. All have displayed the highest degree of competence. Through my experiences in a fully licensed state (Arizona), I have developed a st rong appreciation for medically trained Naturopathic Doctors and the unique skill set they offer to our patients as standalone providers or those working alongside allopathic doctors. It is with my full conviction that I sup port the full licensing of medically trained Naturopathic Doctors in Virginia for the betterme nt of patient care and overall outcomes in our battle against disease and ailment in ou r society, especially during these pressing times.Thank you, Christopher A. Loschiavo, DMD 295August 17, 2020 Dear Esteemed Members of the Board of Health Professions: This is a letter of passionate support and 100% recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. In the 11 thhour I have been made aware the Board of Health Professions is studying the \"need\" to license naturopathic doctors (NDs) in the blessed Commonwealth. My name is Andrea SpringerCollins and I have been a Virginian for 16 years. I have had the 'privilege' of personal involvement with a naturopathic doctor for the last four years. Would definitely not call what I have experienced 'care' because the individual is not considered 'alicensed doctor' although medical school was completed which makes absolutely no sense. I humbly urge the Board to immediately recommend licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors! Please consider the suffix NMDs instead of NDs so people are notconfused and clear their naturopathic doctor completed medical school! Why sell the licensed naturopathic doctor short in the absence of a proper suffix? One reason for support- Licensing provides safe access to care by a medically-trained doctor of naturopathy. Like a back alley abortion, odds are a person risks harm when they may think they are receiving services from what appears to be credib le, legitimate, safe, consultative advisement from a 'traditional naturopath' with no medical training instead of from an individual accountable to a regulatory board with authority to restrict a practice license. Ho w much sense does that make? Like a back alley abortion, odds are a person risks harm when they may think th ey may be receiving services from what appears to be a credible, consultative advisement from a 'traditional naturopath ' with no medical training instead of a regulatory board with authority to restrict a practice license. How much sense does that make? Second reason- Naturopathic doctors are medical providers trained specifically to consider patient health holistically . Trained in drug-herb, drug-nutrient interactions. NDs or NMDs can help bridge the gap that exists between convention, out-dated, traditional medicine practice. NMDs expand access for care particularly in light of the ever- increasing shortage of primary care providers. Fact: Integrating daily practices and different approa ches has contributed grea tly to my own overall health, wellness, self-care and gene ral well-being which has improved markedly over time attributed to my engagement with a naturopathic doctor. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licens ure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Failure to do so in these times could be considered a violation of the Hippocratic Oath. Sincerely yours, Andrea SpringerCollins Non-clinical worker in the healthcare industry 296 109Benedict Lust The term \"Naturopathy\" was first coined in 1885 by Dr. John Scheel, a German homeopath practicing the methods of Kneipp and Kuhn at his Badekur Sanitarium in New York. Benedict Lust purchased the name in 1901 to describe the eclectic practice of \"nature doctors\". The Kneipp convention held in New York in 1901 marks the birth of naturopathy in America. At that time, Naturopathy embraced all known means of natural therapeutics, including diet, herbs, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, exercise, manipulative therapies, electrotherapy, psychological and spiritual counselling. Louisa Lust, a naturopath and the wife of Benedict Lust, provided much financial backing for the naturopathic profession in its early years. Dr. Henry Lindlahr and other significant naturopaths influenced the profession in the early years. Naturopathy Naturopathy is defined as a scientific system of Natural Healing by the Naturopathic Doctor to diagnose, treat, prescribe, for any human health imbalance by use of natural methods or modalities such as food, herbs, natures remedies to restore the body to its natural normal state without the use of drugs, serums, injections, conconotions, major surgery. Naturopathy was defined by congress in 1931 (see attached). Naturopathic Medicine has not been defined. Dr Lust stood by these principals and was adamant about maintaining these standards to create distinction and exclusion of any and all allopathic practices. Originally, Dr Lust was pro legislative practices but urged standardization first. There was much debate over the standardization to include allopathic practices. Dr Lust was fundamentally opposed to such inclusion of allopathy inside of Naturopathic Practice. Hence, why he was opposed to the practice of Naturopathic Medicine and stood by the practice of Naturopathy. It is understood that in Naturopathy the belief is that the body develops disease as a result of accumulation of toxicity based on unhealthy lifestyle habits, poor diet, improper care of the body, mental, and emotional abuses to the body as well as environmental exposures.. The body is always in a state of healing and can and will heal itself if given the right environment. It is determined that acute disease such as fevers, cold, inflammation, etc is determined as the body's way to self initiate the healing process. Chronic disease is the continued suppression and the result of continued poor health. In Naturopathy, it is understood the body has a natural ability to heal itself but the person must take ultimate personal responsibility in doing so and contribute to the healing process. Thus the Naturopathic Doctor becomes a coach, a teacher, and a mentor in self healing for the individual. Naturopathy is a non-medical healing art. It does not make use of drugs or operative surgery. It uses simple natural agencies such as air, sunshine, water, diet, heat, light, manipulation, mental, 297as well as emotional coaching through behavior modification. Naturopaths remove the cause of disease by cleansing the toxic wastes of the body once identified. It supplies nutrient deficiencies, builds vitality, improves circulation, normalizes mental and emotional states, while employing various modalities to restore and maintain health. Naturopathy works with nature and assists the body in the ability to heal itself. Naturopathy is considered curative as long as the person's disease process has not taken over the balance of health within the body. Where disease process has overtaken the health it is recommended that a Naturopathic Doctor work integratively with an allopath to manage the disease. Naturopathic Doctors focus on the health of the body while allopaths study and balance disease processes within the body. Naturopathy is primarily preventative in nature while teaching and advocating strict adherence to laws of health, proper exercise, work, recreation, relatation, and similar matters. Naturopathy does not use anything harmful to treat the patient. Although Naturopathic methods are simple and harmless they require great skill to administer properly. Naturopathy differs from all other forms of Healing Arts 1. Medicine seeks to cure the body by producing chemical reactions in the body by use of drugs, serum, toxins, antitoxins, vaccines, etc. 2. An Osteopath manipulates the muscles, joints, bones, etc in the belief that the primary cause is the impingement of the nerves and blood supply. 3. The Chiropractor adjusts the vertebrae in the spine on the theory that the pressure on the spinal nerves causes disease. 4. Physical Therapy treats the means of physical forces and energies only 5. Psychology is the study of what ails the mind only and does not take into account the physical impact of such ailments. 6. Naturopathy holds a distinction as a belief that the curative force is within the body itself and seeks to assist this natural force by use of physical and natural agents as well as methods including the impact of mindset, emotional wellbeing, actions, and behaviors. Most chemical substances used in both the practice of Allopathy and in Naturopathic Medicine are foreign to the body and can be highly poisonous unless careful doses are given. Naturopathic remedies are found in nature, foods and take part in the bodily functions of the body as nature intended. Naturopathic Doctors stress the importance of preventing sickness and disease. They teach their patients how to stay well and are able to facilitate prevention in sickness as well as disease through public health education. Dr Lust formed several Naturopathic Doctors schools with a goal of standardizing the profession. There still holds to be true a group of Naturopathic Doctors with whom would like to uphold the standards laid out by Dr Lust. These are considered Naturopathic Doctors. These Doctors have 298 completed standardized education of diadetic training. Traditional Naturopaths are another category of Naturopath. Traditional Naturopaths have varying educational backgrounds and standards. Many have completed certificate programs in Naturopathy and do not possess as extensive training as Naturopathic Doctors. A distinction must be made between the three various forms of Naturopathic Practitioners. Dr Lust, the original founder was adminestly opposed to the practice of Naturopathic Medicine and often referred to Naturopathic Medical Doctors as Pseudo Medical Men. In the mid 1950s a branch of our ranks split off to create the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (established 1970) they wished to practice as primary care physicians against the will of our founder. They created what is now known as \"Naturopathic Medicine\" Being a hybrid of Naturopathy and Modern Medicine. Till this day we are not in accordance with their decision and object to any legislation that would disenfranchise the profession as a whole. Naturopathic Doctor Education ND education includes a 4 year didactic education that includes at least 100 hours of clinical practice as preceptorship. The education is a hybrid distance education combined with classroom education. The purpose of this is to provide strong hands on training as well as accommodate the ever growing needs of students in post secondary education. Naturopathic Colleges operate under the laws and legalities of their various charted states. The college is under the supervision of a full time Dean as well as faculty. Classroom attendance is not less than 90% to be able to graduate. The college at this time must be recognized by the ANMA, the second oldest institution representing Naturopathic Doctors. American Naturopathic Medical Association. To enter into the study of Naturopathy, the applicant must submit preliminary education issued by the state education authority. The student entering must have a high school diploma or equivalent as well as some form of Bachelor's Degree, preferably in the biological sciences such as biology, chemistry, etc. The coursework is 4 school years of 36 weeks each. Each school week consists of not less than 25 clock hours of instruction, exclusive of laboratory and clinic attendance time. Clinical internships must be approved prior to attendance with a qualified professional, ie. ND, DC, MD, PHD of various disciplines. Class \"A\" curriculum for ND training contains a minimum of the following: 299800 hours of Anatomy to include histology, embryology, dissection, osteology, etc. 330 Credit Hours of Chemistry. Inorganic, Organic, Biochemistry, and Toxicology. 270 hours of Physiology. 300 Hours of Pathology. 100 Hours of Bacteriology. 200 Hours of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 600 Hours of Diagnosis broken down into Physical, Laboratory, Xray, and Clinical. 400 Hours of Theory, Practice, and Philosophy of Naturopathy. 100 Hours of Pediatrics. 100 Hours of Physiotherapy. 100 Hours of Hydrotherapy. 100 Hours of Electrotherapy. 300 Hours of Anatomical and Manipulation. 100 Hours of Psychiatry. 300 Hours of Naturopathic Farmocopenia and Cell Salts Therapy. 250 Hours of Protology, Fractures, Genito-urinary, 100 Hours of Anesthetics, Minor Surgery, and First Aid. 100 Hours of Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat. 395 Hours of Clinical Naturopathy. 50 Hours of Jurisprudence. Total Credit Hours of 5345 including clinical hours to be completed in 4 years and 9 months. Curriculum is a combination of reading, assignments, classroom activities, tests, quizzes, etc. Upon completion, a proctored Board Exam is provided that is 4 hours long and tests a graduate candidate on skills, concepts, learned within the approved class curriculum. Currently, there are two prep courses that can be taken prior to the exam. Currently, none of the Naturopathic Doctorate Schools have decided to become accredited through the Board of Education. The Board of Education does not create a standard in education and does not certify that the standard in education meets the standards within the field. Therefore Naturopathic Medical Programs cited in this study have not been certified for accuracy towards the Naturopathic profession. Because there is a lack of education in this profession, confusion, and miseducation the Naturopathic Medical Colleges have largely been able to pass as a Naturopathic school even though they have split off from the original Naturopathic roots as defined by the founder. Most recently, the Virginia College of Naturopathy has been formed and plans to go through all of the necessary requirements laid out by the Board of Education to create standardization of true Naturopathic Doctor education within the state of Virginia. 300 110Flexner Report The Flexner Report greatly impacted the growth of Naturopathy within Virginia as well as nationwide and created great fear as well as uneasiness amongst the natural healthcare profession. The Flexnor report sought to discredit all natural health practices in favor of allopathic practices. The presentation of this report forced the removal of all natural occurring substances and the practice of natural health from all allopathic medical schools. Prior to this allopathic medical schools were relatively eclectic and included many natural remedies in practice in addition to allopathic practices. Many doctors of that era went to various trainings and many became NDs, DO's, MDs, and DC's all going to various schools for their prospective education. Naturopathic Doctor Distinctions Naturopathic Doctors, or NDs, do not seek to replace the role of the Primary Care Physician. In fact, they choose to work alongside, in conjunction with, independent of as primary HEALTH providers. Naturopathic Doctors are Integrative Medical Providers. It is observed and understood that allopaths serve a role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of disease yet have little if any education or training in the treatment of health. Naturopathic Doctors are trained in health. That is their role to maintain and educate the person on health. Naturopathic Medical Doctors, or NMDs, seek to replace the role of the primary care physician and believe they are qualified to diagnose, manage, and treat both diseases as well as maintain the health of the person. Naturopathic Doctors believe in working integratively with the allopaths when there is a disease present. They do not believe they are adequately trained to manage or diagnose disease, as we lack sufficient pathology as well as clinical residency. There are three distinct professions: Naturopathic Doctors are NDs. These are Doctors that are trained based on Dr Lusts standardization of Naturopathy. They complete a 4 year doctoral program, and take a Board Exam. The Diploma of these students read, Naturopathic Doctor (see attached). Naturopathic Medical Doctors are NMDs. These are Naturopathic Medical Doctors who also receive some allopathic training in their education. Their diplomas clearly state Naturopathic Medical Doctor (see attached). They are not NDs or Naturopathic Doctors. 301Traditional Naturopaths are TNs. These are Naturopaths who have completed a certificate program in the basic principles of Naturopathy. They do not qualify to take a Board Examination and are not considered to be Doctors. Doctor of Natural Medicine which is also indicated in this bill, refers to the use of alternative medicine modalities in practice less the emphasis on the biosciences. Natural Medicine is the use of naturally occurring remedies ie herbs, homeopaths, meditation, etc for treatment but does not go in depth into the laboratory component of the practice. They are less inclined to run labs, work with allopaths, and monitor treatment. They tend to be stand alone providers. These providers are considered DNM or Doctor of Natural Medicine designations. They typically complete a 3 year didactic training program with or without clinical requirements. The Definitions in the bill as they pertain to the 4 classes of practices is not thoroughly stated or clear. We oppose these definitions as written for the following reasons. (a).Naturopathy is NOT Naturopathic Medicine. Congressional record 1931 DC, was exhaustive in formally defining and codifying Naturopathy. Congress found that Naturopathy was not Allopathic or \"Medicine\". Naturopathy was not the use of drugs or surgery and that no law shall be made in respective states to disenfranchise Naturopaths discriminate as to what school they went to. (See Attached Congressional Record) (b). No congressional record of the definition of Naturopathic Medicine has even been produced by the Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine. \u00a9 Naturopathic Medicine is separate and distinct from Naturopathy as cited in HB 1040 bill in 54.1-2900, yet it creates a \"Board of Naturopathy\" to license AND REGULATE \"Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine\" and \"Naturopathic Medicine\". The confusing amalgamation of the two separate fields is apparent and confusing to both legislators and the public. (d). Though the bill makes mention of \"Naturopathy\" and \"Doctors of Natural Medicine\" the bill does not define what \"Naturopathy\" nor \"Natural Medicine\" is, though it does take the title and position it under the control of the board and make it illegal for anyone other than a select few the board deems \"worthy\" to be granted these titles. The bill only makes reference to the definition of Naturopathic Medicine! (Note this is not the definition given by congress!) The bill mentions 4 different types of practitioners: Doctors of Natural Medicine (DNM), Doctors of Naturopathy (ND) and Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD), Traditional Naturopath (TN). We oppose these 4 groups being loosely traded for the following reasons. 302 (a). The bill would take the titles of \"Doctor of Naturopathy'', \"Doctor of Natural Medicine\" and \"ND\", \"DNM\" from duly studied and tested doctors who do not practice Naturopathy or Naturopathic Medicine but \"Natural Medicine\" and give it to a board of Naturopathy that regulates Naturopathic Medicine. (Note a board of naturopathy is regulating naturopathic medicine). (b). Though the bill was amended and the provisions prohibiting those who had been licensed in Virginia prior to the sunsetting and de-licensing of Doctors of Naturopathy in the state in 1980 the board was clearly stated in the law as a \"board of naturopathy\" NOT NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE. (c) Naturopathic Medicine is mentioned in the Bill as being different from Naturopathy (Which we agree with) in 54.1-2900. (d). It also Takes the title \"Doctor of Natural Medicine\" yet does not define what \"Natural Medicine\" is or why it is reaching to control anyone who uses a derivative of the term \"Natural\" and the word \"Doctor\"! (e).Therefore, a clear distinction should be made between the 3 sets of Doctors this bill is aiming to regulate. (d). It is not clear what title the license and board will be given to which practitioners or why the titles of all 4 sets are going to be given to one board that controls them all. (e). No representatives of the 3 sets of Doctors are mentioned in the making of the board such as a chairperson from each set of doctored groups. Naturopathic Doctor Modalities Naturopathic Doctors treat the person who has a disease, not the disease. Disease treatment is reserved for allopathic physicians and/or Naturopathic Medical Doctors depending on their jurisdiction. In treating the person, we awaken the person to the vital force of life energy within and help facilitate healing within the individual. The following are modalities that are employed by Naturopathic Doctors. Homeopathy Homeoprophylaxis Diet and Nutrition Lifestyle Modification 303Behavior Modification Neurolinguistic Programming Functional Medicine Integrative Medicine Lifestyle Medicine Psychoneuroimmunology Energy Work ie Reiki, Hands on Healing, Touch for Health Herbal Medicine Nutraceuticals (Pharmaceutical Based Supplements) Hydrotherapy IV Therapy (under the supervision of an allopath) Manual Therapy Light Therapy Applied Kinesiology Iridology Cell Salts Clinical Hypnotherapy Light Therapy Breathwork Meditation Yoga Mantra Affirmation First Aid Laboratory Diagnostics Physical Education Mental Hygiene Philosophy of Natural Living Hygiene and Sanitation Public Health Education Clay, Earth Packs, Mud Packs Naturopathy is not a cure all, yet is applicable to all parts of the body. Naturopathy is the only system that treats the body as a whole. It treats causes and not symptoms. Some cases are not suited for Naturopathic treatment and must be referred out to an allopath i.e. surgeries or specialists such as in the case of progressive cancers, tumors, etc. It has been found that 75% of persons seeking naturopathic treatment do so after medical, surgical, or other methods have failed them. A majority have found relief under naturopathic treatment which they did not find elsewhere. The demand for naturopathic treatment is increasing in demand and public acceptance 304 111grows daily. Medical schools do not teach naturopathic principles or methods of treatment. Therefore, patients cannot receive naturopathic treatment from medical doctors. Other systems of non- medical healing such as osteopathy, chiropractic are not complete systems of healing therefore are not equipped to give patients the complete treatment required to secure the desired results. Clinical records show many patients have achieved a cure under naturopathy after being pronounced incurable or hopeless by practitioners of other systems. Naturopathy is effective in long standing chronic conditions. Naturopathy uses similar diagnostic methods as medicine, but in addition uses peculiar diagnostics that are distinct in naturopathy, ie AK or Iridology. Early naturopathic treatment is preventative care that may inhibit the need for heroic measures later on. These principles of the classical naturopathic treatment are distinct from the practice of Naturopathic Medicine, as Naturopathic Medicine seeks to combine pharmacology alongside naturopathic care. In many states with advanced Naturopathic Medical Practice the use of opioids and various synthetic agents are used in conjunction with naturopathic practices and are prescribed by the same physician, an NMD. An NMD is considered a hybrid between a Naturopathic Doctor and an Allopathic Doctor. It is this distinction that proves dangerous as it is the observation that the NMD is inadequately trained in either profession, of allopathy or naturopathy. Many of the NMDs are not trained in more traditional diagnostic or therapeutic modalities as indicated by the Naturopathic Doctor training. We do not agree with the expansion of Naturopathy to include allopathic medical practices as it is outside of the scope of practice for a Naturopathic Doctor. We work alongside allopathic doctors and do not serve to replace the primary care provider as in the case of the Naturopathic Medical Doctor. As cited in the bill, \"Practice of naturopathic medicine\" means a system of primary health care for the (i) prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human health conditions, injury, and disease; (ii) promotion or restoration of health; and (iii) support and stimulation of a patient's inherent self-healing process through patient education and use of naturopathic therapies and therapeutic substances.

(a) The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education only accredits colleges to give the title of \"Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine\" (NMD) not \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" (ND) as proof please find the graduates diplomas with the title given by the 5 naturopathic medical colleges. (b) The American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board is the same age as the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education both residing and registered in the district of Columbia in 1973 and accrediting schools and colleges on Naturopathy. This Board regulates schools that provide the title Doctor of Naturopathy. (c) There exists 2 Congressionally chartered colleges that are not included in the bill- The American School of Naturopathy and the First National University of Naturopathy and Allied Sciences. (d) No mention of colleges of \"Natural Medicine\" or leading to the designation of \"Doctor of Natural Medicine\" (DNM) are noted nor cited in the bill. Doctor of Natural Medicine is a separate distinction from Doctor of Naturopathy, Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine, or Traditional Naturopath. Doctor of Natural Medicine primarily focuses on the modalities within Naturopathy and less on the biosciences. The only acceptable exam as a prerequisite for licensure is the \"NPLEX\" Or (Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination) administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners. (a) The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners does not accept graduates to sit for testing unless they are from schools accredited by the CNME and follow Naturopathic Medicine, 306 therefore they could not offer a Doctor of Naturopathy an exam on Naturopathic Medicine nor will they allow them to sit. (b) There were no \"Naturopathic Medical Programs\" prior to \"CNME\" as the only science of health similar to it at the time was called \"Naturopathy\" Not Naturopathic Medicine\", yet the bill highlights that one may apply for a license if he or she had graduated from a college which granted a degree of naturopathic medicine BEFORE CNME. There is clearly no such college nor was there ever! (c) The National Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NBNE) Mentioned in the Landmark ruling of Wendel Vs. Spenser (National Board of Naturopathic Examiners) is not listed in the bill, yet it is as extensive and mentioned in the verdict and ruling as sufficient to license Doctors of Naturopathy. This board was established in 1951 before NABNE in 1970. Naturopathy Standardization Virginia Naturopathic Doctors Association was formed with the purpose of educating the general public and flushing out the distinctions between Naturopathic Doctors, supporting standardization within the profession, and continuing to progress the profession legislatively within the state. The VNDA is modeled after several Naturopathic Doctors Associations around the country. In conclusion, the Virginia Naturopathic Doctors Association would suggest that if this bill were to be considered for passage that it. 1. Clearly define the difference between a Doctor of Naturopathy (ND), Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD), Traditional Naturopath (TN), and a Doctor of Natural Medicine (DNM). 2. That more than one board of accreditation be added to the bill for schools and colleges of both Naturopathy and Naturopathic Medicine alike such as ANMAB and Congressionally Chartered Colleges. 3. That more than one national examination for competency testing of Naturopathic Doctors be added such as the National Board of Naturopathic Examiners Exam (NDLEX) and the American Naturopathic Medical Certification Board Exam(AMNMCBE) 4. That a reasonable explanation to why the bill is reaching into the realms of all \"Natural Medicine\" be given and absolute power over any designation of \"Natural\" and \"Doctor\" if the only candidates eligible by law and this bill to be granted all 3 designations and licenses are 307those who have graduated with a degree from a college of \"Naturopathic Medicine\" approved by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education\". Unless these amendments be added then there is no way that this bill can be found to be in the best interest of the public and the commonwealth of Virginia and would cause a monopoly of ALL THE NATURAL HEALTH REALM to those graduates of schools approved by the CNME and only clearly license Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine, which distinction is not mentioned in the bill.

I am writing in support of full licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors. I feel the naturopath ic doctors fill the void in medicine by providing in depth knowledge of the plant based supplements that can be used to heal our bodies, along with nutritional information to maintain optimal wellness. My family suffers from the genetic MTHF R mutation, which prevents the body from absorbing Folic Acid. I need a daily regimen of supplements vitamins B-6 and B-12, methionine , 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) to keep my body functioning. I do have heart, thyroid and IBS due to the high level of homocysteine in my blood from the genetic mutation. Recently I found my well water to have high levels of Copper and Lead. I sought out a naturopathic doctor to guide me through the detox process with natural supplements, nutritional guidance and medical testing. We meet and discuss my progress and medical issues I developed like chronic fatigue, joint pain, and insomnia. Using herbal remedies, that use to be a common element in medical tr eatments before the modern age of synthetic chemicals provided by big pharmaceutical companies, we find remedi es that aid in the treatment and healing of my body. Our State of Virginia needs to recognize the unique skills th at the naturopathic doctor bring to us for holistic healing. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natu ral medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and traditional medicine practice. It's time to give the citizens of Virginia a choice in selecting their healthcare providers to suit their unique needs and beliefs in alternative medicine. Having lived eight years in Great Britain, the general public sought out herbal remedies at th e \"Chemist\" store before going to see a doctor. They had relied on these remedies for centuries from generation to ge neration. Why then should we not welcome the doctor of naturopathic medicine to join our ranks here in Virginia.. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic do ctors will provide additional, safe heal thcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend full licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for medically-trained naturopathic doctors.I have personally greatly benefited from working with a medically-trained naturopathic doctor all these years.As a patient who supports licensure for medically -trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the six criteria. 1) Risk of harm. There are traditional naturopaths who call thems elves naturopathic doctors , but who never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safely access care from medically-trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. There is risk of harm in all medical professions; while medically-trained naturopathic doctors are generally low-risk, there needs to be the same level of professional accountability and standards as the other regulated health professions in Virginia. As a patient, I also want to know that if an ND causes harm, they will be disciplined by a regulatory board with the authority to restrict a practice license -not just sued in civil court or reported to a business bureau. 2) Specialized skills. Naturopathic doctors consider the patient's health holistically. They are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both conventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between convention and trad itional medicine practice. While many of the healthcare services that NDs are trained to provi de are shared with other medical professions, NDs do have specific education in certain area s that aren't included or emphasized in other practices. 3) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice autonomously in all other jurisdictions that offer regulation. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medically providers do not have the same training and knowledge in both conv entional and natural medicine. I also trust my ND to refer me to a specialist or another healthcare provider, in order to ensure the best care possible. 4) Scope of practice. 317Currently, medically-trained naturopathic doctors can't offer physical exams, or order labs or imaging; they cannot not even test for COVID-19 or run a basic complete blood count. They are not allowed by law to give a medical diagnosis for my medical records, and must refer me to another medical practice to access essential health care services that I would otherwise choose to receive from an ND. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors would be we ll equipped to provide these basic health care practices, eliminating the need for added appointments. Many primary care providers are retiring, and this is increasing the shortage of primary care providers. This, combined with the increasing needs of the public during the pandemic (especially for mental health support), means that patients are now requiring more access to providers who are well-trained to provide medical services. 5) Economic impact. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doct ors would reduce the burden on our existing system by creating additional access for patients. Licensing would also pave the road to insurance coverage. Currently medically-trained naturopathic doctors are unable to use proper coding that would enable insurance coverag e. In this era of chronic disease, where it's burden and impact fall disproportionately to the medic ally underserved, Virginians need increased access the preventative healthcare services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are so well suited to provide. 6.) Alternatives to regulation. There are no alternatives to regulation, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia . While some alternative options may consider the real risk of harm that exists, they will not appropriately examine or take into consideration the other criteria that warrant licensing for naturopathic doctors. As a patient and aconsumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors w ill provide additional, safe healthcare access for the patients most in need. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia.

My name is Cassandra Mannhardt. I have been a Virginia registered nurse for over 36 years and a naturopathic doctor for over 13 years. I love Virginia but was not going to return after getting my degree in naturopathic medicine due to the lack of licensing here in our Commonwealth. However, my husband's job has brought me back. Although I feel like I am home, I struggle on a daily basis with the limits of what I can do in helping people since I am not able to practice to the scope of my training. I've seen a lot in my many years working in the health profession and know the importance of regulation to ensure accountability in public safety. W ithout regulation it is very difficult for the public to differentiate between different practiti oners' education, skills, competency, and ability to deliver accurate and safe information and care. We are medically trained as a distinct group of providers. Our schools are four-year on site medical programs and we have board exams in basic sciences as well as clinical board exams covering pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies , and physical medicine. We are experts in the field of natural therapeutics and are the most equipped practitioners to understand the interplay between conventional medicine and na tural medicine. We understand the interactions between botanical medicine, nutrition, and pharmacotherapy. Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five us jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic practice. However, I have accompanied people a number of times on their visits with their primary care physicians to facilitate collaboration and seamless care. This has been very beneficial, especially for the el derly who sometimes feel overwhelmed and have trouble understanding their doctors directions. I also believe that it is very important for th e naturopathic profession to have the power to regulate itself by holding its members accountable through suspension or revoking of licence. This helps protect the public from potential harm or abuse. The last point I would like to make is the im portance of the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Registration and certification do not adequately distinguish between lay naturopaths and medically trained naturopathic doctors. This is one ofthe primary purposes of licensure in all of the States and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend li censure for medically tr ained naturopathic doctors Sincerely,Dr. Cassandra Mannhardt, ND, RN 319August 17, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee, Thank you for your thorough work regarding regulation of the practice of naturopathic doctors in Virginia. My name is Viktoriya Beliy, and I have been a naturopathic doctorfor over 4 years. I am writing in support of full licensing medically-trained naturopathicdoctors. I have had the privilege of working in the Richmond, VA community for over 2.5years and have met many unexpected challenges since moving from my fully licensedstate of Oregon. One of my main concerns is the inability to order labs, even standard screening bloodwork, or imaging which could save time for the patient and their primary care provider. It would relieve some of the burden that medical doctors experiencewhen patients go to them to write lab orders. I have been fortunate enough to work withmany different populations in Richmond, but the discrepancy I find between getting anaccurate and timely diagnosis between women of color and Caucasian women isconcerning. The women of color have a much harder time getting their doctors tobelieve their pain and scheduling imaging and lab work for diagnosis. It takes themmuch longer to get a diagnosis of endometriosis or PCOS, which can be debilitatingconditions. They must act as advocates for themselves and push for testing, whereasas a naturopathic doctor I am trained in diagnosis and treatment of such conditions andshould be able to advocate for them. This will relieve some of the burden for other practitioners, which is part of the delay in diagnosis. With the COVID-19 pandemic weare all stretched thin. Naturopathic doctors can be an additional support in preventative medicine and chronic disease. With every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as theyrelate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1)Risk of harm. The general public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically-trained naturopathicdoctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Licensure provides a regulatoryframework, transparency and promotes safety. At present, lay naturopaths areable to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. All medical professionals should have accountability and safety which is why naturopathic licensure is critical. 2)Specialized skill and training. Medically-trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. They go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentallydistinct type of training; skills they acquire are unique compared to laynaturopaths and other medical providers. They take licensing exams inpharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the cri sis of chronic disease, necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have expertise in prevention. 320 115Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, andbotanical medicine. 3)Autonomous practice . Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with theirpatients' collective care teams. 4)Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of providershortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care andpreventative services that medically-trained naturopathic doctors are trained toprovide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help usdeal with our current health crises. 5)Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closestlocalities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District ofColumbia. There are a number of naturopathic doctors that live in Virginia thatchoose to practice in Maryland and DC. This means dollars and taxes are beingspent elsewhere than in Virginia. Licensing of naturopathic doctors is the firststep towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently,naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would beable to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. 6)Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors don't have adequate recourse. They could choose to file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit or contact the Better Business Bureau but it doesn't protect future patients. 7)Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically-trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license naturopathic doctors. Enacting certification or registration does not adequately distinguish between licensable, medic ally-trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process doesn't offer any objective, and doesn't distinguish between medically-trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically-trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcareaccess for the Commonwealth. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. 321Sincerely, Viktoriya Beliy, ND Sincerel y, 322 On Mon, Aug 17, 2020 at 4:30 PM Sarah Mae < sarahmannhardt@gmail.com > wrote: Dear Members of the Committee, My name is Sarah Mannhardt. I've been a resident of the state of Virginia for 3 years now, and have been under the care of Naturopathic doctors numerous times over the last 15 years. I'm writing to urge you to allow Naturopathic doctors to be licensed in our state. Last year I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Over the time of my diagnosis, I began searching for treatment options . While I chose to use the traditional medical route of chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, it was very important to me to have the advice of a naturopathic, integrative doctor w ho could give me medical advice from a holistic perspective. Because Virginia does not allow naturopathic doctors to be licensed, I had to seek counsel from a naturopathic doctor based in Ve rmont. Dr. Matthew Perchimeledes, ND, was able to give me specific advice that I was able to implement alongside the advice of my oncologist, with my oncologists approval. By the time of my surgery following 5 months of chemotherapy, my tumor had shrunk from 4 1/2 cm to smaller than a pea, there was no invasive cancer left, and my lymph nodes were completely free of cancer. I went from needing a mastectomy to being able to have a minimally invasive lumpectomy. My oncologist wa s very surprised at my results. He told me that estrogen positive cancers rarely ever disa ppear with chemotherapy the way mine did. He was extremely pleased. I firmly believe that the medical advice I received from my naturopathic doctor played a large part in my positive results, and had I not followed Dr. Perchimeledes advice on diet, exercise, and supplements, as a young woman with an aggressive form of breast cancer, I highly doubt I would have had the same results. I believe it's critically important that other cancer patients like myself here in Virginia have access to Naturopathic doctors who are able to use integrative methods to support them during treatment. Because I have an aunt with a degree in naturopathic medicine, I was able to locate a naturopathic doctor out of state w ho was able to help me. But many other Virginians critically in need of care don't have that luxury. Please, seri ously consider allowing Naturopathic doctors to be licensed in our state. You could make a huge difference in the lives of many people. Sincerely, Sarah Mannhardt 323 August 17, 2020 Dear Members of the Committee,My name is Joel Thornbury and I am a pharmacist that graduated from the University of Kentucky, School of Pharmacy in 1992. I have served as an independent pharmacist in Eastern Kentucky and Southwest Virginia providing ambulatory care where I run and operate pharmacies within Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee. I have overseen pharmacy interns and medical interns over the last 25 years. I am a third generation Kentucky pharmacist where I was appointed by the Governor to the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy and completed my tenure in 2013. I currently serve as the President of the Kentucky Pharmacist Association where much of my work has been in creating additional access to care for patients to meet the varied needs of Appalachians and to assist with the changing needs of pharmacists. I have had the opportunity to work with naturopathic doctors for over 12 years. Naturopathic doctors are trained within a variety of therapies ranging from pharmacotherapy to nutrition and even botanical medicine. This is useful in rural settings due to the lack of access to care. Naturopathic doctors have served as integral members to assist with opiate addiction wi thin Appalachia where they have assisted with behavioral modifications, nutritional st atus improvements and identified therapies to assist with sleep and anxiety as well as depression. They can also provide lifestyle modifications to assist with cravings and triggers. But naturopathic doctors provide far more tr aining and skills that are being underutilized due to the lack of licensure within Virginia . These skills would be useful within rural and urban settings to combat issues around access to care and chronic disease. Naturopathic doctors are trained in physic al exams, laboratory testing, imaging, pharmacy and minor surgery.Many are trained as primary care providers where additional patients could be served. Because naturopathic doctors believe in prevention it makes them a useful partner in combating addiction and other chronic diseases including smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. All of which are specific comorbidities within Appalachia and prevention will continue to be the key to changing our outcomes. Below outlines my recommendation for their licen sure as referenced by the 7 Criteria of the Department of Health Professions: 324 1161) Risk of harm- At this time there are lay providers using the same title as naturopathic doctors. This provides confusion to consumer and especially to those that may not have the foresight to understand educational differ ences. It also provides confusion for referrals among medical providers. Few medical providers know the differences between lay naturopaths and naturopathic do ctors. Additionally, because naturopathic doctors are not licensed they do not have access to Prescription Monitoring Programs (PMP) which is vital to combating issues around addiction but also mismanagement or duplications of drug therapy. All medi cal providers should have access to PMP for safety of patients and the general population. 2) Specialized skills- As noted above naturopathic doctors have specialized skills in pharmacy, botanical medicine, physical medicine, clinical nutrition, homeopathy and also minor surgery and IV therapy. They serve as the \"old school\" doctors and such doctors are well accustomed to rural setting s. They also have specialty training in prevention and serve as the doctors that approach patients through a holistic view. They don't just look at one illness or one ailment bu t look at the entire picture. They also work on some of the most challenging cases that have failed modern therapies where they work to restore function and provide the best quality of life for each person. Much of our economy has been built on coal and naturopathic doctors have worked to restore and uplift those with occupational injuries. 3) Autonomous practice- In the states or provinces where naturopathic doctors are licensed they all practice autonomously. They are trained as doctors and thus oversight by other medical providers is unnecessary. 4) Scope of practice- In states that licens e naturopathic doctors there can be a varied scope. Even though naturopathic doctors are trained in pharmacy, botanical medicine, nutrition, homeopathy, minor surgery and IV therapy it doesn't mean that each state chooses to adopt the same scope. This is not surprising because each state has its own specific needs. Likewise, within pharmacy prac tice, some states permit pharmacists to order laboratory testing and some permit prescriptive authority for infections such as streptococcus. Each state must discern the scope that is needed and within Virginia we have a varied landscape of rural and urban settings. Within urban settings there may be more access to minor surgery or prescriptive authority but in Appalachia and other rural settings, patients have few providers as it is and thus the lack of prescriptive rights could be a hardship. Medications such as ant iglycemics and antihypertensives as well as antibiotics are urgent therapies that wi thout them have significant consequences in acute and chronic disease. The State of Virginia should consider this when they look to determine scope in order that appropriate access to care is available for the most vulnerable. 325 5) Economic impact- If naturopathic doctors ha d the ability to truly practice in the State of Virginia it could decrease healthcare cost s. Due to the fact that that naturopathic doctors provide preventative medicine and restoration for those with addiction, pain, and also chronic disease it could reduce the burden and healthcare costs. We know that for every $1 spent on prevention we save $7-10 in direct costs and greater than $25 in indirect costs. The healthcare system is st ruggling because the lack of prevention has not been a priority for years. Naturopathic doctors if licensed could serve as an additional primary care provider in the Stat e to reduce costs and promote additional access to care. In certain states naturopathic doctors serve as Medicaid providers- this could be useful in areas such as Appalachia. 6 & 7) Alternatives and least restrictive regulation- There is no current alternative to licensure and licensure serves as the least re strictive option that provides transparency and safety to the public. Every medical profession needs oversight and compliance is key. No current alternative options exist for professional and ethical standards of medicine. Naturopathic medicine should be no different. Thank you for your time and consideration. I ask that the Board move forward with a recommendation of licensure for naturopathic doctors.

As a resident of Virginia fo r over 30 years, I am writing to you today to share my personal and professional reasons for supporting licensure. I have been under the care of several naturopathic doctors at various times since I moved to Virginia and received appropriate care because of their unique approach: having the diagnostic skills of an MD, yet providing me with the option to use all natural non-invasive therapies to treat the whole person. I am fortunate in that I have had excellent care and been able to work integratively with NDs while not only managing my own compromised immune system, but also as a caregiver for a daughter with a life threatening illness. Discerning, both personally and profes sionally as a licensed mental health provider, how best to integrate allopathic and naturopathic approaches, has come as a result of my own research, personal experience, education, and the good fortune of having caring NDs at my side. Everyone should have this access to integrative wellness, and having fully licensed medicall y trained naturopathic doctors will serve Virginians with appropriate oversight and acco untability to provide safe medical care for those seeking treatment. Given the shortage of medical professionals at this time, we need access to the care that NDs can provide with their ability to coordinate with other heal th professionals in the state across many disciplines, especially given their rigorous training and licensing re quirements in various therapies, including nutrition, pharmacology and physical medicine. Finally, I support licensure for NDs in Virginia beca use of the hardship on patients not being able to submit insurance for services because of the inability for NDs to use coding with their billing, something I have personally experienced as a patient and caregi ver. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure and give more Virginians access to cost effective, safe and accountable health services. Respectfully submitted, Ann Duvall, LPC 327Richard S.

Under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, I appreciate the time the committee has invested in writing such a balanced and fair report. My name is Richard Nicholas and I graduated naturopathic medical school over 13 years ago (Bastyr University, Class 2007). Prior to attending naturopathic medical school, I was a practicing pharmacist for nine years. I continue to practice pharmacy and have been a faculty member at the Appalachian College of Pharmacy located in Oakwood, Virginia for over 10 years. I currently serve as the college's Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice. During that 10-year period, I have maintained an ambulatory care practice in a family medicine clinic as well as worked as a part-time community pharmacist throughout Southwest Virginia (VA Rx license #0202209727). I am writing in support of fully licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors. I moved to the area to help fulfill the Appalachian College of Pharmacy's mission to improve the health of medically underserved areas. As a medically trained naturopath, I have a unique set of skills that address the underlying problems of chronic disease. My naturopathic training has provided me the tools to address the diet and life-style factors that are contributing to the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease. In addition to addressing pharmacotherapy issue, the majority of my time is invested in addressing nutrition, physical activity, and life-style interventions that foster health, not disease. Skills that my conventionally trained colleagues never learned. 328 117Richard S. Nicholas, 440-9286 Wit h every medical profession, it is important to have oversight to ensure accountability and public safety. Speaking to some of the seven criteria used by the Board, as they relate to licensing naturopathic doctors: 1) Risk of harm. The public does not know the difference in levels of education, training, and experience between a medically trained naturopathic doctor and a traditional or lay naturopath. Licensure and a regulatory framework will provide clarity - while also promoting safety and access to patient-selected care. At present, lay naturopaths are able to assume the title of 'naturopathic doctors', which confuses not only the public, but also other providers in the health care system. Only medically trained naturopathic doctors, who have received doctoral degrees from federally recognized accredited programs, should be able to use the title \"naturopathic doctor\". It is essential for the public to be assured that anyone who presents themselves as a \"doctor\" has commensurate medical education and training. I would also submit that all medically trained professionals pose some degree of risk of harm, and they should be held to account by a regulatory board for the safety of patients. This is standard for all medical professionals. It is account ability that medically trained naturopathic doctors are seeking for their healthcare field. 2) Specialized skill and training. Medically trained naturopathic doctors are a distinct group of providers. We go through a rigorous, and yet, fundamentally distinct type of training; skills we acquire are unique compared to lay naturopaths and other medical providers. As you are aware, naturopathic doctors complete a four-year onsite medical program, and complete board exams in basic sciences. We also take licensing exams in pharmacology, nutrition, botanical therapies, and physical medicine. The crisis of chronic disease necessitates increased access to specialized professionals who have expertise in prevention. Naturopathic doctors are experts in their field related to natural therapies where they understand the interactions between pharmacotherapy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. As a professor of pharmacy practice, I feel this is missing component in our healthcare system. Both conventional medicine and pharmacy has become increasingly complex with the advent of new medications and technologies.Since there is limited time within a conventional medical curriculum, it is very difficult to devote adequate time to incorporating complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It has been my experience that CAM therapies are included as an afterthought after providing what is necessary for conventional medical training. Studies have demonstrated that our patients are using CAM therapies and often times they fail to inform their healthcare providers of their use. Numerous reports 329Richard S. Nicholas, 440-9286 have documented the poor quality of botanical and nutritional products, and scientific evidence is lacking on some CAM therapies. Medically trained naturopaths are educated on evidence-based CAM practices and remain the conscience of the botanical and nutritional supplement industries. 3) Autonomous practice. Naturopathic doctors practice independently in all twenty-five regulated U.S. jurisdictions, and practice in collaboration with their patients' collective care teams. 4) Scope of practice. Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care providers, and their scope should reflect such training. In this critical time of provider shortages, Virginians need increased access to the full range of primary care and preventative services that medically trained naturopathic doctors are capable to provide. Naturopathic doctors could serve as an additional provider to help us deal with the crises we are having in serving those with pain, addiction, chronic disease, and mental health illness. They work collaboratively to serve as another safety net provider. With the current pandemic, resources are even more limited, and trained medical professionals are critical to our public health system. 5) Economic impact . Licensing will increase the number of naturopathic doctors in Virginia, thereby increasing patient access and reducing costs. The closest localities that license naturopathic doctors include Maryland and the District of Columbia; naturopathic doctors wishing to practice more fully to the scope of their training, and Virginians seeking this holistic access to naturopathic medicine, are being driven to put their financial resources (and pay taxes) into bordering jurisdictions. Additionally, licensing is the first step towards some level of insurance coverage for patients. Presently, naturopathic doctors are not allowed to use coding such that patients would be able to submit their visit to insurance for coverage, even as a superbill. Without ability to obtain insurance coverage, many Virginians -- including those most in need and lacking available care -- are unable to access the preventative medical services that naturopathic doctors are so well positioned to be able to provide. 6) Alternatives to regulation . Without regulation, citizens who are harmed by naturopathic doctors do not have adequate redress. Currently, they can contact the Better Business Bureau, file a complaint with the Attorney General, or file a lawsuit. These alternatives are not adequate to protect Virginians from potential harm or abuse, as there is no ability to suspend or revoke licensing or credentials and have that information available to the public. 7) Least restrictive regulation . Licensing is the appropriate level of regulation for medically trained health care professionals. Of the twenty-five (25) U.S. jurisdictions that regulate naturopathic doctors, twenty-two (22) of them license 330 Richard S. Nicholas, 440-9286 naturopathic doctors, (also known as naturopathic physicians or naturopathic medical doctors --titles vary by state). Neither certification nor registration adequately distinguish between licensable, medically trained naturopathic doctors and lay naturopaths. There are no states that offer certification, and in the few states that register naturopathic doctors, the process in those states works like a licensing process, where only those who graduated from a CNME accredited naturopathic medicine program can call themselves naturopathic doctors. Unfortunately, the Virginia BHP registration process does not offer any objective, and does not distinguish between medically trained and lay naturopaths, which is one of the primary purposes of licensure in all of the states and territories that currently regulate naturopathic doctors. Licensing medically trained naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access for the Commonwealth. Once again, I thank you for your time and effort in producing your report. I respectfully urge the Board to recommend licensure. Thank you for your consideration, Richard S.

I am writing in support of a recommendation for licensure for me dically-trained naturopathic doctors. The impact of having naturopathic support throughout the past years on my multiple sclerosis journey has been invaluable. The resources and support that have been provided to me via naturopathic care has freed me to feel more empowered in my life as a parent, partner and contributing community member. I have far more options on how to help manage my physical and mental welfare and can rely on my provider and their staff for support on an as-needed basis with the confidence that they are working alongside me to identify the most relevant and recent science and therapies related to my situation. I know they desire the best po ssible outcomes for me physically, mentally and socially. As a patient who supports licensure for medi cally-trained naturopathic doctors, here are a few concerns I have as it relates to the below criteria.1) Risk of harm. I want to be able to refer my frie nds and family in Virginia to naturopathic providers with the confidence th ey will receive consistent and qualified level of care. Some traditional naturopaths call themselves \"naturopathic doctors\", but never went to medical school. The public generally does not know the difference between these two types of providers. Many patients move to Virginia from licensed states, where they had been able to safe ly access care from a medically-trained naturopathic doctors. A problem lies in the fact that many of these same patients - who expect the same level of regulation in Virginia as their prior residence - end up under the care of a traditional naturopath who has no medical training. 2) Specialized skills. I trust the broad expertise of my naturopathic doctor and am regularly amazed at the breadth of her kn owledge. Naturopathic doctors are the only medical providers specifically trained in drug -herb and drug-nutrient interactions. As they are both extensively trained in both co nventional approaches and natural medicine, they help bridge the gap that exists between conventional and traditional medicine practice. 3) Autonomous practice. The reason I have hope in spite of my medical condition and feel supported by my medical team of providers is due solely to the fact that my naturopathic doctor has referred me to these specialists who have supported my physical and mental well being throug h physical therapy, lymphatic massage therapy, counselling and other modalities. Please note that at no point have my general practitioners or neurologist referred me to these above mentioned augmentative therapies which I would now be in pain and depression without. In fact, counselling has 332 118probably preserved and strengthened my marriage and my mindset when I felt there might be no other way to cope except to leave. I see my medically-trained naturopathic doctor specifically because other medical prov iders do not have the same training and knowledge in both conventional and natural medicine. I trust them to recommend outside specialists as they are needed. 4.) Alternatives to regulation. As a patient and a consumer, I want access to safe (regulated) and holistic (in scope) care that best aligns with my health needs and priorities. There are no alternatives to regulat ion, including stricter consumer protection laws or inspection requirements, that address the fundamental issue of allowing naturopathic doctors to have an expanded and defined scope of practice in Virginia.While some alternative options may consider the real risk of harm that exists, they will not appropriately examine or take into cons ideration the other criteria that warrant licensing for naturopathic doctors. I respectfully urge the Board to work to join the 22 states and the District of Columbia with naturopathic licensing a nd recommend licensure for naturopathic doctors in Virginia. Licensing medically-tra ined naturopathic doctors will provide additional, safe healthcare access and options for the patients who need it most. Sincerely and with thanks, Leah Tweel Richmond, VA 333From: Dana Kleinschuster <dkleinschuster@verizon.net > Date: Tue, Aug 18, 2020 at 9:42 AMSubject: Written testimony for the support of NDTo: < elizabeth.carter@dhp.virginia.gov > Hello Dr. Carter, I was scheduled to speak on August 11th in support of the licensing of NDs but had to leave the call because of time constraints. I am sending my testimony in written format. Thank you, Dana Kleinschuster Hello My name is Dana Kleinschuster. I am a board cert ified pediatric nurse practitioner and have been practicing in the Richmond community for 25 years. I would like to speak in support for the licensure of naturopathic doctors. As a pediatric nurse practi tioner, my career not only focuses on diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of medical conditions in children but also includes preventative medicine. Compared to the few positions for NPs when I first graduated from school, there are now hundreds of nurse practitioners in the area. As we all know, today's medical system is overtaxed. Sometimes it is difficult to simply just get an appointment with a provider. I have personally witnesses how NPs have eased the overburdened medical system, allowed for better access to care, and helped to contain health care cost. In my opinion, licensed NDs will do the same...more people will be able to receive quality care in a timely manner. The regulations of licensure will establish minimal standards of practice so that the public can confidently choose a ND as a part of their health care team. I have also seen over the 25 years of working how important preventative care is for children. Unfortunately, the time constraints in most medical offices limit providers' ability to fully educate and discuss all aspects of wellness with families. Patients want to learn, want to avoid chronic illness, and want live well. NDs have the training, knowledge, and skills to meet those needs and their focus is on preventive medicine. Naturopathic doctors attend a four-year, in residence, post-graduate medical programs. In addition to studying a standard medical curriculum, NDs complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, physical medicine, and counseling. This extensive training enables a scope of practice to include the treatment of all aspects of family health and wellness. Licensure will allow NDs to practice to the full extent of their training. NDs do not replace traditional medi cine but can offer a more robust approach to overall health. For example, my mother has breast cancer and has re ceived wonderful care and treatment at a local hospital. She sought additional help from a ND to supplement and strengthen her body's ability to fight the cancer and heal from both the cancer and th e treatments. The ND worked in conjunction with traditional medicine, not in oppositi on. The ND was able to spend focused time on a highly individualized plan that helped educate my mother, strengthen her bo dy's ability to heal, and aid in the prevention of further illness. Naturopathic medicine has a distinct place in the medical community. Licensure is a commonsense and tangible way to protect the community by regulating care and ensuring that providers meet educational standards and continuing education requirements. It also will clearly define to the public the expertise, education and scope of practice of NDs. 334 Similarly, other professionals in the medical field can be confident that NDs have meet appropriate standards and are competent to provide quality and safe care. Licensure can help foster interdisciplinary approaches for the betterment of patients and the community. Thank you for your time.

Our memb ers work under many titles depending on the educational level completed. They go to reside nt and online learning programs that operate legally in the states where they originate. These schools are not diploma mills. Such as Internation Institute of Original Medicine in VA. Many of our members are licensed MDs, DCs, DDSs, and RNs that offer naturopathic therapies in their health ca re practices. Many of our members take the ANMCB certification exam. This is a 4 hour proctored ex amination set up and in place for 40 years. Licensing 18 practitioners in the state of VA wi ll not fill any gaps and practitioners currently offering low cost naturopathy in your state will suffer. ANMA represents 213 members in VA and we have been purposely left out of the regulation conversation. You are being asked to consider licensing na turopathic physicians, a small splinter group of naturopaths that want to include minor surgery a nd drugs in the practice of naturopathy without going to medical school. Don't be fooled by the efforts of this dangerous group wanting to \"get their foot in the door\" and eventually practice \"allopa thic medicine\" at expense of the citizens of the state of Virginia. This deceptive group has been before Virginia's legislature repeatedly since 2005 seeking the titles ND, NMD or Naturopathic Phys ician (basically whatever they can get) with 336 119medical rights. This year they come with hidd en features such as their own definition of naturopathic medicine. A definition that was invented by AANP in order to monopolize a profession they don't practice. The general public de fines naturopathy as natural and non invasive never including the practice of allopathy. AN MA opposes this bill based on our belief that graduates from the four year schools are no be tter trained than graduates from distance learning/resident naturopathic schools and all practitioners of naturopathy should only be allowed to practice naturopathy. Bastyr, National, Southwest and Boucher Institute in Canada are not recognized as REAL medical schools. Bast yr and National started as schools without labs. How can you be considered a medical school wi thout a lab? After it was reported to USDE that National was selling degrees National was forced to admitted to USDE that degrees from their school were sold, and they did not know how many or to whom. Those people are out there somewhere and they could come to the state of VA to get a license. A history of this group will show in the St ate of Washington, naturopa ths, who were once called \"drugless practitioners\" in 1987, have over the years, requested their legislature to allow them to use the term \"physician\". Also In the state of Washington through a \"Formulary Council\", buried within their legislation they now are allowed to prescribe Schedule III (heavy narcotics), and IV(codeine) medications, and perform Ch elation, IV drips, and minor surgery including \"malignant tumors\". Through a \"Formulary Council\" Oregon naturopathic doctors now prescribe Lunesta, Viagra, Ambien and opioids. None of th ese medications have any place in a real naturopathic practice. In CA a li censed naturopathic doctor killed hi s patient with a turmeric IV. He still has his license! Tell me where the protection is, if the licensure law was not passed in CA that man would be in jail now. The only benefit or protection from this licensure bill will be for the 18 people practicing outside of the scope of naturopathy, using therapies that have never been tested to see if they work or if they are safe. They come before you calling themselves cardiologists and oncologists, really??? This is awful. Parents think they are protecting their children by using a licensed naturopathic doctor, the license makes them think that it is the same as a going to a pediatrician just without drugs a nd their children end up dying on the way to the emergency room. They also order treatments from outside of the US without telling their patients. You should ask yourselves does the state of VA want to be a part of this? We can provide the proof for all of these facts provided to you here. Licensing is actually the problem. Licensure makes these practitioners appear to be something they are not. There is no naturopathic standard of practice or standard of title every state that licenses is different. You don't see that in the practice of medicine. In the practice of medicine all the practitioners are held to the same standard, the same accrediting bodies, the same liability insurance and educ ational standards from one s tate to another. Members of the public almost never go in search of a naturopath that practices allopathy. They are looking for a natural way to stay healthy and avoid having to go to their family primary care doctor. The cost to the citizens of Virginia for administration of such a board is prohibitive and the benefit is non-existent. In 2010 the Governor of CA recommended sunset for it's naturopathic board due to high cost and low turnout of licensees and in fact a representative from NY told this group to stop bringing legislation because it is a waste of their time and taxpayer dollars. Bridgeport had to terminate their ND program due to lack of interest. The truth is getting out. 337Graduates are coming out and telling their stori es about the lack of education provided and no oversight once in practice. If you still believe that these practitioners went to naturopathic sc hools and they learned allopathy including surgery and pharmacolog y, chiropractic's including massage and manipulation, as well as psychiatry then you should license them as integrative doctors or physicians, that is the definition of what they claim to practice and leave naturopathy out of the conversation. This would keep the public safe and they would not be confused about the care that naturopaths provide. I urge you to vote against the licensure of naturopathy and put an end to this madness.
