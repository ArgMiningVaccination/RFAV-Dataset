The Board rev iewed the draft legislative proposa l included in the agenda packet.

Approximately twelve states have one pharmacy technician member on the Board; one of these states has two positions for pharmacy technicians. Additional states are considering the allowance gi ven the discussions to expand the scope of duties for pharmacy technicians and the important role they play in the practice of pharmacy.

In this instance, a false negative result may be possible. Individuals who are contacts of a confirmed positive TB case may seek testing from a pharmacist. If a pharmacist becomes aware of this during the risk assessment, notification shall be made to the local health department. TST may still be performed. MEDICATIONS This protocol authorizes pharmacists to administer TST antigen, also known as purified protein derivative (PPD), read, and interpret the TST. The TST is one of two standard methods for determining whether a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosi s. This protocol authorizes the pharmacist to dispense and administer the following products with an approved indication for TST. Product Mfr. / Dist. = 42023 -104-05 *or any other FDA -approved tuberculin skin test antigen PROCEDURES FOR INITIATION OF TB SCREENING Decision to conduct a TST will be based on relevant medical and social history and consideration of contraindications and precautions as outlined in this protocol and in the A merican Thoracic Society (ATC) /CDC Guideline.1 A risk assessment should be conducted by the pharmacist prior to initiation of the TST. The form in Appendix A can be used to complete the risk assessment. This assessment should not be self- administered by the client. The Report of Tuberculosis Screening in Appendix B must be completed at the conclusion of the screening. The Report (Appendix B) may be provided to the patient and may be subsequently provided to an employer, if necessary , and authorized by the patient. If active TB symptoms are present or indicated on the TB risk assessment documentation (see Appendix A), the patient must be immediately referred to a healthcare provider for further evaluation and further advised regarding isolation precautions. 120 Adopted: 9/24/2021 Revised: 9/6/2022 Effective: 12/22/2021 by injecting 0.1mL of tuberculin PPD in the inner surface of the forearm. The injection should be made with a tuberculin syringe, with the needle bevel facing upward. The TST is an intradermal injection. When placed correctly, the injection should produce a pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6 to 10 mm in diameter (see Appendix C for detailed procedures for placing the TST ). PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP The skin test reaction should be read between 48 and 72 hours after ad ministration. Schedule an appointment for the reading at the time the TST is administered. An individual who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction should be measured in millimeters of the induratio n (palpable, raised, hardened area or swelling). The reader should not measure erythema (redness). The diameter of the indurated area should be measured across the forearm (perpendicular to the long axis) and recorded as millimeters of induration. Interpretation and classification of TST results is determined by diameter of induration and consideration of risk factors as outlined in Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States: Clinical Recommendations (NTCA/NTSC, 2021 ) 3 (Appendix D). If active TB symptoms are present or indicated on the TB risk assessment documentation (see Appendix A), patients must be immediately referred to a healthcare provider for further evaluation and further advised regarding isolation precautions. COUNSELING REQUIREMENTS Individuals receiving TST will receive counseling regarding: Need to return in 48 -72 hours for interpretation of the TST If mild itchiness occurs, avoid scratching the site. Do not use creams or other treatments to treat the itchiness. Redness may develop. This is a normal reaction, avoid using creams or other treatments. Result of the TST Need for confirmatory evaluation and a chest X -ray following a positive TST result Between an initial positive TST and confirmatory evaluation, the patient may carry on normal activity unless showing signs and symptoms of active TB disease. If active TB symptoms are present or indicated on the TB risk assessment documentation (Appendix A), the patient must be immediately r eferred to a healthcare provider for further evaluation and further advised regarding isolation precautions. DOCUMENTATION 121 Adopted: 9/24/2021 Revised: 9/6/2022 Effective: 12/22/2021 5 Pharmacists will document via prescription or medical record each person who receives a TST under this protocol including: 1. Documentation for the dispensing of prescription medication; and documentation that the individual receiving the TST was provided with the required counseling and referral information pursuant to this protocol. 2. Documentation of the completion of the risk assessment, date and time of test placement , date and time of test reading, results and interpretation must be maintained by the pharmacist and provided to the patient and shall include both the millimeters of induration and interpretation of the test ( negative or positive). 3. Individual test results, either positive or negative, may be provided to others upon the individual's request. This can include employers when testing is provided as a requirement of employment. The Report of TB Screening is included in Appendix B. The individual should sign a release of information indicating the individual's consent that this information can be shared (refer to the Patient Authorization section in Appendix A). 4. Certain laws or regulations may preclude a pharmacist fr om signing documentation for an individual to certify the individual has been examined and is free of tuberculosis. This should be ascertained prior to administration of the TST. The individual may have to be referred back to their primary care provider t o obtain necessary certification. NOTIFICATION AND REFERRAL Prior to screening the patient for TB, the patient must complete and sign the Patient Authorization section of Appendix A authorizing the pharmacist to notify the primary health care provider or local health department of a positive TST result. If the pat ient refuses such authorization, the pharmacist shall not screen the patient for TB and shall refer the patient to a primary health care provider for evaluation. If the patient does not have a primary health care provider, the pharmacist shall counsel the patient regarding the benefits of establishing a relationship with a primary health care provider and, upon request, provide information regarding primary health care providers, including federally qualified health centers, free clinics, or local health d epartments serving the area in which the patient is located. Pursuant to \u00a7 54.1 -3303.1 of the Code of Virginia, a pharmacist who administers PPD for a TST shall notify the patient's primary health care provider that the pharmacist has administered a TST and inform the provider of the test results within three (3) business days, provided that the patient consents to such notification. If the patient does not have a primary health care provider, the pharmacist shall counsel the patient regarding the benefits of establishing a relationship with a primary health care provider and , upon request, provide information regarding primary health care providers, including federally qualified health centers, free clinics, or local health departments serving the 122 Adopted: 9/24/2021 Revised: 9/6/2022 Effective: 12/22/2021 6 area in which the patient is located.

If active TB symptoms are present or indicated on the TB risk assessment documentation (see Appendix A), patients must be immediately referred to a healthcare provider for further evaluation and further advised regarding isolation precautions. An initial positive reaction is considered a TB infection and a second TST is not required. The patient will need to receive a che st x-ray and additional evaluation to rule out active TB disease. An initial negative reaction requires a retest 1 -3 weeks after the initial TST. Upon retesting, a negative reaction suggests the patient does not have a TB infection, in which case a TST can be repeated annually, if required. However, a positive reaction after retesting is considered a boosted reaction due to a TB infection that occurred a long time ago. In this case, the patient will need to receive a chest x -ray and additional evaluation to rule out active TB disease. A referral is required for this follow -up and so that treatment considerations can be made if latent TB infection is diagnosed (see Appendix E) 2. COUNSELING REQUIREMENTS Adopted: 9/24/2021 Revised: 12/22/2021 Individuals receiving TST will receive counseling regarding: Need to return in 48 -72 hours for interpretation of the TST If mild itchiness occurs, avoid scratching the site.

A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall maintain such documentation in writing or electronically for 20658 three years from the date of dispensing and such documentation shall be made available in accordance with regulation. J. A pharmacist shall exercise professional judgment to determine whether to dispense cannabis pr oducts to a registered patie nt, parent, legal guardian, or registered agent if the pharmacist suspects that dispensing cannabis products to the registered patient, parent, legal guardian, or registered agent may have negative health or safety consequences for the registered patient o r the public. 18VAC110-60- 320. Dispensing error review and reporting; quality assurance program. A. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall implement and comply with a quality assurance program that describes, in writing, policies and procedures to detect, identify, and prevent dispensing errors. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall distribute the written policies and procedures to all pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility employees and shall make the written policies and procedures readily available on the premises of the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility. The policies and procedures shall include: 1. Directions for communicating the details of a dispensing error to the practitioner who certified a qualifying patient and to the qualifying patient, the patient's parent or legal guardian, the patient's registered agent, or appropriate family member if the patient is deceased or is unable to fully comprehend the communication. The communication shall describe methods of correcting the dispensing error or reducing the negative impact of the error on the qualifying patient; and 2. A process to document and assess dispensing errors to determine the cause of the error and an appropriate response. B. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall use the findings of its quality assurance program to develop systems and workflow processes designed to prevent dispensing errors. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility PIC shall: 1. Inform pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility employees of changes to policy, procedure, systems, or processes made as a result of recommendations generated by the quality assurance program; 2. Not ify all processor or facility employees that the discovery or reporting of a dispensing error shall be relayed immediately to a pharmacist on duty; 3. Ensure that a pharmacist performs a quality assurance review for each dispensing error. A pharmacist shall commence such review as soon as is reasonably possible, but no later than two business days from the date the dispensing error is discovered; and 4. Create a record of every quality assurance review. This record shall contain at least the following: 20759 a. The date of the quality assurance review and the names and titles of the persons performing the review; b. The pertinent data and other information relating to the dispensing error reviewed; c. Documentation of contact with the registered pat ient, parent, legal guardian, or registered agent, where applicable, and the practitioner who certified the patient; d.

A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall maintain for three years a copy of the pharmaceutical processor's or cannabis dispensing facility's quality assurance program and records of all reported dispensing errors and quality assurance reviews in an orderly manner and filed by date. 18VAC110-60-321. Devices, hemp- based CBD products, and inert product samples. A. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may have for sale on -site devices intended for the administration of dispensed cannabis products and hemp based CBD products that meet the applicable standards set forth in state and federal law and that meet testing requirements of 18VAC110- 60-280 D 2 and D 3. B. The pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may use and distribute inert product samples that do not contain any active cannabinoids for patient demonstration exclusively at the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility without the need for a written certification. Such inert product samples may not be sold or further distributed. 18VAC110-60- 330. Disposal of cannabis products. A. To mitigate the risk of diversion, a pharmaceutical processor shall routinely and promptly dispose of undesired, excess, unauthorized, obsolete, adulterated, misbranded, or deteriorated green waste, chemical, dangerous, and hazardo us waste, extracts, and cannabis products, as applicable. Green waste includes Cannabis plants seeds and parts of plants. Green waste shall be weighed, ground, and combined with a minimum of 51% non- cannabis waste to render the mixture inactive and unrecog nizable. Once rendered unrecognizable, green waste shall be considered agricultural waste and may be disposed of accordingly. B. The destruction and disposal of green waste, extracts, and cannabis oil, as applicable, shall be wit nessed by a pharmacist and at least one other employee or the responsible party of the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility, respectively, and shall be conducted under video surveillance. 20860 The persons destroying and disposing of the green waste, extracts, or cannabis products shall maintain and make available a separate record of each occurrence of destruction and disposal indicating: 1. The date and time of destruction and disposal; 2. The manner of destruction and disposal;3. The name and quantity of cannabis product and green waste destroyed and disposed of; and 4. The signatures of the persons destroying and disposing of the green waste, extracts, or cannabis products. C.Disposal of green waste may be by incineration, inert composting, or any other means of di spo sal or destruction. D. A pharmaceutical processor may sell or otherwise distribute inert composted green waste. E.The record of destruction and disposal shall be maintained at the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility for three years from the date of destruction and disposal. F. Disposal of chemical, dangerous, and hazardous waste must be conducted in a manner consistent with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This may include, but is not limited to, any waste product soaked in a flammable solvent. 1.Any waste that may be hazardous must be treated as hazardous waste in regard to storage, labeling, and disposal. 2.The pharmaceutical processor can, alternatively, test waste that may be hazardous for elemental impurities content. a.When tested for elemental impurities content, materials that meet the definition of hazardous waste, as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") or other applicable federal, state, or local statutes and regulations, must be treated as hazardous waste. Such materials must be properly labeled, contained, stored, and disposed of in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency, RCRA, and other applicable regulations for hazardous waste. b.Materials that contain elemental impurities concentrations less than the allowable concentration limits specified in RCRA and are not designated hazardous waste by other applicable federal, state, or local statutes and regulations, may be disposed of in accordance with this section. 209 August 12, 2022 via Electronic transmission Erin L. Barrett Agency Regulatory Coordinator 9960 Mayland Drive; Suite 300 Henrico, VA 23233 Dear Ms Barrett: Thank you for the opportunity to submit public comm ent on the proposed changes to the Regulations Governing Pharmaceutical Processors, Title of Regulations: 18 VAC 110-60-10 et seq. We appreciate the diligent efforts of the Board of Phar macy in drafting proposed regulations to conform to the legislation passed by the 2022 Virginia Genera l Assembly which eliminated mandatory patient registration and made changes in allowable manufacturing and extraction of cannabis products, wholesale transactions of bulk cannabis, and marketing of cannabis products, as well as other changes. Thanks to these program improvement s, thousands of qualified patients in Virginia now have improved access to the medical cannabis program. In reviewing the proposed regulation changes, we noted a discrepancy in 18VAC110-60-220 (B)(2) and 18VAC110-60-251(A) pertaining to language regard ing pharmaceutical processors' inter-dispensary transfers of cannabis, specifically cannabis oils . Section 18VAC110-60-220 (B)(2) includes permissive language to \"Sell, deliver, transport, or distribute ca nnabis products to any other facility, except that it may distribute cannabis products back to the pharmaceutical processor from which it obtained the products or distribute cannabis oil products between cannabis dispensing facilities\". This Section 18VAC110-60-220 (B)(2) omits the ability to send the other product forms (beyond cannabis oil) between dispensing facilities. Our recommendation is to revise Section 18VAC110 -60-220 (B)(2) to allow for inter-dispensary transfers of all cannabis products. We believe this meets the intent. We appreciate the opportunity to provide this public comment and look forward to our continued work together.

Department of Health Professions 9960 Mayland Drive Henrico, VA 23233 RE: Dalitso, LLC Public Comment re: Pharmaceutical Processor Proposed Dear Ms. Barrett: Macaulay, Jamerson & Sessa , P.C. represents Dalitso LLC and its parent, Jushi Inc. On behalf of Dalitso, please find enclosed requested changes to the draft Regulations Governing Pharmaceutical Processors. Dalitso sincerely appreciates the time and attention the Board of Pharmacy (\"Board\") has given to drafting the regulations now open for public comment (the \"Regulations\"). Without waiving its previous public comment, and while reiterating those associated request for changes, Daliso respectfully seeks specific clarifications and recommends minor revisions as set forth herein. 1. 18VAC110-65-50. Voluntary registration of a patient, parent, legal guardian, or registered agent. This regulation appears in conflict with the statutory changes set forth in HB 933 as it amended Va. Code 54.1-3408.3(F), which eliminated mandatory registration for patients, parents and legal guardians. The second sentence of section A is now proposed to read: \"If the qualifying patient is a minor or a vulnerable adult, the qualifying patient's parent or legal guardian shall register with the board in accordance with this section.\" Retaining \"shall\" in this subsection does not reflect that registration for parents and guardians is now voluntary. The section should be clarified that the regulation will now only apply to those parents and legal guardians who voluntarily register. Recommended Revision: 211Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 2 1021 Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com \"If the qualifying patient is a minor or vulnerable adult, the qualifying patient's parent or guardian may voluntarily request registration shall register with the board [ ].\" 2. 18VAC110-60-215. Advertising. Dalitso understood the legislative intent of HB 933's sixth enactment clause, which gave rise to proposed changes in this section, as a direction to replace the existing language with the language set forth in enactment clause six. Simply inserting proposed Section A as a prologue to the existing rule creates redundan ces and compromise clarity. Recommended Revisions: (i) Strike subsection (B) and allow HB 933's language to stand on its own. (ii) If the existing regulatory language is not removed entirely, then the proposed Section A should be blended with existing regulation to avoid confusing overlap. A. A pharmaceutical processor may engage in marketing activities related to products, the medical cannabis program, the pharmaceutical processor company, and related communications, except those marketing activities that (i) include false, or misleading or deceptive statements; (ii) promote excessive consumption; (iii) depict a person younger than 21 years of age consuming cannabis; (iv) include any image designed or likely to appeal to minors, specifically including cartoons characters, mascots, toys, animals, children, or any other likeness to images, character, or phrases that are popularly used to advertise to children; (v) depict products or product packaging or labeling that bears reasonable resemblance to any product legally available for consumption as a candy or that promotes cannabis consumption; (vi) contain any seal, flag, crest, coat of arms, or other insignia that is likely to mislead patients or the general public to believe that the cannabis product has been endorsed, made, or used by the Commonwealth of Virginia or any of its representatives except where specifically authorized. B. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall not advertise (i) through any means unless at least 85% of the aud ience is reasonably expected to be 18 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up -to-date audience composition data or (ii) on television or the radio at any time outside of regular school hours for elementary and secondary schools. Grounds for revision: Restricting advertising to adults 18 years of age or older is captured in section (A). C. Advertising must accurately and legibly identify the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility responsible for its content and inclu de a statement that cannabis products are for use by registered patients only. Any advertisement for cannabis products that is related to the benefits, safety, or efficacy, including therapeutic or medical claims, shall: 1. Be supported by substantial, current clinical evidence or data; and 2. Include information on side effects or risks associated with the use of cannabis. 212Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 3 1021 Street Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com D. Advertising shall not: 1. Be misleading, deceptive, or false or Contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular manner or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of cannabis consumption; Grounds for revision: Prohibiting false and misleading advertising is captured in section (A), which is further amended as shown above to incorporate \"deceptive\" advertising. 2. Contain a statement, design, illustration, picture, or representation that: a. Encourages or represents the recreational use of cannabis; b. Targets or is attractive to persons younger than 18 years of age, including a cartoon character, a mascot, or any other depiction or image that is commonly used to market products to minors; c. Displays the use of cannabis, including the consumption, smoking, or vaping of cannabis; d. Encourages or promotes cannabis for use as an intoxicant; or e. Is obscene or indecent. Grounds for revision - 2(b): Prohibiting use of material attractive to children in advertisements or advertisements that target children is addressed in section (A). 3. Display cannabis or cannabis product pricing except as allowed in 18VAC110 -60- 215 F. 4. Display cannabis products or images of products where the advertisement is visible to members of the public from any street, sidewalk, park, or other public place; and 5. Include coupons, giveaways of free cannabis products, or distribution of merchandise that displays anything other than the facility name and contact information. E. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may list its business in public phone books, business directories, search engines, or other places where it is reasonable for a business to maintain an informational presence of its existence and a description of the nature of the business. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility s hall not engage in the use of pop-up digital advertisements. Grounds for revision - E: Existing language is inconsistent with HB 933, enactment clause 6. Acceptable media and scope of advertising is captured in section (A). F. Any website or social media site owned, managed, or operated by a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall employ a neutral age -screening mechanism that verifies that the user is at least 18 years of age, including by using an age -gate, age-screen, or age verification mechanism. This provision shall apply to any social media site owned, managed, or operated by a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility to the extent an age screening tool is available. 213Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 4 1021 East Cary Street Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com Grounds for revision - F: This proposed revision addresses technical differences between websites and social media platforms as applied to age gates. G. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility may display the following information on its website or social media site: 1. Name and location of the processor or facility; 2. Contact information for the processor or facility; 3. Hours and days the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility is open for dispensing cannabis products; 4. Laboratory results; 5. Product information and pricing; 6. Directions to the processor or facility; and 7. Materials regarding the use of cannabis products that are supported by substantial, current clinical evidence or data ; and 8. Educational materials regarding the use of cannabis products that are supported by substantial, current clinical evidence or data . H. Communication and engagement for educational purposes with registered practitioners, registered patients, parents, legal guardians, registered agents, other health care practitioners, and the general public, including the dissemination of information permi tted by 18VAC110-60-215 F and educational materials regarding the use of cannabis products available from the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility, is allowed. I. No outdoor cannabis product advertising shall be placed within 1,000 feet of (i) a school or daycare; (ii) a public or private playground or similar recreational or child -centered facility; or (iii) a substance use disorder treatment facility. J. Signs placed on the property of a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facil ity shall not: 1. Display imagery of cannabis or the use of cannabis or utilize long luminous gas - discharge tubes that contain rarefied neon or other gases; 2. Draw undue attention to the facility but may be designed to assist registered patients, parents, legal guardians, and registered agents to find the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility; or 3. Be illuminated during non-business hours. K. All outdoor signage must be in compliance with local or state requirements. L. A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility shall not advertise at any sporting event or use any billboard advertisements. 214Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 5 1021 East Cary Street Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com M. No cannabis product advertising shall be on or in a public transit vehicle, public transit shelter, bus stop, taxi stand, transportation waiting area, train station, airport, or any similar transit-related location. 3. 18VAC110-60-280. Cultivation, Production, and Dispensing. In section A, there appears to be a legacy reference to petroleum -based solvents in the top line that should be removed. Recommended Revision: \"A. No cannabis products shall have had pesticide chemicals or petroleum-based solvents used during the cultivation, extraction, production, or manufacturing process [ ].\" Grounds for revision: Internal consistency and alignment with HB 933, enactment clause 6. In subsection B(2)(b): o The reference to \"regulations of any state\" is concerningly broad and should be revised. o Reference to any agency other than the Board of Pharmacy should be carefully considered. \u00a7 Application of another body of law or otherwise unrelated regulations could have serious implications in ensuring a stable supply chain and patient access to cannabis products. \u00a7 Neither a federal agency nor any other Virginia agency regulates cannabis and therefore such bodies would not have cause to contemplate cannabis product production in regulations. \u00a7 In short, the absence of rules governing technology or use of technology that specifically address cannabis product production or application to cannabis generally should not work to prevent implementation of HB 933, enactment clause 2. Recommended Revision: \"b. The pharmaceutical processor complies with any licensing, permitting, and general safety laws or regulations of any state or federal or Virginia state agency which governs the technology and the use of such technology, except that any such regulations shall not prohibit or restrict a pharmaceutical processor from using a particular technology where regulations governing the technology and its use do not contemplate cannabis product production;\" Grounds for revision: Necessary clarification limiting ap plicable state-level authority to the laws and regulations of Virginia and ensuring enactment clause 2 of HB 933 can be effectively implemented. In subsection B(2)(c), creating a strict liability standard for any \"adverse event\" is overly broad, punitive and could foreclose the processor from raising appropriate legal defenses or bringing cross 215Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 6 1021 East Cary Street Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com claim actions in the event of a product defect in the extraction device. Further, producing cannabis products per se violates federal law notwithstanding the type o f extraction technology used. Recommended Revision: Strike subsection (c). Processors are already liable for adverse outcomes by virtue of their licenses. In the alternative, if the Board believes imposing a higher liability standard is necessary with respect to non-CO2 extraction, revise subsection (c) to provide clarity and specificity as follows: o \"adverse outcome\" should be limited to manufacturing-type accidents resulting in serious bodily injury causally linked to improper use of non -CO2 extraction equipment installed, used and maintained as recommended or otherwise endorsed by the equipment manufacturer. o To the extent the Board construes this liability provision to also apply to adverse patient outcomes: \u00a7 Here, \"adverse outcomes\" triggering a heightened liability standard must be limited to those events resulting in serious bodily injury causally linked to either (i) a substance used in non-CO2 extraction, or (ii) improper use of non-CO2 extraction equipment or processes, and (iii) the processor's failure to test, package and label, and register the product in question as required by 18VAC110-60-300, 18VAC110-60-290 and 18VAC110-60-285, respectively. \u00a7 Such language should be added to this subsection if the Board does construe an \"adverse outcome\" as applicable to patient outcomes as opposed to manufacturing operations. o The pharmaceutical processor maintains sole responsibility for any adverse outcomes or violations of state or federal laws or regulations governing non-CO2 extraction equipment and arising from such use that results in serious bodily injury causally linked to improper use of technology installed, used and maintained as recommended or otherwise endorsed by the equipment manufacturer. Grounds for re vision: Provide the regulated community with clarity and specificity respecting liability. 4. 18VAC110-60-281. Use of Hydrocarbon-based solvents. Generally: The proposed reference to OSHA standards should be reconsidered as OSHA is not a cannabis-specific authority and nationally recognized cannabis -specific authorities are available. Regulations governing cannabis extraction and manufacturing are spelled out in the international codes and fire codes. 216Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 7 1021 East 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com Dalitso consulted third-party experts who noted using OSHA standards for extraction - related issues would be inconsistent with how other jurisdictions are currently handling safety standards and recommended reviewing and considering the requirements set forth in the following authorities: o National Fire Protection Association, Chapter 38 (Marijuana Growing, Processing or Extraction Facilities) \u00a7 https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of- codes-and-standards/detail?code=1 o National Fire Protection Association, Chapter 33 (Spray Application Using Flammable or Combustible Materials) \u00a7 https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of- codes-and-standards/detail?code=33 o International Fire Code, Chapter (Processing and Extraction Facilities ) \u00a7 https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IFC2018P6/chapter -39-processing-and- extraction-facilities o International Building Code \u00a7 https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IBC2021P2 o International Mechanical Code, Section 510 (Hazardous Exhaust Systems) \u00a7 https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IMC2018/chapter -5-exhaust- systems#IMC2018_Ch05_Sec510 Relating to section (B)(5): Creating a strict liability stand ard for any \"adverse event\" is overly broad, punitive and could foreclose the processor from raising appropriate legal defenses or bringing cross claim actions in the event of a product defect in the extraction device. See generally comments to section 18VAC110-60-280(B)(2)(b) above. Relating to section (B)(8)(b): Hydrocarbon extraction systems cannot be \"listed\" at this point in time. The systems are reviewed by a registered design professional and an Engineering Peer Reviewed technical report (EPR) is issued for the system. The EPR is submitted to the authority having jurisdiction for review and approval. Following installation and prior to operation, the designer/engineer of record performs a field verification of the extraction unit and produces a technical report to confirm the equipment installed is the same model and type as was identified in the techn ical report. This report is also shared with the authority having jurisdiction for review and approval. 217Macaulay Jamerson & Sessa, PC Page 8 1021 East Cary Street Suite 1002 Richmond, Virginia 23219 804.216.3000 www.macjamlaw.com Finally, it is Dalitso's understanding that the following transportation is authorized under the proposed regulations: A pharmaceutical processor may transport bulk cannabis oil, botanical cannabis , usable cannabis and cannabis products between processor facilities, and Cannabis products may be transported between cannabis dispensing facilities, between a processor facility and one or more dispensing facilities, and from a dispensing facility to a certified patients subject to delivery requirements. Thank you for your consideration of Dalitso's requested clarifications and changes. Sincerely, Hunter W.

When a pharmacy intern is engaged in obtaining required practical experience hours, to be used either by the college of pharmacy or submitte d to the Board on an affidavit, the pharmacy intern is not counted in the pharmacist to pharmacy technician ratio. For example, one pharmacist could be supervising a pharmacy intern for experience and up to four pharmacy technicians at the same time. The Board has determined that properly registered pharmacy interns may also act as pharmacy technicians without being registered as such during times when they are not gaining practical experience. Pharmacy interns when acting as pharmacy technicians, shal l be considered part of the 1:4 pharmacist to technician ratio. Pharmacy technician trainees performing technician tasks in a pharmacy, are considered to be acting as pharmacy technicians and as such, are included in the 1:4 pharmacist to technician ratio. Except for the administration of drugs or devices, a pharmacy technician trainee enrolled in a training program for pharmacy technicians may engage in acts pursuant to \u00a7 54.1- 3321 (A) for the purpose of obtaining practical experience required for completion of the training program, so long as such activities are directly monitored by a supervising pharmacist. 237Agenda Item: Amendment of Guidance Document 110 -25 Included in your agenda package are: Suggested amendments to Guidance Document 110-25 in redline.

Pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1-3321(I), a registered nu rse (\"RN\") or licensed practical nur se (\"LPN\") practicing at an OTP may perform duties otherwise limited to a pharmacy technician under \u00a7 54.1-3321(A), provided that all take- home medication doses are verified for accuracy by a pharmacist. Additionally, Ww hile waivers are granted by the Board on an individual case basis after considering the merit of each such request, the Board will normally waive certain provisions of 18VAC110-20-190 to allow nurses access to an OTP pharmacy at a time when the pharmacist is not on-duty for the purpose of obtaining methadone doses for administration and retrieving pharmacist-verified take home doses of methadone and buprenorphine . Pharmacies located within an OTP should comply with the following guidance to ensure drug security and protect against diversion: Preparation of drugs for administration and dispensing A pharmacist , or a registered pharmacy technician under the supervision of a pharmacist , or an RN or LPN under the supervision of a pharmacist must prepare the methadone take-home doses or the dispensing of other drugs, to include perf orming the data entry of information into a computer system, if applicable, and the repackaging and labeling of the drugs. There is no authority for nurses to prepare or pre-label bottles for methadone take-home doses or other drugs for dispensing, as they may not perform duties rest ricted to a pharmacy technician in \u00a7 54.1-3321 unless they are registered as a pharmacy technician. If certain provisions of 18VAC110-20-190, such as the requirement that the pharmacy enclosure be locked and alarmed at all times when a pharmacist is not on duty, are waived by the Board to allow nurses access to the pharmacy at a time when the pharmacist is not on-duty for the purpose of obtaining methadone or buprenorphine doses for administration or retrieving pharmacist- verified take home doses of methadone and buprenorphine , then the nurse may access the key and alarm code for this specific purpose only. The pharmacy must remain locked and alarmed at all other times. The nurse must ensure a valid order for administration exists prior to preparing the drug for administration and must properly mainta in a record of administration that contains minimally, the name of the patient, name of ordering physician, drug name, drug strength, quantity of drug administered, and date of ad ministration. The pharmacy's inventory records must also accurately reflect the drug name, drug strength, quantity of drug removed from stock, date, and identification of person removing drug from inventory for patient administration. Only one drug and strength, as ordered for the patient, may be placed in the container, i.e., do not combine multiple strengths of a single drug or multiple types of drugs in one labeled container. Additionally, caution should be taken to not mix the same drug from multiple manufacturers in the same container. The National Drug Code (NDC) for the actual dr ug dispensed or administered should be accurately captured in the computer system, if app licable, and on all applicable records. If the November 28, 2019October 27, 2022 2 computer defaults to a particular drug strength th at is not consistent with the actual drug being dispensed, this must be corrected prior to dispensing or administering to accurately reflect the drug administered or dispensed. Per 2008 guidance from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the label for a methadone take-home dose should include the opioid treatment program's name, address, telephone number, patient's name, medication name, physician's name, and dispensing date. In addition, labels for liquid methadone should include the dose and the directions of use such as \"single dose. \". The label for dispensed drugs, other than methadone, shall include all required elements for a dispensed prescription drug. For example, the labels for Suboxone\u00ae or Subutex\u00ae should also include the strength, quantity dispensed, and the appropriate directions of use such as \"Take [#] tablet(s) under the tongue once a day\" or \"Take [#] tablet(s) once a day,\" respectively. Appropriate cautionary statements should also appear on the take-home bottle. According to 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 290.5 : [t]he label of any drug listed as a 'controlled substance' in schedule II, III, or IV of the Federal Controlled Substances Act shall, when dispensed to or for a patient, contain the following warning: \"Caution: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person other than the patient for whom it was prescribed.\" , \"[t]he label of any drug listed as a 'control led substance' in schedule II, III, or IV of the Federal Controlled Substances Act shall, when dispensed to or for a patient, contain the following warning: 'Caution: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person other than the patient for whom it was prescribed.'\" A pharmacist must verify the accuracy of take-home doses and other dispensed drugs in all aspects, including verification that a valid order ex ists, prior to the patient receiving the drug. Records The pharmacist must ensure records are properly maintained, to include all invoices, orders, and inventories, and should ensure that nurses are properly trained in recordkeeping requirements. Drug that is returned to stock must be inventoried. The pharmacist must print a reconciliation report and should routinely review the reconciliatio n report for accuracy and patterns of possible diversion. Overfill in manufacturer packages must be rec onciled in the inventory record. The pharmacist may request a letter from the manufacturer re garding the amount of overfill in a bottle. The total amount, including overfill, may be accounted for when the bottle is initially added to inventory or the amount of overfill can be added as a separate entry. Spillage of drugs must be accurately documented. Expired drugs Expired drugs must be segregated from the work ing stock and stored within the pharmacy. Expired drugs must be included in the inventory record until returned to a reverse distributor. Some software programs offer a \"quarantine\" feature to identify drugs removed from the working stock. Expired drugs should not be \"stockpiled\", but should be returned to a reverse distributor as soon as possible.

Patient address may be entered on the prescription either by the prescriber or agent, or recorded by the pharmacist on the prescription or in an electronic prescription dispensing record system. F or prescriptions which provide expedited partner therapy pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1- 3303, \"Expedited Partner Therapy\" or \"EPT\" may be entered for the patient's name and address if otherwise unknown.

Prescriber information shall be either preprinted on the blank, electronically printed, typed, stamped, or printed by hand in a legible manner. Interns and residents in a residency program may use the h ospital DEA number and an assigned suffix. Prescriptions issued by physician assistants for drugs in Schedule II -V shall also include the name of their collaborating physician or podiatrist. Note: t he physician is not required to co- sign a physician ass istant's prescription for a Schedule II -VI drug . As of March 4, 2020, nurse practitioners are no longer issued a separate license for prescriptive authority. Nurse practitioners who have been granted prescriptive authority will have an additional designation of \"RX Authority\" clearly displayed on their license to practice nursing which begins with the numbers 0024. Nurse practitioners who are authorized for autonomous practice or who are authorized by a practice agreement with a collaborating physician to prescribe Schedule II -VI drugs are not required to include the prescriptive authority number issued to them by the Boards of Nursing and Medicine , if their DEA registration number is included on the prescription. Nurse practitioners who are authorized by a practice agreement to only prescribe Schedule VI drugs and who do not have a DEA number must include the prescriptive authority number issued to them by the Boards of Nursing and Medicine. Written prescriptions shall be legibly written with ink or indiv idually typed or printed. Written prescriptions may be prepared by an agent for the prescriber's signature, but shall be manually signed by the prescriber. Computer- generated prescriptions that are printed out shall be manually signed by the prescriber . 254Guidance Document : 110-35 Revised: September 6, 2022 Effective: October 27, 2022 Page 2 Written prescriptions shall be dated with the date the prescription is written. While Virginia law does not specifically require that quantity be included on a prescription, written prescriptions must include some direction related to quantity to be dispensed, or authorized duration of the order by which the pharmacist can calculate the authorized quantity using directions for use and duration. Federal regulations require that quantity be indicated on prescriptions for Schedule II-V controlled substan ces. Prescriptions for Schedule VI drugs may be preprinted with the drug name, directions for use, quantity, but must still meet all other requirements of individually written prescriptions for patient name, signatures, issue date, and any other required information. Preprinted prescriptions may contain a list of drugs with a checkbox beside the drug name to be selected by the prescriber, but only one drug may be selected for each prescription. Schedule II prescriptions shall be written and may not be re filled. There is no longer a specific format required for written prescriptions. A pharmacist may substitute an O range -Book rated \" therapeutically equivalent drug product\" for a brand name drug unless the prescriber prohibits substitution by indicating \"brand medically necessary.\" A prescription blank may only contain one prescription. There are a few limited exceptions to this law such as multiple blanks for the Department of Corrections and chart orders for hospital, nursing home, home infusion, and hospice patients. A chart order may be filled by an outpatient (community/retail) pharmacy for outpatient use provided the following conditions are met: o The chart order was written for a patient while in a hospital or long term care facility. o The pharma cist has all information necessary to constitute a valid outpatient prescription. o The pharmacist in an outpatient setting must have direction , either written or obtained verbally , that the chart order is actually intended to be outpatient or discharge prescription orders, and not merely a listing drugs the patient was taking while an inpatient. o The orders include some direction related to quantity to be dispensed or authorized duration of the order by which the pharmacist can calculate the authorized quanti ty using directions for use and duration. Requirements of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services for written prescriptions for Medicaid and FAMIS fee-for- service patients: Tamper -resistant prescriptions are required for all prescriptions u sed for Medicaid and FAMIS fee-for-service recipients. Tamper resistant pads are defined as having at least one feature in all three of the following categories: 255Guidance Document : 110-35 Revised: September 6, 2022 Effective: October 27, 2022 Page 3 1) One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent unauthorized copying of a completed or blank prescription form, 2) One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent the erasure or modification of information written on the prescription by the prescriber, or 3) One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent the use of counterfeit prescription forms. Oral Prescriptions: Oral prescriptions shall contain all the same information as written prescriptions except for the prescriber's signature, and shall be reduced to writing by the pharmacist receiving the prescriptio n. The prescriber or his authorized agent may transmit the prescription. If transmitted by an authorized agent, the pharmacist shall record the full name of the agent. A ccording to Virginia law, an authorized agent may only be an employee of the prescriber under his immediate and personal supervision, or if not an employee may only be someone who holds a license to administer drugs, such as a nurse, physician assistant, or another pharmacist. For Schedule II -V oral prescriptions, DEA may interpret the authority of an agent differently, as well as who can be an authorized agent. Faxed Prescriptions: A faxed prescription that starts out as a written prescription and is placed onto a fax machine in the physician' s office a nd sent via phone to a pharmacy' s fax machine where a facsimile image is printed for the pharmacy records must meet all requirements for a written prescription, to include the manual signature of the prescriber. Computer- generated prescriptions that are faxed must be manually signed by the prescriber. Schedule III -VI prescriptions may be faxed to a pharmacy. Schedule II prescriptions (or chart orders) may only be faxed to a pharmacy for long term care facility patients , home infusion patients, and hospice patients. Pharmacies may no t begin the dispensing process when a prescription is faxed directly from the patient , even if the patient brings in the hard copy when they come to pick up the medication. Prescriptions may only be faxed from the prescriber's practice location Electronically transmitted prescriptions: An electronically transmitted prescription is one that is generated from the prescriber' s office electronically, sent out as an electronic transmission, is normally routed through a switch to the appropriate pharmacy, and i s received by the pharmacy in the form of an electronic transmission or is converted by the switch to a fax, and is printed out on the pharmacy' s fax machine. \"Electronic prescription\" means a written prescription that is generated on an 256Guidance Document : 110-35 Revised: September 6, 2022 Effective: October 27, 2022 Page 4 electronic application and transmitted to a pharmacy as an electronic data file. An electronically transmitted prescription does not have a manual signature, but would contain an electronic or digital signatur e of the prescriber that identifies him as the source of the mess age and indicates his approval of the information contained in the message . If the prescription is generated electronically, but then is printed out in the office and given to the patient , it is no longer an electronic prescription and must follow the guidelines of a written prescription to include bearing the prescriber's manual signature . Schedule II - VI prescription s may be transmitted electronically. Schedule II - V prescriptions must meet all federal requirements including required security and authenticity features, as well as required recordkeeping for the prescriber and pharmacy. The application provider used by a prescriber or a pharmac y for electronic prescriptions of Schedules II -V drugs must be reviewed and certified by an approved certification body for compliance with DEA's standards. The application provider must provide a copy of this report to the pharmacy or prescriber using its services. A pharmacy or prescriber shall not dispense or issue an electronic prescription for Schedules II -V drugs until a report is received from the application provider indicating full compliance with DEA's standards. A pharmacy or prescriber may continue dispensing or issuing electronic prescriptions for Schedule VI drugs in compliance with Board regulations p rior to receiving a report from the application provider regarding its status of compliance with federal law. Individual prescribers authorized to prescribe Schedules II -V drugs who choose to issue electronic prescriptions for Schedules II -V drugs shall f irst apply to certain f ederally approved credential service providers (CSPs) or certification authorities (CAs) to obtain their two -factor authentication credential or digital certificates. An electronic prescription for a Schedule VI drug may either dir ectly populate the pharmacy's automated dispensing system or may be converted by the switch to a fax, and printed out on the pharmacy' s fax machine. Federal law does not permit an electronic prescription for a Schedule II-V drug to be converted to the pharmacy's fax machine. It must directly populate the pharmacy's automated dispensing system in conformity with federal law. Please refer to the federal regulations for additional guidance. 257Agenda Item: Adoption of Guidance Document 110-45 and 110-20 Included in your agenda package are: Draft Guidance Document 110-45. Draft Guidance Document 110-20 Action needed: Motion to adopt Document 110-45 258Guidance Document: 110- 45 Adopted: September 6, 2022 Effective October 27, 2022 DRAFT Virginia Board of Pharmacy Minors Working as Pharmacy Technician T rainees Virginia Code \u00a7 54.1-3321 and 18VAC110-21-135 govern registration of pharmacy technician trainees. There is no age requirement for registration. However, applicants must be enrolled in a pharmacy technician training program. The Virginia Department of Education oversees pharmacy technician training programs for high school students. Students enrolled in the program register as pharmacy technician trainees and work in pharmacies as part of the program. Due to concerns raised by the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry related to the application of Virginia Code \u00a7 40.1-100(A)(4) and 16VAC15-30-200(4) to minors working in pharmacies, the Board of Pharmacy recommends that pharmacy technician trainees under the age of 18 handle only Schedule VI drugs in the course of their training. 259Guidance Document 110- 20 Adopted: September 24, 2021 Revised: September 6, 2022 Effective: November 25, 2021 VIRGINA BOARD OF PHARMACY Criminal Background Checks of Material Owners for Pharmaceutical Processor or Cannabis Dispensing Facility Permits The Board provides the following guidance for a material owner of an applicant for a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility permit who is also a material owner of another permitted pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility and was previously subject to a criminal b ackground check. Upon submission of an application for change of ownership of a n existing pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility or new application , the material owner(s) shall complete a background check if it has been more than 90 days since the previous background check was conducted. Board staff will provide the material owner(s) with the necessary documentation to complete the background check. Notwithstanding 18VAC110-60- 135, the Board interprets the requirement for material owners of a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility permit as referenced in \u00a7 54.1-3442.6 to mean those owners with 5.0% or greater ownership. For facilities that do not have owners with 5.0% or greater ownership, a criminal background check should be performed on the facility's executive leadership with ownership such as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Code of Virginia (Effective J uly 1, 2021) . Permit to operate pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility. G. The Board shall require the material owners of an applicant for a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility permit to submit to fingerprinting and provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with his fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding the applicant's material owners. The cost of fingerprinting and the criminal history record search shall be paid by the applicant. The Central Criminal Records Exchange shall forward the results of the criminal history background check to the Board or its designe e, which shall be a governmental entity. A pharmaceutical processor shall maintain evidence of criminal background checks for all employees and delivery agents of the pharmaceutical processor. Criminal background checks of employees and delivery agents may be conducted by any service sufficient to disclose any federal and state criminal convictions. 260Virginia Board of Pharmacy September 06, 2022 Count 8/18/2022 CSR 25 44 25 28 35 30 1,496 Cannabis Dispensing Facility 1 2 2 1 5 CE Courses 1 1 1 0 1 0 9 Limited Use Pharmacy Technician 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 Medical Equipment Supplier 5 1 6 0 0 4 221 Non-restricted Manufacturer 1 0 1 2 0 2 33 Outsourcing Facility 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Permitted Physician 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 Pharmaceutical Processor 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 Pharmacist 175 275 279 157 187 265 16,276 Pharmacist Volunteer Registration 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 Pharmacy 11 10 9 16 9 11 1,768 Pharmacy Intern 107 59 179 87 88 56 1,242 Pharmacy Technician 424 460 353 360 360 6,487 Physician Selling Controlled Substances 7 19 39 14 17 33 590 Limited Use Practitioner Dispensing 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 Physician Selling Drugs Location 4 4 1 4 2 6 161 Pilot Programs 0 0 0 0 2 1 22 Registered Practitioner For Medical Cannabis 122 162 66 81 106 56 1,007 Repackaging Training Program 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 Restricted Manufacturer 1 0 0 0 0 0 36 Third Party Logistics Provider 1 0 0 0 1 1 7 Warehouser 5 0 1 1 1 1 121 Wholesale Distributor 1 1 1 0 0 0 63 Total 2,146 2,450 2,243 2,137 7/31/22 License Count 8/11/2022 Nonresident Manufacturer 6 6 10 1 12 4 215 Nonresident Medical Equipment Supplier 8 6 10 5 5 7 356 Nonresident Outsourcing Facility 1 1 1 1 0 2 31 Nonresident Pharmacy 37 17 17 22 25 27 903 Nonresident Third Party Logistics Provider 10 9 4 7 1 8 189 Nonresident Warehouser 12 5 4 5 6 0 99 Nonresident Wholesale Distributor 20 18 14 14 6 7 638 Total 94 62 60 55 55 55 2,431 262Enforcement Division Inspections Report : Prepared for the September 6, 2022 - Board of Pharmacy Meeting Quarterly Review - Date Range 04/01/2022 ending 06/30/2022 Numbers of Inspections Completed by License Type 263Enforcement Division Inspections Report : Prepared for the September 6, 2022 - Board of Pharmacy Meeting Date Range: 04/01/2022 ending 06/30/2022 Routine Inspections , Deficiencies by License Type * New, Change of Location, Remodel, Reinspection, Pilot, and Compliance Inspections Removed 264Enforcement Division Inspections Report : Prepared for the September 6, 2022 - Board of Pharmacy Meeting Date Range: 04/01/2022 ending 06/30/2022 Categories of Deficiencies for Occurrences , Routine Inspections Only Recorded >20 Times with Examples Description Number of times for occurrence 110-20-180 24 Deficiency 9a.
