The final list included mandatory vaccination against tetanus, hepatitis B, polio, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, varicella, pertussis, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR). This law was promulgated in response to a worrying decrease in vaccination coverage that occurred in Italy from 2012 to 2016 22.

The new Italian law obliges all parents to vaccinate their children; if they do not comply with the imposed measures, children cannot be admitted to the school system from childcare to secondary school. From the beginning of 2018, an immediate increase in vaccine coverage testified the positive impact of the applied regulation 99.

A few months after Law n. 119 came into force, the Italian National Institute of Health confirmed that the national immunization coverage of the hexavalent vaccine (against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, and H. influenzae B) had reached 95% (goal for herd immunity) 1010.

Despite its excellent results, this law immediately sparked criticisms - from scientists - mainly based on the alleged lack of safety of vaccines 1111. Ordine Nazionale Biologi. Vaccini: 8 sep.. Many anti-vax conspiracy theories have spread throughout Italy, among which a major one is the lack of safety of vaccines, which could be related to certain mental illnesses. Studies on this subject, often cited by anti-vaccination organizations, present numerous limitations (underlined by the authors themselves) and fail in correlating vaccines and certain diseases; rather, they present solely a temporal association between vaccination and the development of some pathological conditions 1212. Leslie JF. Temporal association of certain neuropsychiatric disorders following vaccination of children and adolescents: a pilot case-control study. Front Psychiatry 2017; 8:3.. They also often cite Wakefield et al. 1313. Wakefield AJ, Murch SH, Anthony A, Linnell J, Casson DM, Malik M, et al. Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children. Lancet 1998; 351:637-41., a retracted article that suggested a correlation between vaccines and autism. For campaigning, anti-vax movements apply studies that hypothesize an association between vaccines adjuvants and the occurrence of neuroinflammation or autoimmune diseases 1414.

Naturally, international scientific literature attests that vaccines are significantly beneficial and present few and rare risks 1616. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccine safety publications. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/research/publications/index.html. [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/resear... ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/research/publications/index.html). A widespread belief among people that sympathizes with anti-vaccine movements is that vaccination campaigns serve as a tool to enrich pharmaceutical companies Such theory ignores the increasing costs, for the National Health System, associated with morbidity and mortality resulting from serious difficult-to-treat infections, which would be easily prevented by vaccination. There is no evidence that tests performed prior to vaccination could predict adverse reactions to vaccines. Yet, anti-vax movements, supported by the Italian Association of Consumer Rights Protection (CODACONS), requested pre-immunization allergy tests 1818. Italy, some representatives of the scientific community also support the anti-vaccination movement. An Italian doctor, for example, was removed from the National Medicine Board for spreading ideas contrasting evidence-based medicines in the vaccine field; precisely, he stated that there is no point in vaccinating infants for hepatitis B and tetanus 1919.

Anti-vax movements strongly believe herd immunity to be a myth. This theory claims that believing that vaccines can induce herd immunity is baseless, and that mass vaccination cannot eradicate infectious diseases 2020. MedNat.News. Herd immunity. https://mednat.news/vaccini/effetto_gregge.htm. [https://mednat.news/vaccini/effetto_greg... ](https://mednat.news/vaccini/effetto_gregge.htm). The propagation of anti-vax theories led the Italian National Institute of Health to disclosure an informative document, defining myths and truths regarding vaccinations 2121. EpiCentro. Quali https://www.epicentro.iss.it/vaccini/FAQ_Oms_Ita. [https://www.epicentro.iss.it/vaccini/FAQ... ](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/vaccini/FAQ_Oms_Ita). Despite the total lack of foundation in these theories - which commonly apply scientific studies only to misinterpret them -, anti-vax movements are widespread in Italy, as well as in the world. Such movements pose a risk to morbidity and mortality levels related to infectious diseases, with important socioeconomic consequences 2222.

The importance of complying with vaccination protocols in developed countries: \"anti-vax\" hysteria and the spread of severe preventable diseases. Curr Med Chem 2018; 25:6070-81.. In 2007, a public health policy experiment conducted in Veneto (an Italian region with 4 million inhabitants) suspended mandatory childhood vaccination against polio, hepatitis B, tetanus, and diphtheria. The Ministry of Health opposed to the region political choice; yet, a great amount of the public opinion and some representatives of the Italian community of pediatrics praised and supported the legislation. This public health policy decreased by 5% the immunization coverage of polio vaccine from 2006 to 2016 2323. Signorelli C, Odone A. Four Italian experiences on vaccination policies: results and lessons. Ann Ig 2019; 31(2 Suppl 1):36-44., showing that, in countries with a strong anti-vaccine sentiment, suspending compulsory vaccination is not an optimal choice. The debate on vaccines in Italy has never addressed the issue of early adolescents (from 10 years old) wanting to get vaccinated without parents' consenting. This is an important aspect, considering that vaccinating adolescents (who wish so) would allow they to acquire the immune response they could not develop during childhood, as their parents refused to vaccinate them 2424. Immunization of adolescents. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Medical Association. MMWR Recomm Rep 1996; 45(RR-13):1-16.,2525. Bernstein HH, Bocchini Jr. JA; Committee on Infectious Diseases. The need to optimize adolescent immunization. Pediatrics 2017; 139:e20164186.. Such context of vaccination is an important and complex medico-legal problem, as (often) parents must consent for any medical act to be performed on a minor. Until 2017, in Italy, minor's consent had no legal value; so, for vaccination, especially if not mandatory, the adolescent required parental consent. In 2017, when the Italian government promulgated the Law n. 219 (Provisions for informed consent and advance directives) 2626. Legge 22 dicembre 2017, n. Repubblica Italiana 2018; 16 jan., the minor's opinion regarding the performance of a medical act became particularly important. The article 3 states that a parent or legal guardian should accept or refuse the minor's medical treatment considering their will, age, and maturity, and that the ultimate aim must be to protect minor's mental and physical health and life. This law introduced two basic concepts regarding minor's right to health: first, their will is essential for determining whether or not to undergo a health treatment; second, any decision ultimate aim must be to protect the minor's health and life. The practical application of this law to the medical act of vaccination means to say that if a teenager decides to get vaccinated and his parents disagree, the minor's will shall prevail. Italy is not the only country where children and adolescents vaccination is mandatory regardless of parental consent. California (USA), for example, approved in 2015 the Senate Bill 277, removing personal belief as a reason for exemption from vaccination requirements for school entry. Although a relatively simple public health strategy, this bill increased, in 2 years, 5.2% vaccine coverage 2727.

[http://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforscho... ](http://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/2016-17KindergartenSummaryReport.pdf). Brazil is another nation where vaccinating children and adolescents is an obligation. In this country, parents that fail in providing children and adolescents with all the mandatory vaccinations - as vaccines are considered a child's and adolescent's right (right to health) - can be reported to guardian council 2828. Brazil. Statute of the child and adolescent. Law n\u00ba 8,069, 13 July 1990. https://www.refworld.org/docid/4c481bcf2.html. [https://www.refworld.org/docid/4c481bcf2... ](https://www.refworld.org/docid/4c481bcf2.html). A study analyzing vaccine coverage in Brazil from 2001 to 2011 reported that the 95% goal was achieved for all mandatory vaccinations, except for hepatitis B (2001 to 2005) and rotavirus vaccine (2007 to 2011) 2929. Domingues CM, Teixeira AM, Carvalho SM. National immunization program: vaccination, compliance and pharmacovigilance. Rev Inst Med Trop S\u00e3o Paulo 2012; 54 Suppl 18:S22-7.. Brazil also presents satisfactory levels of vaccine confidence 44. Larson HJ, de Figueiredo A, Xiahong Z, Schulz WS, Verger P, Johnson IG, et al. The state of vaccine confidence 2016: global insights through a 67-country survey. EBioMedicine 2016; 12:295-301.. Vaccination is a right. Minors, if they consent, they have the right to get vaccinated; and a community has the right to protect itself from potential epidemics. Although parental consent is usually required, we must recognize that, in some situations, medical acts benefit not only the individual, but also the entire community. This is a fundamental concept because, considering minor's mandatory vaccination, it is often stated that vaccination cannot be performed if parents do not consent. But there are certain contexts, such as the Involuntary Health Treatment (IHT) of psychiatric patients with hetero-aggressive behaviors, in which mandatory medical acts (although without consent) aim to safeguard public health. Regarding vaccines deemed as \"mandatory\" in many countries worldwide, they serve, firstly, as an instrument of public health and, only in second instance, as a medical act concerning an individual's well-being. Processes that hinder vaccination risk the life not only of a single individual, but the whole community. No evidence-based proofs testify the harmful potential of commonly used vaccines. Some cases of vaccination that meet the irrational refusal of parents would possibly require resorting to a tutelary judge, who may authorize vaccination even when parents refuse to consent and the child/adolescent does not explicitly express consent. The principle - resuming the medico-legal point of view of mandatory vaccination - is that individual's rights end where community's rights begin. As the improving vaccination coverage in Italy after 2017 has shown, making certain vaccines mandatory by law is an effective medium-term strategy in countries where vaccination coverage is alarmingly declining. Yet, a legislation alone is not enough to improve immunization rates 3030. Laws are not the only way to boost immunization. Nature 2018; 553:249-50.. Anti-vax movements are still particularly strong in Italy; many Italian parents doubt the efficacy and safety of vaccination, and some perceive its compulsory requirement as a coercive measure. Despite the legal responsibility in vaccinating children and adolescents, the government must also adopt an information policy to improve vaccination knowledge among individuals. Then training health professionals to inform and clarify the doubts of hesitant parents regarding vaccines is an essential measure. This is a particularly important point, considering that if doctors fail in adequately supporting doubtful and concerned parents, those might consider pseudo-scientific sources, becoming vulnerable to fake news and scientific misinformation - particularly prolific in the vaccine field.
