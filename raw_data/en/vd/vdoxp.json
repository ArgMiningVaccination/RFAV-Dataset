NCVIA's purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of [vaccine](/wiki/Vaccine) manufacturers due to [vaccine injury](/wiki/Vaccine_injury) claims [[1]](#cite_note-nytimes1986-1) to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines, and to provide cost-effective [arbitration](/wiki/Arbitration) for vaccine injury claims. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Under the NCVIA, the [National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program](/wiki/National_Vaccine_Injury_Compensation_Program) (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the [United States Court of Federal Claims](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Federal_Claims) and [special masters](/wiki/Special_master). [[1]](#cite_note-nytimes1986-1) [[3]](#cite_note-SI_42_6_Hall-3) Background[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] In the 1970s and 1980s, a controversy erupted related to the question of whether the whole-cell [pertussis](/wiki/Pertussis) component of the [DPT vaccine](/wiki/DPT_vaccine) caused permanent brain injury known as pertussis vaccine [encephalopathy](/wiki/Encephalopathy), in rare cases. [[4]](#cite_note-Huber-4) No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile [epilepsy](/wiki/Epilepsy). [[5]](#cite_note-5) In 1990, an editorial in the [Journal of the American Medical Association](/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association) by a contractor of the vaccine makers called the connection a \"myth\" and \"nonsense\". [[6]](#cite_note-6) [[7]](#cite_note-7) However, before that point, criticism of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized [anecdotal reports](/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence) of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements. [[8]](#cite_note-Geier_2002-8) [[9]](#cite_note-Gangarosa_1998-9) In the United States, low profit margins and an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. [[4]](#cite_note-Huber-4) By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining [liability insurance](/wiki/Liability_insurance). [[10]](#cite_note-nytimes1984-10) The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one company was still manufacturing pertussis vaccine in the US by the end of 1985. [[10]](#cite_note-nytimes1984-10) Because of this, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986, establishing a federal [no-fault](/wiki/No-fault_insurance) system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines. [[11]](#cite_note-Smith_1988-11) [[12]](#cite_note-McAllister-Grum_2017-12) NCVIA provisions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] The NCVIA also mandates that all health care providers must report certain [adverse events](/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine)) following vaccination to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](/wiki/Vaccine_Adverse_Event_Reporting_System) (VAERS).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The NCVIA also established a committee from the [Institute of Medicine](/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine) (IOM) to review the existing literature on vaccine adverse events occurring after [immunization](/wiki/Immunization).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] National Vaccine Program Office[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] As a of the NCVIA, the [National Vaccine Program Office](/wiki/National_Vaccine_Program_Office) (NVPO) was established within the DHHS. The NVPO is responsible for coordinating immunization-related activities between all DHHS agencies, including the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) (CDC), [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA), [National Institutes of Health](/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health) (NIH) the [Health needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Vaccine Information Statements[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] The NCVIA requires that all health care providers provide a [Vaccine Information Statement](/wiki/Vaccine_Information_Statement) (VIS) to the vaccine recipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose.A VIS must be given with every vaccination, including each dose in a multi-dose series. Each VIS contains a brief description of the disease, as well as the [risks](/wiki/Risk) and [benefits](/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis) of the vaccine. Each VIS is developed by the CDC and distributed to state and local health departments as well as individual providers.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] References[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] - ^ [a](#cite_ref-nytimes1986_1-0) [b](#cite_ref-nytimes1986_1-1) [\"Reagan Bill On Drug Exports And Payment For Vaccine Injuries\"](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/15/us/reagan-signs-bill-on-drug-exports-and-payment-for-vaccine-injuries.html).
