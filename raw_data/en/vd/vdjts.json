There are a lot of chickens crammed into commercial poultry facilities, to be sure, but almost no humans around, as the facilities are highly automated. And when humans do come in contact, it's pretty common for them to be wearing a full hazmat suit because the fumes and filth will overcome them otherwise; they also typically walk through bleach sprays on their way in and out. There's much more close contact between birds in general - and chickens in particular - in urban and suburban areas that are jam-packed with people and don't take any measures to prevent coming in contact with the millions of sparrows, grackles, pigeons, etcetera they share space with.Farmed poultry is where birds most come into contact with humans, so if it makes the leap into humans, my guess is that farmed poultry will be the most likely vector. There is already work being done toThere is no shortage of wingnuts on both sides of any health issue. Those of us in the sensible party would like to point out a non-partisan problem not addressed by this article: flu vaccines are grown in chicken eggs. We critically need a public health campaign to create an alternate vaccine pathway, yet the Biden administration seems obsessed with balloons. We need Warp Speed 2, and we need it now. I'm not thinking incubation so much as I am \"poop lawn darts\". My understanding is, however small there's a window after incubation between a bird shedding and showing symptoms, and a time lapse between identification and eradication.I think the problem you're thinking about is the incubation period. This is why they are killing entire flocks off, and not just the sick and dying animals. The animals live together too densely to really try anything else. Right now the problem is primarily spread of the virus in wild foul, rather than in domesticated flocks. Its part of why it has gone on for longer than a year. None. As long as (i)I(/i) am not one of them...Oh, relax. Everybody knows that the Flu isn't any worse than COVID-19, and that never killed anybody. Well, okay, maybe a few million people, but what's the difference? Yeah, no wonder flying buffaloes are extinct!Yes you are! And wild birds! Watch the EPA stick their noses into it! Because jobs! And wings! (> a billion wings on SB Sunday? Wow). quote snippedAn article in The Atlantic about the debate over gain-of-function research in the viral sense Additional information is why I posted it - there were a number of points in the Stern article which I wasn't aware and thought others might be interested in. What do you do about this virus? How do you go about working up vaccines?quote snipped Your point? Because if you don't even bother to make a coherent one, it's an automatic filing under link spam, trolling or the crazies for me. Mixture of truth and misconception,Not so much, no.

Glad you survived. Talk with your doctor. The internet is full of opinions which may or may not be germane for you.Wow, how horrible. I'm allergic to bird proteins, vaccines or antibiotics created using eggs will kill me. I mean I can't eat chicken, turkey, or even fried rice (because it's made with chicken broth). But wait, I had a flu shot last week! <checks pulse> Nope, I'm still alive. But how could that be? Maybe we, you know, stopped making them that way because of the number of people having bad reactions, up to and including death? Or we shouldn't wait for it to infect humans to start vaccinating against H1N1.Unless the strain of influenza that jumps into the human population is significantly more infectious than the other strains of influenza we deal with, we shouldn't need to wait for a vaccine. Masking, social distancing, and eliminating events likely to be super spreader events will be more than enough to handle the new virus until a vaccine comes out. You don't even need to go to the point of having lock downs most likely. But we will have a vaccine in a few months either way. Does it cost more to vaccinate a chicken than the chicken is worth? Maybe we should be working on making that not true.Some people may argue that regulations can be overly burdensome, costly, or stifling to innovation and economic growth. Others may argue that regulations are necessary to protect public health, safety, and the environment, and to prevent abusive practices by businesses. In reality, the impact of regulations can vary depending on the specific context and the quality of the regulations. Some regulations may be poorly designed and have unintended consequences, while others may be effective in achieving their intended goals. Ultimately, it is up to policymakers and society as a whole to determine the appropriate balance between regulating activities and allowing for freedom and innovation. The problem is if you vaccinate then you can't sell the chicken abroad, because it'll test positive for disease given how the testing is done. Similar stuff happens for other diseases and for various other animals.Does it cost more to vaccinate a chicken than the chicken is worth? Maybe we should be working on making that not true. It is not that a vaccine is too expensive, but that until now one was not necessary. All previous HPAI outbreaks in North America have died out on their own by mid summer. And the cost of vaccinating the entire North American poultry flock (broilers, layers, turkeys, ducks, and all the parent/grand-parent breeding stock) has far exceeded the cost of depopulating a few hundred barns across the US and Canada.Does it cost more to vaccinate a chicken than the chicken is worth? Maybe we should be working on making that not true. Couple of issues.I wonder if anything can be done to make the wild bird population more resilient. The data has shown that H5N1 is more sensitive to dry / hot conditions resulting in significantly slower spread into the Southwest US. For mammals, brewer's yeast has also been used for a long time, mixed in food, to strengthen wild populations with amino acids and B vitamins, and also repels flea and ticks. Thus, deer and other mammalian food with small amounts of brewer's yeast can strengthen wild populations. I wonder if there is anything similar for wild birds that could help them be more resilient to H5N1 and thus reduce their death rates, particularly among non-waterfowl species.

At the end of the day, the flu isn't what's killing these birds (though it will kill many of them if allowed to spread unchecked), but our eradication program. That policy can't go away until we have a vaccine. Once we have that available, and widely adopted, the birds in these barns will be in a similar position relative to HPAI as people are from COVID now. At risk if not vaccinated (which everyone should be) and perfectly safe if vaccinated. They might even be even better off, as qualified medical professionals will be vaccinating the birds at hatch (most likely) and not leaving it up to them to \"opt-in\" as is the case with humans.More and more I think the real evil in our world is the corporatization of food. It's truly scary how much we have allowed giant corps to control massive swaths of food production, and how little they care about the dangers of mass production and homogenization of the gene pools to create problems. Unfortunately we focus so much on the morality of packing animals in and breeding them all to be the same, and too little about the long term dangers of doing so. I have not seen anything that says avian flu came from a different source than birds. Ie it was not swing flu that jumped to birds or something arising from mixed animal farming. It was a wild bird, and water fowl disease that spread to chickens. It then exploded because of lack of diversity and extreme close quarters farming as well as mutations to become more virulent.At the end of the day, the flu isn't what's killing these birds (though it will kill many of them if allowed to spread unchecked), but our eradication program.

Furthermore, it wasn't intensive western-style agriculture that created the environment necessary for HPAI to come into existence, but the \"Old MacDonald\" farm (or rather the Chinese equivalent) with a little bit of everything living cheek-by-jowl with each other and their owners. I don't pretend that modern animal agriculture is without its flaws, but this specific problem is LESS likely to evolve from a modern commercial swine or poultry barn. Small hold farming is far riskier for the creation and spread of novel viruses than commercial agriculture because they create the conditions most favorable for the types of recombination events necessary for the rise of truly novel strains. Biosecurity is one of the benefits of our western system. There are two issues under discussion in this thread, and you may have confused them. Sorry for making this so long.I have not seen anything that says avian flu came from a different source than birds.

It then exploded because of lack of diversity and extreme close quarters farming as well as mutations to become more virulent. Am I wrong in that? How would smaller farms have a greater chance of mass spread and mutation within a species? Or are you just saying after that happened the jump in species happened at smaller farms? It's. Not cheaper unless you have dozens of chickens but the eggs are better and you know that your breakfast is ethically sourcedBackyard chickens (maximum of 5) are allowed where I live and I seriously investigated it as a way to reduce my egg costs. The bottom line was that keeping a small flock does not make economic sense because of infrastructure and feed costs. It worked out to be cheaper, but nowhere near enough cheaper to justify the amount of ongoing work I would need to put in to do it. If I were already running a farm, it might be different. Similar to growing tomatoes in the back yard, where you save tens of dollars on store-bought tomatoes by spending dozens of dollars and dozens of hours growing them.It's.

Re the feed costs for backyard hens, some \"weeds\" like stinging nettles and certain kitchen scraps (only some, many scraps aren't healthy for hens) were traditionally much added to hen feed. I remember having to harvest nettles every summer at my grandparents' house as a kid, they even had a bigass cast iron grinding/crushing machine looking like from the 19th century...It's.
