Merriam) ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to understand how cul tural values influence health-related behaviors among older Asian Indian immigrants in th e United States. To achieve this purpose, the following questions guided this research: 1) Ho w do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-related issues? 2) In what ways do cul ture and heritage affect older Asian Indian immigrants' health behaviors? and 3) How do older A sian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? A qualitative research approach was employed. In-d epth interviews were conducted with eleven participants to obtain data on how cultural values shape the health-related behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. A purposeful sampli ng was conducted to find suitable participants. All participants were at least 60 yea rs of age and had moved to the U.S. as adults. Neither they nor any immediate family member was in volved in healthcare professions. Eight men and three women representing various regions of India were interviewed using in-depth interviews with open-ended questions. Analysis revealed five key resources the participa nts used to learn about health. These included their healthcare professional, immediate f amily, the Indian community, media, and the Internet. An analysis of the findings also address ed three cultural values that influenced these immigrants' health behaviors. First, the participa nts worked to establish a personal relationship with their healthcare professional. Second, there was a high level of family involvement not only during the treatment process, but also in the everyday maintenance of health. And third, these immigrants value alternative medicine, making it a viable option when these individuals are faced with an illness. Finally, analysis of th e last set of findings highlighted the participants ' decision making process when they are considering m edical treatment. Data indicated that these immigrants experiment with both Western and Eastern medicine and their belief in traditional systems of healing cause them to be skeptical of ce rtain Western medical practices. Based on the findings the following conclusions we re drawn from the study: Indian culture and heritage shape healthcare behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants and informal learning is the primary way these immigrants learn about health.

people are living longer. In 1970, it was estimated there were 307 m illion people in the world over the age of 60. There were 500 million in 2000 and in 2020 it is es timated there will be one billion (Bee, 2000). Worldwide, the number of people in this age bracket is growing faster than any other age group (World Health Organization [WHO], 2002). Within th e United States, persons aged 65 years or older currently represent approximately 13% of the population (Administration on Aging, 2001). This proportion is expected to increase to more tha n 20% by the year 2010 when the baby boomer generation begins to enter the older age per iod (Kim & Merriam, 2004). These older adults are the most frequent users of medical servi ces. For example, chronic diseases become a burden for nearly 40% of the older adult population , often leading to a diminished quality of life (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2002). Not only are the numbers of older adults increasing , but the composition of this segment of the population is also changing. Immigration is one factor affecting the makeup of the elderly in the United States. Additionally, immigration to the United States continues to increase each year. For instance, the Administration on Aging (2 005) reports that members of minority groups are projected to increase from 5.7 million in 2000 (16.4% of the elderly population) to 8.1 million in 2010 (20.1% of the elderly) and then to 12.9 million in 2020 (23.6% of the elderly). As these first-generation immigrants begin to age, their need for health services will begin to magnify. For this reason, it becomes imperative to gain an understanding of how these groups 2 interact and utilize health services in the United States. Thus, the goal of this study was to better understand how Asian Indian cultural values shape h ow these immigrants learn and navigate their healthcare in the United States. Asian and Pacific Islanders and Healthcare Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIAs) have b een the fastest growing ethnic minority population in the United States over the p ast 20 years. In 1970, the number of APIAs was 1.4 million; in 1980, 3.5 million; and in 1990, 7.3 million (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). By 1992, it was estimated that the APIA pop ulation had numbered 3.3 percent of the total population, and these numbers are expected to quadr uple by 2038. By the year 2050, American Pacific Islander Americans will exceed 41 million a nd constitute 10.7 percent of the total U.S. population (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). This broad category of immigrants comprises about 3 2 different national and ethnic groups (Austin & Prendergast, 1994). The distribut ion of Asians in the United States is as follows: Chinese (23.8%); Filipino (18.3%); Asian I (1.5%); Thai (1.1%); and other (4.7%) (U.S. Bureau of the C ensus, 2000). Since the majority of these immigrants are foreign born, strong cultural values , beliefs, and traditional health practices are still evident in their behaviors. These are reflec ted in unfamiliarity with Western concepts and terminology of illnesses and diseases, as well as w ith modern diagnostic techniques or treatments. Lack of understanding of the U.S. heal thcare system prevents them from utilizing available services or following prescribed treatmen t (Ma, 1999). Additionally, many Asian Americans may also be apprehensive about seeking me dical help from Western doctors or practitioners and, as a result, may withhold or avo id disclosing information about their cultural 3 practices. Thus, the lack of culturally competent services becomes a major obstacle for provision of services to Asian patients, and a challenge to h ealthcare providers. Because the U.S. healthcare system often fails to recognize indigeno us medicine and other traditional health practices common among Asian immigrants, these pati ents are often hesitant to cooperate with their respective providers. As the APIA population continues to grow in the Uni ted States, researchers have begun to explore the implications for this group in regar d to healthcare, as well as health behaviors. For example, Grewal, Bottorff, and Hilton (2005) examin ed the influence of family members on immigrant South Asian women's health and health-see king behaviors in order to better understand how these women made decisions regarding their health. In-depth interviews revealed that these participants made decisions abo ut their health in consultation with family members, who were often perceived to be supportive and provided direct and indirect assistance to women in ways that influence their health. In a ddition, it was evident that expected roles and responsibilities often had detrimental influences o n women's health. This type of information is critical for healthcare professionals in order to r each these individuals effectively. By taking into account women's relationships with family, as well as their influence on women's health, both physicians and educators can better serve the needs of this group and improve their health- seeking behaviors. In addition to shaping health behaviors, culture al so plays a role in learning. This relationship has been widely studied in the fields of both multicultural education as well as adult education. Most often, culture has been treated as a factor, along with others that influence the learning behaviors of a particular group of people. However, culture is not merely a minor factor or an issue that is related to a particular group o f people. Every person embodies and represents 4 his or her own culture. As DuPraw and Axner (1997) maintained, culture is central to what we see, how we make sense of what we see, and how we e xpress ourselves. Anthropologists Avruch and Black (1993) emphasized that culture pro vides the \"lens\" through which we view the world, the \"logic\" by which we order it, and the \"g rammar\" by which it makes sense. As a social and cultural being, an adult is shaped and constrai ned in every aspect of his or her life. Culture is a popular yet ambiguous concept in our l anguage system. Different people use different layers of meaning to describe culture. K roeber and Kluckhohn (1952) summarized more than 160 definitions of culture, explicitly re flecting the complexity of this term. Banks and Banks (1997) offered a well recognized definition, stating that culture is \"the values, symbols, interpretations, and perspectives that distinguish one group of people from another in modernized societies\" (p. 8). Still others believe that the essential element of culture is values. According to Hofstede (1980), values refer to \"a br oad tendency to prefer certain states of affairs over others\" (p. 19). Cultural values have served as a standard to judge situations, to interpret meaning, or to direct people's daily behaviors. A number of empirical studies reveal the important role of cultural values in shaping the learning process of adults from non-Western backgro unds (Alfred, 2003; Hvitfeldt, 1986; Merriam & Muhammad, 2000). For instance, Hvitfeldt (1986) provided an earlier qualitative study that explored the relationships between learn ing behaviors and cultural values in adult education. After observing an American basic educa tion classroom for newly immigrated Hmong people (a minority group from Southeast Asia) , Hvitfeldt found that Hmong adults' learning behaviors, such as reliance on external so urces, achievement as group cooperation, and a holistic rather than analytic perceptual style, s ignificantly reflected their community life in preliterate and pre-technical society. Similarily, in their study on learning activities of older 5 Malaysian adults, Merriam and Muhammad (2000) found that Eastern cultural values, such as collectivism, hierarchy, and relationship orientati on, shaped the way these individuals learned. The above discussion illustrates the importance of cultural values in shaping both health and learning behaviors. However, much still remain s unknown on specific groups within Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and specifically th e intersection of learning and health-related behaviors. For this reason, researchers have begun to investigate the various subgroups among the APIA population independently in order to bette r understand and appreciate the unique characteristics of each ethnicity (Ma, 1999; Lin-Fu , 1993). However, there are still some groups that remain overlooked, even though their presence within the United States continues to increase. Asian Indian Cultural Values and Healthcare According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there are over 1 .5 million Asian Indians residing in the United States, representing the third largest A PIA group after Chinese and Filipino. Furthermore, this population had the highest compou nd growth rate of all Asian subgroups at 7.49% per year from 1990 to 2000. Even more specif ically, it has been argued that Asian Indians are one of the fastest growing elderly grou ps in the United States (Doorenbos, 2003). However, little is known about these immigrants and how their culture shapes the way that they learn about health. Asian Indian immigrants, just like other minorities, are a heterogeneous group, representing a huge mosaic of cultures, and people of widely varying socioeconomic status, education, place of residence, generation, views, values, lifestyles, and appearance. However, this population has an added complexity in that they also do not share the same language. Although the national language is Hindi, only about 40% of Asian Indians are fluent and use this language on a daily basis (Shapiro, 20 01). Instead, there are a plethora of dialects 6 that are dependent upon the region of India from wh ich an individual comes. This variance in communication creates a type of \"segregation\" withi n the community, as people tend to socialize and interact with those individuals who share a com mon language other than English. Though this diversity does make it increasingly dif ficult to examine this population, commonalities still exist across Asian Indian subgr oups. When considering healthcare, belief in traditional medicine still exists within these comm unities, especially among elders. One specific approach is called Ayurvedic medicine, which focuse s on obtaining balance, not only physically, but also mentally and spiritually. This system of medicine emphasizes treatment of the complete human being and not just physical disorders. When a person becomes unbalanced, Ayurveda practitioners will recommend specific lifestyle and nutritional guidelines to assist the individual in regaining equilibrium. Herbal supplements may a lso be suggested to hasten this healing process. The use of alternative medicine continues to grow e very year, and with this increased interest, researchers have begun to develop additio nal terms for these types of medical systems, such as parallel therapies or dual systems. This m ovement away from \"alternative medicine\" indicates the understanding that Western and Easter n medicine is not necessarily in conflict with one another, but working together, these systems ca n actually increase the effectiveness of treatment. Whether one identifies the approach as alternative, parallel, or another similar term, the fact remains that its use is growing. For inst ance, Channa (2004) estimated that two-thirds of the world's population seek healthcare from traditi onal, indigenous systems of medicine such as Ayurveda. Within the past decade, these types of a lternative practices have permeated the United States healthcare systems as well (Ruggle, 2 005). Barnes, Powell-Griner, McFann, & Nahin (2004) surveyed 31,044 people, with 36% respo nding that they had used a form of 7 alternative therapy, such as -meditation, yoga, and /or diet-based therapies (which are all components of Ayurvedic medicine) over a one year p eriod. Major medical journals are publishing research on the efficacy of specific alt ernative therapies, physicians are attending oversubscribed continuing medical education courses on this issue, and hospitals are offering alternative services, sometimes through outpatient integrative medicine clinics. Ruggle (2005) argues that this increase in interest among the U.S . medical system can be traced to numerous factors, from an increase in alternative therapy us e, governmental support, a surge in scientific research, to a rise in physicians' interest in this area. While a large number of individuals in India contin ue to rely solely on Ayurvedic practices (Ariff, 2006), here in the United States the focus is on integrative medicine, where there is collaboration among the primary healthcare provi der, the specialist of alternative care, and the patient (Barrett, 1993). This new form of treatmen t is especially beneficial for chronic illnesses such as arthritis, hypertension, and asthma, which are common in older people and are often accompanied by symptoms that are not easily eradica ted by conventional medicine. Additionally, because of the frustration with conve ntional medical practices, many individuals are choosing to take more personal responsibility f or their health by exploring a variety of self- regulatory, mind/body, and wellness practices indep endent of their physician's input. These often include techniques such as meditation, which are considered alternative by U.S. medical standards (Barrett, 1993). However, as the populat ion continues to age, it can be argued that more individuals will begin to seek alternative rem edies that offer an increasingly holistic approach to treatment. Therefore, understanding th ese practices among Asian Indian immigrants can not only help us to better serve the needs of t his population, but also expand alternative medical services for the U.S. as a whole. 8 In addition to indigenous medical practices, religi on also plays a role in shaping the health decisions of Asian Indian immigrants. Altho ugh there is not one unifying faith for all Asian Indians, approximately 82% of this population is Hindu (Takaki, 1995). Hinduism is not only a religion, but also a way of life, providing its followers with cultural values and guiding principles for behavior and interaction with others . For instance, in the Asian Indian community, elders are revered and should be treated with the u tmost respect. This belief sets up a hierarchy within familial relationships, which is represented in the language itself (Roland, 1988). Different terms distinguish between aunts and uncle s, older and younger brothers and sisters, as well as maternal and paternal relatives. This stru cture affects communication among Asian Indians as well as with others. Within this system , the roles of individuals are defined according to age, sex, and status. Docility, respect for aut hority, and restraint of strong feelings are encouraged, while direct expression of thoughts are discouraged (Pai & Adler, 2001). This emphasis on authority has the potential to impact t he doctor-patient relationship. Due to the importance of hierarchy, Asian Indian immigrants ma y defer judgment to their physician because they believe that he or she is the expert on medica l issues. These individuals may not readily voice their concerns during the consultation, makin g it necessary for the healthcare professional to prompt this type of information. This probing i s especially critical with these individuals because they may be practicing a number of alternat e approaches that could impact the negotiation of the healthcare process. Although it may appear that the hierarchical struct ure hinders the formation of relationships, the extended family is still essenti al and serves as a unified support system. These immigrants are accustomed to solving problems and m aking decisions with friends and family. For instance, Asian Indians not only prefer to incl ude family members in the treatment process, 9 but may even defer decision making to other individ uals in their network. These individuals like to consult with friends and family when seeking inf ormation and making decisions, as this network serves as social support. This reliance on relationships, both within the family and among the community, can provide many informal lear ning opportunities for these immigrants. Indeed, informal learning characterizes the majorit y of learning in adult life. When considering informal learning, which is usually int entional but not highly structured, it helps to contrast this concept with formal learning to bette r understand its subtleties and nuances. Marsick and Watkins (1990) offer the following defi nition: Formal learning is typically instutionally spo nsored, classroom-based, and highly structured. Informal learning...may occur in in stitutions, but it is not typically classroom-based or highly structured, and cont rol of learning rests primarily in the hands of the learner....Informal learning can be deliberately encouraged by an organization or it can take place despite an e nvironment not highly conducive to learning. (p. 12) More specifically, informal learning can be charact erized as integrated with daily routines and triggered by an internal or external jolt. Additio nally, this type of learning process is often influenced by chance and is linked to the learning of others (Marsick & Volpe, 1999). Networking, a form of informal learning, is popular among groups who value community, such as Asian Indians. Networking is a type of shared learning, where individuals work together to locate information and find soluti ons. Learning opportunities flow from the communication that creates the linkages between ind ividuals and clusters of people. This type of knowledge acquisition is quite common among Asian I ndians. Since this community is so interwoven, it can be considered a network within i tself. People often come together to celebrate 10 cultural holidays and festivals, and these gatherin gs become avenues for communicating information. Individuals share their stories and e xperiences, making conversations the means for learning. This is evident even with health issues, as a large number of Asian Indians still attend health fairs to gain knowledge about diseases and o ther medical concerns. A number of physicians and other healthcare professionals from the Indian community come together, offering exams, answering questions, and providing support. In a way, these fairs serve as a health network for these immigrants, where learning is the result of a dialogue with a number of people within the community. English (2000) also noted that the characteristics of informal learning provide a spiritual component not necessarily available from other more traditional teaching methods. Because this form of learning occurs continuously in the everyda y world, it stimulates reflection on people's actions. Furthermore, informal learning not only s upports individual learning, but also provides an opportunity to explore group development. By bu ilding from pre-existing relationships, individuals feel a sense of community and belonging , a factor that is more important than individual growth for Asian Indians. The spiritual nature that can result from the relationships created during the mentoring and networking process is also beneficial and motivating to these immigrants. This population's views on learning an d development are much more holistic than the Western approach. Asian Indians seek to nurtur e the mind, body, and soul, and the various methods within informal learning offer these indivi duals the flexibility to not only focus on intellect, but also the spirit. The literature suggests that informal learning off ers an alternative to more traditional forms of learning that would be highly conducive fo r Asian Indian immigrants. Networking and 11 the spiritual nature of informal learning allow the se individuals to learn and build community at the same time. Statement of the Problem In today's society, life expectancy continues to in crease as advances in technology continue to encourage the development and implement ation of new medical treatments and solutions. For example, within the United States, persons over age 65 currently represent approximately 13% of the population (Bee, 2000). A s the baby boomer generation enters retirement, this number will continue to increase. In addition to this growth, the rise in immigration continues to change the demographics wi thin the United States., thus impacting the composition of the elderly population. As individu als within these minority populations age, their use of health services will continue to incre ase. Although there has been a wide array of research co ncerning minorities and healthcare, knowledge on the Asian Indian community is limited, even though this is one of the fastest growing elderly groups in the United States (Dooren bos, 2003). Asian Indian philosophy offers an alternative perspective to the Western viewpoint and these differences influence how these individuals learn and interact with others. These immigrants value family and maintaining relationships and much of their learning takes plac e within and among the community in an informal setting. Furthermore, these distinctions become increasingly evident when exploring traditional Asian Indian health practices, such as Ayurvedic medicine, which focuses on treating the mind, body, and spirit. Understanding these nuances is critical t o serving the needs of this growing population. However, very little research explores how these cultural values impact the way in which these immigrants learn about health in the United States. For this reason, it is 12 imperative to have a better understanding of how cu ltural values shape Asian Indians' behaviors and approaches to health. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study was to understand how cul tural values influence health-related behaviors among older Asian Indian immigrants in th e United States. Specifically, I examined the following: 1. How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn abou t health-related issues? 2. In what ways do culture and heritage affect old er Asian Indian immigrants' health behaviors? 3. How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate be tween Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? Significance of Study This study adds to multiple knowledge bases in a v ariety of ways, highlighting a population, namely Asian Indian immigrants who are continually overlooked, despite their growing numbers in this country. By exploring how their cultural values shape their health behaviors, it is possible to better understand diff erent aspects of these immigrants. For instance, this research adds to the adult learning literature by illuminating how these individuals learn and negotiate health issues. While there is a consider able amount of literature on informal learning, there is very little on how Asian Indian immigrants utilize this form of knowledge acquisition in everyday life, and more specifically, when dealing with health related issues. This study helps to expand the concept of informal learning. In addition to further developing the concept of i nformal learning, this research also provides practical applications for health practiti oners, as well as health educators. By investigating these immigrants, this study highligh ts a number of key cultural values that not 13 only impact their learning process, but also the wa y that these individuals approach health. Understanding these nuances is critical in order to effectively treat these immigrants, especially as the number of elderly among this population cont inues to grow. This information becomes invaluable as more and more Asian Indian immigrants begin to utilize health services within the United States. Health professionals will be better able to reach this population when they understand the connections between cultural values, behavior, and learning. As immigrant populations continue to grow in the United States, the impact of cultural differences is becoming recognized. Among health p rofessionals, the need to be increasingly sensitive to other cultures and their beliefs are c oming to the forefront and is referred to as cultural competency (Sue, Ivey and Pedersen, 1996). This study helps to expand on this notion by illustrating a number of core Asian Indian cultu ral values, an element that is currently missing from the literature in this area. These characteri stics are not only beneficial for physicians in a clinical setting, but also for instructors and plan ners as they develop outreach programs for this population. Finally, this research illustrates the value of al ternate ways of knowing, specifically foregoing the dichotomy between mind and body and a pproaching learning from an increasingly holistic perspective. This contrast is magnified w hen dealing with health issues, because Western medicine often treats symptoms and has a te ndency to neglect the spiritual component that is so highly valued among Asian Indians. By i nvestigating the negotiation process that these immigrants utilize when confronted with an illness, these individuals demonstrate the importance of understanding and treating the whole person rather than just the body. Definitions The following definition is important for this stud y: 14 Culture is the sum total ways of living; including values, beliefs, esthetic standards, linguistic expression, patterns of thinking, behavioral norms, and styles of communication which a group of people has developed to assure its survival in a particular physical and human environment (Chryssochoou, 2004). It is learned behavior, beli efs and attitudes; simply stated, it is all human activities obtained by learning (Wissler, 1929) whi ch are largely invisible yet always present sources of authority in people's lives (Bowers, 199 3, p. 21). 15 CHAPTER 2 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE The purpose of this study was to explore how Asian Indian cultural values shape the health-related behaviors of older Asian Indian immi grants living in the United States. The research questions that guided this study were: (a) How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-related issues? (b) In what ways does culture and heritage affect older Asian Indian immigrants' health behaviors? and (c) How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? With th is in mind, this chapter explores the following four bodies of literature in order to sit uate this study: cultural issues in education, Asian Indian cultural values, informal learning, an d immigrant healthcare. Learning and Culture Learning is always situated within a cultural sett ing. Individuals select from information in the culture's information pool, refashion, recre ate, invent, and synthesize the resulting data into a structure of knowledge (Barkow, 1989). Cult ure can then be considered a \"map\" that can help guide the learning process. Though it is not possible to know all the details of either our own or another people's cultural map, an understand ing of the general terrains of the society's culture will be helpful in relating to others and d esigning effective teaching-learning situations (Pai & Adler, 2001). While it is evident that culture affects the learn ing process, educational endeavors also have the ability to influence how people think, bel ieve, judge, and act. Mullins (1999) discussed the concept of learning across cultures, noting tha t educators seek to understand and be 16 understood by students who are members of other cul tures. She further argues that for this process to occur, individuals need to not only be w illing to share their own experiences, but also remain open to hearing the opinions of others. Ins tructors can create supporting learning environments that will help foster this type of dia logue. By sharing personal values and beliefs, individuals can learn about the world through an al ternate lens and identify issues and possible solutions in new and unique ways. Through this pro cess, students are able to engage in critical thinking which can not only highlight, but also alt er cultural assumptions. The relationship between culture and learning is a n important topic and has begun to enter the dialogue in the field of adult education. According to McLoughlin (1999), \"culture and learning are interwoven and inseparable\" (p. 232). As a social being, everyone lives in his or her own culture. DuPraw and Axner (1997) maintained th at culture is central to what we see, how we make sense of what we see, and how we express ou rselves. Hofstede (1991) expressed similar ideas and believes that culture is so funda mental that \"no part of our lives is exempt from culture's influence\" (p. 170). Guy (1999) also mai ntained that every aspect of adult life is shaped by culture, and he further points out that e ducation has served as a vehicle for defining cultural values that people hold or that they view as central to being successful in their society. Based on their extensive research on learning style s, Dunn and Griggs (1995) conclude that each cultural group tends to have some learning style el ements that distinguish it from other groups. The following section examines cultural issues spec ifically within the field of adult education. Two well-known theories of adult learning - andrag ogy and self-directed learning - can be examined to demonstrate the link between learnin g and culture. Andragogy was known to be the first theory created for adult learning. Knowl es (1980) defined it as the art and science of helping adults to learn in an attempt to make a dis tinction from pedagogy (the education of 17 children). His five assumptions reveal characteris tics of adult learners: 1) As people mature, they become more self-directed; 2) Their life exper iences are valuable resources for learning; 3) Their learning becomes oriented to the development of their social roles; 4) They wish to apply knowledge immediately, and 5) Their learning orient ations shift from subject centered to problem centered. Similarly, Pratt (1991) critical ly assessed the underlying cultural assumptions of Malcolm Knowles' andragogy theory: This particular view of adult education espouses, a t least implicitly, a set of beliefs about the nature of adults as learners, motives for learn ing, appropriate types of relationship[s] between teachers and learners, and the nature and r ole of self-concept within the educational process. Its proclaimed goals are the \"democratization\" of education and the empowerment of the individual; and its methods of c ollaboration and choice are coupled with a profound appreciation of individual differen ces. This is embedded within a cultural commitment to individual autonomy and the right to choose as central values to be protected and promoted. Thus, it is no accident that such a conception of adult education, as a set of beliefs and a way of practic e, has taken root and flourished in the soil of Jeffersonian democracy. The strident indiv idualism of the United States, with its constitutional proclamation of individual rights, h as indeed been fertile ground for such growth. (p. 303). Self-directed learning, another theory, focuses on the learning process itself and includes a series of concepts by different researchers (Know les, 1975; Grow, 1991, 1994). It advocates that learning occurs as a daily part of adults' liv es. Self-directed learning is systematic, self- planned and self-realized, and leaves control with the learner. 18 Andragogy, self-directed learning, and a number of other key learning theories have helped to articulate the characteristics of adult l earners and provided insights into the learning process of adults. However, these major adult lear ning theories have also been criticized for being developed from mainstream culture - the white , male, and Western European culture (Amstutz, 1999; Lee, 2003; Pratt, 1991). Caffarell a and Merriam (2000) analyzed the long tradition and historical focus on individual learne rs in adult education, noting that many key theories assume that learning happens \"primarily in ternally\" (p. 56) regardless of the situation and background of the learners. Amstutz (1999) further critiqued the cultural limi tation of traditional adult learning theories, nothing that these frameworks are acontex tual. Furthermore, she argues that these theories are highly individualistic, attempting to define knowledge as a generalizable truth for all cultures, thus \"making the assumption that the 'rig ht' way to know things is acceptable only through one hegemonic filter\" (p. 19). Lee (2003) also evaluated adult learning theories, specifically focusing on andragogy from the perspec tive of an immigrant learner, noting its inattention to the roles of the historical and soci o-cultural context of diverse learners, as well as for the overgeneralization of characteristics of th e privileged group to most adults in American society. Echoing these theoretical critiques, other empirica l studies have further revealed how socio-cultural background affects people's learning processes and outcomes. In an earlier study, Hvitfeldt (1986) observed an American basic educati on class for newly immigrated Hmong adults and found that their learning behaviors are significantly influenced by their preliterate and pre-technical culture and reflected their interdepe ndent community life. In the classroom, they show a respectful and submissive attitude toward th e instructors, rely on external referents, 19 achieve tasks through group cooperation, and demons trate a holistic rather than analytic perceptual style. Pratt (1990, 1991, 1992) conducted several studies on Chinese adult teachers and learners. He found that learning for Chinese indiv iduals was understood as the acquisition of knowledge or skills from others, a fulfillment of r esponsibility to society, and a change in understanding of external matters and oneself, whil e teaching was recognized as the delivery of content, the development of character, and a type o f relationship. Pratt believed that these concepts are compatible with the cultural, social, political, and economic context of mainland China. In a similar fashion, Merriam and Muhammad (2000) performed a study on the learning activities of older Malaysian adults. They found t hat these individuals' learning was significantly shaped by Eastern cultural values suc h as collectivism, hierarchy, and relationship orientation. For example, learning was seen as \"a highly social activity where they [learners] enjoyed being in a group and relating to other lear ners\" (p. 59). In addition, Malaysian older adults view learning \"as a responsibility and a mea ns of giving back to their communities\" (p. 60). This emphasis on community and service clearl y reflects the collective and interdependent culture of Eastern society. Alfred (2003) explored the learning experiences of Anglophone Caribbean immigrant women in postsecondary institutions through qualita tive inquiry. Serving as both researcher and participant, Alfred interviewed 15 individuals in o rder to better understand how culture shaped the way these immigrant women learn. The findings of this study revealed that culture and early schooling socialization in their country of origin have significantly influenced these adult immigrants' learning experiences in the United Stat es. Having assimilated indigenous knowledge from their families and local communities , as well as having been socialized in the 20 teacher-directed and selective British education sy stem, these women became silent knowers who preferred learning through lectures and written exercises rather than learning from dialogue and active classroom participation. To voice their opinions, challenge the authority of instructors, and participate in discussion were con tradictory to their silent learning style, and thus created a learning challenge for these women. The examination of cultural assumptions and limita tions of adult learning theories and exploration of the role of socio-cultural context i n its influence of the learning processes of adult learners from different societies helps to not only extend our understanding of the learning process, but also expands the horizon of adult educ ation research. Many researchers have begun to consider culture as an important contextual fact or that influences adult learning. Guy (1999) points out that the idea of a generic adult learner with certain universal characteristics and traits has been gradually rejected by most researchers in adult education and that socio-cultural context strongly influences the motivations, needs, goals, and perspectives of the learners during their learning process. For this reason, it becomes impe rative to have a clear understanding of culture, cultural values, as well as its implications for le arning and other health-related behaviors. Cultural Values and Asian Indian Cultural Values Culture is a complex concept that has been defined by many people in a variety of ways. There is little consensus on one single definition. Anything commonly shared by a group of people and distinguishing them from other groups - such as food, clothes, music, art, language, and customs - can be labeled as culture. Kroeber a nd Kluckhohn (1952) once summarized more than 160 definitions of culture, underscoring the b road range of this concept. The multi-layered and non-static nature of culture was best described by Vinken, Soeters, and Ester (2004) in their statement that \"culture is conceptualized as a phen omenon lacking coherence, full of 21 complexities, something that is dynamic, continuous ly changeable, and fundamentally fluid\" (p. 6). In the following section, I will first explore the definitions of culture and cultural values. Following, I will review some major studies on cult ural values and conclude by highlighting some key characteristics of Asian Indian culture. Definitions of Culture While the term culture first appeared in an English dictionary in the 1920s (Kroeber, 1949), the first use in an anthropological work was by Edward Taylor (1871), who defined culture as \"that complex whole which includes knowl edge, belief, art, morals, laws, customs, and many other capabilities and habits acquired by man [sic] as a member of society\" (cited in Berry, Poortinga, Segall, & Dasen, 1992, p. 165). Two rat her short but now widely used definitions were later proposed: Linton (1936) suggested that c ulture means \"the total social heredity of mankind\" (p. 78), and Herskovits (1948) said that \" Culture is the man-made [sic] part of the human environment\" (p. 17). In contrast to these c oncise definitions, others sought to create lengthy lists of what was included in the term cult ure. For instance, Wissler (1923) included speech, material traits, art, knowledge, religion, society, property, government, and war (cited in Berry, Poortinga, Segall, & Dasen, 1992). As the number of definitions grew, researchers beg an to seek methods to organize the plethora of meanings. In a classic survey, Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952) suggested that there are six major classes of definition of culture to b e found in the anthropological literature: descriptive, structural, historical, normative, gen etic, and psychological. Descriptive definitions are those that attempt to list any and all aspects of human life and activity thought by the writer to be an example of what one means by culture. Bot h Taylor's and Wissler's definitions, which were expressed earlier, serve as examples of this t ype of classification. For Kroeber and 22 Kluchhohn (1952), this category stresses the widesp read totality of culture. Similarly, structural definitions underline the pattern or organization o f culture. However, this category requires going beyond the obvious features in order to disco ver preexisting arrangements. The central view here is that culture is not a mere list or ass ortment of customs, but forms an integrated pattern of interrelated features (Berry, Poortinga, Segall, & Dasen, 1992). Historical definitions, such as Linton's, tend to highlight the accumulatio n of tradition over time rather than specifying the entirety or range of cultural phenomena. The t erm heritage is frequently used in these definitions, as well as the term heredity, but the context clearly indicates that no biological factors are thought to be involved in this growth. Unlike descriptive and historical definitions, where the cultural life being referred to is clearl y observable, normative definitions require us to dig into the explicit activity and to try to discov er what lies behind it. This category underscores the shared rules that regulate the events of a grou p of people. Rather than focusing on the elements of culture, ge netic definitions focus on the origin of this phenomenon. Within this category there are th ree main answers given: culture arises as adaptive to the habitat of group, out of social int eraction, and out of a creative process that is a characteristic of the human species. Finally, psyc hological definitions take an increasingly broad approach in explaining culture, considering aspects such as adjustment, problem solving, learning, and habits (Berry, Poortinga, Segall, & D asen, 1992). This classification stresses that culture is a learned phenomenon, a factor that is o f particular interest to educators and will be discussed in greater detail shortly. Although it has been argued that culture originated in anthropological studies, as the concept grew and expanded, a rather large number of other disciplines have begun to research this phenomenon. For instance, scientists refer to culture as a way to understand the differences 23 between societies. Still others speak of music, ar t, and travel as representing culture. The list of definitions is extensive and continues to grow as a n increasing number of individuals seek to understand the nuances of culture. A more recent d efinition of culture by Banks and Banks (1997) demonstrates that people focus more and more on the internal essence rather than the external expression of culture: The essence of a culture is not its artifacts, tool s, or other tangible cultural elements, but how the members of the group interact, use, and per ceive them. It is the values, symbols, interpretations, and perspectives that distinguish one people from another in modernized societies; it is not material objects and other tan gible aspects of human societies. (p. 8) This definition is reminiscent of that of Kroeber a nd Kluckhohn (1952) in indicating that the values are the core or important components of a cu ltural system. By examining the above definitions and categorizations, we can summarize t he main features of culture. First, culture is a shared symbolic or meaning system. Second, culture is formed through a rather long period and passed from generation to generation. Third, cultu re \"glues\" a group of people together and directs their ways of living and behaving in a simi lar way. Fourth, culture distinguishes one group of people from another. And finally, values represent the core of a culture. This concept of values has been explored and expan ded further by several researchers. Values are seen as relatively fundamental compared to rituals, heroes, and symbols. According to Hofstede (1991), a value is \"a broad tendency to prefer certain states of affairs over others\" (p. 8). In other words, values represent how things \"o ught to be\" according to an individual or group. For this reason, values influence and shape behavior. 24 Classic Studies on Cultural Values How cultural values shape people's daily lives and behaviors is a significant question that many anthropologists and cross-culture researchers have explored. Kluchhohn and Strodtbeck's (1961) well-known research increased awareness of t he taken-for-granted cultural values that are subtly embedded and learned during childhood. Thes e authors studied five culturally distinct communities in the Southwestern United States in or der to illustrate the impact of culture on the differences in value orientations. Through this re search, Kluchhohn and Strodtbeck identified five problems common to most cultural communities a nd possible responses to each of these issues: 1. What is man's [sic] assessment of human nature? [Ev il, neutral, good-and-evil, [Subjugati on-to-nature, harmony-with-nature, or focus of life? [Past as tradit ion-bound, present as situational, or future as goal-oriented] 4. What is the group's principal mode of activity? [Be ing, caring little about achievement, being in becoming, stressing inner development, or doing as emphasizing material success] 5. What is the modality of the group's relationship to others? [Authoritarian mode, group- oriented, or individuals] (p. 453) These five questions focus on the five main aspects of people's lives: human nature, the person- nature relationship, time orientation, mode of acti vity, and social relationship. It is hypothesized that different cultural groups will have different answers to some or all five inquiries. For 25 instance, Mexican American communities tend to be p resent-oriented and group-oriented, which is in sharp contrast with the future orientation an d individualism emphasized in European American communities. Similarly, the value of bein g in harmony with nature is stressed in Asian communities, while European Americans' prefer a master-over-nature mindset (Ortuno, 1991). The most influential research on national cultures was conducted by Hofstede (1980, 1984, 1991), a Dutch scholar who was active in a br oad range of social science disciplines. Through a survey study on work-related values of ov er 100,000 employees of a large company operating in 40 countries, he developed five dimens ions from a factor analysis of cultural averages: 1) individualism/collectivism, 2) power d istance, 3) uncertainty avoidance, 4) masculinity/femininity, and 5) long/short term orie ntation. In individualistic cultures, such as the United States, people tend to perceive themselves a s individuals rather than as part of a group, whereas in collectivistic cultures, such as India, people see themselves as members of a group and give higher priority to the interests of the co mmunity. Power distance refers to how a society accepts unequal power distribution. In hig h-power distance cultures, power differences and social hierarchies are accepted, valued, and ho nored. Uncertainty avoidance refers to the negative reaction to ambiguous or risky situations. Individuals in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance are more hesitant to take risks, change, or accept new ideas. The concepts of masculinity and femininity consider a culture's ori entation to gender and whether they are viewed as distinct or overlapping in roles and defi nition. Finally, long/short-term orientation focuses on the concept of time. Long-term orientat ion stands for fostering of virtues which emphasize future rewards such as perseverance and t hrift. In contrast, short-term orientation 26 stresses qualities related to the past and the pres ent, particularly respect for tradition and fulfilling social obligations. Another series of representative studies on multic ultural values were carried out by Schwartz and her colleagues (1987, 1990, 1994). Sc hwartz, an Israeli social and cross-cultural psychologist, views culture as a complex, multidime nsional structure, with values at the core. She defines values as \"the criteria people use to s elect and justify actions and to evaluate people (including the self) and events\" (Schwartz, 1992, p . 1). By reviewing previous work and developing a theoretical map of the value domain, S chwartz identified seven culture-level value types. Conservatism is a value that emphasizes the status quo, proprie ty, and encourages the avoidance of actions or inclinations that have the ability to agitate others. Intellectual and affective autonomy focuses on the individual being in control of his or her own destiny and goals. Hierarchy is a value that accepts power differentials and re source allocation. Mastery encourages developing confidence with the social en vironment through self-assertion. Egalitarian commitment values the well-being of others and individual's c ommitment to promote this form of welfare. Similarly, harmony also endorses the notion of community service. Bu t, in addition to social welfare, this value also encoura ges unity with nature. Rather than searching for the common and fundamenta l elements of diverse national cultures, Hall (1976) divided cultures into two cat egories: low context and high context. Individuals within a low-context culture tend to us e direct verbal expression style that underscores situational context, explicitness, self -expression, verbal fluency, eloquent speech, and vocal expression of one's opinion. In contrast , people in high-context cultures often use an indirect verbal expression style that places less e mphasis on explicit verbal messages, rely heavily on contextual cues in conveying important i nformation, value harmony, use ambiguous 27 language and silence in interactions, and avoid say ing no directly. According to Hall (1976), low-context cultures include the United States, Can ada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, most of Western Europe, and Scandinavia. Typical high-context cultures include Japan, China, Korea, Latin America, the Mediterrane an, the Middle East, Vietnam, and most of France. Although many cross-cultural researchers have ident ified the huge cultural differences between the East and the West, the former is usuall y represented by Chinese culture. While there are similarities among all Asian perspectives , more importantly, there are unique differences between China and India that shape lear ning and health. The following section highlights specific Asian Indian values. Asian Indian Cultural Values Culture can be viewed as consisting of standards an d control mechanisms with which members of a society assign meanings, values and si gnificance to things, events, and behaviors. These mechanisms are the products of human beings' unique ability to symbolize, or to originate, determine, and bestow meaning upon thing s and activities in the external world and the ability to understand these meanings (Pai & Adler, 2001). This helps to explain how the same item or event can have alternate meanings for diffe rent people. For example, in India, the cow is considered sacred because it is believed that this animal is a reincarnate of God. For this reason, the cow is not consumed as food. Similarly, a spec ific river located in north India is considered to be holy. Thousands of individuals pilgrimage to this place every year to bathe in its waters. It is thought that this river has spiritual powers, as its water is given to people as they are dying and many have their ashes spread in this sacred place. However, both of these examples are 28 especially significant for Asian Indians. This ind icates that the meanings of objects, events, and behavioral patterns need to be understood and appre ciated within their specific cultural context. In addition to assigning meaning and importance to activities and objects, culture also dictates the norms of a society. A norm is a \"shou ld\" or \"ought\", a prescriptive statement of how people expect others to behave in a particular situ ation (Barkow, 1989). For instance, in the Asian Indian community, elders are supposed to be t reated with the utmost respect, and this is indicated by a specific greeting. Norms also refer to how one is \"supposed to\" behave in a particular society and cover things such as what to eat, what to wear and where, whom to marry and how to court, as well as how to worship. Withi n the Indian community, dating is still not readily accepted and arranged marriages still conti nue today. There is a tremendous amount of faith in family and it is believed that relatives h ave the ability to choose an appropriate mate. At the wedding, there is certain attire and specific c olors that are deemed suitable and deviation is unacceptable. Familial and communal relationships existing in harmony are valued above the individual (Merriam & Muhammad, 2000), and maintain ing and nurturing these relationships is critical. Although it may appear that this type of structure hinders the formation of relationships, the extended family is still essential and serves a s a unified support system, even among Indian immigrants. This emphasis on the collective can ma ke the American saying \"You have to look out for yourself because no one else will\" difficul t to comprehend and disheartening. These immigrants are accustomed to solving problems and m aking decisions with friends and family. This preference for cooperative learning should be considered when communicating with this population. For instance, although Western medical practices privilege doctor-patient privacy, when working with Asian Indians, it is important to involve family members in the treatment 29 process. These individuals like to consult with fr iends and family when seeking information and making decisions, as this network serves as social support. This hierarchical structure also affects communica tion among Asian Indians as well as with others. Within this system, the roles of indi viduals are defined according to age, sex, and status. Further, individuals are expected to deal with problems indirectly so as not to offend others. Docility, respect for authority, and restr aint of strong feelings are encouraged, while direct expression of feelings and thoughts is highl y discouraged (Pai & Adler, 2001). It is important to recognize that communication flows fro m higher to lower positions in the hierarchy. This affects the learning environment, especially i n a traditional classroom. These individuals will be less likely to voice their opinions, becaus e they have a tremendous amount of respect for the teacher and consider his or her knowledge highl y valuable. This emphasis on authority extends into other relationships as well, and is ev ident between physicians and patients. Although Asian Indians confer with family and frien ds about their treatment processes, there is a strong possibility that they will defer judgment to their doctor because they believe that he or she is the expert on medical issues. For this reason, they may not readily voice their concerns during the consultation, making it necessary for physician s to prompt this type of information. This probing is especially critical with these individua ls because they may be practicing a number of alternate approaches that could impact the negotiat ion of the healthcare process. In addition to emphasizing family relationships an d respect for authority, there is also a difference in the conception of time. Western soci eties are increasingly future-oriented, focusing on tomorrow and the implications that the new day b rings. In contrast, Indians concentrate on the present, giving value to the moment at hand (Ro land, 1988). This belief is spiritual in nature and is reflected in this community's concept of wel l-being. For example, yoga is a popular 30 practice that incorporates meditation and reflectio n and focuses on self-actualization by helping individuals eliminate mental, emotional and other s uch distractions. By focusing their energy on the present, Asian Indians seek to unite the mind, body, and spirit, providing them with a holistic view of their identity. A number of the alternate medical approaches that are used by Asian Indians incorporate these ideas of spiritual well-b eing. For instance, it is believed that homeopathic medicine increases the vitality, or lif e force, that animates each of us. If we weaken and deplete our vitality (as suppressive therapies do), we diminish our immune function, thereby becoming increasingly susceptible to all disease \u2014 physical, emotional, as well as mental. The goal of homeopathy is to simulate the body's own he aling capacity, so that it corrects these imbalances and weaknesses that allow disease to eme rge. This approach is believed to stimulate an accelerated immune system response, release unde rlying energetic blocks and trauma imprints, provide a non-toxic, safe and natural sys tem of healing, complement orthodox allopathic medicine if necessary, revitalize all le vels of being, raise vitality, and assist in healin g the body/mind/spiritual connection. Hinduism stres ses holistic development over material well- being (Merriam & Mohamad, 2000), and thus Asian Ind ians are continually searching for methods to merge the mind, body, and spirit. Our cultural values are evident in the experiences that we share everyday. Jerome Bruner (1996) discussed the importance of stories and thei r affect on the construction of reality. Each of our narratives is situated within a cultural contex t, and this becomes magnified for immigrants as they attempt to navigate between two distinct envir onments. I cannot help but think about my own acculturation process, being Asian Indian, but being raised in an American society. I can vividly recollect the tales that my parents and gra ndparents shared to help me understand my heritage, as well as my cultural beliefs - the impo rtance of family and education, my role as a 31 daughter, sister, and wife, and my obligations as a human being. Each of these stories served as a building block, as I learned (and continue to lea rn) how to mold these values into a Western context. In addition to emphasizing cultural value s, these narratives also serve as texts, which allow these individuals to informally learn from ev eryday situations. Informal Learning The process of acquiring knowledge by adults can b e realized through formal, non-formal and a spectrum of informal and incidental learning (Coombs, Prosser, & Ahmed, 1973; Merriam & Brockett, 1997; Merriam Merriam & Brockett, 1997; Merriam & Caffarella, 199 9) have characteristics that serve as indicators to learners who want to choose how to fu rther their knowledge base to satisfy their needs. Formal learning is structured usually by a single or a collaboration of entities and is held in an educational institution, often granting some type of credentials such as a diploma, certificate, or degree (Galbraith, 1992; Merriam & Caffarella, 1999). The learner has little control over what is taught and the method(s) in wh ich the information will be presented. The major responsibility of curriculum development lies with educators who structure learning programs that will provide necessary content to sat isfy educational pursuits (Galbraith, 1992). In formal settings, teachers often have some form of p rofessional training that provides credibility. Learning pursuits outside of formal settings (educa tional institutions) are recognized as nonformal. Nonformal learning refers to organized activities that take place sometimes outside of educational institutions but are located in comm unity-based settings, such as local churches, cooperative extension, or non-profit organizations (Galbraith, 1992; Merriam & Brockett, 1997; Merriam & Caffarella, 1999). Organizations having education as part of their mission often conduct educational programs in communities in orde r to combat barriers such as transportation 32 and work schedules. Learners have some control ove r what they learn, as well as when, how, and where this learning will take place (Galbraith, 1992). Informal learning is probably one of the most frequ ently discussed aspects of adult education. Some researchers say that as much as 70 percent of learning takes place outside classrooms and formal education institutions (Day, 1998). Various terms have been used for it, including experiential learning, nonformal learning , and incidental learning. For example, Fenwick (2000) prefers the term \"experiential learn ing\" to refer to adult learning that is situated in everyday undertakings, whether it happens at wor k, in the home, or in the community. She offers five currents of thought that have become pr ominent in discussing experiential learning within the adult education literature: reflection, interference, participation, resistance, and co- emergence (Fenwick, 2000). She describes reflectio n as a process where the learner reflects on lived experience and then interprets and generalize s this experience to form mental structures. Born out of constructivism, it is believed that the learner constructs meaning by reflecting on his or her actions. The idea of interference focuses o n an individual's relations between the outside world of culture and objects of knowledge and the i nside world of psychic energies and dilemmas of relating to these objects of knowledge. Our desires and resistances for different objects, which we experience as matters of love and hate, attach our internal selves to the external social world (Fenwick, 2000). This viewpo int seeks to build on this form of anxiety between the conscious and unconscious mind to gener ate knowledge, and more importantly, self- understanding. In contrast, Fenwick (2000) described an alternativ e learning perspective which she calls participation. This approach is similar to situate d cognition, where learning is rooted in the situation in which a person participates, not in th e head of that person as intellectual concepts 33 produced by reflection nor as inner energies produc ed by the psychic conflicts described in interference. Knowing and learning are defined as e ngaging in changing processes of human activity in a particular community. Knowledge is no t a substance to be ingested and then transferred to new situation but, instead, part of the very process of participation in the immediate situation. Similarly, Lave and Wagner (1 991) noted that individuals learn as they participate by interacting with the community (with its history, assumptions and cultural values, rules, and patterns of relationship), the tools at hand (including objects, technology, languages, and images), and the moment's activity, along with its purposes, norms, and practical challenges (cited in Fenwick, 2000). Although participation emphasizes interactions amon g individuals within a community, Fenwick (2000) argued that this approach overlooks power relations that inevitably exist when people communicate and work together. For this rea son, she explores a concept called resistance, which emerges from the critical cultura l perspective, where there is a focus on understanding and analyzing existing structures of dominance within a given society. By recognizing such oppressions, it becomes possible t o resist such forces, thus allowing people to become open to unexpected, unimagined possibilities for work, life, and development. Through this form of understanding, Learning becomes about critical awareness about one's contexts as well as one's own contradictory investments and imp lications in what knowledge counts in particular communities, how development is measured , who gets to judge whom and why, and the interests that are served by resistant or devel opment initiatives. Finally, co-emergence portrays experiential learnin g in an ecological way by emphasizing processes of self-organization and inte rdependence which occur through feedback loops. For this reason, this perspective considers understandings to be embedded in conduct, 34 drawing attention to the background by examining my riad fluctuations, subtle interactions, imaginings and intuitions, the invisible implied by the visible, and the series of consequences emerging from any single action (Fenwick, 2000). H ere the focus is not on the components of experience (which other perspectives might describe in fragmented terms such as person, experience, tools, community, and activity) but on the relationships binding them together in complex systems. Learning is thus cast as continuo us invention and exploration produced through the relations among consciousness, identity , action and interaction, and objects and structural dynamics of complex systems. Some of these viewpoints consider the learner to be at the center of the learning transaction, some see the context as the key ingred ient, and some view the relationship between learner and context as the catalyst for learning. No matter where an individual is on the continuum, the fact remains that much of adult lear ning takes place outside formal institutions. At least one author defines informal learning by wh at it is not: learning determined or designed by an organization (Day, 1998). Some auth ors use these different terms to indicate slight variations in the process that takes place. For the purpose of this study, however, informal learning is considered to be learning that takes pl ace outside formal instruction, and it may take place without any conscious decision to learn on th e part of the learner. Informal learning may occur in the context of work, family relationships, community involvement, religious participation, or leisure pursuits. Informal learning is often afforded \"residual\" stat us, representing the entire collection of adult knowledge that is gained outside formal conte xts. Cairns (2000) however insisted that the process is much more complex. She suggests that th e ever-changing nature of adults' lives, their social contexts, and their individual needs and cho ices create layers of learning that interact with 35 all of the above elements. Not only did Cairns (20 00) suggest that the majority of what people learn over their lifetime occurs informally, she ar gued that what is learned through this method may be the most significant learning that an indivi dual acquires. The context in which informal learning occurs is al so the focus of studies conducted by English (1999, 2000). She suggests that this form of learning is generally unintended, and it happens on a continuum of learner consciousness (En glish, 1999). Additionally, she asserts that informal learning takes place continuously in every context (English, 2000). In her study of parishioners adjusting to changes in church leaders hip, participants reported that their learning was affected by such elements as incidents of chang e, the church context, action required of parishioners, and extraordinary circumstances (Engl ish, 1999). Furthermore, it was noted in this study that, perhaps like all informal learning, \"fo r learning to occur, there has to be some element of reflection on action\" (English, 1999, p. 391). She also found that it was not always easy for church members to articulate their informal learnin g, which may be an additional feature of informal learning that bears investigation. In addition to being difficult to articulate, anoth er complexity of informal learning is that it is difficult to measure, both in participation a nd in knowledge and skills gained (Gorard, Fevre, & Rees, 1999). Gorard et al. use informal learning to indicate a deliberate act on the part of a learner, but without taking part in a course or tra ining activity. They also include learning that goes on in work and leisure situations, and they be lieve that much of the learning that goes on in work is so difficult to measure that it escapes not ice of employers and researchers alike (Gorard, Fevre, & Rees, 1999). If informal learning is diff icult to measure, it may be even more difficult to describe. This study discovered that women were less likely than men to describe their activities as \"learning,\" even when it was apparent that significant learning took place. 36 An element of control in informal learning is one o f the features that make it attractive to adults (Garrison, 1997). The desire to be in contr ol of making decisions regarding what to learn, how to learn it, and when to learn it, appeals to m ost adults' sense of autonomy. More researchers agree that adults have an innate desire to learn, and they want to direct the course of how that learning takes place (Garrison, 1997). Ad ditionally, Garrison (1997) stated that \"motivation to assume responsibility in learning is influenced by external conditions and internal states\" (p. 29). This may help to explain why some adults seek out self-directed learning opportunities and others do not. The grouping of e xternal conditions and internal states may not be balanced for some individuals. This same combin ation of factors may also explain why some adults tend to engage in leisure pursuits, whether participating in a number of actvities or becoming involved in a particular one for a very lo ng time. When describing informal learning, if is often help ful to imagine a continuum, with formal learning on one end and informal on the othe r (Stein, 2001). However, this process is increasingly complex, because there is no concrete dividing line between formal and informal learning and there are numerous times when these tw o styles merge. The term natural learning, developed by Watkins and Marsick (1992), is also us ed to identify learning from experience that takes place outside formally structured, institutio nally sponsored, classroom-based activities. This approach is often composed of incremental lear ning, also known as \"filling in the gaps\" (Burton & Perkins, 2003). Many different activitie s are used to gain knowledge, from reading to lectures to collaborative inquiry. This last metho d is popular among groups who value community relationships. The community is where ad ults spend the majority of their time interacting, learning, as well as acquiring and imp roving knowledge in order to meet their needs. Galbraith (1992) noted that informal learning is ch aracterized by interactions and can occur in a 37 variety of situations such as informal debates and conversations in the work, family, or community setting, leisure-time activities, as well as listening to audio cassettes, reading publications, or viewing video tapes. Networking is another example of informal learning and involves learning through widespread relationships. Learning opportunities f low from the communication that creates the linkages between individuals and clusters of people . This type of knowledge acquisition is quite common among Asian Indians. Since this community i s so interwoven, it can be considered a network within itself. People often come together to celebrate cultural holidays and festivals, and these gatherings become avenues for communicati ng information. Individuals share their stories and experiences, making conversations the m eans for learning. This is evident even with health issues, as a large number of Asian Indians s till attend health fairs to gain knowledge about diseases and other medical concerns. A number of p hysicians and other healthcare professionals from the Indian community come together, offering e xams, answering questions, and providing support. In a way, these fairs serve as a health n etwork for these immigrants. Although this interaction is planned, it can be argued that the l earning is still informal because it is the result of a dialogue with a number of people within the commu nity. It has also been noted that the characteristics of informal learning provide a spiritual component not necessarily available from other more traditional teaching methods. Because this form of learning occurs continuously in the everyda y world, it stimulates reflection on people's actions. English (2000) argued that informal learn ing is experienced best when learners depend upon one another and draw strength from personal co nnections. Furthermore, this interaction not only supports individual learning, but also provide s an opportunity to explore group development, which is critical when working with As ian Indians. By building from pre-existing 38 relationships, individuals feel a sense of communit y and belonging, a factor that is more important than individual growth. The spiritual na ture that can result from the relationships created during the networking process is also benef icial and motivating to these immigrants. This population's views on learning and development are much more holistic than the Western approach. Asian Indians seek to nurture the mind, body, and soul, and the various methods within informal learning offer these individuals th e flexibility to not only focus on intellect, but also the spirit. Immigrant Healthcare Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIAs) repres ent the fastest growing ethnic minority populations in the United States over the past twenty years, increasing from 1.4 million in 1970 to 7.3 million in 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). This growth is projected to increase, with the Bureau of the Census estimating that APIAs will double their current size by 2009, triple by 2024, and quadruple by 2038. By th e year 2050, APIAs will exceed 41 million and constitute 10.7 percent of the total U.S. popul ation (Lin-Fu, 1993). In addition to this growth, Asian and Pacific Isla nder Americans represent a culturally and ethnically diverse group differing in language, socioeconomic status, as well as patterns of immigration. The APIA population is comprised of a bout thirty-two different national and ethnic groups (Austin & Prendergast, 1994) includin g Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Asian Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Lao, Cambodian, Thai, Hmong, Samoan, Guamanian, and Tongan (Ma, 1999). This distribution highlights th e heterogeneity of the APIAs and illustrates the difficulty in examining this group. Though this population possesses a large amount of diversity in regards to customs, culture, and religion, they still share a number of barriers that prevent them from seeking and/or 39 receiving adequate healthcare. Research shows that this population has limited access to healthcare, and hence has a lower health status, at tributed mainly to language, cultural, socioeconomic, and other systemic barriers (Associa tion of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, 1995). Other barriers are self-impo sed. For example, many APIAs often avoid biomedical treatment or other formal health service utilization, preferring traditional and ethnic healthcare, exposing themselves unnecessarily to pr eventable health conditions. Because the majority of Asian Pacific Islanders in the United States are foreign-born, strong cultural values, beliefs, and traditional he alth practices are still evident in their behaviors . These are reflected in unfamiliarity with Western c oncepts and terminology of illnesses and diseases, and with modern diagnostic techniques or treatments. Lack of understanding of the U.S. healthcare system prevents them from utilizing available services or following prescribed treatment (Ma, 1999). Additionally, many Asian Ame ricans may also be apprehensive about seeking medical help from Western doctors or practi oners and, as a result, may withhold or avoid disclosing information about their cultural practic es. Thus, the lack of culturally competent services becomes a major obstacle for provision of services to Asian patients, and a challenge to healthcare providers. Because the U.S. healthcare system often fails to recognize ethnomedicine and other traditional health practices common among Asian immigrants, these patients are often hesitant to cooperate with their respective provide rs. Language is yet another barrier that APAIs face wh en confronting the healthcare system in the United States. In 1990, 4.5 million people reported speaking at least one APAI language at home, and 2.4 million of these reported that the y did not speak English very well (Ma, 1999). Today, the U.S. healthcare delivery system is still unprepared to respond to these groups' linguistic needs. Clinics and hospitals serving th em often do not have interpreter services, 40 leaving the burden of assuring communication entire ly to service consumers (Brooks et al., 2000). As the APAI population continues to grow in the Un ited States, researchers have begun to explore the implications for these groups in reg ard to healthcare, as well as health behaviors. For example, Grewal, Bottorff, and Hilton (2005) ex amined the influence of family members on immigrant South Asian women's health and health-see king behaviors in order to better understand how these women made decisions regarding their health. In-depth interviews revealed that these participants made decisions abo ut their health in consultation with family members, who were often perceived to be supportive and provided direct and indirect assistance to women in ways that influenced their health. In addition, it was evident that expected roles and responsibilities often had detrimental influences o n women's health. This type of information is critical for healthcare professionals in order to r each these individuals effectively. By taking into account women's relationships with family, as well as their influence on women's health, both physicians and educators can better serve the needs of this group and improve their health- seeking behaviors. Sadler et al. (2001) specifically examined Asian I ndian women and their knowledge and behaviors surrounding breast cancer. Surveying ove r 150 Asian Indian women, it was determined that although a significant number of th ese participants undergo an annual mammography, their self-breast exam rate is relativ ely low compared with other groups. Several cultural factors can indicate possible reasons for this low participation. First, Asian Indians have a high respect for authority and often defer judgme nt to the higher power. For this reason, Choudhry (1998) noted that these women believe that detection is their physician's responsibility and not their own. Additionally, Asian Indian cult ure considers touching oneself a taboo 41 (Choudhry et al., 1998), making self-breast exams p roblematic for these women. Finally, family is extremely important for this population. Ramakr ishna and Weiss (1992) argued that Asian Indian women often place their families' concerns f irst. Consequently, they may feel guilty taking time to monitor their own health. These cul tural issues can dramatically impact the health and well-being of these women, and Asian Indians in general. Despite a number of research studies and their dra matic increase, Asian Pacific Islander Americans remain one of the least understood and mo st invisible and neglected minority groups in the United States, especially in the context of health status and health service utilization. Information on their healthcare needs, barriers the y face in their access to health services, and their quality of life remains sparse. Although in some local areas they are organized to advocate for changes in healthcare delivery, their collectiv e impact at the national level has not been reflective of their growing numbers or their specia l needs. Asian Indians and Healthcare The 2000 United States Census confirms earlier ass ertions that the Asian Indian group is one of the fastest growing ethnic communities durin g the last decade. A total of 1,678,765 Asian Indians called United States as their home at the t ime of 2000 census, making them the third largest Asian group after Chinese and Filipinos (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). Most of the growth in population among Asian Indians is through immigration and less through natural increase. The Asian Indian immigration took on a fa st phase after the 1965 U.S. immigration act abolished a national origins' quota system. However , the surge was limited to a 20,000 per country ceiling. The relaxation of immigration regu lations attracted many adventurous and talented professionals from India for the first tim e. The percentage change in immigrants from India between 1965 and 1977 was about 3098.1 (Dinne rstein and Reimers, 1982). The 1990 42 comprehensive immigration legislation increased the total immigration to 700,000 during the fiscal years 1992 through 1994. Unlike earlier immi gration regulations, this 1990 legislation created a separate category for family-sponsored, e mployment-based, and diversity of immigrants. For example, there were 30,667 persons from India that were admitted under new regulations in 1990, compared to 45,064 in 1991, 34 ,629 in 1992, and 40,021 in 1993 (INS, 1994). It is expected that the family re-unificatio n and favorable global economy would likely promote conditions conducive to higher immigration levels from India in the future. By examining more current data, it becomes evident tha t this assertion is true. In 2004, 70,151 Asian Indians immigrated to the United States, and in 2005, this number rose to 84,681 (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2007). This stead y growth underscores the need to further examine this population to better understand their needs. While Asian Indians have been present in the Unite d States for hundreds of years, it was not until the 1980s that the United States began to collect and record information separately for various ethnic minority groups. Several studies ha ve been conducted based on the 1980 census data such as a census monograph on Asian Indian dem ographics, occupational structure, and family structure (Xenos, Barringer, & Levin, 1989). However, the term Asian Indian has had a somewhat more confusing history than other ethnic t erminology to describe ethnic groups such as Koreans, Chinese, etc., for the general populati on. This uncertainty arises from the fact that Native Americans are often referred to as Indians i n the United States. Additionally, varied terminology has been adopted by mass media in refer ring to Asian Indian groups such as East Indian community, Asian Indians, Asian Americans, i mmigrants from India, etc., and there seems to be no consensus on standard terminology un iversally. 43 Asian Indians, just like other minorities, represen ting a group with a tremendous amount of diversity, from food and customs to socioeconomi c status. However, this population has an added complexity in that they also do not share the same language. While the national language is Hindi, only about 40% of Asian Indians are fluen t and use this language on a daily basis (Shapiro, 2001). Instead, individuals use a dialec t that is unique to the region of India in which they live. This variance in communication creates a type of \"segregation\" within the community, as people tend to socialize and interact with those individuals who share a common language. Though this diversity does make it increasingly dif ficult to examine this population, there are still similarities that exist across these subg roups. In regards to healthcare, many Asian Indians, especially elders, believe in the traditio nal system of medicine called Ayurvedic medicine as the means of preventing and curing illn ess. Ayurveda is an intricate system of healing that originated in India, thousands of year s ago. Ayurveda is made up of two Sanskrit words, 'Ayu' meaning life and 'veda' meaning the kn owledge of (Channa, 2004). Ayurveda is not merely a medical system dealing with physical d isorders. It is a science that relates to the complete human being (body, mind, senses and soul). It explains how balance can be attained physically, mentally and spiritually. According to it, each individual is made up of three doshas (vata, pitta or kapha). Each Dosha represents certa in bodily activity. The ratio of the doshas varies in each individual. When any of the doshas b ecomes accumulated, Ayurveda will suggest specific lifestyle and nutritional guidelines to as sist the individual in reducing the dosha that has become excessive. They may also suggest herbal supp lements to hasten the healing process. There are also aspects of the Hindu religion that c ommonly affect healthcare decisions. Hinduism is a social system as well as a religion; therefore customs and practices are closely interwoven. \"Karma\" is a law of behavior a nd consequences in which actions of past life 44 affects the circumstances in which one is born and lives in this life (Panganamala & Plummer, 1998). Despite complete understanding of biologica l causes of illness, it is often believed that the illness is caused by Karma. Additionally, the Hindu philosophy offers differin g views on death and dying, and thus these immigrants often do not seek the same end-of- life care as others living in the United States (Desphande, Reid, & Rao, 2005). Furthermore, a maj ority of Asian Indians are not aware of the services that are provided in the United States, su ch as hospice (Doorenbos, 2005). Working to understand their cultural beliefs, healthcare profe ssionals will be able to more effectively meet the needs of this fast growing elderly population. Chapter Summary This chapter broadly reviews the literature in fou r areas of research in order to set up the theoretical framework for the current study. First , the relationship between culture and learning, and adult education specifically, are overviewed. Second, definitions of cultural values, research on national cultures, and Asian Indian cultural val ues are addressed. Third, definitions of informal learning, along with its key characteristi cs and features, are provided. Finally, Asian Pacific Islander American healthcare is examined, l eading into a discussion of Asian Indian healthcare specifically. Culture and learning are interwoven and inseparabl e (McLoughlin, 1999). In the field of adult education, the awareness of cultural issues m anifested itself in critiques of traditional learning theories, such as andragogy and self-direc ted learning. Caffarella and Merriam (2000) criticized these theories as neglecting the context of learning and the background of learners. Amstutz (1999) and Lee (2003) highlighted that thes e theories are based on the mainstream culture of the Western, White, and male populations . Pratt (1991) analyzed the cultural 45 foundations of andragogy as having been rooted in t he soil of Jeffersonian democracy. This theoretical analysis was supported by other empiric al studies (Alfred, 2003; Merriam & Muhammad, 1999; Pratt, 1990, 1991, 1998), which fur ther reveals how cultural factors impact the learning process of learners from different soc ieties. Culture can be defined as the learned and shared k nowledge, belief, values and habits (Krochber & Kluckhonn, 1952; Useem & Useem, 1963) w hich distinguish one group of people from another (Hofstege, 1980). Values represent th e core of a cultural system and serve as a standard for people to make judgments in their live s. Studies indicate that Asian Indians value collectivism, hierarchy, family, and community (Mer riam & Mohamad, 2000; Pai & Adler, 2001; Roland, 1998). These beliefs shape these ind ividuals' learning process. Informal learning takes place outside of formal in stitutions and can occur in many contexts, such as on the job, within family relatio nships, or in leisure pursuits. Although this form of learning is often considered residual, rese archers still argue that much of adults' learning takes place in this manner (Cairns, 2000) and happe ns continuously (English, 2000). Networking is a type of informal learning which is readily evident in the Asian Indian community. Additionally, English (2000) illustrate d the spiritual component of this particular learning style by highlighting the importance of ut ilizing pre-existing relationships. By consulting one another, informal learning allows fo r not only individual growth, but also community growth, a key value among Asian Indians. Just as cultural values shape the learning process , such beliefs also play a role in healthcare. Asian Pacific Islander Americans (APIA s) represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and Asian Indians rank third among this extremely diverse minority population. Although research has been done on API As in general, this group is composed of 46 over thirty-two different national ethnicities (Aus tin & Prendergast, 1994). For this reason, it is imperative that studies focus on specific APIA subg roups rather than generalizing findings to the group as a whole. For example, studies show that t here is still a strong belief in traditional medicine such as Ayurveda among Asian Indians (Chan na, 2004). Additionally, the teachings of Hinduism play a role in the way these individuals v iew sickness and well-being (Panganamala & Plummer, 1998). Similarly, these beliefs also impa ct one's perception of death and end-of-life care (Desphande, Reid, & Rao, 2005; Doorenbos, 2005 ). Although there have been several studies specifical ly with Asian Indians, much is still unknown about these immigrants. Research indicates that cultural values impact learning as well as health, but little is understood about the inter section of these two concepts. As the elderly increase among this population and their need for h ealth services magnifies, it will become critical to understand how these individuals' cultu ral values shape their learning and other health-related behaviors. 47 CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY The purpose of this study was to explore how Asian Indian cultural values shape the health-related behaviors of older Asian Indian immi grants living in the United States. The research questions that guided this study were: (a) How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-related issues? (b) In what ways does culture and heritage affect older Asian Indian immigrants' health behaviors? and (c) How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? This ch apter describes the methodology that will be used to examine these questions and is divided i nto the following sections: the design of the study, sample selection, data collection, data anal ysis, validity and reliability, assumptions and limitations, and a chapter summary. Design of the Study Given the limited information on the target popula tion, and more specifically the issue under investigation, a qualitative approach was bes t suited to further understand the role of cultural values and its impact on the health-relate d behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. According to Merriam (1998), qualitative research i s interested \"in process rather than outcomes, in context rather than a specific variable, in disc overy rather than confirmation\" (p. 19). This description highlights the goal of this particular research project. Rather than looking for correlations or significance between variables, thi s study focuses on the learning and negotiation processes Asian Indian immigrants use when confront ed with health issues. 48 In contrast to a quantitative approach which assume s one objective reality that is measurable (Crotty, 1998), qualitative research rec ognizes that meaning is socially constructed by individuals in interaction with their world. Re ality is not a fixed, single, or quantifiable phenomenon as indicated by a positivistic perspecti ve. Rather, there are multiple constructions and interpretations that are fluid and constantly c hanging with time (Merriam & Associates, 2002). Thus, qualitative researchers are intereste d in understanding these interpretations at a specific point in time and in a particular context. Learning about such experiences and the meaning that they possess for individuals is deemed an interpretive qualitative approach. This form of inquiry attempts to achieve an underst anding of how people make sense out of their lives (Merriam & Simpson, 2000). In order to explain this process, researchers employ inductive techniques, building toward theory from o bservations and intuitive understanding. Data is gathered in order to build concepts and for mulate hypothesis and theories, rather than deductively developing postulates to be tested (Mer riam, 1998). The collection of this type of information occurs in the field, whether it is a sp ecific site, group of people, or institution, with the researcher immersing himself or herself within the context, thus becoming the primary instrument for data collection. With this approach, findings typically result in the identification of themes, patterns, typologies, and even theories, which help to illuminate an issue that has not previously been studied extensively. A qualitative design best suited my study because i t allowed me to conduct an in-depth exploration of a complicated phenomenon that has re ceived little attention. This approach enabled me to go beyond a superficial comparison of the differences between Western and Eastern cultural values. A qualitative inquiry pro vided me with an inductive research strategy and enough flexibility to analyze the themes, conce pts, topics, and hypotheses for understanding 49 these immigrants' experiences. As the primary data collection instrument, I reported pertinent information about the research context and particip ants, collected the richest data that relates to the topic, and maintained interactions with both th e data and the participants throughout the entire research process. Sample Selection Yet another difference between quantitative and qua litative research lies in the sampling approaches utilized within each method. While quan titative research depends on random sampling in order to generalize the results to the larger population and avoid bias, qualitative research focuses in-depth on relatively small sampl es that are chosen purposefully. Patton (2002) notes, \"The logic and power of purposeful sa mpling lies in selecting information-rich cases for study in depth\" (p. 230), which have the potential to yield insights and in-depth understanding rather than empirical generalizations . This form of participant selection focuses on selecting information-rich cases whose study wil l clarify the questions under study. Patton (2002) describes a number of strategies for this type of sample selection, and for this study, the snowball sampling approach was the most appropriate. This particular type of sampling involves locating information-rich cases b y asking key informants within the community for recommendations. In addition to choo sing the appropriate sampling strategy, it was equally important to identify the specific crit eria necessary for locating information-rich cases. Based on the purpose of this research, part icipants had to meet the following criteria: 1. I am interested in understanding how culture shapes the health behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. For this reason, it was critica l that my participants meet a certain age requirement in order to qualify as older adults. I interviewed individuals who are 60 years of age or older. I believe that this age ran ge provided me the flexibility to obtain an 50 appropriate number of participants while still focu sing on older adults within the Asian Indian community. I am examining older adult immig rants because, due to their age, these individuals are more likely to need and utili ze healthcare services than younger Asian Indian immigrants. 2. Participants should not have been living in the Uni ted States for an extended period of time. Individuals who came to the U.S. at the age of 40 or later would have begun the acculturation process, but not have become complete ly Westernized. Furthermore, they will be more in tune with their heritage and cultur al values. There is also a higher possibility that the behaviors and norms that were acceptable and standard in India are still prominent and affect these individuals' decis ion making process here in the United States. This factor is critical in understanding h ow culture shapes the health behaviors of these immigrants, as well as how they navigate the healthcare process. After 3 months of recruiting and finding only one appropriate partici pant, it became necessary to reevaluate my selection criteria. Upon further consideration, this was the only qualification that could be removed and not dramatically impact the st udy. So, I decided to forgo this stipulation. 3. Participants, or their immediate family (defined as spouse, children, brothers, and/or sisters) should not be healthcare professionals, such as nur ses, physician assistants, or physicians. Although these practitioners will have insight into the research topic, it is believed that these individuals will be too entrenc hed in Western medical practices. Even if they have been trained in India, where they are more likely to have been exposed to alternative methods of treatment, the fact that the se people are practicing in the United States indicates, in some form or fashion, that the y value western remedies over its 51 eastern counterparts. It can be argued that this i s a generalization, but a test interview with an Asian Indian physician indicates this to be true. For this reason, it is prudent to target individuals who are not trained in healthcar e practices. 4. The sample group should represent a range of gender s, ages, and regions of India. Using these criteria, I began my search for qualifi ed participants by contacting Asian Indian organizations and temples, via telephone. I descri bed the purpose of my study, the type of people I was seeking, and asked if they knew any su itable participants who would be interested in speaking with me. I also sent an email to frien ds and family (Appendix A) detailing my research and requested them to notify me of any ind ividuals who would be willing to meet with me. I located 11 participants that met my selection cri teria. All individuals interviewed for this study were adults upon coming to the U.S. Al l participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time and confidentia lity was assured along with a description of how pseudonyms were to be used to protect their ide ntity. Since in qualitative research there are no specific requirements for sample size, sampling to the point of redundancy is an ideal (Patton, 2002). Lincoln and Guba (1985) explain: \"In purpos eful sampling the size of the sample is determined by informational consideration. If the purpose is to maximize information, the sampling is terminated when no new information is f orthcoming from new sampled units; thus redundancy is the primacy criterion\" (p. 202). By the eleventh interview I was reconfirming what other participants had said, no longer finding new information, and had generated sufficient data for my research. 52 Data Collection Methods Of the various qualitative data collection techniq ues, semi-structured interviews was most suitable for this research. I used this approach a s the major data-gathering technique for my study. The interview was recently defined by DeMar rais (2004) as \"a process in which a researcher and participants engage in conversation focused on questions related to a research study. These questions usually ask participants fo r their thoughts, opinions, perspectives or descriptions of specific experiences\" (p. 54). Mer riam (2002) and other qualitative methodologists view an interview as a conversation between two people that is focused on the research topic, or as Lofland and Lofland (1995) de scribed it, \"a guided conversation\" (p. 18). In contrast, Misher (1986) argues that \"even questions that are apparently simple in both structure and topic leave much room for alternative interpret ations by both interviewer and respondent\" (p. 45). Rather than a simple exchange, he believes th e interview to be a type of discourse where both the researcher and participants work together to create meaning within a particular type of social relationship. However one views the concept of interviewing, this approach was well-suited for my study. My research questions focused on the learni ng experiences of older Asian Indian immigrants, as well as determining how they negotia te their social and cultural identities within a health context. These types of experiences are dif ficult to capture through surveys, and are better understood through direct conversations with partic ipants. As Patton (2002) observes, We interview people to find out from them those thi ngs we cannot directly observe...We cannot observe feelings, thoughts, and intentions. We cannot observe behaviors that took place at some previous point of time...We can not obs erve how people have organized the world and the meanings they attached to what go es on in the world. We have to ask 53 people questions about those things. The purpose o f interviewing, then, is to allow us to enter into the other person's perspective. (p. 341) There are many ways to conduct an interview, rangin g from a strict, structured interview to an entirely open-ended format. A semi-structured appr oach allows the researcher the opportunity to \"explore a topic more openly and to allow interview ees to express their opinions and ideas in their own words\" (Esterberg, 2002, p. 87). Through this method, though the researcher is guiding the discussion, the participants are still able to steer the conversation by communicating their views on a particular issue. I created an intervie w guide (Appendix B) that consisted of open- ended questions related to the issue of culture and healthcare. This guide provided topics or subject areas \"within which the interviewer is free to explore, probe, and ask questions that will elucidate and illuminate that particular subject\" ( Patton, 2002, p. 343). The semi-structured interview allowed me to remain flexible and open to the different experiences of my participants, modifying the questions to make them personal and r elevant for each participant. By incorporating this method I was able to focus the i nterview to encourage efficiency and allow for the greatest opportunity for varied response from p articipants. Specifically, I considered issues of time, participant apprehension, uncertain ty, or lack of understanding about the questions. The interview format consisted of questions intende d to encourage the participants to explore their experiences with bein g ill in the United States. Interviews ranged from one to two hours in length, with a large porti on of time dedicated to asking participants to describe their experience(s) with b eing sick, and how they made decisions regarding treatment (see Appendix B for interview g uide). All eleven interviews were conducted in person at a location of the participant's choice. The interviews were tape-recorded and then transcri bed verbatim to typed format for analysis. In 54 two cases, follow-up phone calls were necessary to clarify statements and misunderstandings. This not only served to clarify or strengthen emerg ing themes and ideas in the data, it also gave me insight into how to modify questions for future interviews. Field notes were made following the interview to highlight my own feelings, reflect ions, and observation (Bogdan & Biklen, 2003). An example of such notes included short desc riptions of my impressions, such as: \"tall and physically fit\" or \"shy but jovial.\" At each interview, I also invited the participant t o share any documents that related to their experiences with health-related behaviors. T his could have included diaries, appointment calendars, pamphlets, brochures, and any other mate rials that represent the individual's learning and negotiation of health issues. However, none of the participants had any such information to share. Data Analysis Data analysis refers to making meaning of what peo ple have told of their experiences. According to Merriam (1998), data analysis is a com plex process that \"involves moving back and forth between concrete bits of data and abstrac t concepts, between inductive and deductive reasoning, between description and interpretation\" (p. 178). This process occurs throughout the course of the research. Although there are a numbe r of strategies for analyzing qualitative data, the constant comparative method developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967) served as the primary analysis method in this research study. Maykut and Morehouse (1994) note that the four main steps of this form of analysis are: 1) inductive ca tegory coding and simultaneous comparing of units of meaning across categories, 2) refinement o f categories, 3) exploration of relationships and patterns across categories, and 4) integration of data yielding an understanding of the people and setting being studied. 55 This analysis began simultaneously with the data c ollection process. Analysis started after the first interview, and each following inter view was informed by the previous conversation. Each transcript was scrutinized in t urn line by line, sorting out the units of meaning deemed relevant to the research questions, and then coded by topic, participant's pseudonym, and line number. As I read each intervi ew, I identified significant words and phrases in the participant's own words. For example , when discussing illness, the first interviewee repeatedly used phrases such as \"family involvement\" and \"valuing traditional medicine.\" Comparing subsequent transcripts I looke d to see if the same or similar phrases occurred, while continuing to look for new terms. \"Skepticism\" and \"personal relationships\" appeared in later interviews, and therefore I retur ned to early interviews to see if I had overlooked those concepts, or similar ones, in the preliminary stages of data analysis. Once all the data had been reviewed, findings were aligned w ith possible properties of each category, and then the categories were reduced into a smaller num ber of conceptual themes and recorded. One example of this analysis was when I examined m y first research question: How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-re lated issues? Besides formal classes suggested by a healthcare professional, participant s described activities such as conversing with friends and family, reading magazines, browsing the Internet, and even watching TV. These examples were compiled and based on the forms of le arning discussed I assigned the category of informal learning. Validity and Reliability Reliability and validity are indicators that are u sed to determine the trustworthiness of research. Reliability refers to the degree to whic h the results are consistent with the data collected (Bogdan & Biklen, 2003) or the extent to which a researcher's findings can be 56 replicated. However, since human behavior is not s tatic and there are many interpretations of a particular phenomenon, it is almost impossible to r epeat a study in order to establish reliability in the traditional sense. Lincoln and Guba (1985) sug gest thinking about the dependability or consistency of the results obtained from the data r ather than demanding identical outcomes from other researchers. Similarly, Merriam (1998) recom mends using techniques such as specifying the investigator's position, triangulating data col lection, and using an audit trail to ensure the dependability of the results. Validity is composed of both external and internal validity. Internal validity refers to whether research findings are congruent with realit y (Merriam & Simpson, 2000). However, within qualitative research, reality is multidimens ional and ever-changing. For this reason, the researcher needs to demonstrate that he or she accu rately and adequately represents informants' constructions of their views and experiences (Merri am & Associates, 2002). Various strategies have been developed to improve internal validity, i ncluding triangulation, member checks, peer examinations, and clarifying the researcher's assum ptions (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 2002). The use of triangulation can strengthen a s tudy by combining methods, using several kinds of methods or data, or including both quantit ative and qualitative approaches (Patton, 2002). External validity or generalizability refers to th e extent that the findings of one study can be applied to other situations. Since qualitative studies use purposely small selected samples, it is impossible to generalize these results to the la rger population. Instead, Merriam (1998) suggests using reader or user generalizability, in which \"readers themselves determine the context to which findings from a study can be appli ed to their context\" (p. 29). For this reason, external validity focuses on the transferability of the findings to other studies. The reader or user 57 of the information determines the generalizability of the information presented. I do not speculate how findings apply to others, but instead allow the reader to determine the applicability of the information. To accomplish this, I used as much thick description as possible, rich with detail, resulting in an audit trail that provides r eaders with a way to understand how I reached my findings. By doing so, I hope readers wi ll be able to determine for themselves if the information in the study is relev ant in their own lives. I implemented a number of strategies into my resea rch project to help ensure both reliability and validity. I utilized member-checks to enhance my findings. Member checking involved taking emerging or tentative findings back to a number of participants for their assessment. This was accomplished through e-mails t o participants. I sent emerging findings to all participants and received replies from three. R eactions were positive and responses indicated surprise, with comments like this one in reply to t he importance of context, \"Wow I didn't think of it that way, but you're right!\" I also used pee r examination, utilizing colleagues in a dissertation-writing group to comment on the plausi bility of the findings. Reliability in quantitative work makes certain that study findings can be replicated, but in qualitative inquiry, reality is constantly in a sta te of change, making it difficult to ensure reliability. Merriam and Simpson (2000) that reliab ility asks if the \"results are consistent with the data collected\" (p. 102). Reliability provides cons istency and dependability to a study, and in this study, three strategies were employed: peer review, an audit trail, and a statement of my subjectivity. The first strategy, peer review has a lready been described. An audit trail will give readers of this study a description of how I arrive d at the findings. This means that I provided detailed documentation of the data collection proce ss, reporting of my decision making processes, and an explanation of the steps used in the data analysis. Finally, reliability will be 58 strengthened through an explanation of my subjectiv ities, including my assumptions and biases about the research. This informed readers about how I approached the undertaking of this study. Assumptions and Biases My own opinions and biases affect many, if not all, components of the research process. It is critical to \"develop an understanding of how our positions shape the research topics we choose and the methods we use to study the social w orld\" (Esterberg, 2002, p. 12). Thus, I can work to minimize this occurrence by recognizing my limitations up front. First, it is important to have a clear understandi ng of what one considers accurate and valid data. I firmly believe that meaning is const ructed from experiences. This perspective affects my entire research process, from the type o f questions that I explore to the methodology that I choose to implement, and thus it is imperati ve that I am cognizant of these implications, as they will not only shape the research design, but a lso the information that I will find. Although I believe that analyzing the experiences of individua ls yields unique and valuable data, I am also aware that this approach has its limitations and re cognize the need for alternate viewpoints. Second, it is critical to note my connection to th e population that I am studying. I too am Indian and thus have a vested interest recording th e experiences of this group and increasing their representation in the research literature. H owever, although I am Indian, I was born and raised in the United States, and this upbringing af fords me some differing viewpoints from first- generation Indians. Though this allows me the oppo rtunity to be both an insider as well as an outsider, it also produces a slight challenge in ga ining the trust and confidence of the participants. With this study, the fact that I was an outsider, being born and raised in the United States, altered the way in which my participants pr ovided certain information. During the interviews, it was apparent that individuals felt t hey needed to elaborate or clarify certain issues 59 because I have not lived in India. There was an un derlying assumption, sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect, that I was not aware of specif ic customs, and/or rituals. This belief prompted participants to provide additional details and explanations that they would not have offered to other individuals who immigrated to this country from India. Class and gender also impacted this study, both in sample selection and in interactions between myself and the participants. Since I used snowball sampling to locate participants, my own class shaped the demographics of the individual s that participated in my study. My family, along with their circle of friends, are mostly uppe r middle-class and highly educated. Because I utilized this network to recruit individuals for my study, all of my participants were also well educated. My status affected the people that I rea ched during recruitment and thus impacted the make-up of my sample. Additionally, my gender infl uenced how participants, especially men, responded and interacted with me. I was often view ed as a daughter, and this helped to build confidence and improve rapport between myself and t he participant. Individuals often shared stories about their own daughter(s) and as they hel ped me with my research they were reminded of how their own family and friends aided their chi ldren in times of need. Finally, it is essential to highlight my own biase s about medical practices. Growing up in a family of doctors, I have always been surrounded by Westernized medicine and its practices. Although I have been exposed to some Eastern approa ches on my trips to India, I have never been a strong follower of these types of alternate medicine. Additionally, my upbringing has always strongly emphasized preventive medicine, a c oncept still quite foreign in India and for many first-generation Indians living in the United States. With this research it is vital that I suspend these beliefs to more clearly understand th e role that culture plays in the health behaviors of my participants. 60 Chapter Summary This chapter presented the methodological process and related techniques that will be used to explore how cultural values shape the healt h behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. The research design, sample selection, data collect ion, and data analysis of the research process were described. A qualitative research design was used and in-depth interviews were the primary method of data collection. Eleven Asian In dian immigrants who are 60 years of age or older and are not affiliated with a health professi on, were purposefully sampled as research participants. The constant comparative method was used to analyze the data in order to determine common categories, themes, and patterns a cross the research sample. In order to enhance reliability and validity, member checks, pe er review, and an audit trail will be used in order to increase the trustworthiness of this study . 61 CHAPTER 4 FINDINGS The focus of this qualitative study was to underst and how cultural values shape the way older Asian Indian immigrants in the United States learn about health-related behaviors. Three questions guided this research: 1) How do older Asi an Indian immigrants learn about health- related issues? 2) In what ways does culture and he ritage affect this population's health behaviors? and 3) How do older Asian Indian immigra nts mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? This chapter begins with an overview of the eleven participants who comprised the sample. Second, the findings will be discussed in terms of each research question, with supporting data from the interviews provided as evi dence. Participants As stated in Chapter Three, individuals for this s tudy were chosen based on snowball sampling. Furthermore, participation was based on the following criteria: (1) 60 years of age or older and (2) they or their immediate family (spous e, children, or siblings) must not be a nurse or physician. Originally I had hoped to find individu als that had come to the U.S. at the age of 40 or older. But after recruiting for three months an d finding only one person who met all three criteria, I chose to omit this qualification, as th e other two conditions were non-negotiable. As illustrated in Table 1, the sample consisted of 8 m ales and 3 females, with ages ranging from 60 to 70 years old. 62 Table 1 - Participant Information Name Gender Age Years in US Region of India Health Status Deepak M 65 35 North Healthy Raj M 64 37 South Cancer; in remission Babu M 70 39 South Healthy Suresh M 65 25 South Diabetes Hanuman M 65 36 North Diabetes Leela F 60 41 South Healthy Balram M 64 32 North Healthy Anita F 67 38 South Healthy Bansi M 60 33 South Diabetes Jai M 70 41 South Healthy Nirali F 67 2 South Healthy All participants had at least a Bachelor's degree, with about half completing their education in India and the others coming to the United States fo r higher education. In addition, the participants represented various regions of India. Although these individuals have been in the United States for an extended period of time, all o f them came to the U.S. during adulthood. 63 Deepak Deepak is a 65 year old man who is from a large cit y in the northern part of India. He has been in the United States for 35 years and currentl y lives in the Southeast with his wife, where they own and run a small business. While he often mentions that he was not heavily exposed to English in India, his many years in the United Stat es and serving customers has helped him to become more confident, comfortable, and fluent in t he language. He has a son and a daughter who both live close by. We met at my home for the interview, which was conducted after we shared tea and a small snack. Deepak, a tall gentl eman with a mustache and graying temples passionately shared his experiences with being ill, seeking healthcare in the United States, as well as the differences he sees between treatment i n the U.S. and in India. Raj Raj is a 64 year old South Indian gentleman from a small village in Southern India. The pursuit of education brought him to the U.S., where he obtained his Masters degree from a university in Southwest. He has been residing in t he United States for 37 years, living most of that time in the Southeast, where he works as an en gineer for a large electrical company. He has a wife, who is also working, and two daughters. On e daughter is pursuing a Masters degree while the other is living and working in a nearby s tate. Raj, a tall man with gray hair that is beginning to bald, invited me over to his home for the interview. Upon meeting it was evident that he was physically fit for his age and it would be difficult to know that he was in remission from cancer. Soft spoken and gentle, he shared wit h me his ordeal with this disease, along with the physical and emotional struggles that accompany treatment. Babu 64 Babu came to the United States from a region in Sou th India 39 years ago to pursue a post-doctoral fellowship in New England, which led to a research position with a large institute in Alabama, where he has spent most of his adult li fe. Now in retirement at the age of 70, he enjoys spending time with his wife, children, and g randchildren, as well as attending festivals and celebrations with other members of a local Asia n Indian organization. Although he is 70 years of age, Babu's passion for fitness and good h ealth is evident in not only his outward appearance, but in his mental and spiritual well-be ing as well. During these golden years he spoke with me about the strategies he uses to not o nly maintain physical fitness, but also about the importance of keeping his mind active. Suresh Suresh, a 65 a year old man, came to the United Sta tes from a city near Chennai 25 years ago to pursue his career. Now in retirement, he li ves in the Southeast with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, and 2 grandchildren. A dark-skinn ed, plump, bald man with minimal gray hair at his temples and a welcoming smile, spoke with me about his trips to India and his continual struggle with diabetes. In his spare time he enjoy s tinkering with electronic gadgets, perusing the Internet, and visits the local temple on a week ly basis with his family. Hanuman Hanuman and his wife run a wholesale retail busines s in a large metropolitan city in the Southeast. Although he obtained a law degree in In dia, he came to the United States seeking a better life for himself and his family. He has two daughters, one who has completed her doctorate, and another who is in graduate school. Now at the age of 65, after being in this country for 36 years and running a successful busin ess, he is looking forward to retirement once his youngest daughter is finished with school. Eve n with his busy schedule, Hanuman invited 65 me to his business to show me around and speak with me. A jovial, mild mannered man, he eagerly shared with me his health concerns, his fea r(s) of what the doctor would find, as well as his desire to live near his children after retireme nt. Leela Leela, a 60 year old lab technician, lives in the S outhwest and has been in the United States since she was 19 years old, coming to this c ountry immediately after she was married to follow her husband as he pursued his doctorate. An extremely outgoing and friendly woman, she invited me to her home for lunch. Although she has been living in the U.S. for many years, she still visits India frequently and her home is accen ted with art and d\u00e9cor that reflects Indian culture. When I arrived, she was wearing a black s ari with pastel flowers, her mangalsutra (a necklace worn by married Indian women) and was in t he middle of cooking a traditional South Indian meal. She shared with me photos of her tw o daughters, one who recently got married in India, as well as her desire to retire in the next couple of years and go to India for an extended period to spend time with her family. She spoke pa ssionately about her experiences with the doctors in the United States and in India, as well as her thoughts on homeopathic and ayurvedic medicine. Balram Balram came to the United States 32 years ago from India to have more career opportunities. Once an engineer at a large company in the Southeast, he is now retired and offers his consulting services to various clients. A deep ly religious man, we met before his weekly commitment to the temple. He was wearing coral bea ds around his neck, which are used during ritual ceremonies and bhajans (sacred songs and cha nts sung during religious ceremonies). In his retirement he stays busy by having a leadership rol e at the temple, as well as actively 66 participating in other events within the Indian com munity, where he is able to enjoy the company of others. Anita 38 years ago Anita came to the United States to fo llow her husband as he pursued higher education. Now at the age of 67, after working man y years at a large research institute in the Southeast and raising 2 children, she is enjoying h er retirement by finding time to relax. A friendly soft-spoken woman, she invited me over to her home one weekend for the interview. Her attire, sweatpants, a t-shirt, and her hair pin ned back in a ponytail, was reminiscent of her carefree spirit. She spoke with me about her reluc tance to take medication and how she still uses a number of homemade therapies that she learned fro m her family in India. Additionally, she emphasized her desire to stay active even during re tirement, in order to keep her body, as well as her mind, healthy. In addition to exercising with her husband, she also enjoys cooking, gardening, and finally having the time for leisure reading. Bansi Bansi came to the United States over 30 years ago to obtain his doctorate. He now lives in the Southwest where he works as a researcher. A shy and soft spoken gentlemen, Bansi agreed to speak with me after another interview par ticipant called and asked him to come over. A tall, slender man with gray hair and a thin gray mustache arrived about one hour later wearing khaki dress slacks, a button down shirt, and a vest . Although quiet, he greeted me with a smile and shared his experiences with the doctor, how he learned about diabetes, as well as how he manages this chronic illness. Jai 67 When meeting Jai, it was evident that he was a pro ud and confident man. Tall and slender it was clear that he was physically active and it would be difficult to tell that he was 70 years old. When I first arrived at his home, Jai h ad just returned from his weekly visit to the temple. He was dressed in traditional Indian cloth ing, and had a bhindi on his forehead. Once he had changed clothing we had lunch before startin g the interview. During the conversation it was clear that Jai was an intellectual man who prid ed himself on all of his accomplishments. He spoke of his commitment to exercising, mentioning t hat he and his dog walk several miles every day. He used to work at a large laboratory near hi s home, and he would bike to work each day. Now in retirement he enjoys the company of his frie nds as well as staying active in the temple, which helps to keep his mind, body, and spirit heal thy. Nirali This 67 year old woman has been living in the Sout hwest for two years. She and her husband used to visit their two daughters frequentl y and when he passed away suddenly, her daughters encouraged her to apply for a green card so that she could stay with them on a more permanent basis. She now spends most of her time i n the United States visiting both of her children, and returning to India for a couple of mo nths each year. When I went to meet Nirali at her daughter's home, she was drinking a cup of tea and watching her two grandchildren. Her hair was black, with streaks of silver, and was hel d up in a bun. She was wearing a maroon Punjabi dress, had a gold chain around her neck, an d a red bhindi on her forehead. She had an extremely pleasant demeanor and spoke English with great comfort and fluency. Speaking softly, she told me about how her husband passed aw ay several years while they were visiting the U.S., her experience with paramedics, physician s, and the emergency room, as well as how she has coped with this great loss. 68 Findings Findings are presented based on each of the three research questions guiding this study. As illustrated by Table 2, the participants utilize d five main resources when learning about health issues: healthcare professionals, immediate family, media, the Internet, and the Indian community. Table 2 - Overview of Findings Research Question Findings 1. How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-related issues? Healthcare Professional Immediate Family Media Internet Indian Community 2. In what ways do culture and heritage affect old er Asian Indian immigrants' health behaviors? Personal Relationship with Physician High Level of Family Involvement Valuing Alternative Medicine 3. How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? Experiment with both systems Adopt a skeptical approach to Western medicine The second set of findings relate to the cultural v alues that shape these immigrants health-related behaviors. These include having a personal relatio nship with their physician, a high level of family involvement in the healthcare process, and t he consideration of alternative medicines 69 when they are ill. The last set of findings explor es how these participants mediate between Western and Eastern treatments of medicine. This p rocess includes experimentation with both systems as well as adopting a skeptical approach to Western medicine. Learning Resources for older Asian Indian immigrant s When considering how older Asian Indian immigrants in the United States learn about health issues, the participants mentioned their hea lthcare professional as well as their immediate family. In addition to these individuals, they als o make use of the media and the Internet. Finally, these immigrants also rely on the Indian c ommunity for information on health topics. Healthcare Professional All of the participants mentioned that they rely o n their healthcare professional for accurate and pertinent health information, whether it is for a referral or knowledge about a treatment option that they are proposing. For exam ple, when asked about how he checks and maintains his diabetes, Suresh shared, \" The doctor gave me a little gadget which, you know, prick yourself and then read and give you all those things. In fact he pushed me into that habit.\" Similarly, Bansi notes, \"she [the doctor] recommended some class that they gave me materials about diabetes and various medications.\" Both of these individuals not only looked to their physician for guidance, but also trusted that they were providing the best advice possible. This trust in authority is one of the reasons that the healthcare professional is a main source of information for Asian Indians. These ind ividuals believe that their doctor has their best interest in mind, which is echoed by Hanuman, \"So i f the doctor suggests something, I just follow him because he is my doctor and he is going to take care of me.\" This form of confidence can also be expressed as faith, which is how Balram described his experience, \"So it was a mixture of hope, faith, and main thing is really fa ith was the main part you know...in doctor's 70 competence.\" All the participants not only believe d in their physician's expertise but also relied on this knowledge during the decision making proces s. For example, Anita recalled how she changed her exercise habits after a consultation wi th her physician: But, and I think this uh exercises in the weight be aring exercises in the gym is better because my doctor you know OBGYN had suggested that you know I start doing weight bearing exercises to improve the bone density and a ll that. He said, you know, the older you are the better it is to do weight bearing exerc ises. So that's how I started the exercises in the gym. It also became clear that these participants not on ly viewed their healthcare professional as an expert, but also relied on them for reminders about exams and check ups. For instance, Suresh notes, \"So I go to him every time and he tel ls me when I need to do what and all those things.\" Leela shared a similar experience: \"my do ctor she has a record she usually reminds me you know 'you're do for a physical why don't you ma ke an appointment?' Often times she makes it herself on the computer,\" emphasizing that this type of service was critical in helping her maintain her health. This reliance on the healthcare professional was ev en more evident in those individuals who were faced with a serious illness. For instanc e, when Raj was diagnosed with cancer, his doctor was his primary source of information, espec ially regarding his options: Once it [the test] came positive then he gave me a book to read with all the options. And I talked to my doctor basically that's what you nee d. Plus, he gave me couple of people patients' name, addresses, and their telephone numb ers so I could invite them for lunch then sit down and go through their experience after and uh so I had lot of uh information. 71 This example illustrates how Raj's physician not on ly provided medical guidance, but also pushed him to find social support not only from fam ily, but also from others who have had similar experiences. Balram also mentioned that hi s belief in his doctors' abilities, as well their knowledge about specific procedures helped to ease his discomfort about undergoing surgery: And then I had Indian doctors that uh, they were no t experts in that area, but they are general doctor they generally know what do they do in a back surgery herniated disk, why it happens and what not, the statistics about t he surgery, the success rate, what can go wrong and so on. These physicians were able to provide Balram with i nformation and guidance that increased his confidence in their suggestions for treatment. Although these participants regard their healthcar e professional as an expert, this did not always signify blind obedience. A couple of partic ipants mentioned that there were times when they questioned their doctor's advice and did not f ollow through for various reasons. Hanuman shared one such story: \"The doctor recommended that I should go and take a stress test, which I have been avoiding. He has been telling me for the last five years probably, but I have not gone for a stress test.\" While he has confidence in his physician, Hanuman is reluctant to have the procedure because he is afraid of what the test wil l uncover. \"I am avoiding because I know if I go I will have some blockage and doctors will be 'O h, we need surgery right away' and I am trying to avoid it.\" Fear of further testing, or e ven surgery, has caused Hanuman to disregard his doctor's request. In a similar fashion, Raj chose an alternate path t han the one recommended by his physician when he was being treated for cancer. \"A nd as matter of fact, he [Raj's doctor] recommended me to go with laparoscopic surgery\" he shared, \"but at that time I did not feel they 72 had enough data.\" So, even though his healthcare p rofessional suggested one form of treatment, Raj's own knowledge and research on the topic made him select an alternate option. Both of these examples illustrate that while these particip ants trust their physician, this faith does not always transform into adherence and/or compliance. Immediate Family The second resource that these participants utiliz ed for health information was their immediate family, leaning on their spouse, children , and siblings when in need. First and foremost, these individuals depend on their family when seeking physician referrals. For example, Deepak shares, Oh, in India we didn't know who to go to, but she [ his wife] went there and her brother knows lot of people. So one of his friends, a busin ess man, and he wrote him [and] said take care of my sister. So he knew a doctor. Even here in the United States, Asian Indians rely on their family for information about physicians. Suresh shared a story of a time when h e was not receiving proper treatment and his daughter stepped in: \"After that, I think couple of days later I was not feeling better, I was not getting the right treatment so then my daughter sug gested this other doctor that was in uh the Alcoa area.\" Being new to the United States, it was evident that Nirali relied more heavily on her family than the other participants for information and guidance. For instance, she relied completely on her daughter to find a physician when she was having a medical problem. She states, \"I don't know how she found out, she found out through friends so through them she found out and then so we have taken appointment and then we went.\" She also mentioned that she often turned to her family for information whil e her husband was suffering with Parkinson's 73 disease. She remarked that after returning from th e doctor's office, \"I used to pester my sister and my brother to tell more\" and \"I used to ask my nephew, I used to ask him to get some books\" to help her better understand the illness that was affecting her husband. Participants also revealed that spouses were not o nly a source of information, but also provided encouragement to practice good health habi ts. This was especially true for the women in this study. For example, Anita mentioned that i n addition to teaching her specific exercises, her husband \"is very particular about exercise so t hat is how I started doing exercise every day. He is very knowledgeable in all these exercises. S o he actually introduced me to all that.\" Similarly, Leela notes, \"My husband pushes me to it ...he says I'll go walking with you, he's an exercise fanatic he does not even miss a day of exe rcise.\" Nirali also mentioned that she and her husband would \"go walking together\" and encouraged each other to stay active. It was only after he passed away that she turned to her children for assistance. These women viewed their spouse not only as a partner, but also relied on them for knowledge as well as support. In contrast, the male participants depended increa singly on their children and/or siblings when confronted with a health issue. For instance, Deepak notes that after experiencing heart problems, his daughter taught him to be more carefu l about the food he ate: \"I never knew those labels, you know, Avani [his daughter] told me you have to see saturated fat, this and that. And now I'm always reading labels.\" Likewise, Suresh r elied on his children when he was not feeling well. \"My son helped me to go to the hospi tal,\" he explained, \"he was with me going to the doctor's office and at the doctor's office the decision was made to get into the hospital.\" Others looked to their siblings for guidance and as sistance. For example, Hanuman, who struggles with diabetes, comments that his sister i s continually sharing information with him: 74 My sister who lives in New Haven she is very much i nvolved in vitamins, so she always, if I call her she gives me two hour lectures on the phone that I should do this, and not do this, and I should take this vitamin every day, and all that. Bansi is also afflicted with diabetes and suffered for many years before being properly diagnosed. \"My brother told me I should have him t o recommend me to a diabetic specialist,\" he shared, emphasizing that his brother's comments enc ouraged him to seek out another healthcare professional to properly treat his condition. For the male participants, both siblings as well as children were integral sources of knowledge. Although family involvement was often regarded in a positive light, some participants also indicated guidance from spouses, siblings, and /or other family members can be difficult at times. Raj spoke of an instance when his grandmoth er was determined to treat his illness in a particular way. \"All the treatment I had was some herbs and a strict diet.\" While he understands that this form of treatment is preferred among some Indians, he noted the difficulty he had in relying solely on this type of treatment. \"\"I was very lucky I recovered,\" he shared, \"it took me about two months to recover.\" Leela also expressed a negative aspect of family i nvolvement. While she appreciates their concern and support, she stated, \"Everyone ha s their own perspective, they want to help and they each have their own viewpoint. Sometimes it c an be overwhelming.\" With so many people involved, the treatment process can become a burden . For example, Leela noted that her family is constantly questioning her about her medication: \"They keep uh sending me emails [asking] are you taking your medication, you know? And all of my sisters, when I call [they say] 'are you taking the medication? Don't neglect to take the m edication.'\" While these reminders can be useful, at times Leela finds them slightly distract ing and intrusive. 75 Media The media, such as television, radio, and popular m agazines, was also used by these individuals to learn about varying health topics. For instance, when asked how he learned about free local prostate screenings, Deepak shared, \"The y were advertising on the radio and local newspaper and so I said let's go.\" Similarly, Balr am shared this story to illustrate why he began yearly exams: But after I saw this one [a magazine article] I sai d boy, then reading lot of articles it says after certain years of age you should be going for this one regularly, after this age you should be doing this one and it was common knowledg e after 50 years you should be more uh paying attention to what you do, your exerc ising, your uh health. Numerous participants mentioned that they utilize t he media to stay updated on current health issues. Babu notes, \"Well I read uh you know healt h uh magazines and that kind of thing. Popular articles, and newspaper.\" Information seen through the media also drives thes e individuals to learn more about various health topics. For example, Deepak shares this story: But then I found out, uh, I was listening to news a nd one of these guys was talking about Bush and he [asked] how good health is Bush in? An d he said Bush is in good health, every morning he exercises and he brings his heartb eat up to so much and everything. After hearing this clip, Deepak began to wonder abo ut the connection between exercise and one's heartbeat and he sought out additional inform ation: And I was wondering there is something about this, and I was reading in there and I found out that just half an hour exercise, I mean y ou walk fine, exercise fine, but you 76 have to bring your heartbeat up to certain level. A nd then I talked to my friend, how you figure out and then he told me 220 minus your age, that's your heartbeat. This story illustrates how the media was an instiga tor for Deepak to learn more about a specific issue that was important to his health and well-bei ng. Bansi also shared an instance where the media sparked his curiosity. When discussing how h e learns about different exercises, Bansi noted, \"I saw it on TV, like a PBS show had some on yoga and I saw them and tried it while watching the TV and I got a book from the library.\" The media was a vehicle for learning by introducing new concepts, thus encouraging these pa rticipants to seek out additional information. Magazines and other reading material were a partic ularly important resource for the women in this study. Articles, whether in popular magazines or research journals, helped these women to learn more about a particular issue, as we ll as introduce them to new issues. For example, when asked how she learns about health top ics Anita shared, \"I uh I read these uh you know health magazines you know every month they sen d some articles about health.\" Both Nirali and Leela mentioned that they use reading ma terial to help them better understand medical conditions. When Leela was diagnosed with a proble m, she went to the library and \"read everything I could find in books and magazines\" to better comprehend her condition, its symptoms, as well as available treatments. In a si milar fashion, Nirali noted \"I'm interested to, even when my daughters uh get some problem also, I used to read [about] those things.\" From their stories it was evident that all of these wome n preferred written material over other forms of media when seeking health information. Internet 77 All of the men in this study used the Internet in some way to learn about varying health issues. Some mentioned its use in passing, simply noting that it was yet another information source. For instance, Babu mentioned: You can go to Internet and you can find out lot of things. On a regular basis I go on the Internet and read what is happening you know, espec ially if it is related to cholesterol and you know that kind of thing. However, others utilized this technology for specif ic purposes. Jai made use of the World Wide Web to learn more about a recommended physician whe n he was in need of surgery. He notes, \"When we found out this guy's name, and we went to the internet and found out his qualifications and what in all on him.\" In addition to searching for doctors, these indivi duals also used the Internet to learn about particular diseases. For example, Raj revealed how the Internet helped him while he was struggling with cancer: I went to the Internet. There are so many, with th e Internet there is so much information. You can go to the American Cancer Society and go to the websites and read the experiences of lot of other people. So you can read lot of information. For Deepak the information on the Internet encourag ed him to seek medical attention for a problem that he had been ignoring: I go and ask for prostate cancer symptoms and every thing and I read that and this is me, this is me, this is me, I knew that. But yeah I st arted because you go on computer and check it online. So everyday I learn. Suresh shared that he uses the Internet to help him learn how to maintain his diabetes. He notes, \"There is so many medical websites that talks about uh diabetic foundations, there are so many 78 websites I don't remember specific particular name. \" Overall, the Internet serves as a major learning tool for these immigrants. Balram and Ban si both expressed that the Internet was a resource that they utilized to learn more about iss ues of interest and/or personal consequence. \"If there is a need, if I say I want to know about this one because it is close to me or whatever, then I will try [going on the Internet],\" shared Balram, n oting that while he does not surf the Internet regularly, it still serves as a source of informati on in times of need. Bansi sums this up by stating, \"I used the internet to learn about other things like, even though I don't have these problems, heart attack, heart disease, I just want to learn about them, so I went to the Internet and read about it.\" The women in this study were less likely to utiliz e the Internet as a source of information. And even when they did use this technology, it was with someone else, generally their spouse. For instance, Anita shared \"We [my husband and I] l ook up on the Internet um just you know stay up to date on the issues of older people.\" Li kewise, Leela expressed that she and her husband used the Internet to find out about physici ans specializing in her illness: \"Uh we were looking on the Internet to find information and the n her name came up as the, you know, she's really the pioneer in the research.\" For both of t hese women, using the Internet was a joint activity, once again emphasizing the support that t heir spouse provides. In contrast, Nirali did not mention the Internet a t all when asked about how she learns about health issues. This could be due to a variet y of reasons, one of which can be attributed to the short amount of time she has been in the United States. \"In India, we did not have a computer in our flat,\" remarked Nirali, indicating that this technology was not readily available as it is for the other participants who have been i n this country for an extended period of time. Although she has been living in the United States f or the past couple of years, the Internet is still 79 not a primary source of information for Nirali, as she is not accustomed to having access to this resource. Indian Community The Indian community is another key source of info rmation for these individuals. While this can include the immediate family, it is much b roader and often includes a large circle of friends who serve as a family away from home. Alth ough these individuals turn to immediate family first, they also depend on their friends in times of need. Hanuman shared the following story that illustrates this point: Then I had some chest pain and I was not for sure i f it was anything serious or what, so I called my friend, and asked him to bring some medic ine, for some maybe some gas problem, and so I asked him to bring some medicine for me, so he was to bring that, but his son said \"no, no...we should not take a chance... w e should just call 911 and take him to hospital and let hospital check him out thorough ly\". So he says no, we are coming there and we have already called 911, the ambulance is coming there, you get ready and we are going to take you to hospital. Hanuman not only relied on his friend for help, but trusted in his opinion to go to the hospital. For these immigrants, their circle of friends becom es their extended family and just as important as their spouse, children, and/or siblings. All of the participants utilized this community for various reasons. For example, this network was used when these individuals were attemp ting to locate a physician, whether because of relocation or because they were experiencing a h ealth problem. Raj shares: 80 Internist, ok, first I had an Indian friend here, s o he had a friend, an Internist, I used him. Than I wanted some Internist who is affiliated with St. Valley hospital. So I asked him, you know, give me somebody who practicing at St. Va lley. Deepak and his wife also had a similar experience w hen they moved to the Southeast: We ask someone, we asked one of our friends when we came to Dougherty and they say ok she's a good doctor. And we went there and aunt y [his wife] talk and then oh yeah we know this, this, this. But that is how we found out , ask friend. Likewise, Jai asked his friends for referrals when he was in need of a surgeon. He notes, \"So my friend had his internship at Kaiser so he knows peo ple and he inquired and they told him that this surgeon is good, he is young and good, and so I too k him.\" A number of participants also mentioned that they discuss health issues with their circle of friends. For instance, Anita shares, \"we will b e talking you know people our age will be talking about health matters and then we learn litt le bit from them also at parties or functions or when we visit friends and all that.\" Similarly, Ha numan notes: Yeah, a couple of friends that we talk about it, th e diet and all that and about what I should eat, what I should not eat, and all that. W hat they do, and I can learn about it from what they do. Through these types of discussions, these individua ls not only learn about specific topics, but they also encourage one another to practice good he alth habits. Balram shares one such example that pushed him to continue with his annual check-u p: Then you hear somebody had something you know you s tart talking about it and people say that's one of those things people should have c hecked it you know or you should be 81 checking it. So that brought more vigilance to tha t one and I said \"Boy I should be doing that religiously.\" So that just strengthens thought about it you should be doing that one. These conversations also include dialogue about spe cific illnesses. Leela voiced her experience of seeking advice from a friend who had suffered fr om her same condition: Yeah, there is one person, they live here [Californ ia] and he's in his um probably 70s and he developed the condition too and after a while it went away. So I was asking I don't know he had it all over his hands and eventually it went away and they said he took homeopathy medicine. Suresh also revealed how one of his friends provide d information when he was having difficulty with his diagnosis: And then I called uh one of my friends, Indian doct or, he was in Dugan and when I explained to him what happens he right away he figu red that it's malaria. So right away he said you have to come here to Dugan and then I k now that the American doctors are not familiar with that they could not right away te ll me what it was. The participants' network of friends is an integral source of knowledge, providing these individuals with valuable insight on various health issues. Since the community is close knit, it was noted that sometimes individuals come together and organize activities for large numbers of people. One such example was health fairs. \"And G ujarat Samaj used to they started, you know that kind of [health] fair. And Swaminarayan peopl e they wanted to establish something, their own dispensary hospital or something,\" shared Hanum an, stating that a couple of times a year these organizations come together to serve the enti re Asian Indian community in their local area. \"Before the health fair start, then they send all t he doctors that we have health fair and if you want to come tell us so we can make a booth for you or something. And they are always willing 82 to come to serve the community,\" stated Balram, exp ressing the spirit of volunteerism within the Asian Indian community. Since these fairs are comp letely organized and run by volunteer Asian Indian physicians, these immigrants are more comfor table seeking medical attention. Deepak shared the following: They are mostly good because usually we go Indian h ealth fair and all the doctors are Indian over there and they are specialists and you can freely talk to them and everything. They are really concerned you know. They want to d o it themselves, give something to the community. So that's why we know that they not just do lousy job. Otherwise they don't come. They don't have to come to the health fair. This notion of giving back to the community was ech oed by several participants and helped to gain their confidence as well as encourage them to seek preventative care. Nirali was the one exception, in that she did not express the same connection to the Indian community as the other participants. She ha s not yet developed the extended family like the others have described, and this could be due to the limited time she has been in the United States, having only arrived 2 years ago. Instead, she relied more heavily on her children for guidance, information, and support, as well as her family back in India. \"We talk almost every other day and discuss any problems we have,\" she sh ared, mentioning that she and her sisters are very close. \"My daughters help me with any medical issues I have, such as getting medicine or making appointments.\" Whereas the other participan ts have developed familial relations with other Asian Indians in this country, Nirali chooses to cling to her immediate family, whether here in the U.S. or in India. This section addressed the different resources tha t the participants used to learn about health matters. This included their healthcare pro fessional, immediate family, and friends. In 83 addition to this social capital, these individuals also utilized the media and the Internet to stay updated on their personal health concerns. Asian Indian Cultural Values Influencing Health Beh aviors The next portion of this chapter focuses on the se cond research question: In what ways does culture and heritage affect this population's health behaviors? These participants revealed that they desired a personal connection with their healthcare professional. When questioned about their doctor visits and treatment process, it was evident that there was a high level of family involvement and that each of these individua ls value alternative medicine and consider this form of treatment as an option when they are i ll. Personal Relationship with Physician Interview after interview, participants echoed the same sentiment: We desire a personal connection with our doctor. This need for cultivat ing a personal relationship with their healthcare professional originates from their exper ience(s) with medical treatment in India. For example, Deepak comments, \"doctor is part of our fa mily you know. We call them Uncle rather than doctor you know,\" when asked about his encount er with doctors in India. Similarly, Anita recalls the following, \"It was like, everybody knew that doctor, she lived in the neighborhood. We already knew her,\" noting the familiarity that i s already present among doctor and patient in India. Jai shared this story regarding his feeling s about the doctor-patient relationship: There [India] it is because he knows you from your childhood and it is just like a village doctor who knows everybody and everybody knows the doc and he knows everybody. But here, the experience is like, you go to the doc tor and the doctor does his duties and there is no personal rapport. 84 This longing for a personal connection is a drivin g factor when these individuals are selecting a physician. Some feel that an Indian do ctor is key to obtaining the desired treatment. Jai notes, \"I found an Indian origin doctor, and I said, \"I will go to that guy. And he was an extremely nice guy, and he was now his intellectual level as well as on a social.\" In relation to American doctors, Deepak states: And uh lot of time you see like American doctor or something we still don't feel like going, because see we feel like they going to ask q uestion, very formal, and we not used to be like that, we want to talk here and there. In contrast, he is much more comfortable with his I ndian physician: He's like friend, I just went last week, two weeks ago and uh for check up, Dr. Nag, and he's from same city. So I didn't know him before u ntil Dougherty County send him. I didn't know him personally, you know, we knew his n ame but then he was from same Ahmedabad, same town, and we talked about it. For these immigrants, there is a strong need to con nect, and having a doctor of Indian origin helps to break down the barrier of communication. In fact, nine out of the eleven participants have an Indian physician. In addition to favoring Asian Indian doctors, stil l others are willing to make sacrifices in order to find a personal connection with their heal thcare professional. For instance, Suresh noted that he drives over a 100 miles to see his physicia n. When asked why he chooses this commute, he shared the following: See him, I can talk to him a little closer and you know personal I can call anytime and he can call me. That way a little closer than some ou tside doctors I guess. That's why it's more a personal thing. Right, as a friend I feel m ore comfortable. 85 Leela is also willing to relinquish certain conveni ences in order to cultivate a relationship with her doctor: Even if I go there and I have to wait an hour I don 't mind because I know she [her doctor] takes the time with the patients you know. She's r eally nice. But she really sits there and make sure all my questions are answered and you hav e anything else. You know she takes her time which is good. These stories illustrate that forming a personal co nnection with their healthcare professional is a necessity for these immigrants and they are willing to do what is necessary to find a physician that is willing to provide this type of relationshi p. This desire to connect with the healthcare professi onal also influences communication between the doctor and patient. These participants not only wanted to feel comfortable asking questions, but they also wanted dialogue with their physician. For instance, Jai shared the following: And doctor being a young doctor, he was very cordia l and also he knows that I am highly educated, so the conversation between he and I were at a high level.... So it is not like he was telling me and I just accepted, or that I asked dumb questions, or anything like that... it was an intellectual conversation. Jai was emphasizing that by developing a relationsh ip with his physician he was able to not only voice his opinion, but also be a part of the decisi on making process. Raj also shared this sentiment. He noted, \"So, uh, we [he and his docto r] discuss pretty openly. Then decide what we want to do. He's uh, he don't impose. He gives the choice and discussion and uh then he will explain what's good and bad and why he's doing that .\" Just like Jai, Raj also appreciated having the opportunity to have an open dialogue with his p hysician and make decisions together. By 86 building a personal relationship, these immigrants felt greater rapport with their healthcare professional and thus had increased confidence in t he treatment process. High Level of Family Involvement In addition to cultivating a relationship with the ir doctor, these individuals also include their family in their medical decisions and treatme nt. This value is yet another one that originates from the participants' experiences in In dia. When sharing her story about her hospital stay, Anita commented, \"But you have a lot of suppo rt in India. That is the only difference I can think of.\" Here, Anita was referring to the extend ed family support that is available in India and absent for many of these immigrants in the United S tates. For this very reason Deepak's wife returned to India to have surgery: \"And uh she want ed to go over there, mother, her whole family. She's more comfortable with her mother and uh after surgery she needed some rest and she couldn't get it over here because nobody was he re.\" When visiting India, Nirali also looks to her family for guidance and support, relying on her brother and sisters when dealing with health matters. \"They take me there [the doctor's office] ,\" she says, \"especially for blood sugar I go, because my mother she had diabetes. So all of us, all my sisters, once at least we go for check- up.\" In this instance the whole family goes togeth er to monitor and maintain their health. Although this type of support is diminished in the U.S., these individuals still attempt to include their family in their treatment process. A number of these participants take a family member with them whenever they visit their doctor. For example, both Suresh and Hanuman note, \"Basically my wife was with me going to the d octor's office\" and \"Or sometimes my wife comes... but mostly we go together.\" In a similar fa shion, Jai commented, \"I went with my wife... because wife is also involved in this thing, so sh e has to know and it should be a joint 87 decision.\" While in the United States, Nirali reli es on her daughters for support. She shared a story detailing a time when she utilized her family to help her husband: I rang up to my daughter saying that you take appoi ntment for the evening so that we can take daddy there. Then my daughter and then my son -in-law consulted each other from their office only, but they said, \"No, when he's sa ying chest pain don't wait till evening. Why to take any chance like that so it is better uh I will go home my son-in-law said I will go home and then take him to any doctor that i s um near our place.\" Nirali trusted the judgment of her daughter and son -in-law in the treatment of her husband. In addition to this trust, older Asian Indian immigran ts often relinquish decision making to their family. Leela shared one such story: They don't tell you even if you're dying they won't tell you're dying. Basically they tell the family but they don't tell the patient per se. That kind of and then they leave it up to the family I think. Like one of my brothers-in-law he has um cancer in his intestine. So then but the kids never told my brother-in-law he h ad that, so you know he doesn't have to be on medication or anything and now he's able t o retain food and he thinks he's ok now. Well there is always that chance, why worry h im with that? This is another illustration of how these immigrant s not only look to their family, but often rely on these individuals to make critical decisions. Valuing Alternative Medicine When considering medical treatment, whether on the ir own or with their family, all of these participants mentioned that they have contemp lated the use of alternative medicine at one time or another. These individuals firmly believe that this form of medication has value for a variety of reasons. Family plays an integral role in this belief. For example, when questioned 88 about his interest in alternative medicines Deepak stated, \"Yeah, they believe, and now I believe too,\" noting that his family's confidence in this f orm of treatment influenced his decision to try this type of medication. Likewise, Balram's experi ences in India prompted him to continue alternative treatments in the United States: I mean because whatever was in India what they used to give us for medication uh you know if you have a cough they give you a little tur meric in the milk, they warm it up and give you in the evening. Yeah, I believe in those things. All the ayurvedic things, homeopathic, ayurvedic, anything like those home re medies you know? Others utilize their own understanding of the sys tem as reason enough to try alternative medical treatments. \"Ayurvedic is plant based and natural and they have been dispensing these ayurvedic medicines for, in their families, for so many gener ations, so the knowledge base is there,\" described Jai, explaining why he believed this medi cal system has value. In a similar fashion, Babu shares his thoughts: Yeah, it may have some uh active ingredients in the Ayurvedic medicine. But you know by and large if you take Ayurvedic medicine you kno w for most part what I believe it gives a lose motion you know, clean out the system. Here he notes the long term usefulness of this medi cine, which allows individuals to maintain a healthy body over time. Even those who have limited experience with Easter n treatment expressed their belief in this medical system. \"If I had started homeopathic medicine and it was controlling my health well, I would have continued that,\" shares Hanuman. Similarly Suresh mentioned: 89 So I guess if things didn't work for me I would go to the other ways [ayurvedic and/or homeopathy] to get better. I don't mind going to t he others if this didn't work then I have to try something else. Jai also shares this sentiment. \"If the Western me dicine says that is all we can do, and the other [Eastern medicine] says no, no, we have this, then I would go and try that,\" he says, adding that he would not \"discard that option\" simply because i t may not be his first choice. Each of these statements demonstrates that even though these immi grants may not currently be using Eastern medicine, its value is not mitigated and this form of treatment is still a consideration when they are confronted with an illness. Surprisingly, even though Nirali just recently cam e to the United States, she stated that she has \"never used Ayurveda or Homeopathy. This c ould be due to family influence. \"My brother and sisters are strong believers in allopat hy [Western medicine],\" shared Nirali, indicating that she often seeks their advice when s he is in need of medical treatment. This is another example of how family plays an integral rol e in the decision making process for these immigrants. However, although Nirali has not utili zed Eastern medicine for herself, she did mention that she tried it for her husband when he w as ill. \"Homeopathy, yes, I tried because this was not suiting him this dopamine medicines they we re not suiting him for a long time. Then I thought alternative medicine why can't we try?\" she stated, indicating that while her own personal experience with this system of medicine wa s limited, she still understood and recognized its value. This section explored three different cultural val ues that influence the health behaviors of these immigrants. First, all of these participants seek a personal relationship with their physician and are willing to make certain sacrifices to devel op this rapport. Second, in addition to this 90 personal connection, these individuals also desire a high level of family involvement in their medical treatment. And third, these immigrants val ue alternative medicine and believe in the benefits this system can provide when they are face d with an illness. Mediating between Eastern and Western Medical Appro aches This final segment focuses on the third research q uestion: How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern heal thcare approaches? Data analysis revealed two findings related to this research ques tion: 1) Individuals experiment with both Western and Eastern medicine and 2) these immigrant s adopt a skeptical attitude towards certain Western medical practices. Experimentation with Western and Eastern medicine Not only do these immigrants consider alternative medicine, but each of these participants had also used this form of treatment at one time or ano ther. When discussing their decision making process during treatment it was clear that these in dividuals experimented with both systems, resulting in varying patterns of use between Wester n and Eastern medicine. For example, some participants choose to start with alternative medic ine when they were experiencing a medical problem. Deepak shared the following: And I start taking, not over the counter but homeop athy or something like that. It was known for prostate, you eat that and it takes care of prostate. For this I forgot name but there is a special one for the prostate too. So I started taking that. I tried, instead of going to the doctor. Suresh also began with alternative treatment when h e was first diagnosed with diabetes. \"But my friends they used to um say some of the Indian h erbs and some of the seeds uh [in] vegetables would help to minimize diabetic effect. I used to eat that,\" he commented, noting that 91 he preferred to try this natural remedy rather than take medication. Anita shares this attitude. \"Yeah, I really don't like to take medications unle ss it is absolutely necessary,\" she said, explaining that she prefers to try other approaches if at all possible, especially if her illness is mild. She elaborates further: So if I catch the onslaught of cold or something I try that. I use natural remedy you know for if I have congestion cold or something I may br ew some kind of natural tea or something. I just brew myself. Make some kind of brew. Or for indigestion or something, I may use ginger or something like that. I learned about it from India . Her desire to avoid medication, along with her know ledge of alternative remedies, allows Anita to choose the route of treatment that seems most va luable to her. However, both Suresh and Anita commented that if they are not seeing improve ment, they alter their course of action. \"The herbs were not properly controlling my blood sugar so I switched to medication,\" shared Suresh. Similarly Anita noted \"If the brews don't work than I will try over-the-counter medicine or see the doctor.\" Although both of these participants p refer natural remedies, they are willing to use other forms of medicine in order to achieve effecti ve treatment. In contrast, others described situations where the y started with Western treatment and moved to alternative medicine in the hope of better results. Nirali shared one such story regarding her husband: This dopamine medicines they were not suiting him [her husband] for a long time. So when we told the doctor they said no that is the on ly medicine he has to continue he has to bear that. That's what they used to say. Then we thought why can't we go for homeopathy? 92 Finding relief for her husband was an instigator fo r Nirali to look into alternative forms of treatment. So, although the doctor felt that the d opamine medicine was the appropriate treatment, Nirali and her husband decided to try ho meopathy. \"So we tried those medicines, but no significant results. So it [homeopathy] was not troubling him much, but not much progress was there and so we went back to the dopamine medic ine.\" Leela spoke of a similar situation. She has been struggling with an illness for several years and after becoming discouraged with Western t reatments, as well as the physicians, she turned to alternative medicine. She even went to I ndia to visit with a doctor specializing in alternative remedies and is planning to return for follow-up: I'm going to India again in May so I'll go back to him [homeopathy doctor] and see what he thinks of it. So he's treating me, well I saw h im when I was there last year and then he's just sending me medication through the mail ev ery two months. Just as Nirali was looking to ease her husband's di scomfort, Leela also chose this course of action in hopes of finding a solution for her own p ersonal medical problem. Still others noted that they utilize both Western and Eastern treatments simultaneously, believing that the two forms of medicine complement each other. \"So I do that one whenever there is a need, use of lemon, ginger, things like that\" shared Balram. But when asked if he starts with these natural remedies he stated, \"No, no, no, it's not that I will try that first and then go to something. I will try that one along with other ov er the counter [medicines] what has worked for me.\" In a similar fashion, Deepak also noted that he has a particular medicine that he uses on a regular basis. \"So like if you have stomach proble m for long time then they give Herda ,\" which is an ayurvedic medicine that is even available her e in the United Sates. He continues, \"You can take Herda so many days and your stomach clears. So those ki nd of things I use. It is just long 93 term.\" With this last point Deepak expressed the n eed to take this medicine along with other over the counter treatments in order to achieve imm ediate symptomatic relief while he continues with the ayurvedic medication for long term mainten ance. Listening to these stories it became evident that w ith these participants there was no clearly defined pattern of mediation between Western and Ea stern medicine. Instead, the decision was based on each individual's experience, knowledge, a nd belief in each form of treatment. Skepticism with certain Western medical practices As these participants shared their experiences wit h deciding between Eastern and Western medicine, an underlying belief emerged. A number of these individuals expressed their uncertainty with particular medical practices here in the United States, not only when they first arrived in this country, but also today. For many of these immigrants, the notion of preventive medicine from an early age was a foreign concept. For example, Deepak stated, \"Only time you go to doctor for check up is if you have some probl em.\" Only recently, after being hospitalized, did he begin going to regular check-ups. Hanuman a lso had similar feelings, noting that he used to see a doctor \"only if I am sick, with cold, or s omething like that,\" beginning annual exams only a few years ago. This late adoption of preven tive care is due in part to skepticism, but is also due to a lack of understanding of Western medi cal practices. For instance, Deepak commented, \"At that time, it wasn't like, I didn't know, that actually it's nice to go, even if you're not feeling good, it's ok to go doctor and h ave physical check-up or something, it would be nice.\" In a similar fashion, Balram stated \"So I didn't go over there [the doctor], I didn't think of it,\" explaining that the idea of going for an annual exam did not occur to him until he became older and had a better appreciation for the value that these check-ups could provide. 94 Although all participants now visit their physicia n for routine check-ups, they still question some of the practices that they encounter. One major concern that was mentioned repeatedly was the idea of too much testing. \"When I came over here they say oh yeah go for this test, go for this test and that upset me,\" not ed Deepak, making him feel uncomfortable and reluctant to seek out medical attention. Both Raj and Jai noted this as a key difference between treatment in India versus the U.S. Raj shared this sentiment: And also in India they don't do all kinds of tests. But here everything they have to do the test, you know they do the blood test the urine tes t you know and then based on the test results and their knowledge then they decide. Similarly, Jai commented, \"So there it is they look at you and give you medication right away and this guy [in the U.S.] gets all these tests don e and then gives you the medicine.\" Suresh also remarked about the overuse of tests in the United S tates when questioned about the differences between his treatment in India. He states, \"I gues s they run uh tests more than necessary here, uh, that's how I feel. They run blood test I guess invariably for everything...they take the blood and test it.\" While all of these participants have adjusted to this practice, it was evident that thi s was, and continues to be, a major obstacle for them to overcome in order to feel comfortable with medical treatment in the U.S. Summary of Findings This chapter began with an overview of the study p articipants, their demographics, and a brief description to help identify with each indivi dual. The chapter then addressed each of the three research questions. The first question was: How do older Asian Indian immigrants learn about health-related issues? The data revealed fiv e main resources that these participants use to learn about health matters. They rely on their hea lthcare professional as well as immediate 95 family for guidance on locating a physician, unders tanding a particular condition, or other such issues. They also used the Internet as well as the media, which included TV news, radio programs, as well as magazines to learn about speci fic health behaviors. Often these sources would prompt these individuals to seek out addition al information. Finally, these participants utilized the Indian community, which is composed pr imarily of their circle of friends, to discuss health concerns and seek advice. The second question explored was: In what ways doe s culture and heritage affect this population's health behaviors? Findings indicated three key cultural values influenced these individuals' health habits. First, these immigrant s desire a personal relationship with their doctor and are willing to make sacrifices in order to achi eve this connection. Second, there is a high level of family involvement during the treatment pr ocess, and at times, these individuals even defer decision making to other members in their fam ily. And third, all of these immigrants value alternative medicine and have considered using this form of treatment at one time or another. The final question examined in this study was: How do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare appr oaches? The data supports the idea that these participants experiment with both systems, th us resulting in varying patters of use between Western and Eastern medicine. Some participants be gin with Eastern medicine while others move toward this alternative system once they have not had success with Western approaches. Then there are those who use both forms of medicine simultaneously, believing that each has its own value and benefit in the treatment process. Fi nally, as these participants shared their experiences, they articulated their uncertainty wit h particular Western medical practices, causing them to adopt a skeptical approach to treatment in the U.S. 96 CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS, DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, RECOMMENDATI ONS The purpose of this study was to explore how cultu ral values shape the health-related behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants in the U nited States. Three questions guided this research. First, how do older Asian Indian immigra nts learn about health-related issues? Second, in what ways does culture and heritage affe ct this population's health behaviors? And third, how do older Asian Indian immigrants mediate between Western and Eastern healthcare approaches? Eleven participants were interviewed f or this study. Sample selection was purposeful in order to find individuals who met spe cific criteria and represented various regions of India. Semi-structured interviews were conducte d lasting between one to two hours each. Follow-up contact by email and/or telephone elicite d additional information and clarification. The results of this study revealed five main resou rces these immigrants use to learn about health issues and three key cultural values that sh ape these individuals' health behaviors. Additionally, this study highlighted the decision m aking process these participants use when considering medical treatment. Conclusions and Discussion Findings from this study resulted in two main conc lusions. The first conclusion of this study is that Indian culture and heritage shape hea lthcare behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. The second conclusion is that informal learning is the primary way these immigrants learn about health. 97 Conclusion 1: Indian culture and heritage shape hea lthcare behaviors of older Asian Indian immigrants. The first conclusion of this study is that Asian I ndian cultural values influence these immigrants' healthcare behaviors. Culture and heri tage are interwoven, representing both the tangible and intangible attributes of a group or so ciety that are inherited from past generations, maintained in the present and bestowed for the bene fit of future generations (Banks & Banks, 1997). The term culture has many definitions, but at its heart is a shared meaning system that holds a community together and directs the way that they live, interact, and behave. It has been argued that values represent the core of culture, a re fundamental, and refer to the tendencies and preferences of a group of people (Hofstede, 1991). For this reason, this study focused on understanding specific cultural values that influen ce the behaviors of Asian Indian immigrants. Thus, this section explores the following values in particular: (1) Asian Indians are a collective community, (2) they honor a hierarchical system, (3 ) they value traditional systems of medicine, and (4) they seek a connection between the mind, bo dy, and spirit. First, Asian Indians are a collective community, va luing relationships with others over individual gain. In another study of Malaysian old er adult learners, Merriam and Mohamad (2000) note that among this population, familial an d communal relationships existing in harmony are valued above the individual. This is also true among the Asian Indian community, as these immigrants come together to not only maintain a sen se of cultural identity, but also to work together to solve common problems. This desire to emphasize the community over the i ndividual also encourages these individuals to maintain positive relations with oth ers, which shapes the health behaviors of these immigrants. For example, Grewal, Boltorff, and Hil ton (2005) conducted a study with South 98 Asian women to better understand their decision mak ing process when faced with a health issue. These researchers found that these women made decis ions about their health in consultation with other family members not only for support, but also in order to maintain a sense of community and personal connection. This was evident in my st udy as well, as the participants stressed the importance of high family involvement during the tr eatment process. Several individuals mentioned that family members often accompany them to doctor visits on a regular basis and are involved in the decision making process. Nirali in dicated that she and her sisters \"all go together\" for a check-up in order to maintain their health. By going together, they have a direct support system and are able to help each other deci de the best course of action if confronted with a problem. When examining which family members are included, i t was evident that the women relied on their spouse (with the exception of Niral i, whose husband passed away several years ago), while the men often looked to their adult chi ldren and/or siblings. The female participants remarked that their husbands have played an integra l role in helping them establish good health habits, as well as assisting them in making decisio ns when they are faced with a medical problem. In contrast, the men mentioned that their children played a more significant role than their spouse. Although research indicates these im migrants often turn to the male elders in the family (Ma, 1999; Pai & Adler, 2001; Roland, 1988), this was not the case for these participants. While sometimes they did request the help of their eldest son or brother, other times they turned to sisters and/or daughters. This could be due to a variety of reasons. It is possible that geography plays a role. For some of these particip ants, their siblings still live in India and so they turn to other family that are in closer proxim ity and more readily accessible. Other individuals mentioned that they contemplate other f actors, such as education and connections, 99 when considering who to ask for help. For instance , Suresh shared that although he lives with his son, he sought the advice of his daughter when he was ill because her circle of friends includes numerous physicians and other healthcare p rofessionals. This illustrates the complexity of family dynamics and underscores the importance o f the extended family unit. In addition to family, the participants in this stu dy also relied on their friends, family, and local community and often looked to these individua ls for guidance and information, especially in providing them with accurate and updated health information. A number of these individuals depended on other members of this community for a s econd opinion when they were experiencing a problem. For example, Balram relied on his friends' opinions when his physician recommended back surgery. His friends' confidence, strength, and support helped to ease his fears of undergoing the operation. In a similar fa shion, Raj also utilized other members of his community for guidance when he was confronted with cancer. Given multiple options and unsure how to proceed, he relied on the knowledge a nd advice of his friends to guide him through a difficult process. Just like Balram, Raj also drew strength from the support of his community and network of friends. This commitment of friendship and information sharing becomes cyclical, as individuals continually help o ne another and further develop their community and its members. Second, among the Asian Indian population, there i s still an adherence to a hierarchy of authority within the community and among its member s, which can cause these immigrants to leave the decision making in the hands of family me mbers or healthcare professionals. Sadler et al. (2001) found that Asian Indians have a tendency to defer judgment to individuals who they feel are experts, whether it is the physician or an other trusted individual. For example, Leela shared a story about her brother-in-law's experienc e with cancer and how the physician and his 100 family thought it best \"not to worry him,\" choosing not to provide the patient with details about his situation. This gentleman trusted his family a nd doctor and thus did not question the suggested course of action even though he was unawa re of his actual circumstance. Similarly, Choudhry (1998) argues that often Asian Indians bel ieve that it is the physician's responsibility to monitor and guide their health behaviors. Hanum an, Suresh, Bansi, and Nirali all relied primarily on their physician to help them stay heal thy. Each of these individuals trusts the judgment of their doctor and believes that he or sh e will provide them with necessary information regarding their health. However, while there are times that these particip ants defer judgment to their physician, this did not overshadow their desire to connect wit h their healthcare professional, which could be attributed to this populations' desire to develop a nd maintain relationships with others. Although the literature on Asian Indians indicates that a re spect for hierarchical structure may prevent these immigrants from asking questions and sharing their opinions (Pai & Adler, 2001; Roland, 1988), findings from this study challenge this prem ise. Rather than being timid and docile, these participants worked to cultivate a personal relatio nship with their doctor so that it would be possible to have an open dialogue. When discussing his physician, Jai notes he was \"now his intellectual level as well as on a social,\" indicat ing that he is comfortable conversing with his doctor on both a formal and informal level. While these individuals still vie w their healthcare professional as an expert, they also want to be abl e to talk \"here and there,\" as Deepak stated, providing them the freedom to share their hopes, fe ars, and concerns. This need for open dialogue, as well as being incl uded in the decision making process, is an intriguing finding and in contrast to the doctor -patient structure here in the United States. Researchers note that physicians in this country ar e often regarded as an expert and usually 101 diagnose in an authoritative, hierarchical fashion, with the doctor dictating treatment to the patient (Chopra, 1995; Pai & Adler, 2001). However , this study indicates that these immigrants not only want to be able to voice their opinions, b ut they also want to be treated as equals. Once again this is in contrast to the hierarchical natur e of the Asian Indian culture (Roland, 1988). Although there is a respect for authority and the p hysician's expertise, this does not always lead to compliance. Instead, these immigrants prefer to have a relationship where communication flows not only from the doctor to the patient, but vice versa as well. They not only want to be included in the decision making process, but also w ant to be able to have an intellectual conversation with the doctor, sharing their concern s and also having the opportunity to disagree with his or her suggestions and/or advice. This co uld be attributed to the high education level of these participants. For instance, Jai noted that h e was \"a highly educated man\" and he desired conversations with his physician that were at this same intellectual level. Similarly, Raj mentioned his background in engineering and how he wants to have a logical discussion when deciding between treatment options. Both of these examples highlight the impact of education on the communication preference of these participan ts and how this influences the doctor-patient relationship. Third, although these participants may not adhere to a hierarchical structure when working with their physician, these immigrants stil l believe in traditional beliefs, such as indigenous medical practices (Channa, 2004). Even today many elders within the Asian Indian community still believe in Ayurvedic medicine, the 6,000-year-old tradition of healthcare from India, which provides individuals with a holistic a pproach to medicine by connecting the mind and body (Chopra, 1995). Findings from this study confirm that elders in the Asian Indian community still consider traditional systems of hea ling. All eleven participants had utilized this 102 form of treatment at one time or another and, more importantly, place value in this system. When considering treatment options, alternative med icine becomes a viable option for these individuals because of their knowledge and faith in traditional healing methods. This study expands upon this idea of valuing tradi tional medicine systems by further elaborating on the decision making process that occ urs when Asian Indian immigrants are faced with an illness. Findings indicate that these indi viduals experiment with both Western and Eastern medical approaches when treating sickness. Strong belief in alternative medicine lead some of these participants to start treatment with traditional medicines such as ginger, turmeric, lemon, and homemade brews. Others, such as Nirali and Leela moved to ayurvedic and homeopathic medicine when they were not having succ ess with Western treatments. And then there were those individuals who did not see a need for drawing a distinction between the two systems of medicine. Instead, they chose to use bo th Western and Eastern treatments simultaneously, believing that each has its own ben eficial component. These individuals believe that ayurvedic, and other such alternative approach es, \"clean out the system,\" as noted by Balram, and use this form of medicine for maintaini ng a healthy body. While the decision making process varied among these participants, wha t remains is a belief in traditional healing methods, making alternative medicine not only a fea sible but also appealing option for these immigrants when they are faced with an illness. Finally, in addition to valuing traditional system s of medicine, these immigrants also utilize techniques that help them to maintain balan ce, mentally, physically, and spiritually. Roland (1988) argues that Asian Indians prefer to f ocus on the present, which was illustrated by the number of participants in my study who particip ated in yoga. One of the most common forms of yoga is Hatha yoga. Traditionally, this f orm of yoga is a complete yogic path, including 103 moral disciplines, physical exercises (for example, postures and breath control), and meditation. By suspending thought and no longer privileging the mind over the body, individuals are able to gain a deeper understanding of their relationship t o others (Srivastava, 2001). Numerous participants mentioned this form of yoga specifical ly, noting not only its health benefits, but also the mental and spiritual satisfaction that the exer cises bring. Hinduism advocates the use of subjective and exper iential methods in contrast to empirical methods (Srivastava, 2001). This can be seen in the decision making process described by the participants in this study. Rathe r than basing their treatment decision solely on scientific knowledge, these immigrants prefer to re ly on their own experience, or information provided by friends and family, which results in th eir experimentation with both Western and Eastern medicine. They begin with one treatment an d evaluate the results based on their own opinion and judgment. This form of experiential le arning often leads to introspection and self- study that helps these individuals move from an ego centric attitude to a sociocentric perspective (Chakraborty, 2005). As mentioned previously, Asia n Indians are a collective community, privileging the development of the group over the i ndividual. Learning from experience not only allows the individual to reflect and alter his or h er own beliefs, but than this knowledge is shared with others, thus increasing the knowledge base of the community as a whole. The experiences that these individuals had in Indi a, their faith in traditional medical approaches, along with their desire for holistic tr eatment, lead these immigrants to be skeptical of certain Western medical practices, which was an une xpected finding. Research indicates that those of a younger age, lesser education, and lesse r income are more prone to be skeptical of conventional medicine (Fiscella, Franks, & Clancy, 1998), but data from this study suggest otherwise. All the participants were over 60 years old, highly educated, and middle to upper-104 middle class, and they still expressed a skeptical attitude when discussing their experiences with healthcare in the United States. While this could be attributed to the fact that these individuals emigrated from India, all but one have been in this country for an extended period of time, acculturating to numerous U.S. customs. However, t hey still remain uncertain and uncomfortable with Western medical practices. The literature also indicates that Asian Indians ar e often reluctant to discuss their medical history with healthcare professionals (Ma, 1999; Ro land, 1988). Although findings from this study do not directly confirm this sentiment, sever al participants shared details and experiences that inadvertently expressed discomfort with Wester n medical doctors. For example, Deepak noted that he and his wife were still uncomfortable visiting American doctors, feeling that the atmosphere was formal and stiff, thus making it dif ficult for them to express their problems freely. For this reason, he, along with many Asian Indian immigrants, utilize an Asian Indian doctor as their primary healthcare professional. I n fact, nine out of the eleven participants in this study mentioned that their primary care physician w as Asian Indian. Having a doctor of Indian origin increases the comfort level for these immigr ants, allowing them the freedom to share their concerns and cultivate the personal relationship th at they desire. While visiting an Asian Indian physician does impr ove communication for these individuals, it still does not eliminate all of the ir skepticism. Even Indian doctors must adhere to specific Western medical norms, which are often foc used on the symptoms rather than the individual, and some of these practices are still c onfusing, and even disturbing, to Asian Indian immigrants because they are contradictory to what t hey experienced in India. One such practice that was mentioned repeatedly in this study was the notion of testing. A number of participants felt that doctors required too much testing, such a s drawing blood, and often did not see the need. 105 \"Invariably they draw blood for everything,\" shared Suresh, emphasizing that at times this procedure seemed unnecessary. Although these indiv iduals have adjusted to these types of practices and have an understanding of the underpin nings of such decisions, it is still a source of tension, especially if these immigrants are uncomfo rtable in voicing their concerns with their physician. Medical skepticism, which can be defined as doubt in the ability of conventional medical care to appreciably alter health status, has been l inked to the use of alternative medicine (Callahan et al., 2008). According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), patients often turn to alternativ e treatment when conventional medicine fails or provides dissatisfactory results, and find ings from this study are indicative of this statement. Numerous participants mentioned that th ey had moved to alternative medicine, such as homeopathy or Ayurveda, after becoming discourag ed with the outcome from conventional treatment. With this increase in use, it is critic al that physicians question their patients about th e use of alternative medicine. Sleath et al. (2005) found that patients were more likely to reveal this information if their doctor used a participato ry style of communication. This could be one reason why these immigrants desire a personal conne ction with their healthcare professional and seek out a doctor with whom they feel will listen a nd include them in the decision making process. Not only does it allow them to talk freel y, but this type of relationship also has the potential to lead to more effective treatment. Conclusion 2: Informal learning is the primary wa y these immigrants learn about health issues. The second conclusion drawn from this study is tha t that these participants utilize different forms of informal learning when seeking i nformation about health matters and/or concerns. Informal learning is considered to be le arning that takes place outside formal 106 instruction, and it can take place in a variety of contexts (Day, 1998; Galbraith, 1992). Cairns (2000) suggests that what is learned through this m ethod may be the most significant learning that an individual acquires, and this is especially relevant when considering health knowledge. A number of participants shared how a news program, a magazine article, or even a conversation with a friend, altered their health habits. Deepak noted that an advertisement on the radio encouraged him to attend a screening and Balram men tioned that information in a magazine article prompted him to begin annual check-ups. Kn owledge gained through informal channels helped to change these individual's perception abou t health and stimulated a positive behavior reaction that ultimately led to long term benefits. Other researchers have also investigated the conte xt in which informal learning occurs. English (1999, 2000) suggests that this type of lea rning is generally unintended, happening on a continuum of learner consciousness. For example, i n this study all participants mentioned that casual conversations at parties and/or other commun ity functions often led to insight on a new topic. Although these individuals were not directl y seeking information, participants discovered that informal dialogue with friends and family ofte n resulted in unanticipated learning. Hanuman recalled that a weekly chat with his sister increased his understanding of vitamins and even resulted in regular use of one in particular. Similarly, Leela shared how a conversation with other female friends introduced her to the negative health aspects of dye, thus causing her to stop coloring her hair. In both of these examples a cas ual interaction with friends or family became an indirect medium for knowledge sharing, leading t o learning that was unintended. Since individuals are not directly seeking informa tion, English (1999) argues that for learning to occur, \"there has to be some element of reflection on action\" (p. 391). People need to return to the experiences they have had, reevaluate these experiences, and then decide what they 107 would do differently. This form of reflection was evident in the decision making process of these participants when they were faced with an ill ness. The experimental attitude that these immigrants adopted was in itself an informal learni ng process. They started with one treatment, reflected on the outcome, and then decided whether or not they should take a different course of action. For example, Suresh mentioned that several of his friends have used a particular Indian herb to control diabetes. Suffering from the same chronic illness, and being reluctant to use medication, Suresh also chose to use this natural i ngredient to control his sugar level. After several weeks and no improvement, he was forced to reevaluate his decision, as well as his desire to avoid long term use of medications. After much deliberation he recognized the need to modify his treatment in order to improve his well b eing. Leela had a similar experience, but in reverse. Wh en confronted with an illness, she started treatment with Western medicine. However, after months of limited success, she began to contemplate other options. She had never used a lternative treatments before, but her dissatisfaction with solutions available through We stern medicine prompted her to consider traditional, more naturalistic approaches. She rea d about these other systems of medicine and spoke with friends and family in India who were fam iliar with Ayurveda and homeopathy. After reflecting on her situation, she decided to go to I ndia and visit a physician who specializes in homeopathic treatment, and is currently using this system in hopes of curing her disease. In both of these examples reflection allowed these individuals to assess their preconceived notions about health, well-being, and medicine. In addition to this contemplation, interaction with others also improves the informal learning process (Galbraith, 1992). Among Asian Indians, networking is common and often resul ts in knowledge sharing. In this study, all eleven participants mentioned the Indian community as a key resource for information, 108 especially concerning health issues. For instance, they all made use of this network when they were searching for a physician, whether it be a gen eral practitioner or a specialist for a specific illness. This type of networking most often includ ed the participant's circle of friends and took place in a variety of contexts such as a party, som eone's home, or the local temple. It was evident that these immigrants relied on other membe rs within the community, sharing resources with one another whenever necessary. Raj summed it up best by saying \"We are very fortunate to have the Indian community. We can call anybody and go to anybody when we need help.\" This form of relationship building leads to dialogu e, which in turn results in informal learning. Informal learning is a complex process which is dif ficult to measure (Gorard, Fevre, & Rees, 1999) and even more difficult to describe. H owever, some researchers have attempted to outline the characteristics of this learning proces s, such as its focus on learner control (Garrison, 1997). Others have adopted a more general descript ion such as a continuum with formal learning on one end and informal on the other (Stei n, 2001). For this study, the most useful explanation of informal learning is put forth by Bu rton and Perkins (2003) who describe this process as \"filling in the gaps.\" This was evident in the numerous resources the participants utilized in learning about new health issues. An i ndividual may hear about a certain topic at a party and become curious, which may lead him or her to have additional conversations with other friends and/or family. For instance, Deepak explained how he heard a news program detailing how President Bush exercises and maintain s his heartbeat at a certain level during his physical routine. After hearing this report, he wa s curious about this idea and had additional questions. Does this apply to his own exercise sch edule? How does one calculate his heartbeat? What is its importance? Wanting to learn more, Dee pak turned to his friends. Through talking with other individuals, he was able to increase his understanding of this phenomenon by learning 109 additional information. One friend explained how h e can calculate his heart rate before, during, and after exercise, and what level he should mainta in at each of these stages. Deepak's daughter used the Internet to show him different equipment t hat would help him monitor his heartbeat during physical activity. One news program prompte d him to utilize other resources to fill in the missing pieces and in turn, changed his perceptions of exercise. Just like Deepak, all of these participants used a variety of resources to \"fill i n the gaps\" in order to increase their understanding of a new idea or issue. Findings from this study also indicate that these i mmigrants utilize nonformal learning in addition to informal learning. Nonformal learning refers to organized activities that take place sometimes outside of educational institutions but a re located in community-based settings such as local churches, cooperative extension, or (1993) identified nonformal learning as \"any organized, intentional and explicit effort to promote learning to enhance the quality of life through non-school settings\" (p. 2). This typ e of learning is evident in the Asian Indian community. For example, several participants menti oned health fairs, which are coordinated by local Asian Indian organizations and run by local I ndian physicians who volunteer their time. These fairs are held at public places in the commun ity such as Indian shopping centers or the local temple. In addition to these health fairs, t emples often provide various seminars and classes for the local community. Both of these act ivities emphasize information sharing and skill building, as well as fostering personal enjoyment ( Taylor, 2006). At the health fairs, individuals are not only offered free screenings and check-ups, but they are also provided with information and skills that will improve their well-being. One participant mentioned that he learned how to monitor his diabetes and another shared that she wa s taught about breast self exams. Seminars at 110 the temple range from information about heart disea se to lectures on the meaning of religious texts. These workshops not only increase knowledge and skills, but they also allow social interaction for these immigrants. Another particip ant expressed his fondness for a yoga class at his local temple, not only because of the exercises and meditation he was learning, but also because it provided him with personal enjoyment and allowed him to congregate with friends and family on a regular basis. Just as networking, a mechanism for informal learning often results in community development, nonformal program s within the Asian Indian community also lead to information sharing among its members. In addition to informal and nonformal learning, thi s study indicates that these immigrants also utilize self-directed learning. It is argued that self-directed learning is a natural part of ad ult life (Merriam & Caffarella, 1999) and can simply be defined as learning on one's own. Numerous participants mentioned that they read mate rial on their own to better understand different health issues that affecting them persona lly or other friends and/or family. They also mentioned the Internet as a primary source of infor mation. \"I will go on the Internet just to learn more,\" shared Bansi, noting that he browses on his own to stay updated on specific topics. As noted by Brookfield (1993), learning on one's own g ives each individual primary control over his or her learning, a factor that appeals to many adults. This desire for control may also enter the doctor-patient relationship and provide another reason why these immigrants seek a personal relationship with their physician. It is possible that they want open dialogue so that they can control their own understanding of the phenomenon, as well as the proposed diagnosis and treatment. Several models of self-directed learning have been proposed, some linear (Knowles, 1975), some instructional (Grow, 1991; Hammond & Co llins, 1991), and others 1992; Danis, 1992; Garrison, 1988). The interactive model postulates that information gathe red through one set of activities is stored until it fits in with other ideas and resources on the sa me topic gleaned from one or more additional clusters of activities. This process is evident in this study, as the participants used multiple resources to learn about various topics. Some indi viduals would go onto the Internet and read some information and that issue would come up later in a conversation with friends and/or family. Others would hear about something of inter est in a casual conversation and would then read more about that topic to better understand its details and nuances. Using multiple approaches, these immigrants are able to engage in a sufficient number of relevant clusters of learning activities and then assemble these cluster s into a coherent whole. This section examined two conclusions. First, Indi an culture and heritage shape the healthcare behaviors of older Asian Indian immigran ts. Four values were explored in detail. And second, is the conclusion that informal learnin g primarily characterizes how these immigrants learn about health. Implications for Practice This study highlights a number of elements that ar e useful for educators as well as healthcare professionals. First, findings from thi s research illustrate the informal nature of learning among these participants, and outline the different resources that Asian Indian immigrants use to learn about health issues and neg otiate their treatment process. When developing educational programs for this population , it is important to recognize that these immigrants prefer to work in groups, solving proble ms with others. The desire to maintain relationships with other me mbers of the Indian community is an integral component to reaching this audience. Thes e individuals look to their network of friends 112 and family first for information, guidance, and sup port and through these interactions, there is a form of knowledge sharing that continues to develop the members of its community. For this reason, organizations within the Indian community, such as a local temple, are excellent initial entry points to reach this population. These organ izations are a natural gathering place for these immigrants, and can serve as a prime venue for educ ational programs. In addition, by drawing on this resource it will be possible to not only de velop individuals, but also build the knowledge base of the community, which is extremely important for Asian Indian immigrants. The need to cultivate a personal relationship was not limited to friends and family, but also included the individual's healthcare professio nal. This finding is critical for physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers who are treati ng this population. Research indicates that these immigrants are reluctant to share their medic al history (Ma, 1999; Roland, 1988), but this can be overcome if there is a level of comfort betw een the doctor and patient, which encourages more open communication. Spending a few minutes to learn about each person as an individual rather than a patient will allow these immigrants t o develop a personal connection, which is essential when ensuring the well being of this popu lation. Developing good dialogue with these immigrants is significant for other reasons as well. It is evident that cultural values shape these indi vidual's health behaviors, even those who have been living in the United States for an extended pe riod of time. Traditional systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda or homeopathy, are considered as t reatment options by these immigrants when they are ill. Findings from this study indicate th at some of these individuals use such an alternate approach in conjunction with Western medicine. Thi s information is vital when offering medical treatment and for this reason, healthcare workers n eed to not only understand the value that these 113 immigrants place on traditional medicine, but also establish a clinical atmosphere that will allow this information to be shared. Taking the time to encourage and develop open comm unication will also help healthcare professionals address the skeptical attitude some o f these immigrants have regarding certain Western medical practices. If individuals are comf ortable in engaging in dialogue with their physician, it becomes easier to address their conce rns regarding hospital procedures and testing, which in turn will encourage this population to con tinually seek treatment, whether for a specific problem or preventive care. Finally, when working with these immigrants, it is important to remember that the entire family is involved in decision making. Data from t his study reveals that participants were often accompanied by other members of their family when s eeking medical attention, even if the visit was a regular check up. Decisions about treatment options and use of medication were often made in consultation with their spouse, children, a nd even brothers and sisters. Both healthcare professionals as well as educators should recognize that for this population, the family unit is often a priority over the individual. Physicians s hould attempt to include the patient's family during the visit, sharing information with all thos e involved. Similarly, when developing educational interventions, programs targeting the e ntire family will be increasingly successful, as they will allow individuals to work together toward s a common goal. Recommendations for Future Research Based on the findings of this study a number of re commendations for further exploration have been generated: 1) This study involved individuals who have been livin g in the United States for an extended period of time. It would be useful to con duct a similar study with older Asian 114 Indian immigrants who have recently immigrated to t he U.S. to determine if there are differences in cultural values and/or the negotiati on of treatment. 2) One of the fastest growing segments of the Asian In dian population is individuals between 25 and 35 years of age (2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census), immigrating to the United States for jobs and/or education. Replicati ng this study with this audience would help highlight differences and similarities between young adults and elders in this population. 3) Further understanding the decision making process o f Asian Indians, especially in regards to their negotiation of Eastern and Western medicin e, would help physicians improve treatment for this population. Conducting a narrat ive study, focusing specifically on how these immigrants choose treatment options, would pr ovide additional details on this topic. 4) This study indicated the importance of family, both immediate and extended, in the health-related behaviors of these immigrants. Howe ver, further study could better highlight the dynamics of this familial support. I s the entire family involved all the time? Are there specific individuals who are consulted mo re often? Answers to these and similar questions will help to better understand th ese immigrants' support system. 5) This study highlighted several cultural values that influence health-related behaviors among Asian Indian immigrants. However, from this research data, these values cannot be claimed to be exclusive to this population. A c omparative study with other immigrant groups (such as Hispanics, Chinese, Koreans, and Ja panese) would help to identify values that are unique to Asian Indians and those that are common across immigrant populations. 115 6) Individuals who were unwilling or unable to commit to an hour-long interview may choose to share their experiences through a survey instrument. A larger sample, which can be obtained through a quantitative study with p redetermined questions as well as some open-ended questions, may reveal even more cul tural values and learning resources than those determined through the study of 11 parti cipants. With this study serving as a foundation for further research investigating the role of cultural values on the health-related behaviors of Asian Ind ian immigrants, it is important for researchers to continue to expand on these findings and conclus ions. Doing so will not only benefit educators and healthcare professionals, but also th e Asian Indian population. Chapter Summary Based on 11 interviews with older Asian Indian imm igrants 60 years of age or older, two conclusions regarding how cultural values shape the health-related behaviors of this population emerged. First, Indian culture and heritage shape the healthcare behaviors of these immigrants. And second, informal learning primarily characteriz es how these individuals learn about health. This chapter also addressed the implications for ad ult educators, program developers, and healthcare professionals. Finally, recommendations were made for possible future studies. 116 REFERENCES Administration on Aging. (2001). A profile of olde r Americans: 2001.

My name is Swathi Nath Thaker, and I'm the daughter of Dr. Hrudaya Nath. I am currently working on my Ph.D in Adult Education at the University of Georgia. I am interested in health education, and more specifically, how cul tural values and beliefs shape the way that immigrant populations learn about healthcare. For my dissertation, I would like to interview older Asian Indians to better understand how these individuals interact and utilize healthcare in the United States. I am writing to ask for your he lp in locating individuals who would be willing to talk to me and meet the following criteria: 1. Individuals must be 60 years or older 2. Individuals and their immediate family (which inclu des spouse, children, and/or siblings) must not be employed in healthcare (doctors or nurs es) I will interview interested individuals for approxi mately one to two hours about their experiences with the healthcare system in the United States, as well as how they manage their health. Interviews will be audio taped so that I can accura tely capture the conversation, but all information shared will remain confidential and pse udonyms will be used whenever I refer to specific passages of dialogue. I would greatly appreciate your help in locating ap propriate participants. If you know anyone that would be willing to talk to me, or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email ( snath@uga.edu ) or by phone (678.344.7992). I thank you in advan ce for helping me with my research. Sincerely, Swathi 128 APPENDIX B Interview Guide Please tell me about a time when you were sick. How would you describe your health? Has it changed since coming to the United States? What are your health habits? In what ways do you attempt to ease your discomfort ? What are your views on healthcare? What do you do to prevent illness? How often do you visit a doctor? When would you consult with a doctor? Please tell me about an experience you had with a d octor What made you decide to go see a doctor? How comfortable are you talking with your doctor? How do you decide what medical advice to follow? How does this experience compare to healthcare back in India? How satisfied are you with the medical care you rec eive as compared to India? How do you learn about health related topics? What types of resources do you use? How are these similar/different from India? 129 APPENDIX C Interview Participant Consent Form I agree to participate in a research study titled \" Understanding the Role of Culture in the Health - Related Behaviors of Older Asian Indian Immigrants \" conducted by Swathi Nath Thaker from the Department of Lifelong Education, Administration, a nd Policy at the University of Georgia (542-3343) under the direction of Dr. Sharan Merriam, Departme nt of Lifelong Education, Administration, and Policy, University of Georgia (542-4018). I unders tand that my participation is voluntary. I can ref use to participate or stop taking part without giving any reason, and without penalty. I can ask to have all of the information about me returned to me, removed from t he research records, or destroyed. The reason for this study is to better understand h ow cultural values influence how older Asian Indian immigrants learn and negotiate health issues in the United States. If I volunteer to take part in this study, the following will occur: 1. I will be asked to participate in one interview that will last approximately two hours. Following the consent form, the researchers will co llect demographic information from me by verbally running through a checklist. These activit ies will take place at a time and location that is convenient for me. 2. In addition, the researchers may ask for copies of journals, calendars, or other documents that identify health related issues important to me to u se as research data. 3. The researchers would like to make an audio reco rding of the interview. 4. In addition, the researcher may contact me 3-4 w eeks after you participate to seek clarification or more information regarding your responses. 130 The benefits for me are that I have the chance to s hare my experiences and better understand how my cultural values shape how I learn about health. The researcher also hopes to learn how these beliefs c an be utilized by healthcare professionals to better serv e the needs of older Asian Indian immigrants. The researchers do not expect any risks for me from participating in this study. It is possible that I may feel uncomfortable answering some of the rese arch questions. I can skip any questions that Ii d o not wish to answer. In addition, I may stop answer ing questions or discontinue participation at any t ime. If I experiences any distress as a result of my par ticipation in this research, I may contact the inve stigator or his advisor for other counseling referrals, assi stance, and resources. No individually-identifiable information about me, or provided by me during the research, will be shared with others without my written permission, e xcept if it is required by law. I will be assigned a pseudonym that will be used on all documents. Addi tionally, any data containing individually identify ing information, including the audio tapes, will be sec urely kept in a locked filing cabinet and/or passwo rd protected computer in the researcher's office. Af ter analysis is complete, the researchers will eras e any individually identifying information from the data, remove any links between my name and results, and will erase the audio recordings. The investigators will answer any further questions about the research, now or during the course of th e project. I understand that I am agreeing by my signature on this form to take part in this research project and understand that I will receive a signed copy of this consent form for my records. _________________________ _____________________ _____ __________ Name __________________ ____________ __________ Name of Participant Signature Date Please sign both copies, keep one and return one to the researcher.
