The Highlights section below groups key program performance measures by HRSA's goals and includes anticipated measure targets for fiscal year (FY) 2022. In collaboration with states, communities, and organizations, the performance examples below illustrate how H RSA will continue to improve health outcomes and address disparities through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce, and innovative, high-value programs for millions of Americans who are geographically isolated and economically or medically vulnerable. Highlights HRSA Goal: Impr ove access to quality health care and services HRSA programs support the direct delivery of health services and health system improvements that increase access to health care and help reduce health disparities. In FY 2022, the Health Centers Program expects to support health centers' provision of affordable, accessible, quality, and cost efficient care to 29.8 million patients. HRSA expects to help states serve 63 percent of children through the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program in FY 2022, providing support to address states' highest MCH priorities. The MCH Block Grant program expects to contribute to the reduction of the national infant mortality rate to 5.4 per 1,000 in FY 2022 by supporting state MCH activities to impro ve the health of mothers, children, and families, particularly among low- income mothers and families or those with limited availability of care. In FY 2022, HRSA expects to serve 50,000 new clients under the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. By supporting the provision of HIV medications and related services to more than 280,000 persons in FY 2022 through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, HRSA will continue its contribution to reducing AIDS- related mortality for low -income and uninsured people living with HIV/AIDS. In FY 2022, the Ryan White HIV Emergency Relief Grants (Part A) and HIV Care Grants to States (Part B) are projected to support, respectively, 3.3 million visits and 2.7 million visits for health -related care. 15 In FY 2022, 83% of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients receiving HIV medical care and at least one viral load test are expected to be virally suppressed. To increase the number of patients from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds able to find a suitably matched unrelated adult donor for their blood stem cell transplants, the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program projects that it will have nearly four million adults on the donor registry in FY 2022 who self-identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. The Organ Transplantation program projects that it will facilitate the transplantation of more than 32,600 deceased donor organs in FY 2022. HRSA Goal: Foster a Health Care Workforce Able to Address Current and Emerging Needs HRSA works to i mprove the health care system by bolstering the healthcare workforce through provider placement, retention, and training activities. In FY 2022, 11,000 healthcare providers will be deemed eligible for Federal Tort Claims Act malpractice coverage through the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice program. The program encourages providers to volunteer their time at sponsoring free clinics, thereby expanding the capacity of the healthcare safety net. HRSA Goal: Enhance Population Health and Address Health Disparities through Community Partnerships HRSA efforts will include activities such as leveraging advisory councils to better understand community requirements, integrating public health and primary care services, using evidence-based research to address health disparities, and promoting illness prevention and healthy behaviors. In FY 2022, 430,000 unique individuals will receive direct services through Federal Office of Rural Health Policy Outreach grants, which improve rural health through community coalitions and evidence-based models by focusing on quality improvement, increasing health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. The Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program will train 400 students in FY 2022 through innovative doctoral -level health psychology programs that foster an integrated and interprofessional approach to addressing access of behavioral health and substance use prevention and treatment services in high need areas through academic and community partnerships. The GPE Program is focused on providing specialized training to doctoral health psychology students, interns, and post-doctoral residents in the provision of Opioid Use Disorder and other Substance Use Disorder prevention and treatment services. In FY 2022, HRSA expects to have 148,721 cord blood units from underrepresented 16 ra cial and ethnic minorities available through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, increasing the likelihood of finding suitably matched donors among these populations with a high rate of diversity in tissue types. Th e MCH Block Grant program expects the ratio of the Black infant mortality rate to the White infant mortality rate to decrease to 2.0 to 1 in FY 2022. Perfo rmance Management Performance management is central to the agency's overall management approach and performance -related information routinely is used to improve HRSA's operations and those of its grantees. HRSA's performance management process includes setting priorities and goals that are linked to HRSA's Strategic Plan, action planning and execution, regular monitoring and review with follow -up. HRSA's Strategic Plan includes three goals focused on health access, the health workforce, and population health, each of which gives direction to the agency a s it administers its external programs (described above). HRSA's Strategic Plan also includes one goal focused on intern al HRSA performance management that drives improved used of data and evidence to support decision-making. In accordance with the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, HRSA uses the results from its performance measurement as evidence to address pressing agency questions about program impacts and progress toward agency and department goals. Building an evidence- base on program impacts informs agency leadership decisions and policies. As the key element of the performance management process, HRSA Senior Staff establish annual fiscal year performance plans, including metrics and indicators of success, directly linked to implementation of the HRSA Strategic Plan and additional priorities, as appropriate. Regular performance reviews take place several times a year between Senior Staff and the Administrator/Deputy Administrator, including during regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings, mid-year and year -end Senior Staff performance reviews , and ad hoc meetings to address emerging issues. Reviews focus on progress, challenges, and possible course corrections, with particular emphasis on root- causes of performance results. These aspects of HRSA's performance management system promote accountability and transparency, support collaboration in problem solving and help drive performance improvement at the agency and among HRSA's grantees. Ultimately, HRSA holds itself to high standards to maximize program investment impacts and to improve health outcomes. 17 Budget Exhibits TAB18 All Purpose Table Health Resources and Services Administration (Dollars in Thousands) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 3,905,348 -94,652 Health Center Tort Claims 120,000 -

FY 2022 Community Health Center Fund Authorization ................................................. $4 billion. Allocation Method ....................................................... Competitive grants/cooperative agreements Program Description and Accomplishments For more than 50 years, health centers have delivered affordable, accessible, quality, and cost-effective primary health care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. During that time, health centers have become an essential primary care provider fo r millions of people across the country. Health centers advance a model of coordinated, comprehensive, and patient-centered primary health care, integrating a wide range of medical, dental, behavioral health, and patient support/enabling services. Today, approximately 1,400 health centers operate over 13,000 service delivery sites that provide care in every U.S. State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. In 2019, health centers served 29.8 million patien ts, one in every eleven people living in the United States, providing approximately 123 million patient visits, at an average cost of $1,044 per patient (including Federal and non-Federal sources of funding). In 2019, about 43 percent of 25 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 65 all health centers served rural areas providing care to over 9 million patients, one in 5 people living in rural areas. Patient services are supported through Federal Health Center grants, Medicaid, Medicare, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), other third party payments, self-pay collections, other Federal grants, and State/local/other resources. Heal th Centers have performed a critical role in the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to provide high quality primary health care services for the nation's underserved and vulnerable populations. Through the American Rescue Plan Act, H RSA is providing one-time funding to support health centers in responding to and mitigating the spread of COVID -19, and enhancing health care services and infrastructure. Improvements made with these funds will help health centers to continue meeting the needs of their patient population through the pandemic by providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and treatment, and supporting critical health ce nter construction, renovation, modernization and other facility improvements. In addition, to ensure our nation's underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID -19 are equitably vaccinated against COVID-19, HRSA in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program to directly allocate COVID -19 vaccines to HRSA-supported health centers. Through this program, millions of people living in the nation's medically underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by COVID-19 have received vac cines. Health centers deliver high quality and value-based care by using key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. Seventy -seven percent of health centers are currently recognized by national accrediting organizations a s Patient Centered Medical Homes - an advanced model of patient- centered primary care that emphasizes quality and care coordination through a team based approach to care. Despite treating a sicker, poorer, and more diverse population than other health care providers, health centers exceeded numerous national averages and benchmarks in 2019 including Healthy People 2020 goals for hypertension control and dental sealant services. Overall, 94 percent of health centers met or exceeded Healthy People 2020 goals for at lea st one clinical measure in 2019. Health centers also reduce costs to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as emergency departments and hospitals 26. Populations served: Healt h centers serve a diverse patient population. In 2019: People of all ages: Approximately 31 percent of patients were children (age 17 and younger); over 9 percent were 65 or older. Health centers provided primary care services for o ne in nine children nationwide. People in poverty: Over 91 percent of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines as compared to approximately 33 percent of the U.S. population as a whole. 26 Nocon, Rober t S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in F ederally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 66 People without and with health insurance: About one in 4 patients were without health insurance. Those patients that are insured are covered by Medicaid, Medicare, other public insurance, or private insurance. Special Populations: Some health centers receive specific funding to provide primary care services for certain special populations including individuals and families experiencing homelessn ess, agricultural workers, those living in public housing, and Native Hawaiians. Health centers served over 1 .4 million individuals experiencing homelessness, more than 1 million agricultural workers and their families, over 5.1 million people living in or near public housing and nearly 9,000 Native Hawaiians. o Health Care for the Homeless Program: Homelessness continues to affect rural as well as urban and suburban communities in the United States. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, over 1.4 million people experienced sheltered homelessness. In 2018, HRSA-funded health centers provided primary care services for nearly 1.4 million persons in supportive housing and/or experiencing homelessness. The Health Care for the Homeless Program supports coordinated, comprehensive, integrated primary care including substance abuse and mental health services for homeless persons in the United States, serving patients that live on the street, in shelters, or in transitional housing. o Migrant Health Center Program: HRSA -funded health centers provided primary care services for over 1 million migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.8 million migratory and seasonal agricultural workers in the United States (2016 LSC Agricultural Worker Population Estimate Update). The Migrant Health Center Program supports comprehensive, integrated primary care services for agricultural worke rs and their families with a particular focus on occupational health and safety. o Public Housing Primary Care Program: The Public Housing Primary Care Program increases access for residents of public housing to comprehensive, integrated primary care services. Health centers deliver care at locations on the premises of public housing developments or immediatel y accessible to residents. HRSA-funded health centers provided primary care services for over 5.1 million people living in or near public housing. The Public Housing Primary Care Program provides services that are responsive to identified needs of the residents and in coordination with public housing authorities. o Native Hawaiian Health Care Program: The Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, funded within the Health Center appropriation, improves the health of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health promotion, and disease prevention services available through a combination of outreach, referral, and linkage mechanisms. Services provided include nutrition programs, screening and control of hypertension and diabetes, immunizations, and basic pr imary care services. Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems provided medical and enabling services to nearly 9,000 people. 67 Allocation Method: Public and non- profit private entities, including tribal, faith -based and community -based organizations are eligible to apply for funding under the Health Center Program. New health center grants are awarded based on a competitive process that includes an asses sment of need and merit. In addition, health centers are required to compete for continued grant funding to serve their existing service areas at the completion of every project period (generally every 3 years). New Health Center Program grant opportunities are announced nationally and applications are reviewed and rated by objective review committees (ORC), composed of experts who are qualified by training and experience in particular fields related to the Program. Funding decisions are made based on ORC assessments, announced funding preferences and program priorities. In making funding decisions, HRSA applies statutory awarding factors including funding priority for applications serving a sparsely-populated area; consideration of the rural and urban distribution of awards (no more than 60 percent and no fewer than 40 percent of projected patients come from eit her rural or urban areas); and continued proportionate distribution of funds to the special populations served under the Health Center Program. Patient Care: Health centers continue to serve an increasing number of patients. The number of health cente r patients served in 2019 was 29.8 million; an increase of 11.0 million, or 66 percent, above the 18.8 million patients served in 2009. Of the 29.8 million patients served and for those for whom income status is known, over 91 percent were at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level and approximately 23 percent were uninsured. Success in increasing the number of patients served has been due in large part to the development of new health centers, new satellite sites, and expanded capacity at existi ng clinics. Health centers focus on integrating care for their patients across the full range of services - not just medical but oral health, vision, behavioral health (mental health and substance use disorder services), and pharmacy. Health centers also deliver crucial services such as case management, transportation, and health education, which enable target populations to access care. Over 92 percent of health centers provide preventive dental services either directly or via contract. In 2019, health centers provided oral health services to over 6.7 million patients, an increase of 76 percent since 2010. In 2019, about 2.9 million people receive d behavioral health services at health centers, an increase of over 100 percent from 2014 to 2019 due to significant Health Center Program investments in behavioral health services. From FY 2016 through FY 2019, HRSA invested $540 million in targeted, ongoing annual grant funding for the expansion of substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health (MH) services in health centers. An additional $300 million has been invested in one- time health center infrastructure costs that support the expansion of services. These ongoing annual investments are projected to remain in health center continuation awards in FY 2020 and beyond, and support health centers in implementing and advancing evidence- based strategies to expand access to quality integrated SUD prevention and treatment services, including those addressing opioid use disorder (OUD) and other emerging SUD issues, to best meet the health needs of the population served by each health center; and/or to expand access to quality integrated mental health services, with a focus on conditions that increase risk for, or co-occur with SUD, including 68 OUD. Screening for substance use disorders has increased 93 percent since 2016 with the number of patients receiving screening, brief intervention, referral and treatment (SBIRT) increasing from 716,677 in 2016 to 1,381,408 in 2019. From 2016-2019, the number of health center providers eligible to prescribe MAT increased over 300 percent (from 1,700 in 2016 to 7,095 in 2019) and the number of patients receiving MAT increased 266 percent (from 39,075 in 2016 to 142,919 in 2019). Improving Quality of Care and Health Outcomes: Health centers continue to provide quality primary and related health care services, improving the health of the Nation's underserved communities an d populations. HRSA- funded health centers are evaluated on a set of performance measures emphasizing health outcomes and the value of care delivered. These measures provide a balanced, comprehensive look at a health center's services toward common conditions affecting underserved communities. Performance measures align with national standards and are commonly used by Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance/managed care organizations. Benchmarking health center outcomes to national rates demonstrates how he alth center performance compares to the performance of the nation overall. Timely entry into prenatal care is an indicator of both access to and quality of care. Identifying maternal disease and risks for complications of pregnancy or birth during the first trimester can also help improve birth outcomes. Results over the past fe w years demonstrate improved performance as the percentage of pregnant health center patients that began prenatal care in the first trimester grew from 57.8 percent in 2011 to 74.0 percent in 2019, exceeding the target of 73.0 percent. Appropriate prena tal care management can also have a significant effect on the incidence of low birth weight (LBW), the risk factor most closely associated with neonatal mortality. Monitoring birth weight rates is one way to measure quality of care and health outcomes for health center female patients of childbearing age, approximately 25 percent of the total health center patient population served in 2019. In 2019, the health center rate was 8.0 percent, lower than the 2019 national rate of 8.3 percent, and has consistently been lower than the national rate during the past several years. Health center patients, including low-income individuals, racial/ethnic minority groups, and persons who are uninsured, are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Clinical evidence indicates that access to appropriate care can improve the health status of patients with chronic diseases and thus reduce or eliminate health disparities. The Health Center Program began reporting data from all grantees on the control of hypertension and diabetes via its Uniform Data System in 2008. In 2019, 65 percent of adult health center patients with diagnosed hypertension had blood pressure under adequate control (less than 140/90) compared to 61 percent 27 nationally. Additionally in 2019, 68 percent of adult health center patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes had their most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent) compared to 60 percent 28 nationally. 27 2019 National Committee for Quality Assurance, Medicaid HMO average. 28 2019 National Committee for Quality Assurance, Medicaid HMO average. 69 Health centers improve health outcomes by emphasizing the care management of patients with multiple health care needs and the use of key quality improvement practices, including health information technology. H RSA's Health Center Program Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Initiative supports health centers to achieve national PCMH recognition, an advanced model of primary care using a team-based approach to improve quality through coordination of care and patient engagement. At the end of 2020, more than three- fourths of HRSA -funded health centers were recognized as PCMHs. In addition, health centers have advanced quality and accountability by adopting Health Information Technology (HIT), including the use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth and other technologie s that advance and enable quality improvement. Over 99 percent of all health centers reported having an EHR in 2019. Promoting Efficiency: Health centers provide cost- effective, affordable, quality primary health care services. The Program's efficiency measure tracks the ratio of medical patients per medical physicians in health centers, which focuses on maximizing the overall efficiency and scope of clinical provider teams, recog nizing the valuable and cost effective contributions of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives to health center patient access to comprehensive, quality primary care services. In 2018 and 2019, the number of medical patients per physician in health centers was approximately 1,780. External Evaluation: In addition to internal monitoring of health center performance, peer reviewed literature and major reports continue to document that health centers successfully increase access to care, promote quality and cost -effective care, and improve patient outcomes, especially for traditionally underserved populations. Health centers successfully manage hypertension by race/ethnicity. ( Sripipatana A, Pourat N, Chen X, Zhou W, Lu C. Exploring racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension care among patients s erved by health centers in the United States. J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich) . 2019;21(4):489-498. doi:10.1111/jch.13504). Health center organizational characteristics positively ass ociated with cancer screening rates include provider- patient staffing ratios, electronic health record status, percentage revenue from public capitated managed care, and local primary care provider availability. (Chuang E, Pourat N, Chen X, et al. Organiza tional Factors Associated with Disparities in Cervical and Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates in Community Health Centers. J Health Care Poor Underserved. 2019;30(1):161-181. doi:10.1353/hpu.2019.0014). NHSC clinicians complement non -NHSC clinicians in primary care and mental health care. They help enhance the provision of patient care in CHCs, particularly in dental and mental health services, the 2 major areas of service gaps. (Xinxin Han, Patric ia Pittman, Clese Erikson, Fitzhugh Mullan, and Leighton Ku ; \"The Role of the National Health Service Corps Clinicians in Enhancing Staffing and Patient Care Capacity in Community Health Centers\" Medical Care. 57(12):1002-1007, December 2019). Health centers' support for ambulatory care accreditation improve qua lity of care and reduce health disparities in underserved communities across the United States. (Nair S, 70 Chen J; \"Improving Quality of Care in Federally Qualified Health Centers Through Ambulatory Care Accreditation\" Journal of Healthcare Quality 2018 Oct; 40(5):301- 309). The availability of health centers' services is positively associated with having a usual source of care among those with no insurance coverage. (Kirby JB, Sharma R. \"The Availability of Community Health Center Services and Access to Medi cal Care\" Healthcare, 2017 December; 5(4): 174-182). Health centers with longer periods of PCMH recognition were more likely to have improved their clinical quality on 9 of 11 measures, than health centers with fewer years of PCMH recognition. (Ruwei Association of Patient- Centered Medical Home Designation with Quality of Care of HRSA-Funded Health Centers: A Longitudinal Analysis of 2012 - 2015\" Medical Care, 2018 Feb; 56(2): 130-138). Health center Medicaid patients had lower use and spending than did non- health center patients across all services, with 22 percent fewer visits and 33 percent lower spending on specialty care, and 25 percent fewer admiss ions and 27 percent lower spending on inpatient care. Total spending was 24 percent lower for health center patients. (Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medicaid Enrollees in federally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016). Health centers demonstrate lower total costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Total median annual costs (at $2,370) for health c enter Medicare patients were lower by 10 percent compared to patients in physician offices ($2,667) and by 30 percent compared to patients in outpatient clinics ($3,580). (Dana B. Mukamel, Laura M. White, Robert S. Nocon, Sharma, Leiyu Shi \"Comparing the Cost of Caring for Medic are Beneficiaries in Federally Funded Health Centers to Other Care Settings\" Health Services Research , Volume 51, No. 2, April 2016. Health centers provide socially and medically disadvantaged patients with care that results in lower utilization and main tained or improved preventive care. (Neda Laiteerapong, James Kirby, Yue Gao, Tzy-Chyi Yu, Ravi Sharma, Robert Nocon, Sang Mee Lee, Marshall Chin, G. Nathan, Quyen Ngo- Metzger, and Elbert S. Huang; Services Research 2014) . Health centers p rovide high-quality primary care and do not exhibit the extent of disparities that exist in other US health care settings. (Shi L, Lebrun- Harris L, Parasuraman S, Zhu J, Ngo- Metzger Q \"The Quality of Primary Care Experienced by Health Center Patients\" J ournal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2013; 26(6): 768-777). 71 Health centers and look -alikes demonstrated equal or better performance than private practice prim ary care providers on select quality measures despite serving patients who have more chronic disease and socioeconomic complexity (Goldman LE, Chu PW, Tran H, Romano MJ, Stafford RS; 2. American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2012 Aug; 43(2):142- 9). Feder al Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Program: The Health Center Program administers the FTCA Program, under which participating health centers, their employees and eligible contractors may be deemed to be Federal employees qualified for medical malpractice liability protection under the FTCA. As Federal employees, they are immune from suit for medi cal malpractice claims while acting within the scope of their employment. The Federal Government assumes responsibility for such claims. In addition, the FTCA Program supports risk mitigation activities, including reviews of risk management plans and sit es visits as well as risk management technical assistance and resources to support health centers. The enactment of the 21 st Century Cures Act in December of 2016 extended liability protections for volunteers at deemed health centers under the FTCA Progra m. In accordance with the statute, HRSA implemented FTCA coverage for volunteers in FY 2018. Nearly 300 volunteers were covered under the FTCA Program in FY 2019. Overa ll, in FY 2018, 110 claims were paid totaling $109.3 million, in FY 2019, 150 claims were paid totaling $135 million, and in FY 2020, 117 claims were paid totaling $93.5 million . Currently, there are 770 FTCA Program claims outstanding. As the number of health center patients continues to grow, it is projected that the amount of annual c laims paid will continue to increase through FY 2022. Funding History FY Amount 2022 reflects the post -sequestration amount. 72 Budget Request The FY 2022 Budget Request for the Health Center Program is $1.73 billion in discretionary resources , which is an increase of $50.0 million from the FY 2021 Enacted level. In addition, FY 2021 Omnibus (P.L. 116-260), provided mandatory resources of $4.0 billion for each fiscal year through FY 2023. In 2022, Health Centers mandatory funding will be reduced by $94.7 million through sequestration pursuant to Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA). In FY 2022, the Health Center Program will provide care for approximately 29.8 million patients. At the Budget Request level, t he Health Center Program will continue to focus on the optimization of virtual care. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations across the U.S. has highlighted the need to promote new, innovative ways to deliver prim ary health care services, including the increased use of technology and telehealth. It has also increased the awareness of the need to reduce health disparities among minority and at- risk populations and to better address the underlying health conditions that create elevated risks for heart attacks, strokes, and earlier death rates. This request will ensure that current health centers can continue to provide essential primary health care services to their patient populations, including continuation of supplemental awards initiated in FY 2016 through FY 2019 targeting mental health services and substance use disorder services focusing on the treatment, prevention, and/or awareness of opioid abuse. The request also supports cos ts associated with the grant r eview and award process, operational site visits, information technology, and other program support costs. The FY 2022 Budget Request also supports $120 million for the FTCA Program, which is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted level. The Ending the HIV Epide mic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative is an HHS -wide effort to reduce new infections by 75 percent in the first five years of the initiative and by 90 percent over a 10- year period, with the goal of decreasing the number of new HIV infections to fewer than 3,000 per year. The first phase of the EHE initiative is focused on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), and seven states that have a substantial rural HIV burden. The HRSA Health Center Program provides HIV testing and prevention services, HIV ca re and treatment where appropriate, and also assists with responding quickly to HIV cluster detection efforts. The HRSA Health Center Programs' primary focus in the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative is on expandi ng outreach, care coordination, and access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)-related services to people at high risk for HIV transmission through selected health centers in the identified jurisdictions. In FY 2020, the first year of the Initiative, HRSA provided $54 million in resour ces to 195 health centers that received Health Center/Ryan White Program funding and/or were located in close proximity to a Ryan White Program where no jointly funded health center currently existed in the target jurisdiction. In FY 2021, HRSA anticipates awarding approximately $48 million to support additional health center participation in the targeted jurisdictions. The Budget Request level includes $152 million , including an additional $50 million in discretionary funding, which will support an additional 140 health centers, resulting in the total 73 participation of approximately 440 health centers across the country. The Health Centers Program will provide prevention and treatment services to people at high risk for HIV transmission, including Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP) -related services, outreach, and care coordination through new grant awards in areas currently served by health centers. Health centers continue to be a critical element of the health system, largely because they can provide an ac cessible and dependable source of value- based primary health care services in underserved communities. In particular, health centers emphasize coordinated primary and preventive services that promote reductions in health dispa rities for low income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities, and other underserved populations. Health centers place emphasis on the coordination and comprehensiveness of care, the ability to manage patients with multiple health car e needs, and t he use of key quality improvement practices, including HIT. The health center model also overcomes geographic, cultural, linguistic, and other barriers through a team based approach to care that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, phys ician assistan ts, nurses, dental providers, midwives, behavioral health care providers, social workers, and health educators. Health centers also reduce costs to health systems; the health center model of care has been shown to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as EDs and hospitals. In 2016, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health evaluated the total annual health care use and total health care spending of Medicaid (fee -for-service) patients seen at health centers vers us those seen at non- health center settings. 30 This study found that patients seen at a health center had lower health care utilization and spending across all services when compared to non-health center patients. This included 33% lower spending on specialty care, 25% fewer inpatient admissions, and 24% lower total spending overall. Specifically, Medicaid FFS patients seen at a health center saved nearly $2,400 in total health care spending per year when compared to those seen in a non- health center setti ng. Health centers serve 4.4 million Medicaid FFS patients. The FY 2022 Request supports the Health Center Program's achievement of its performance targets, including goals on access to affordable, accessible, quality, and cost- effective primary health care services, and the improvement of health outcomes and quality of care. The Health Center Program has established ambitious targets for FY 2022 and beyond. For low birth weight, the Program seeks to be below the national rate. This is ambitious becaus e health center s continue to serve a higher risk prenatal population than represented nationally in terms of socio-economic, health status and other factors that predispose health center patients to greater risk for LBW and adverse birth outcomes. The FY 2022 target for the program's hypertension measure is that 63 percent of adult patients with diagnosed hypertension will have blood pressure under adequate control. The FY 2022 target for the program's diabetes management measure is 67 percent of adult pa tients with typ e 1 or 2 diabetes with most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent). The Health Center Program will continue to promote efficient, value- based care, and aims to keep the ratio of medical patients per medical physicians at approximately 1,775 patients. The FY 2022 Request also supports efforts to improve the value, quality, and program integrity in all 30 Nocon, Robert S. et al. \"Health Care Use and Spending for Medica id Enrollees in F ederally Qualified Health Centers Versus Other Primary Care Settings\" American Journal of Public Health, Nov 2016 74 HRSA-funded programs that deliver direct health care. Health centers annually report on a core set of clinical perfo rmance measures that are consistent with Healthy People 2020, and include: immunizations; prenatal care; cancer screenings; cardiovascular disease/hypertension; diabetes; weight assessment and counseling for children and adoles cents; adult weight screenin g and follow up; tobacco use assessment and counseling; depression screening and follow-up; scr eening. In addition to tracking core clinical indicators, health centers report on health outcome measures (low birth weight, diabetes, and hypertension) by race/ethnicity in order to demonstrate progress towards eliminating health disparities in health outcomes. To support quali ty improvement, the Program will continue to facilitate national and State -level technical assistance and training programs that promote quality improvements in health center data and quality reporting, clinical and quality improvement, and implementation of innovative value-based, quality activities. The Program continues to promote the integration of HIT into health centers through the Health Center Controlled Network Program to assure that key safety-net providers are able to advance their operations through enhanced technology and tele-health systems. HRSA also utilizes a variety of methods to oversee the Health Center Program and to monitor Health Center Program grantees to identify potential issues, including non- compliance with program requirements and areas where technical assistance might be beneficial. HRSA accomplishes this monitoring through a variety of available resources, including the review of health center data reports, independent annual financial audits reports, routine conference call s, and site visits. HRSA's efforts to strengthen evidence-building capacity in the Health Center Program include recent enhancements and modernization to the Uniform Data System (UDS). Patient visits are now reported for both in-person and virtual visits. This data enhancement supports HRSA's efforts to better identify medically underserved population service needs and utilize new technology to improve access to care in medically underserved communities nationwide. The Health Center Pr ogram will also continue to work with the CMS and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology on HIT, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address HIV prevention and public health initiatives, and the National Institutes of H ealth on clinical practice and precision medicine, among others. In addition, the Health Center Program will continue to coordinate with CMS to jointly review section 1115 Medicaid Demonstration Waivers. The Program will continue to work closely with the Department of Justice on the FTCA Program. Additionally, the proposed Budget supports coordination with programs in the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Justice. 75 Outcomes and Outputs Tables Measure Year a nd Most Recent R esult /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) of grantees that provide the following services either on-site or by paid referral: (b) Preventive Dental Care Percentage of grantees that provide the follo wing services either on-site or by paid referral: Health/Substance Medical cost per medical visit at health centers compared to the national cost 31 FY 2018: $200 Target: Below National Cost (Discontinued) Discontinued Discontinued N/A 1.E.2:Number of medical patients per medical physician in FY 2019: 1,777 Target: 1,777 (Baseline) 1,775 1,775 Maintain 31 Measure discontinued and replaced due to data reliability, timeliness, and relevancy in a value-based health care system. 76 Measure Year a nd Most Recent R esult /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) Target 1.II.B.2 : Rate of births less than 2500 grams (low birth weight) to prenatal Health Center patients compared to the national low birth weight rate (Outcome) FY 2019: 8.0%, below national rate of 8.3% Target: Below national rate (Target Met) Below national rate Below national rate Maintain 1.II.B.3 : Percentage of adult health center patients with diagnosed hypertension whose blood pressure is under adequate control (less than 140/90) (Outcom Maintain 1.II.B.4 : Percentage of adult health center patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes with most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) under control (less than or equal to 9 percent) (Outcome) FY 2019: 68% Target: 69% (Target Not Met, but improved) 67% 67% Maintain 1.II.B.1 : Percentage of pregnant health center patients beginning prenatal care in the first trimester (Output) FY 2019: 74% Target: 73% (Target Exceeded) 73% 73% Maintain 1.II.A.1 : Percentage of Health Center patients who are at or below 200 percent of poverty (Output) FY 2019: 91% Target: 91% (Target Met) 91% 91% Maintain 1.I.A.3 : Percentage of health centers with at least one site recognized as a patient centered medical home (Output) FY 2019: 76% Target: 65% (Target Exceeded) 75% FY 2020 Final FY 2021 Enacted FY 2022 Budget Level Number of Awards 1,376 1,376 Average Award $3.6 million $3.6 million $3.6 million Range of Awards illion $400,000 - $23 million $400,000 - $23 million 78 Free Clinics Medical FY --- A uthorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 224, as amended by Public Law 111-148, Section 10608 FY 2022 Authorization ...................................................................................................... I ndefinite Allocation Method ................................................................................................................... Other P rogram Description and Accomplishments T he Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program encourages health care providers to volunteer their time at qualified free clinics by providing medical malpractice protection at sponsoring health clinics, thus expanding the capacity of the health care safety net. In many communities, free clinics assist in meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and underserved. They provide a venue for providers to volunteer their services. Most free clinics are small organizations with annual budgets of less than $250,000. I n FY 2004, Congress provided first-time funding for payments of free clinic provider's claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The appropriation established the Free Clinics Medical Malp ractice Judgment Fund and extended FTCA coverage to medical professional volunteers in free clinics in order to expand access to health care services for low -income individuals in medically underserved areas. Allocation Method: Qualifying free clinics su bmit applications to the Department of Health and Human Services to deem providers that they sponsor. Qualifyi ng free clinics (or health care facilities operated by nonprofit private entities) must be licensed or certified in accordance with applicable law regarding the provision of health services. To qualify under the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program, t he clinic cannot: accept reimbursements from any third -party payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan, or under a ny Federal or State health benefits program including Medicare or Medicaid); or impose charges on the individuals to whom the services are provided; or impose charges according to the ability of the individual involved to pay the charge. I ncreasing Acces s: In FY 2019, 12,015 health care providers received Federal malpractice insurance through the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program, slightly less than the Program target. In FY 2017, 237 clinics operated with FTCA deemed clinicians; in FY 2018, 239 clinics participated, and in FY 2019, 236 clinics participated, exceeding the program target in each year. 79 Promoting Efficiency: The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program is committed to improving overall efficiency by controlling the Federal admi nistrative costs necessary to deem each provider. By restraining these annual administrative costs, the Program is able to provide an increasing number of clinicians with malpractice coverage, thus building the free clinic workforce capacity nationwide an d increasing access to care for the target populations served by these clinics. In FY 2017 the cost was $7 per provider, which was unusually low due to no need to support system enhancement costs in FY 2017. Costs in FY 2018 were $38 per provider and in FY 2019 costs were $22 per provider. In each year, the Program performance target has been exceeded. I n FY 2020, there were no paid claims under the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program. There is 1 claim currently outstanding, and the Program Fund h as a current balance of approximately $3.6 million. F unding History FY T he FY 2022 Budget request for the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program is $1 .0 million, which is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted. The request will support the Program's continued achievement of its performance targets addressing its goal of maintaining access and capacity in the health care safety net. The funding request also includes costs associated with information technology and other program support costs. T argets for FY 2022 focus on maintaining FY 2021 target levels for the number of volunteer free clinic health care providers deemed eligible for FTCA malpractice coverage at 11,000, while also maintaining the number of free clinics operating with FTCA deemed clinicians at 220. The Program will also continue to promote efficiency by restraining growth in the annua l Federal administrative costs necessary to deem each provider, with a target of $75 administrative cost per provider in FY 2022. T he FY 2022 request will also support the Program's continued coordination and collaboration with related Federal programs in order to further leverage and promote efforts to increase the capacity of the health care safety net. Areas of collaboration include coordination with the Health Center FTCA Program, also administered by HRSA, to share program expertise. In addition, the two programs control costs by sharing a contract to process future claims, and by providing technical support and outreach. The Program will coordinate with non- profit free clinic -related umbrella groups on issues related to program information dissemination and outreach and will continue to collaborate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS 80 Office of General Counsel (HHS/OGC) to assist in drafting items including deeming applications and related policies. The Program continues to work with the HHS/OGC to answer legal technical assistance issues raised by free clinics in the Program and clinics interested in joining the Program.

Other (Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description and Accomplishments: Since its inception in 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has worked to support qualified health care providers dedicated to working in underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Across the nation, NHSC clinicians serve patients in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) - communities with limited access to health care. As of September 30, 2020, there were 7,203 primary c are HPSAs, 6,487 dental HPSAs, and 5,733 mental health HPSAs. The NHSC recruits clinicians who demonstrate a commitment to serve the Nation's medically underserved populations at NHSC -approved sites, which are located in HPSAs. NHSC- approved sites provide care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay. As of September 30, 2020, there are 18,548 NHSC-approved sites across the United States. Eligible sites includ e: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and FQHC Look- Alikes, American Indian an d Native Alaska health clinics, rural health clinics, critical access hospitals and hospitals managed or owned by the Indian Health Service (IHS), school- based clinics, mo bile units, free clinics, community mental health centers, state or local health departments, community outpatient facilities, federal facilities such as the Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, IHS, and private practices. 32 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 83 In part icular, the NHSC has partnered closely with HRSA -supported FQHCs to help meet their staffing needs. Over 60 percent of NHSC clinicians serve in Health Centers around the nation, and 15 percent of clinical staff at FQHCs are NHSC clinicians. The NHSC also places clinicians in other community-based systems of care that serve underserved populations, targeting HPSAs of greatest need. FY 2021 represented the largest field strength ever for NHSC. As of September 30, 2020, there are 16,299 primary care medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health practitioners providing service nationwide in the following programs: NHSC Scholarship Program (SP): The NHSC SP provides financial support through scholarships, including tuition, other reasonable education expenses, and a monthly living stipend to health professions students committed to providing primary care in underserved communities of greatest need. Awards are targeted to individuals who demonstrate characteristics that are indicative of success in a career in primary care in underserved communities. The NHSC SP provides a supply of clinicians who will be available over the next one to eight years, depending on the length of their education and training programs. Upon completion of training, NHSC scholar s become salaried employees of NHSC -approved sites in underserved communities. NHSC Loan Repayment Program (LRP): The NHSC LRP offers fully trained primary care clinicians the opportunity to receive assistance to pay off qualifying educational loans in exchange for service in a HPSA. In exchange for an initial two years of service, loan repayers receive up to $50,000 in loan repayment assistance. The NHSC LRP recruits clinicians as they complete training and are immediately available for service, as well as seasoned professionals seeking an opportunity to serve in the nation's underserved communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHSC has enabled the program's clinicians to be increasingly flexible in their use of telemedicine. This has, in part, resulted in more than 40 percent of NHSC applicants indicating that their site currently uses telemedicine. T he NHSC is collaborating with HRSA's Primary Care Training and Enhancement (PTCE): Training Champions Program, the Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF), and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program to bolster the primary care and behavioral health workforce in rural and underserved communities. In FY 2021, the NHSC will provide a funding priority to applicants who have completed a fellowship through the PCTE: Training Primary Care Champions Program, the AMF Program, or a postgraduate medical or dental training program funded by HRSA through the THCGME Payment Program. The PCTE: Training Primary Care Champions program trains community-based primary care professionals to lead health care tr ansformation, enhance recruitment and retention in community -based settings, and enhance academic-community partnerships to support positive community -based training experiences in underserved communities. The AMF Program trains addiction medicine special ists who work in underserved, community -based settings that integrate primary care with mental health disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) prevention and treatment servic es. 84 NHSC Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Workforce LRP: Since FY 2018, funding has been appropriated to the NHSC for the express purpose of expanding and improving access to quality opi oid and SUD treatment in rural and underserved areas nationwide. The primary purpose of this dedicated funding is to expand the availability of substa nce use disorder (SUD) treatment providers to include the SUD workforce and categories for outpatient services, including Opioid Treatment Programs, Office-based Opioid Treatme nt Facilities and Non -opioid Outpatient SUD facilities. The funding supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals needed in underserved areas to provide evidence-based SUD treatment and prevent overdose deaths. Providers receive loan repayment assistance to reduce their educational financial debt in exchange for ser vice at SUD Treatment Facilities. SU D Providers include: Allopathic/Osteopathic Physicians, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants with Drug Addiction Treatment Act 2000 Waivers Licensed or certified health professionals providing SUD services; and Licensed primary care and mental & behavioral health professionals. NHSC Rural Community LRP: A portion of the FYs 2018- through 2021 appropriations provided funding for the NHSC Rura l Community LRP, a program for providers working to combat the opioid epidemic in the nation's rural communities. The NHSC Rural Community LRP has made FY 2020 loan repayment awards in coordination with the Rural Communities Opioid Response Progr am initiative within the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) to provide evidence-based substance use treatment, assist in recovery, and to prevent overdose deaths across the nation. B oth the NHSC SUD LRP and the NHSC Rural Community LRP will continue to make FY 2021 awards to clinicians addressing the opioid crisis. N HSC and the Indian Health Service (IHS): FY s 2019 through - 2021 appropriations directed funding to support - awards in the aforementioned NHSC LRPs to both fully trained medical, nursing, dental and behavioral/mental health clinicians, and SUD providers, to deliver health care services in Indian Health Service facilities, Tribally -Operated 638 Health Programs, and Urban Indian Health Programs (ITUs) . Federal Indian Health Service C linics, Tribal Health Clinics, Urban Indian Health Clinics, and dually- funded Tribal Health Clinics/Community Health Centers are automatically designated as HPSAs. The NHSC made award s to all eligible clinicians serving in ITUs in both FY 2019 and FY 2020. It should be noted, that these entities do not need directed funding to be eligible to receive providers that are supported through NHSC scholarship and loan repayment activities. In FY 2021, NHSC set aside $15 million towards awards for providers in these entities. In FY 2022, NHSC anticipates an additional $15 million in funding for these providers. NHSC Students to Service (S2S) LRP: The NHSC S2S LRP provides loan repayment assistance of up to $120,000 to allopathic and osteopathic medical students and dental students in their last year of school in return for a commitment to provide primary health care in rural and urban HPSAs of greatest need for three years. This program was established with the goal to increase the number of physicians and dentists in the NHSC pipeline. 85 State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP): The SLRP is a federal -state partnership grant program that requires a dollar- for-dollar match from the state that enters into loan repayment contracts with clinicians who practice in a HPSA in that state. The program serves as a complement to the NHSC and provides flexibility to states to help meet their unique primary care workforce needs. States have the discretion to focus on one, some, or all of the eligible primary care disciplines eligible within the NHSC and may also include pharmacists and registered nurses. In FY 2018, HRSA opened a new SLRP competition, expanding approved disciplines to include substance use disorder counselors, an additional 5 states and one territory received awards, for a total of 43 grantees. The combination of these programs serves the immediate needs (through loan repayers) of underserved communities and supports the development of a pipeline (through Scholars and Students to Service awardees) poised to meet the needs of these communities upon completion of their trainin g. The tables below show the students in the NHSC pipeline that are training to serve the underserved and the number and type of primary care providers currently serving in the NHSC and providing care in underserved areas. States receiving funding from this opportunity are encouraged to allow health professionals to practice to the full extent of their license.

The short- term retention rate among N HSC participants who completed their service obligation in FY 2019 is 81 percent, meaning that more than 2,000 clinicians continue to provide primary care services to underserved communities 1-2 years after completing their service commitment. In FY 2019, HRS A began using a newly-developed Clinician Dashboard to calculate retention rate for NHSC providers 33. The Clinician Dashboard uses National Provider Identifier numbers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a baseline in conjunction wit h other data sources to assist in determining the current practice locations of providers who previously served in the NHSC. It allows HRSA to calculate a more accurate retention rate that is not dependent on survey response rates. 33 Bureau of Health Workfor ce Clinician Dashboards . 87 The experiences that NHSC providers have at their sites while completing their service obligations significantly influences retention among NHSC providers. The most common reasons given by participants for not remaining at their NHSC-approved site following their service com mitment were financial considerations and site operations.

The FY 2021 Omnibus, P.L. 116-260, provided mandatory resources of $310.0 million for each fiscal year through FY 2023.35 In 2022, NHSC mandatory funding will be reduced by $17.7 million through sequestration pursuant to Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA). The discretionary request includes $ 180.0 million specifically for loan repayment for clinic ians to provide opioid and substance use disorder treatment, of which $15.0 million will be for clinicians serving in ITUs, and $5.0 milli on for Maternity Care Target areas to implement requirements contained in the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act. Specifically, the Maternity Care Target areas funding will: (1) establish criteria for maternity care health professional target areas (MCTAs), that identify geographic areas within primary care healt h professional shortage areas (HPSAs) that have a shortage of maternity care health professionals; (2) identify MCTAs using the criteria established by HRSA; (3) distribute maternity c are health professionals using the newly-identified MCTAs; and (4) collect and publish data comparing the availability and need for maternity care health services in HPSAs and in areas within such HPSAs. The funding will allow HRSA's data contractors to enhance data collection capabilities and will allow State Primary Care Office grantees the ability to hire or implement additional data collection methodologies for the newly included provider types that MCTAs will track.

FY 2022 Authorization ....................................................................................................$5,663,000 Allocation Method ................................................................................ Competitive Grant/Contract Program Description and Accomplishments : T he United States spends billions of dollars in both public and private funds each year on education and training of the health workforce. Since the nation's health care system is constantly changing and preparing new providers requires long lead times, i t is critical to have high quality projections to ensure a workforce of sufficient size and skills capable of meeting the nation's health care needs. Policymakers and other decision makers need high quality information about the health workforce that incorporates up- to-date research, modeling, and trends. This information can help inform how the nation spends billions of dollars each year on the education and training of the health workforce. T he National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) co llects and analyz es health workforce data and information in order to provide national and state policy makers, researchers, and the public with information on health workforce supply and demand. NCHWA also evaluates the effectiveness of HRSA's workforce investments. NCHWA focuses on: Providing timely reports and data on the current state and trends of the U.S. health workforce; Building national capacity for health workforce data collection by working with federal agencies, professional associations, an d others to develop and promote guidelines for data collection and analysis; Improving tools for data management, analysis, modeling and projection to support research, policy analysis, and decision making, as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of workforce programs and policies; Responding to information and data needs by translating data and findings to inform policies and programs; and Analyzing grantee performance data and evaluating Bureau of Health Workforce's programs. 105 NCHWA continues to model supply and demand of health professionals across a range of health occupations, and makes health workforce information available through reports and online databases. Several publications have been released during Calendar Years 2019 through 2021 Women's Health Service Provider Projections, 2018-2030 Oral Health Workforce Projections, 2017-2030 Behavioral Health Workforce Projections, 2017-2030 Allied Health Workforce Projections, 2016-2030 NCHWA also oversees nine Health Workforce Research Centers that perform and disseminate research and data analysis on health workforce issues of national importance, and provide technical assistance to regional and local entities on workforce data collection, analysis, and reporting. 41 Together, these nine Centers examine a broad range of issues related to variou s sectors of the health care workforce, including (but not limited to) occupations in Oral Health, Long Term Services and Supports, Allied Health, Behavioral Health, emerging health workforce issues, and health equity in health workforce education and training. Research conducted by these HWRCs aims to strengthen the evidence base for effective education and training programs that can enable and empower a health workforce capable of fostering and ensuring health equity for all populations. Examples of res earch include: Looking across a range of health care professions and providers to develop a comprehensive picture of how current health workforce education and training programs incorporate consideration of health equity, including social needs, social de terminants of health, and related elements, into their programs. Developing a deeper understanding of the current behavioral health workforce and its readiness related to addressing the current opioid public health emergency. Investigating in real- time the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on sectors of the U.S. health workforce, such as long term services and support occupations. Evaluating health workforce education and training programs to understand their impact on how increasing access to primary care; mitigating provider shortages in underserved areas; delivering integrated primary, behavioral, and oral health care; addressing health workforce diversity; and strengthening community/provider partnerships. In FY 2020, NCHWA continued to develop a proje ction model that allows a more sophisticated analysis and projection of health workforce supply and demand, taking into account changing national demographics, the demand for health care services, and the impact thos e changes have on the delivery of health care. NCHWA anticipates publicly releasing a new interactive projection visualization tool in FY 2021. In an effort to better understand and demonstrate the outcomes of BHW programs, NCHWA has been developing and publicly releasing Program Accomplishment and Outcomes reports for grant programs overseen by the Bureau of Health Workforce. The eleven reports released in FY 2021 highlight the ways in which BHW programs have impacted access, supply, distribution and quality of the health workforce. 41 In FY 2019, one Health Workforce Resource Center administered by NCHWA was funded from the Bureau of Primary Health Care. 106 F unding History FY Amount 2022 Budget Request for NCHWA of $5.7 million is the same as the FY Enacted level. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, NCHWA will continue to deliver reports and evaluations that support the Administration's goal of better understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. health care workforce, as well as advancing current efforts to understand and document BHW 's role in enhancing access, supply, distribution and quality of the US health workforce. Additionally, the NCHWA will continue its work on improving access to behavioral health services, including substance use treatment and prevention services. This includes collecting data and conducting studies on models of behavioral health care delivery systems, the extent of their use, and the staffing ratios required to implement those systems. This new information will soon be incorporated into NCHWA's projection model to enhance its capabilities with emerging models of care. Further, the NCHWA will continue to disseminate information from and utilize data within the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, to help better understand the nation's nursing profession, as well as federal investments in nursing education and training. Finally, NCHWA will recompete its cooperative agreement for the Health Workforce Research Centers in FY 2022.

The purpose of the AHEC Program is to develop and enhance education and training networks within communities, academic institutions, and community -based organizations. In turn, these networks develop the health care workforce, broaden the distribution of the health workfor ce, enhance health care quality, and improve health care delivery to rural and underserved areas and populations. AHECs develop and maintain a diverse health care workforce and broaden the distribution of the health workforce. The redesigned AHEC Program invests in inter professional networks that address social determinants of health and incorporate field placement programs for rural and medically -underserved populations. I n Academic Year 2019 -2020, the AHEC Program supported various types of pre-pipeline, pipeline, and continuing education training activities for thousands of trainees across the country. AHEC grantees implemented 2,003 unique continuing education courses that were delivered to 155,249 practicing professionals nationwide, 75,708 of whom (49 percent) were concurrently employed in medically underserved communities. They also enhanced or developed 1,829 courses and training activities for 32,240 AHEC scholars and other health professionals. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, HRSA provided supplemental funding to 43 AHEC grantees to support telehealth activities. Grantees had about one month in Academic Year 2019-2020 to implement these activities. In this short amount of time, grantees were able to successfully offer 31 continuing education courses and 19 courses and training activities using these funds. These courses are included in the totals reported above. AHEC grantees partnered with 5,092 training sites to provide 31,025 clinical training experiences to student trainees (e. g., ambulatory practice sites, physician offices, and hospitals). 127 Approximately 59 percent of these training sites were primary care settings, 67 percent were located in medically underserved communities, 45 percent were in rural areas, and 17 percent offered COVID -19 rela ted services.

The AHEC Scholars Program is an interprofessional educational and training program targeted towards health professions students and consi sts of a speciali zed curriculum focused on six core topic areas and health care delivery within rural/underserved areas and populations. The six core topic areas include: (a) interprofessional education, (b) social determinants of health, (c) behavioral health integration , (d) cultural competency, (e) practice transformation, and (f) current and emergent health issues. Approximately 38 percent of AHEC Scholars came from a rural background and nearly 46 percent came from a disadvantaged background. Approximately 50 percent of AHEC Scholars received training in a rural setting, 61 percent in a primary care setting, and 90 percent in a medically underserved community. Over 33 percent of AHEC Scholars received training on integrating behavioral health in pr imary care and 17 percent received training in substance use treatment. Nearly 100 percent of AHEC scholars received training on interprofessional education, logging close to 380,000 hours of training on this topic. The AHEC Scholars program is a two -year commitment. In AY 2019-2020, 1,347 AHEC Scholars completed the program. Nearly 36 percent intend to work or pursue further training in a medically underserved community, 25 percent in a primary care setting, and 24 percent in a rural area. The percent o f AHEC program completers practicing in medically underserved communities and/or rural areas is collected one-year after program completion. This data will be available next year and reported as part of the 2023 Congressional Justification. HRSA recentl y completed a five- year review of AHEC data. Between Academic Year 2014 - 2019, AHEC trained over 1.8 million individuals and recorded over 1.7 million program completers. Forty -two percent of AHEC's program completers were from a rural background, 40 percent were from disadvantaged backgrounds, and 29 percent were underrepresented minorities. Over this five -year period, AHEC delivered more than 21,000 continuing education courses, which provided training to nearly one million health professionals. Approximately 92 percent of AHEC trainees participated in multi-disciplinary, non-degree training programs such as enrichment activities; college academic support; community -based outreach and education; pre-college or pre- diploma/certification preparation; summe r programs; and t raining activities for current health profession students, residents, and fellows. Each of the five years, 62 percent or more of AHEC's experiential training sites were in medically underserved communities, 60 percent or more were in primary care settings, and 40 percent or more were in rural areas.

Cooperative Agreement Description and Accomplishments: The Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) improves health care for older adults by developing a health care workforce to provide value- based care that improves health outcomes for older adults by integrating geriatrics and primary care delivery sites/systems. The Program maximizes patient and family engagement in health care decisions and provides training focusing on interprofessional and team -based care across the educational continuum (students, faculty, providers, direct service workers, patients, families, and lay and family caregivers). An essential component of the program is developing academic- primary care -community -based partnerships to address gaps in health care for older adults, and transforming clinical training environments into integrated geriatrics and primary care sites/systems to become age- friendly health systems and dementia-friendly communities. FY FY 2021 Year 2019 -2020, GWEP grantees provided training for 56,603 students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics -focused degree programs, field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees, 46,107 gr aduated or completed their trainin g during the current academic year. GWEP grantees partnered with 302 health care delivery sites (e.g., hospitals, long- term care facilities, and academic institutions) to provide clinical training experiences to trainees. Approximately 42 percent of thes e sites were located in medically underserved communities, and 45 percent were primary care settings. 132 With regard to the continuing education of the current workforce, 290,161 faculty and practicing professionals participated in 2,068 unique continuing education courses offered by GWEP grantees, 906 of which were specifically focused on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. More than 400 continuing education courses used COVID telehealth funding which reached over 54,000 individuals. The redesign of the GWEP program in FY 2019 shifts its focus to transforming clinical training environments into integrated geriatrics and primary care systems to become age-friendly health systems that incorporate the principles of value- based care and alternative- paymen t models (e.g., Advanced Alternative Payment Models [AAPMs], bundled payment, Comprehensive Primary Care Plus [CPC+], etc.). As a result of the redesign, GWEP grantees developed or enhanced and implemented 5,853 differe nt curricular activities. Most of these were new continuing education courses, academic courses, and workshops, which together reached 205,322 people. Finally, with regard to faculty development, results showed that GWEP grantees supported 448 different faculty -focused training programs and activities during the academic year, reaching 10,872 faculty -level trainees. In FY 2021, the GWEP program received an additional $2,000,000 in funding. The funding will provide COVID-19 specific education and training to the nursing home workforce and to improve care to nursing home residents. The goal of this program is to 1) educate and train the nursing home workforce, to care for nursing home residents and their families and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery phase, and 2) to partner with nursing homes and community-based organizations to address gaps in health care for nursing home residents, promote age-friendly nursing homes, and address the social determinants of health. Approximately 10 grants will be funded. In FY 2022, HRSA anticipates funding an additional year for the 10 FY 2021 supplemental awards. The National and Regional Projections of Supply and Demand for Geriatricians: 2013-2025 report by HRSA's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis projected demand for geriatricians will exceed supply, resulting in a national shortage of 26,980 full time equivalent positions in 2025. 57 The report states all regions of the U.S. are projected to have a 2025 shortage of geriatricians, although the degree of shortage in each region is variable.58 The education and training of health professionals in the area of geriatrics are hindered by a shortage of faculty, inadequate and variable academic curricula and clinical experiences, and a lack of opportunities for advanced training. In order to address these issues, faculty with expertise in geriatrics are needed to train the workforce to provide specialized care to improve health outcomes for older adults. Consequently, in FY 2019, H RSA funded the Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACA) Program to support the career development of junior faculty in geriatri cs at accredited schools of allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, nursing, social work, psychology, dentistry, 57 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Adminis tration, National Ce nter for Health Workforce Analysis. 2017.

Faculty with expertise in geriatrics are needed to train the workforce and provide specialized care to improve health outcomes for older adults. Under the GACA program, career development awards were made to support individual junior facul ty who will provide interprofessional clinical training and become leaders in academic geriatrics. The goals of the program are for the GACA candidate to develop the necessary skills to lead health care transformation in a variety of settings. These settings include rural and/or medically underserved settings, as well as age-friendly settings that provide interprofessional train ing in clinical geriatrics. I n Academic Year 2019 -2020, GACA supported the career development of 26 junior faculty in geriatrics from the following disciplines: geriatric psychiatry, social work, addiction counseling, family medicine, internal medicine, geriatrics medicine, general d entistry, advanced practice nursing, pharmacy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. They had 2,634 contact hours in a primary care setting, 941 contact hours in a medically underserved community, and 503 contact hours in a rural area. The majority of GACA recipients provided clinical services in a primary care setting (23) and/or a medically underserved community (14). There were 10 in rural settings. There were 34 articles published and 62 conference presentations. Approximately 58 percent of GACA awardees received training in telehealth, and 31 percent received training in opioid use treatment. Furthermore, 42 percent of GACA faculty received COVID- 19 related training. G ACA awardees developed or enhanced and implemented 363 different curricula r activities. The delivery modes used to offer course or training activities were classroom -based, distance learning, hybrid, clinical rotation, experiential/field-based, grand rounds, and simulation- based training. These together reached 18,692 people. With regard to faculty instruction, GACA awardees offered 307 courses during the academic year, reaching 14,692 students and clinicians with the delivery mode used to offer course including classroom-based, clinical rotation, hybrid, archived/self -paced d istance learning, real-time/live distance learning, and other types.

FY 2022 Agreement/Contract P rogram Description and Accomplishments: T he purpose of Behavioral Health Workforce Development Programs is to develop and expand the behavioral health workforce serving populations across the lifespan, including in rural and medically underserved areas . Opioid use and its resulting deat hs have impacted the lives of individuals and families, crippled communities, and depleted limited resources. H RSA uses projections data and other information about the behavioral health workforce to develop and adjust programs to ensure that they are responsive to the Nation's emerging needs. For example, a recent Kaiser Family Foundation Issue Brief 63 explored the dual impacts of efforts to reduce the spread of COVID -19 on behavioral health: the economic downturn has increased stress and vulnerability t o behavioral health conditions at the same time isolating and quarantining have reduced access to behavioral health services: \"A broad body of research links social isolation and loneliness to poor mental health; and recent data shows that significantly higher shares of people who were sheltering in place (47%) reported negative mental health effects resulting from worry or stress related to coronavirus than among those not sheltering in place (37%). Negative mental health effects due to social isolation ma y be particularly pronounced among older adults and households with adolescents, as these groups are already at risk for depression or suicidal ideation. Research shows that job loss is associated with increased depress ion, anxiety, distress, and low self-esteem and may lead to higher rates of substance use disorder and suicide. Recent polling data shows that more than half of the people who lost income or employment reported negative mental health impacts from worry or stress over 62 The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114- 255) authorized $50 million through FY 2022. 63 Panchal, Nirmita, et a l. The Implications of COVID -19 for Mental Health and Substance Use , Kaiser Family Foundation . Published April 21, 2020. 139 coronavirus; and lower income people report higher rates of major negative mental health impacts compared to higher income people.\" The need for a behavioral health workforce is even more glaring in the COVID-19 context. Suspected overdoses nationally jumped 18 percent in March 2 020, compared with last year, 29 percent in April and 42 percent in May 2020, according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (www.odmap.org), a federal initiative that collects data from ambulance teams , hospitals and police. HRSA's 2020 Behavioral Health Workforce Projections Report estimated national- level health workforce needs for several behavioral health occupations between 2017 and 2030. The report estimated the demand for addiction counselors is expected to increase 15 percent by 2030, with demand exceeding supply and leading to a deficit of addiction counselors of approximately 11,530 FTE. Also, the report estimated that by 2030, the supply of psychiatrists is expected to decrease by approxim ately 20 percent. 64 The COVID epidemic exacerbates an existing imbalance in the supply of and demand for mental and behavioral health providers across the US. Future updates to these health workforce projections will be posted on HRSA's website. By 2025, HRSA's Behavioral Health Workforce Ed ucation and Training (BHWET) Program is projected to eliminate over 40% of the projected shortfall of behavioral health providers, and provide thousands of new paraprofessionals to enhance the nation's health workforce capacity in critical areas of need. Since the program began, 6,787 new paraprofessionals have begun work as community health workers, peer paraprofessionals, and substance use/addictions workers. The Behavioral Health Workforce Development budget line supports the Behavioral Health Workfo rce Education and Training (BHWET) Program, the Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program, the Opioid Workforce Expansion Programs (OWEP), the Behavioral Health Workforce Development Technical Assistance and Evaluation (BHWD TAE) Program, the Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) Program, the Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment (ISTP) Program, a loan repayment program for the Substance Use Disorder Treatment Workforce, and the Opioid- Impacted Family S upport Program (OIFSP). 64 Health Resources and Services Administration/National Center for Health Workforce Analysis; Substa nce Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Office of Policy, Planning, and Innovation.2020. Behavioral Health Workforce Projections, 2030 Graduate Psychology Education $18,000,000Fi Behaviora Behavioral Health Workforce Development (BHWD) programs support a number of activities to expand the behavioral workforce as well as enhance the training of the pipeline and current workforce. In Fiscal Year 2022, these programs will support a number of activities, which are described below. BHWET Program: This program increases the number of behavioral health providers entering and continuing practice, with special emphasis on prevention and clinical intervention and treatment for those at risk of developing mental and substance use disorders, and the involvement of families in the prevention and treatment of behavioral health conditions. In FY 2021, HRSA will support approximately 135 BHWET Professional grantees. In Academi c Year 2019-2020, the BHWET Program supported training for 6,119 individuals. Of the total students supported, 3,254 graduate- level social workers, psychologists, school and clinical counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and marriage and family ther apists were trained as well as 2,865 students training to become behavioral health paraprofessionals (such as community health workers, outreach workers, social services aides, mental health w orkers, substance abuse/addictions workers, youth workers, and peer paraprofessionals). Nearly 46 percent of the BHWET trainees received training in substance use treatment and 29 percent received training in opioid use treatment. Furthermore, 44 percent received training in behavioral health primary care integrati on. By the end of the Academic Year, 4,449 students graduated from these degree and certificate-bearing programs and entered the behavioral health workforce. Upon program completion, 22 percent of students intended to pursue training and/or employment to serve at -risk children, adolescents, and transitional-aged youth. Further, upon graduation, 49 percent of students intended to pursue training and/or employment in a medically underserved area and/or rural setting. BHWET grantees partnered with 2,439 training sites (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites, and academic institutions) to provide 6,392 clinical training experiences for 65 Includes appropriations from both MBHET and BWHET lines. 141 BHWET student trainees. Approximately 72 percent of the se training sites were located in medically underserved communities where trainees provided over 1.4 million hours of behavioral health services to patients and clients. Over 30 percent of the sites offered opioid use treatment services and 50 percent of the sites offered substance use treatment services. Training at partnered sites incorporated interdisciplinary team -based approaches, where 15,481 students, residents and/or fellows from a variety of professions and disciplines were trained on teams with BHWET students. BHWET grantees used grant funds to develop, enhance, and implement 1,959 behavioral health- related courses and training activities, reaching over 54,000 students and advanced trainees (i.e., psychology interns and fellows and psychiatry residents). BHWET- Community Improvement Program (CIP ): This new program seeks to enhance community-based training partnerships for students preparing to become behavioral health professionals and paraprofessionals focused on improving health equity. OWEP Program: In FY 2019, HRSA awarded approximately $69 mil lion for the Opioid Workforce Expansion Programs (OWEP) for Professionals and Paraprofessionals. The OWEP program allows eligible institutions to improve community -based training for students preparing to become behavioral health professionals and parapro fessionals focused on opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. These awards support HHS's priority to end the opioid crisis. In Academic Year 2019 -2020, the OWEP Program supported training for 1,001 individuals. Of the total students supported, 510 graduate- level social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, addiction counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and marriage and family therapists were trained as well as 491 students training to become behavioral health paraprofessionals (such as peer paraprofessionals, community health workers, outreach workers, behavioral health aides, mental health workers, and substance abuse/addictions workers). Over 82 percent of the OWEP trainees received training in substance use treatment and nearly 86 percent received training in opioid use treatment. Furthermore, approximately 34 percent received training in behavioral health primary care integration and 40 percent received training in teleh ealth. By the end of the Academic Year, 537 students graduated from these degree and certificate-bearing programs and entered the behavioral health workforce. Moreover, upon graduation, 45 percent of OWEP students intended to pursue training and/or employment in a medically underserved area and 20 percent intended to pursue training and/or employment in a primary care setting. Among OWEP paraprofessional students who completed their program, 17 percent intended to become State certified paraprofessionals . OWEP grantees partnered with 457 training sites (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites, and academic institutions) to provide 881 clinical training experiences for OWEP student trainees. Approximately 76 percent of these training sites were located in medically underserved communities where trainees provided over 250,000 hours of 142 behavioral health services to patients and clients. Approximately 58 percent of the training sites offered opioid use treatment services and 75 percent offered substance- use treatment services. Training at partnered sites in corporated interdisciplinary team- based approaches, where 1,970 students, residents and/or fellows from a variety of professions and disciplines were trained on teams with OWEP students. OWEP grantees used grant funds to develop, enhance, and implement 281 behavioral health- related courses and training activities, reaching over 7,180 students and advanced trainees (i.e., psychology interns and fellows and psychiatry residents). The Behavioral Health W orkf orce Development Technical Assistance and Evaluatio n (BHWD TAE) Program: This program develops and provides tailored technical assistance (TA) to current and future grant recipients in the BHWET-Professionals, BHWET -Paraprofessionals, OWEP- Professiona ls, OWEP -Paraprofessionals, and GPE Program. This program will fund one award with a $2.5 million investment. Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) Program: The AMF pr ogram seeks to increase the number of board certified addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry specialists trained in providing interprofessional behavioral health services, including OUD and SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services, in underserved, community- based settings. Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program (ISTP) : In FY 2021, HRSA will award approximately $10 million to support approximately 4 awardees to expand the number of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, and social workers trained to provide mental health and SUD services in underserved community -based settings that integrate primary care and mental health and SUD services. Opioid-Impacted Family Support Program (OIFSP): In FY 2021, HRSA anticipates making $16.8 million via continuation awards and additional support to grantees. OIFSP seeks to train paraprofessionals to support children and families impacted by OUDSUD in underserved areas. The program will also provide professional development opportunities and educational support to increase the number of para professional trainees receiving a certificate upon completion of the program. Loan Repayment Program for Substance Use Disorder Treatment Workforce : This Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program provides for the repayment of educational loans for individuals working in a full- time SUD treatment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. In FY 2022, SUD treatment workforce loan repayment participants will be fulfilling part of their required SUD treatment service commitments, and HRSA anticipates making 112 award s with approximately $28 million in funding in FY 2021. The Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program: This program supports innovative doctoral-level health psychology programs that foster an interprofessional approach to providing 143 behavioral health and substance use prevention and treatment services in high need and high demand areas throu gh academic and community partnerships. Through these efforts, the GPE Program transforms clinical training environments and aligns with HRSA's mission to improve health outcomes and address health disparities through access to quality services, a skilled health workforce, and innovative, high-value programs. In FY 2022, HRSA anticipates making approximately $25 million in new awards to 55 recipients. In Academic Year 2019 -2020, the GPE Program provided stipend support to 251 students participating in practice, internships, or post-doctoral residency programs in psychology. The majority o f students who received a stipend were trained in medically underserved communities (93 percent) and/or a primary care setting (77 percent). Of the 94 students who completed GPE-supported programs, 79 percent intended to become employed or pursue further training in medically underserved communities and 41 percent intended to become employed or pursue further training in primary care settings. GPE grantees partnered with 210 sites (e.g., hospitals, ambulatory practice sites, and academic institutions) to provide 829 clinical training experiences for psychology graduate students as well as 3,358 interprofessional team- based care trainees who participated in clinical training along with the psychology graduate students. Approximately 89 percent of these training sites were located in medically underserved communities and 73 percent were primary care and/or rural settings. Approximately 77 percent of the sites offered substance use treatment services and 83 percent offered telehealth services. The future targets for the GPE program take into account the timing of the psychology internship match and GPE funding. Because the annual psychology match for the next academic year occurs in early spring and grant funds are allocated in September, GPE grantees would have already had interns match prior to funding; therefore, almost a one-year delay occurs between the start of the next academic year and this program's funding cycle.

The progr ams aim to improve the health of communities by increasing the number and quality of public health and preventive medicine personnel who can address public health needs and advance preventive medicine practices. P rogram FY 2020 Final FY 2021 Enacted FY Health Training Preventive Medicine Residency Program Health Training Centers (PHTC) Program: The PHTC Program funds schools and programs of public health to expand and enhance training opportunities focused on the technical, scientific, managerial and leadership competencies and capabilities of the cu rrent and future public health workforce, including regional centers. The PHTC Program aims t o strengthen the public health workforce through the provision of education, training and consultation to state, local, and tribal health departments to improve the capacity and quality of a broad range of public health personnel to carry out core public health functions by providing education, training and consultation to these public health personnel. The primary target for education and training 149 through the PHTC Program are frontline public health workers, middle managers, and staff in other parts of the public health system. The National Coordinating Cente r (NCC)'s purpose was to provide national coordination and technical assistance to the 10 Regional PHTCs . Instead of developing a new iteration of the NCC, HRSA redesigned the Regional PHTC program. HRSA has funded 10 PHTCs, one for each HHS region , to e nsure that the United States and its territories and jurisdictions have access to quality public health workforce education and training. Each Regional PHTC encompasses a designated geographic area or medically underserved population that provides special ized technical assistance reflective of that Region's unique needs. In Academic Year 2019 -2020, Regional PHTCs partnered with 278 sites to provide more than 345 clinical training experiences to student trainees (e.g., local health departments, academic institutions, and community -based organizations). Approximately 74 percent of these training sites were l ocated in medically underserved communities and 29 percent were located in primary care settings. With regard to the continuing education (CE) of the current workforce, PHTC grantees delivered 2,779 unique CE courses to 307,750 trainees during the academi c year, approximately 25 percent of whom were practicing professionals concurrently employed in medically underserved communities. Over 6,000 instructional hours for continuing education were offered in the current academic year. Eligible Entities: Health professions schools, including accredited schools or programs of public health, health administration, preventive medicine, or dental public health or schools providing health management programs; academic health centers; State or local go vernments; or any other appropriate public or private nonprofit entity that prepares and submits an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.

Formula Grant Program Description and Accomplishments: The Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP), which began in 2003, seeks to increase the number of qualified nurse faculty by providing funding to accredited schools of nursing to establish and operate a student loan fund and provide loans to students enrolled in advanced education nursing degree programs who are committed to becoming nurse faculty. In exchange for completion of up to four years of post-graduation full-time nurse faculty employment in an accredited school of nursing, the program authorizes cancelation of up to 85 percent of any such student loan (plus interest thereon). In Academic Year 2019 -2020, 45 schools received new NFLP awards. Awardees supported 2,270 nursing students pursuing graduate level degrees with the intent of serving as nurse faculty. By the end of the Academic Year, 659 trainees graduated, 89 percent of whom intended to teach nursing. The number of schools receiving a new NFLP award does not equate to the number of schools providing NFLP loans to graduate-level nursing students. New NFLP awards are made to eligible new applicants (with no current NFLP award) and continuing applicants (with current NFLP award), who apply for the funding annually. In order to receive a new NFLP award, continuing applicants must meet certain criteria with regard to program compliance and loan fund balances. However, even schools that do not receive new awards may continue making loans from the student loan fund accounts they have already established. NFLP grantees are expected to continue conducting training activity and maintaining the loan fund account throughout the duration of the project. In FY 2022, HRSA plans to make 80 new awards to new and continuing NFLP applicants. Eligible Entity: Accr edited schools of nursing that offer advanced nursing education degree progra m(s) that prepare graduate students for roles as nurse educators. 168 Funding H istory FY Amount The FY 2022 Budget Request for Nurse Faculty Loan Program of $28.5 million is the same as the FY 2021 Enacted level.

(Competitive Awards to Individuals) Program Description and Accomplishments: HRSA's nursing and primary care projections generally indicate that the supply of nurses will outpace demand at a national level in 2030. However, maldistribution of nurses is projected to be a continued problem. In addition, projections at the national- level mask a distributional imbalance of registered nurses (RN) at the state- level. Specifically, seven states are projected to experience a shortage of RNs by 2030. 77 Furthermore, as the Administration seeks to continue to address the opioid epidemic and other substance use disorders across the nation, the Nurse Corps program is critical to ensure access to high quality adequate behavioral health nursing workforce. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new layer of challenges to the preservation and expansion of the nursing workforce. Stress and burnout among the nursing workforce are among the most pressing concerns. Gaps in personal protective equipment, the risks of acquiring COVID-19, and concerns about transmitting the virus to family and loved ones can all contribute to burnout and an interest in changing to other careers. 78 Nurses have been reported to experience stress associated with separation from family, sleep deprivation and heavy workloads created by health system demand and staff shortages. 79 Nurses serving throughout the country, especially those on the front lines battling this pandemic are seeing an increased demand for their services. The Nurse Corps addresses (1) the distribution of nurses by supporting nurses and nursing students committed to working in communit ies with inadequate access to care; (2) access to 77 DHHS (US), Health Resources and S ervices Administration, National Center for Health Workforce Analys is.

In exchange for scholarships or educational loan repayment, Nurse Corps members fulfill their service obligation by working in Critical Shortage Facilities (CSFs) located in health professional shortage areas and medicall y underserved communities around the nation, which include rural communities and other identified geographic areas with populations that lack access to primary care and behavioral health services. As of September 30, 2020, over three- quarters of the Nurse Corps providers were serving in community-based settings and 22 percent served in rural communities. The Nurse Corps Program includes: Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP): Nurse Corps LRP, which began in 1988, aims to assist in the recruitment and retention of professional RNs, including advanced practice RNs (APRNs), (i.e., nurs e practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, clinical nurs e specialists) who are dedicated to working in CSFs or as faculty in eligible schools of nursing. The Nurse Corps LRP decreases the economic barriers associated with pursuing careers in CSFs or in academic nursing by repaying 60 percent of the principal and interest on nursing education loans in exchange for two years of full- time service at a CSF or in academic nursing. The Nurse Corps Scholarship Program (SP ): Nurse Corps SP, which began in 2002, awards scholarships to individuals who are enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an accredited school of nursing in exchange for a service commitment of at least two years in a CSF after graduation. The Nurse Corps SP awards reduce the financial barrier to nursing education for all levels of professional nursing students and increase the pipeline of nurses who will serve in CSFs. The Nurse Corps performance measures gauge these programs' contribution towards improving access to health care and improving the health care systems through the recruitment and retention of nurses working in CSFs. In FY 2020, 58 percent of Nurse Corps LRP participants extended their service commitment for an additional year, exceeding the 52 percent target; and in FY 2020, 84 percent of Nurse Corps participants were retained in service at a CSF for up to two years beyond the completion of their Nurse Corps service commitment. 80 In addition, in FY 2020, 96 percent of Nurse Corps SP awarde es are pursuing their baccalaureate degree or advanced practice degree. In FY 2021, HRSA plans to continue directing up to 20 percent of scholarship and loan repayment awards to NPs specializing in psychiatric-mental health with the goal of leveraging 80 In FY 2020, HRSA began using the \"Clinician Dashboard\" to calculate the retention rate. The Clinician Dashboard is a data visualizatio n tool that includes data on clinicians with NPI numbers supported by the National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps. 172 HRS A funding to address the opioid crisis. In FY 2021, Nurse Corps will fund an estimated 252 scholarship (new and continuation) and 753 loan repayment (new and continuation) awards. Additionally, Nurse Corps supports increasing the skilled workforce of women's health nurses who are trained to provide care for women, and practice in rural and underserved communities. Maternal mortality and morbidity are key indicators of women's health worldwide. Each year more than 300,000 women across the globe die from complications associated with pregnancy or childbirth. 81 In 2015, the U.S. ranked 46th among the 181 countries with a maternal mortality rate that is among the highest of developed countries.82 Too often, women cannot initiate prenatal care within the fir 83st tr imester of their pregnancy due to lack of access to providers or coverage for services. Provider availability, knowledge, training, and preparedness, as well as access t o life- saving medication and tools are factors that impact high maternal mortality rates. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, HRSA plans to expand the set aside funding for women's and maternal health services up to $5M each for scholarship and loan repayment awards for the funding of women's health NPs, certified nurse midwifery (CNM), and certified obstetrics and gynecology RNs that was piloted in FY 2020. This proposal is in support of the Improve Access to Maternity Care Act 42 USC 201. Eligible Entities: Eligible participants for the Nurse Corps LRP are U.S. citizens (either U.S. born or naturalized), U.S. nationals or lawful permanent residents with a current license to practice as a registered nurse who are employed full time (at least 32 hours per week) at a public or private CSF or at an accredited, public or private school of nursing. Eligible participants for the Nurse Corps SP are U.S. citizens (either U.S. born or naturalized), U.S. nationals or lawful permanent residents enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an accredited diploma, associate or collegiate (bachelors, master's, doctoral) school of nursing program.

FY 2022 Authorization ................................................................................................$325,000,000 Allocation Method ..................................................................................... Formula Based Payment Program Description and Accomplishments: The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program was first established in 1999 and it supports graduate medical education in freestanding children's teaching hospitals. CHGME Payment Program helps eligible hospitals maintain GME programs to support graduate training for physicians to provide quality care to children. It supports the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhances the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. A sufficient and appropriate health workforce, efficient organization of health care teams, and training in value-based models of care are all critical components to supporting new models of care that drive value and quality throughout the entire system. In FY 2021, the CHGME Payment Program implemented the third year of the Quality Bonus System (QBS), authorized by statute to allow the Secretary of HHS to distribute bonus payments to participating CHGME hospitals that meet quality standards specified by the Secretary. The goal of the QBS is to recognize and incentivize awardees with high quality training t o meet the pediatric workforce needs of the nation. The CHGME QBS is the first of its kind for any federal GME payment program and responds to changes occurring in the larger health care arena. The CHGME QBS is the only flexibility allowed in the legisla tion in the CHGME Payment Program in how payments can be distributed. The FY 2021 and FY 2022 CHGME QBS payments aim to incentivize individual level reporting for all residents supported by the CHGME Payment Program. In order to qualify for the QBS payment, awardees must complete individual level documentation for all residents supported by the CHGME Payment Program in the FY 2021 and FY 2022 Annual Performance AY 2021-2022). In FY 2022, HRSA will implement a pay for performance QBS based on the recommendations and data collected through an evaluation contract with the George Washington University. The CHGME QBS will link bonus payments with measures that address 176 issues of access related to general shortages and mal- distribution of generalists and subspecialists, including in rural and urban underserved areas, efforts to assure a diverse and inclusive pediatric workforce, and educational priorities that prepare all pediatricians to practice as part of a care team. The CHGME Pa yment Program supports the training of residents in graduate medical education in freestanding children's teaching hospitals and supports a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Assessment conducted annually to verify the number of FTE resident counts reported by eligible awardees. In FY 2020, the CHGME Payment Program distributed $323,713,555 to 59 eligible awardees, including $1,589,804 in QBS payments to 29 awardees who met the eligibility requirements. For FY 2021, the CHGME Payment Program will award $332,470,465 to the same 59 eligible awardees including a QBS payment for those who meet the QBS eligibility criteria. For FY 2022, the CHGME Payment Program plans on the same level funding as the prior fiscal year and number of eligible awardees. The CHGME Paymen t Program has an annual project period from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. In FY 2020, 59 children's hospitals received CHGME funding. During FY 2019 (AY 2019- 2020), the most recent year for which FTE information was reported, the CHGME hospitals trained 7,757 resident full- time equivalents (FTEs). 84 Among these FTEs, 41 percent were pediatric residents, 32 percent were pediatric subspecialty residents, and 27 percent were residents training in other primary disciplines such as family medicine. During Academic Year 2019 -2020, the most recent year for which performance information is available, CHGME -funded hospitals served as sponsoring institutions for 42 residency programs and 252 fellowship programs. In addition, they served as major participating rotation sites for 628 additional residency and fellowship programs. CHGME supported the training of 5,433 pediatric residents that included general pediatrics residents, as well as residents from seven types of combined pediatrics programs (e.g., internal medicine/ pediatrics). Additionally, 3,055 pediatric medical subspecialty residents, 322 pediatric surgical subspecialty residents, and 403 adult and pediatric dentistry residents were trained. CHGME funding was also responsible for the training of 4,037 adult medical and surgical specialty residents such as family medicine residents who rotate through children's hospitals for pediatrics training. The total number of funded residents and fellows during Academic Year 2019-2020 was 13,250. During their training, these medical residents and fellows provided care during more than 1.6 million patient encounters in primary care settings in addition to providing over 4.7 million patient contact hours in medically underserved communities. Of the full-time residents and fellows who completed their training during Academic Year 2019- 2020, approximately 61 percent of these CHGME-funded physicians chose to remain and practice in the state where they completed their residency training. Among 358 health care delivery sites utilized for residency training, 44 percent provided telehealth services, 22 percent offered substance use treatment services, and 26 percent offered COVID -19 related services. 84 Each of the children's hospitals report the number of full -time equivalent residents trained during the latest filed (completed) Medicare Cost Report period. 177 Approximately 26 percent of residents received training in opioid use treatment, 34 percent received training in telehealth, and 52 percent received COVID -19 related training.

Submit an annual report on the status and expansion of GME in their institutions. Fundi ng 2022 Budget Request for the CHGME program of $350.0 million is the same as the FY 2021 Enacted level. The Budget request enables HRSA to continue to support approximately 7,757 physicians FTEs for direct and indirect medical expenses for graduate medical education. Direct medical education spending includes expenditures related to stipends and fringe benefits for residents, salaries and fringe benefits of supervising faculty, costs associated with p roviding the GME training programs and institutional overhead costs. Indirect medical education spending includes expenditures associated with the productivity of the hospital staff as they assist in training residents, and the processing of additional diagnostic tests that residents may order during their clinical experience. The FY 2022 funding request will support the FTE resident verification through an annual FTE Assessment contract to ensure funded FTEs counts are reported correctly and are not funded by other federal programs to avoid an overlap in payments. The funding will also support costs associated with the award process, program performance reviews, QBS eligibility reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. The funding will further support 178 additional information technology enhancements that ensure accurate certification of FTE counts and analysis of QBS data needed to determine payments.

Teaching Health Centers (THCs) specifically have been shown to attract residents from rural and/or disadvantaged backgrounds who are more inclined to practice in underserved areas than those from urban and economically advantaged backgrounds.94 In a national census of third- year family medicine residents, those who trained in THCs were more likely to plan to work in safety net clinics than residents who did not train in these centers.95 Unli ke most Federal funding for graduate medical education (GME), THCGME payments support training in community-based ambulatory care settings, as opposed to in- patient care settings in hospitals. Although health centers receive federal funding to improve access to care, they often have difficulty recruiting and retaining primary care professionals.96 Community health centers are also generally smaller organizations with smaller ope rating margins compared to teaching hospitals. The THCGME Program is uniquely positioned to meet these recruitment and retention needs by providing funding to support residents training in underserved communities. Without THCGME funding, these additional residency positions would be challenging to maintain, resulting in a decrease in physicians and dentists available to serve rural and underserved communities. A sufficient and appropriate health workforce, efficient organization of health care teams, and training in value-based models of care are all critical components to ensure value and quality throughout the entire system. Health professions training progra ms such as the THCGME are essential player s in value-based transformation of the healthcare system. Based on recent research demonstrating overall health care cost savings when patients are served in community health centers, the patient care provided by THC residents could yield up to $288 million in Medicaid and Medicare savings between 2019 and 2023. After residency training, evidence demonstrates that physicians who trained in cost-efficient geographic areas continue to provide lower -cost care in thei r post -residency practice. 97 In addition to increasing the number of primary care residents training in these community -based patient care settings, the THCGME Program meets the Administration's priority by increasing health care quality and expanding Ame ricans' overall access to care. Program funds support the educational costs incurred by new and expanded residency programs. Along with supporting the salaries and benefits of residents and faculty, THCGME funds are used to foster innovation and support curriculum concepts aimed at improving the quality of patient care, such as the Patient -Centered Medical Home model, Electronic Health Record utilization, population health, telemedicine, and healthcare leadership. These activities ensure residents receive high quality training and are well prepared to practice in community -based settings after graduation. 94 Talib, Z, Jewers, M M, Strasser, JH, Popiel, DK, Goldberg, DG, Chen, C, Kepley, H, Mullan, Regenstein, M.

Policy Issue Brief 58: Examining the Cost Effectiveness of Teaching Health Centers . March 2019. 181 In Sept ember 2019, HRSA awarded a three-year contract to George Washington University to conduct an updated evaluation of the costs of residency training at THCs, including identifying both direct and indirect expenses. Information and data from this evaluation will provide HRSA with a future methodology to determine appropriate THCGME program payments for direct medical expenses as well as indirect m edical expenses. In Academic Year 2021 -2022, HRSA will award to 60 teaching health centers that will support the training of up to 801 resident FTEs. Currently, 45 of the 60 teaching health centers are in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) or FQ HC Look- alikes. HRSA anticipates awarding approximately $220 million appropriated by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to support up to 145 teaching health centers including up to 60 continuation awards, 35 expansion awards, and 50 new awards to establish teaching health centers. These funds will be used to increase the maximum number of approved resident FTE slots to over 1,375. Funding for the additional resident FTE slots is made available through the American Rescue Pl an Act of 2021, which will provide support through Fiscal Year 2023. In addition, funds will be used to increase the per resident rate (PRA) payment to THCGME awardees by $10,000, resulting in a total payment of $160,000 per resident FTE starting in FY 2021. Additional awards will be made from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to support the development of new teaching health center programs in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine -pediatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, general dentistry, pediatric dentistry, and geriatrics to address the physician workforce shortages and challenges faced by rural and underserved communities. Once the authorization ends on September 30, 2023, additional funding will be needed to support the training of teaching health cent er residents beyond Academic Year 2023 -2024. Should mandatory base and supplemental THCGME new and expansion funding cease after FY 2023, teaching health centers would not be able to sustain the training of their residents through program completion. As a result, the additional residents supported by supplemental THCGME funding would have their training interrupted, impacting direct patient care and these residents may need to seek out-of- cycle alternate residency opportunities, most likely in non-community based settings. In addition, communities served by teaching health center residents will be impacted by the loss of these additional physician and dental residents. In Academic Year 2019 -2020, the THCGME Program awarded 738 98 resident FTE slots that provided funding to 883 primary care medical and dental residents. While the number of FTE slots just missed the target due to the unexpected loss of two grantees, the program increased the number of FTE slots by 10 and the number of residents funded by 25 over the prior academic year. Nearly all residents (over 99 percent) received training in a primary care setting, providing care during nearly half a million patient encounters and accruing over 600,000 contact hours with these primary care patients. Add itionally, most THCGME residents (93 percent) spent a significant part of their training in medically underserved and/or rural communities, providing more than 1.1 million hours of patient care to more than 800,000 patients. Approximately 19 98 Awarded FTE slots are not the maximum resident FTE cap of up to 801 resident FTEs. 182 percent of residents reported coming from a financially or educationally disadvantaged background, and 24 percent of them reported a rural background. In addition to supporting training of individual residents, THCGME recipients also used funding to develop or enhance curricula on topics related to primary care. Programs developed or enhanced and implemented 1,490 courses and training activities during the academic year, impacting over 12,600 healthcare trainees. Over 6,600 students, residents, and other health car e professionals from a variety of professions and disciplines trained alongside THCGME residents while participating in interprofessional team- based care. Among 582 health care delivery sites utilized for residen cy training, 46 percent provided telehealth services, 30 percent offered substance use treatment services, and 30 percent offered COVID -19 related services. Approximately 80 percent of residents received training in opioid use treatment, 63 percent received training in telehealth, and 60 percent rec eived COVID -19 related training. Of the 286 residents who completed the program in Academic Year 2019-2020, approximately 60 percent reported intentions to practice in a primary care setting, while 55 percent intended to practice in a medically underserved and/or rural area. Employment status will be assessed for these individuals one year after program completion (during Academic Year 2020-2021). Of the 213 program completers from the prior academic year for whom employment data was available, most currently practice in a primary care setting (66 percent) and/or in a medically underserved community (55 percent). Since the THCGME Program began, 1,434 new primary care physicians and dentists have graduated and e ntered the workforce. As the national averag e of physicians practicing in primary care specialties is approximately 33 percent, 99 the THCGME Program has evidenced much stronger results. Cumulative follow-up data indicates that 65 percent of graduates are currently practicing in a primary setting an d approximately 56 percent of the graduating physicians and dentists are currently practicing in a medically underserved community and/or rural setting. THCGME residents have cumulatively provided over 3.5 million hours of patient care in primary care set tings during 3.1 million patient encounters. Residents additionally provided over 5.5 million hours of patient care in medically underserved and rural settings, significantly expanding access to care in these k ey settings.

Funding History FY Amount Request The THCGME program is funded at $126.5 million for each fiscal year through FY 2023. 101 In FY 2022, THCGME mandatory funding will be reduced by $7.2 million through sequestration pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (B BEDCA). Academic Year 2022-2023, the program expects to support up to 801 FTE slots, which is the maximum resident FTE cap at the current funding level. Recoveries and carryover funds in addition to supplemental funds under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 will also support this activity . 100 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration amount. 101 Subject to Sequestration thru FY 2023. 184 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result)102 Health Centers (Cumulative)103 FY 2019: 738 Target: 750 (Target Not Met) 740 740 Maintain 6.I.C.48: Percent of THCGME -supported residents training in rural and/or 93% Target: 80% (Target Exceeded) 80% 80% Maintain Program Activity Data THCGME Program Outputs Year and Most Recent Result Number of primary care residents funded by THCGME residencies104 FY 2019: 883 Number of primary care residents completing training FY 2019: 286 Percent of residents who are from a disadvantaged and/or rural background FY 2019: 36% Percent o f primary care resident program completers who intend to practice in primary care settings FY 2019: 60% 102 Most recent results are for Academic Year 2019 -2020 and funded in FY 2019. 103 Measure captures the number FTEs resident slots awarded and not the maximum possible nor the number of individuals receiving direct financial support through the program. Awardees may use 1 FTE slot to fund two residents at 50 percent time, thus the FTE slot is not a one to one correspondence with number of individuals trained. Number of residents also does not equal the number of graduates as primary care residency programs require one year (Dental and Geriatrics), three years (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics), or four years (Ob -Gyn and Psychiatry) of training. 104 Measure captures the number of individual residents supported, which is different than the FTE slots. 185 Awards Table FY 2020 Final FY 2021 Enacted FY 2022 President's Budget 60 60 --- Aut horizing Legislation: Section 6403 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148); Title IV of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-660); Section 1921 of the Social Security Act (Section 5(b) of P.L. 100-93, the Me dicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, as amended); and Section 1128E of the Social Security Act (P.L. 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996). FY 2022 Authorization ...................................................................................................... I ndefinite Allocation Method ............................................................................................... User Fee Program Program Description and Accomplishments: The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) is a workforce tool that improves health care quality, promotes patient safety, and deters fraud and abuse in the health care system by providing information about past adverse actions of practitioners, providers, and suppliers to authorized health care entities and agencies. With more than 1.6 million reports, the NPDB helps reduce health care fraud and abuse by collecting and disclosing information to authorized entities on health care-related civil judgments and criminal convictions, adverse licensure and certification actions, exclusions from health care programs, and other adjudicated actions taken against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners. Authorized health care entities then use this information to make informed hiring, credentialing, and privileging decisions to ultimately determine whether, or under what conditions, it is appropriate for health care practition ers, providers, and suppliers to provide health care services. Prior to NPDB's inception, health care providers who lost their licenses or had serious unprofessional conduct moved from state to state with impunity, making it difficult for employers and licensing boards to learn about their prior acts. Through the use of the NPDB, employers and other authorized health care entities are able to receive reliable information on health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers. In FY 2020, the NPDB facilitated more than 9.9 million queries from the NPDB to authorized health care providers and entities. DPDB has launched attestation initiatives for HRSA's community health centers, hospitals, health plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agents. To date, the attestation completion rate for selected health centers, hospitals, health 187 plans, medical malpractice payers, all other health care entities, and authorized agents is over 90 percent. In FY 2020, NPDB released a publicly available interactive Compliance Results tool105 that displays the compliance and attestation results for state licensing and certification boards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NPDB temporarily waived query fees. The fee waiver supported health care entities, during this national emergency, to make informed hiring, licensing, and credentialing decisions. As a result, the NPDB waived fees for over 6 million one -time queries, continuous queries, and continuous query renewals between March 1 , 2020, and September 30, 2020. Funding History The table below shows the user fees (revenue) collected (or expected to be collected): FY Amount FY 2022 Budget Request for the National Practitioner Data Bank program of $18.8 million in user fees, is the same as the FY 2021 Enacted level. This is based on HRSA's projections of queries on practitioners and organizations. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, the NPDB does not receive appr opriated funds and is financed by the collection of user fees. Annual Appropriations Act language since FY 1993 requires that user fee collections cover the full cost of NPDB operations; therefore, there is no request for appropriation for operating the NPDB. User fees are established at a level to cover all program costs to allow the NPDB to meet annual and long- term program performance goals. F ees are established based on forecasts of qu ery volume to result in adequate, but not excessive, revenues to pay all program costs to meet program performance goals. 105 State Licensing Board Compliance Resul ts 188 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measu re Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Res ult / (Summary of Result) FY of prac titioners enrolled in Continuous Query (which is a subscription service for Data Bank queries that notifies them of ne w information on enrolled practitioners within one business day) FY 2020: 4,538,937 Enrolled Practitioners 5,300,000 +1,100,000 8.III.B.7: Increase annually the number of disclosures NPDB reports to health care organizations 2020: 2,022,845 Disclosures Target: 1,980,000 (Target Exceeded) 2,020,000 2,100,000 80,000 189 Health Workforce Cross- Cutting Performance Measures The Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) has tracked and reported on four cross -cutting measures for over 30 of its programs that reported performance data during Academic Year 2019-2020. The cross-cutting measures focus specifically on the diversity of individuals completing specific types of health professions training programs; 106 the rate in which individuals participating in specific types of health professions training programs are trained in medically underserved communities; 107 the rate in which individuals who complete specific types of health professions training programs report being employed in a medically underserved community; and the rate in which clinical training sites provide interprofessional team- based care to patients. These measures do not currently include data from the Faculty Loan Repayment Program or the National Practitioner Data Bank. 108 Du ring Academic Year 2019 -2020, results showed that 50 percent of graduates and program completers participating in BHW -supported health professions training and loan programs were underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the health professions and/or from disadvantaged backgrounds.109 Wi th regard to the types of settings used to provide training, results showed that 67 percent of individuals participating in BHW-supported health professions training programs received a t least a portion of their training in a medically underserved community surpassing the performance target of 57 percent. This is a small improvement over last year's result of 65 percent and reflects the Bureau's continued emphasis aimed at increasing se rvice and training in rural and underserved areas. As a result, more health professions trainees are being exposed to training and patient care in medically underserved communities than in prior years. Results showed that 43 percent of individuals who graduated from or completed specific types of BHW -supported training programs reported working in medically underserved communities across the nation one year after graduation/completion. This result surpassed the target of 40 percent. 106 BHW currently funds more than 35 health professions training and loan programs that have varying types of data reporting requirements based on the program's authorizing legislation. For the purposes of the cross -cutting measures, only programs that are required to report individual -level data are included in the calculation, as this ensures a higher level of accuracy and data quality, as well as cons istency in the types of programs that are included in the calculation. Currently, 30 of the BHW -funded programs are required to report individual -level data and are included in these calculations. These programs are representative of the health professions and include oral health programs, behavioral health programs, medicine programs, nursing programs, geriatrics programs, and physician assistant programs, among others. 107 A medically underserved community is a geographic location or population of individua ls that is eligible for designation by a state and/or the federal government as a medically underserved area, a health professions shortage area, and/or medically underserved population. 108 Nearly all grant programs are repo rting performance data that is utilized in the cross -cutting measures. Only two programs do not report data as they have specific reporting requirements unique to their legislation. 109 This measure includes individuals who graduated from or completed a spec ific type of HRSA -supported healt h professions training or loan program and identified as Hispanic (all races); Non- Hispanic Black or African American; Non -Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native; Non -Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; a nd/or identified as coming from a financially and/or educationally disadvantaged background (regardless of race). 190 Lastly, the percent of clinical training sites that provide interprofessional training to individuals enrolled in a primary care training program was 71 percent, far exceeding the target of 45 percent. This result is also an improvement over last year's result due to a continued focus on the programmatic emphasis of interprofessional training across programs in the Bureau.

Results are from Academic Year 2019 -2020 based on graduates from Academic Year 2018- 2019. 191 Maternal and Child Health TAB 192 MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Maternal and Child Health Block Grant FY 2020 Final +17 Aut Act, agreement Competitive grant/co -operative agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program, authorized under Title V of the Social Security Act, seeks to improve the health of all mothers, children, and their families. The activities authorized as part of the MCH Block Grant program include : The State MCH Block Grant program , which awards formula grants to 59 states and jurisdictions to address the health needs of mothers, infants, and children, as well as children with special health care needs in their state or jurisdiction; Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) that addr ess national or regional needs, priorities, or emerging issues (such as opioids, maternal mortality, and COVID- 19) and demonstrate methods for improving care and outcomes for mothers and children; and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) grants, which help increase local service delivery capacity and form state and local comprehensive care systems for mothers and children, including children with special health care needs. The MCH Block Grant program funding, combined with state investments, provides a significant funding source to improve access to and the quality of health care for mothers, children, and their families in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions. Th e MCH Block Grant program enables each state to: Assure access to quality maternal and child health care services for mothers and children, especially for those with low- incomes or limited availability of care; Reduce infant mortality; 193 Provide access to prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care to women (e specially low- income and at -risk pregnant women); Increase the number of low- income children who receive regular health assessments and follow-up diagnostic and treatment services; Provide access to preventive and primary care services for low -income children as w ell as rehabilitative services for children with special health needs; Implement family -centered, community-based, systems of coordinated care for children with special health care needs ; and Provide toll- free hotlines and assistance with apply ing for services to pregnant women with infants and children who are eligible for Title XIX (Medicaid). State MCH Block Grant Program The State MCH Block Grant program awards formula grants to improve care and outcomes for mothers, children, and familie s in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions. A federal -state partnership, the State MCH Block Grant program gives states flexibility in meeting the unique health needs of their children and families, while HRSA assures accountabili ty and impact through performance measurement and technical assistance. HRSA distributes funding based on a legislative funding formula tied to a state's level of child poverty compared to the overall level of child poverty in the United States. States report progress annually on key MCH performance/outcome measures and indicators. To assist states in improving their performance, HRSA provides technical assistance to states on request, as specified in Section 509(a)(4) of the Social Security Act. Each state cond ucts a comprehensive Needs Assessment, as mandated by law, every five years. This assessment helps each state to determine its highest MCH priorities, target funds to address them, and report annually on its progress. Federal funds, combined with statutorily required state matching investments, support activities that address individual state MCH needs . The State MCH Block Grant program continues to play an important role as payer of last resort to address gaps in coverage and services not reimbursed by Medicaid/CHIP and other third-party payers. In addition to gap-filling direct and enabling services, state MCH programs promote the access and quality of comprehensive public health services and systems of care, including through quality improvement initiatives, workforce training, program outreach and population-based disease prevention and health promotion education campaigns. Consistent with the block grant structure and driven by a commitment to improving the health and well -being of the nation's mothers, infants, children and families, HRSA continues to implement efforts to: Reduce state burden by streamlining the narrative reporting structure of the Five- Year Needs Assessment and Application/Annual Report, by reducing duplication in narrative reporting across multiple sections of the Application/Annual Report, and by pre-populating performance and outcome measure data, as available, using national data sources. Maintain state flexibility through a comprehensive needs assessment proces s where state needs and priorities drive the selection of national performance measures and state-194 specific performance measures and inform the development of a state action plan that responds to individual state MCH needs. The action plan includes evidence-based/informed strategy measures that assess the outputs of state Title V strategies and activities that drive improvement in performance measures . Improve accountability through a performance measurement framework that enables the states to describe their program efforts and demonstrate the impact of Title V on the health of mothers, children, and families, at both state and national levels. HRSA works in partnership with the State MCH Block Grant programs to provide technical support, as requested by the state, for addressing their MCH priority needs as well as other performance and programmatic requirements of the MCH Block Grant program. HRSA makes key financial, program, performance, and health indicator data, as reported by states, available to the public through the Title V Information System. 113 As a l ongstanding source of funding for MCH populations, the State MCH Block Grant supports a wide range of services for millions of women and children, including low- income children and children with special health care needs. Program achievements include: An estimated 60 million pregnant women, infants, and children, including children with special health care needs, benefitted from a service supported by the State MCH Block Grant program in FY 2019. Nationwide, the 59 State MCH Block Grant programs reached approximatel y 92 percent of pregnant women, 98 percent of infants, and 60 percent of children. Access to health services for mothers has improved with support of the State MCH Block Grant program. The percentage of women who received early prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy increased from 71.0 percent in 2007 to 77.6 percent in 2019. Recognizing that improving maternal and child health in the United St ates will require improving women's health before pregnancy, 47 states and jurisdictions are now working to improve access to preventive and primary care for all women of childbearing age. The infant mortality rate is a widely used indicator of the nation' s health. The State MCH Block Grant program has played a lead role in the 22 percent decline in U.S. infant mortality from 7.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1997 to 5.6 infant deaths per 1,000 in 2019. Efforts to reduce the overall infant mortality rate and its contributing factors continue. States are also working to reduce maternal mortality, whi ch has been rising over the past two decades, through a range of approaches. For example, in 2018, 37 State MCH Block Grant programs provided funding to support comprehensive maternal mortality reviews to identify contributing factors, monitor trends, and initiate appropriate action to reduce such events in the future. An additional 14 states are in the planning process to use Title V funds to support mate rnal mortality reviews. In many cases, states have opted to use Title V funds to supplement activities working to address maternal health (see Maternal mortality under SPRANS). Select National Outcome and National Performance Measures in effect from 1997 to 2019 illustrate the program's successes: 113 Title V Information System (TVIS). 195 National Outcome or Performance Measures Percent Change (1997 - 2019 u nless otherwise noted) Data Source Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 22% decrease National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Neonata l mortality rate per 1,000 live births 23% decrease NVSS Postneonatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 24% decrease NVSS Perinatal mortality rate per 1,000 live births plus fetal deaths 21% decrease NVSS Child mortality rate, ages 1 through 9 per 100,000 35% decrease NVSS Percent of 19 -35 month olds who have received full schedule of age appropriate immunizations against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Polio, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus Influenza, & Hepatitis B 64% increase (2009-2018) National Immunization Survey (NIS) Percentage of children without health insurance 63% decrease National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Percent of very low birth weight infants delivered at facilities for high -risk deliveries and neonates 12% increase (1997-2013) Title V Information System Percent of infants born to pregnant women receiving prenatal care beginning in the first trimester 9% increase (2007-2019) NVSS Spe cial Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) HRSA awards SPRANS grant s to 1) address critical and emerging issues of regional and national significance in maternal and child health, and 2) support collaborative and innovative learning across states so pro grams can utilize existing best practices and evidence. Of the $1 39.1 million for SPRANS in FY 2021 Congress set aside approximately 11 percent to address four specific priorities: oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell disease, and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. In addition, approximately 32 percent of the total SPRANS budget supports specific directives highlighted in the authorizing language, including genetics, hemophilia, training, and research. The remaining approximately 57 percent addresses critical and emerging issues in maternal and child health such as maternal mortality and opioid abuse prevention, and supports collaborative learning across st ates. S PRANS awards also drive innovation and build capacity to improve systems of care for MCH populations. Funding provides critical programming that complements and ensures the succe ss of State formula -funded activities by improving workforce and syste m capacity and the ability of programs to utilize best practices and evidence (e.g., through research, data collection, quality improvement and workforce development), as well as enable the Nation to address emerging issues. 196 Critical and Emerging Issu es in Maternal and Child Health Maternal mortality - HRSA supports a number of investments with SPRANS funding that are integral to HRSA's efforts to promote maternal health and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. In FY 2021, HRSA continued support for the State Maternal Health Innovation (State MHI) program (9 states), including a focus on access to care via alternative telehealth platforms to address needs resulting from the COVID -19 public health emergency . HRSA has also increased funding for the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program with a goal of expanding implementation of the AIM progr am's maternal safety bundles across all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities. To date, 41 states and the District of Columbia are enrolled in AIM, with participation from approximately 1,900 birthing facil ities. Additional investments related to maternal health include the newly esta blished Maternal Mental Health Hotline and the Women's Preventive Services Initiative. COVID -19 - SPRANS funding has been instrumental in addressing emerging public health iss ues that impact the MCH population, including COVID- 19 response efforts. For example, HRSA launched the Promoting Pediatric Primary Prevention (P4) Challenge in December 2020 to incentivize innovations in pediatric primary care to increase well -child visits and immunizations within primary care settings in light of the COVID -19 pande mic. Innovations will address decreases in these services to prevent the spread of vaccine -preventable diseases such as measles and ensure children receive preventative care, cr ucial to their growth and development. Community Integrated Service Systems (CI SS) CISS grants are awarded on a competitive basis and support states and communities in building comprehensive, integrated system of care to improve care and outcomes for all children, including children with special health care needs. For example, CISS funding supports the Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) program to enhance state -level capacity and infrastructure for integrated maternal and early childhood systems of care that lead to improved children's developmental health , family well- being, and increased family -centered access to care for the prenatal -to-3 year old population. The program provides direct support and technical assistance to up to 20 states to build leadership capacity in early childhood systems, improve cross -sector service coordination and alignment, improve policies and practices across sectors , and advance health equity in early childhood so that mo re children are thriving at age three and school- ready by age five. The program is re-competing in FY 2021. Table 1. MCH Block Grant Activities ($ in thousands) MCH Activities FY 2020 Final FY 2021 Enacted ($ in thousands) SPRANS The FY 2022 Budget Request for the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant program of $822.7 million is $110.0 million above the FY 2 021 Enacted level . The Budget includes an increase of $29.0 million in funding for formula awards to states to promote and improve the health and well -being of the nation's mothers, children-including children with special needs, and their families . Additionally, the Budget includes an increase of $81.0 million in SPRANS funding for a total of $ 220.12 million , of which $112.30 million will support HRSA's efforts to improve maternal and child health, including reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. This funding will support the Improving Maternal Health Initiative, which includes new activities and continues support for existing activities, including: 198 State Maternal Health Innovation Grants : A total of $53.0 million , a $30.0 million increase, to expand the program . This program supports innovation among states to improve maternal health outcomes and address dispari ties in maternal health. With this funding, states collaborate with maternal health experts to implement state -specific action s plans in order to improve access to maternal care services, identify and address workforce needs, and support postpartum and int erconception care services. The Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) : A total of $ 14.3 million , an increase of $5 .3 million, to expand the reach of AIM 's evidence -based models of maternity care to a broader array of providers and health care settings and increase AIM penetration in currently enrolled States. Funding will also ensure the long- term sustainability and impact of AIM by supporting the infrastructure and capacity of health care provid ers and systems of care to develop and implement AIM-related quality improvement efforts and e fforts. Maternal Mental Health Hotline : A total of $4.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million, to continue and increase support for a maternal mental health hotline, staffed by qualified counselors 24 hours a day. U.S. maternal mortality has not improved in the past decade. Mental health conditions, including those resulting in suicide and unintentional overdose, are a leading cause of pregnancy-related death during pregnancy and the year following delivery. 114 Nearly 1 in 8 women report experiencing depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.115 Pregnancy Medical Home Demonstration: A total of $25.0 million to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes and maternal de aths by incentivizing maternal health care providers to provide integral health care services to pregnant women and new mothers. Early Childhood Development Expert Grants : A tota l of $10.0 million in funding to help cities place early childhood development experts in pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program patients. Implicit Bias Training Grants for Health Providers : A total of $5.0 million in funding will support new grant awards to train health care providers on implicit bias with the goal of reducing racial disparities. National Academy of Medicine Study : $1.0 million in funding will support a partnership with the National Academy of Medicine study and make recommendations for incorporating bias recognition in clinical skills testing for accredited schools of allopathic medicine and accredited schools of osteopathic medicine. The Budget also includes additional SPRANS fun ding that will support programs to drive innovation and improve systems of care for MCH populations. These programs will address emerging issues relating to disparities in maternal and c hild health outcomes and gaps in care related to the ongoing impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on maternal and child health . HRSA anticipates these will continue to be critical issues in FY 2022. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow- up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 114 Enhancing Reviews and Sur veillance to Eliminate Maternal M ortality | CDC Davis NL, Smoots AN, Goodman DA.

The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program began in 2008 as authorized by the Combating Autism Act of 2006. The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support, or Autism CARES Act reauthorized the program in 2019. The program supports training programs, research, and state systems grants to: Impro ve access to early screening, diagnosis and intervention for children with ASD or other DDs; Increase the number of professionals able to diagnose ASD and other DDs; Promote the use of evidence-based interventions for individuals at higher risk for ASD and other DDs as early as possible; Increase t he number of professionals able to provide evidence-based interventions for individuals diagnosed with ASD or other DDs; Provide information and education on ASD and other DDs to increase public awareness; Promo te research and information distribution on the development and validation of reliable screening tools and interventions for ASD and other DDs; and Promote early screening of individuals at higher risk for ASD and other DDs. Training Programs The program has two main training components, the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related Disabilities (LEND) Training program and the 206 Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) Training program. LEND programs provide interdisciplinary training to enhance the clinical expertise and leader ship skills of professionals dedicated to caring for children with neurodevelopmental and other related disabilities including autism. DBP trains the next generation of leaders in developmental- behavioral pediatri cs and provides pediatric practitioners, residents, and medical students with essential biopsychosocial knowledge and clinical expertise. Data from FY 2018 showed that the LEND and DBP programs collectively: Provided diagnostic services to confirm or rule out ASD and other DDs to nearly 120,000 children. Provided training to over 23,500 trainees in the fields of pediatrics, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and other health professions. Provided nearly 1,600 continuing education events on early screening, diagnosis, and intervention that reached nearly 118,000 pediatricians and other health professionals. T he training programs have an explicit focus on training professionals to provide culturally and linguistically relevant care and to recruit diverse students and professionals into the program s. In FY 2018, over 25% of long-term trainees were from underrepresented racial groups and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. The training programs also include self-advoc ates and family members as trainees and faculty to enhance exposure to lived experiences an d increase the leadership skills of self -advocates and family members as part of an interdisciplinary care team. Research To improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents with ASD and other DDs, HRSA supports research networks, single investigator -led autism innovation projects, field- initiated research and secondary data analysis projects. HRSA supports research and development of reliable screening tools and guidelines for ASD and other DD and the implementation of interventions to impro ve the physical and behavioral health of individuals with ASD and other DDs across the life course. HRSA also funds research to address barriers to diagnosis, access to care, and social determinants of health and health disparities with an explicit focus to recruit participants from underserved populations. For example, the two largest Research Networks, the Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health (AIR-P) and the Autism Intervention Research Network on Behavioral Health (AIR- B), recruit dive rse research participants with the target of including at least 60 percent of study participants from underserved populations. Collectively, these research investments address the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan research questions around improving early identification and advancing effectiveness of interventions and services for children with ASD and other DD . Accomplishments from the Autism Research Networks and Autism Single Investigator Innovation Programs in FY 2018 include: Conduc ted 76 studies on physical and behavioral health issues related to ASD and other DDs, screening and diagnostic measures, early intervention, and transition to adulthood. Fo rty-nine research sites across the country enrolled 7,696 participants in prima ry research studies and there were also 228,887 participants included in secondary data analyses. 207 Developed 30 peer-reviewed publications in leading scholarly journals. State Systems Grants The Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities program supports state systems grants to improve access to comprehensive, coordinated health care and related services for children and youth with ASD and other DDs. State systems g rants promote access to more comprehensive coordinated services for ASD by establishing integrated teams of educators, physicians, and social service providers . State grantees: Engaged families in program planning, community outreach, and training for providers. In FY 2017, nearly 80,000 individuals received services to facilitate family engagem ent through family navigation and other family engagement strategies; Implemented strategies to reduce disparities in early identification and treatment of ASD. In FY 2017, more than 37,000 individuals were reached by services to promote and facilitate scr eening and follow- up care. Funding FY 2022 Budget Request for the Autism and Othe r Developmental Disabilities program of $57.3 million is $4.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level . This request will support training programs, research, and state systems with a focus on improving access, quality, and systems of care for underserved children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD or other DDs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 1 in 54 children have ASD based on an in-depth examination of 11 local areas, 122 while parent -reported data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health documented that 1 in 40 children aged 3-17 years have a diagnosis of ASD. 123 The req uested funding increase will allow the program to increase access to services for approximately 5,000 additional children, for a total of 125,000 children total. Increased funding for the LEND and DBP programs will address unmet needs and disparities in evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Increased funding will support the expansion of the DBP program to 2 additional awardees (14 total ) as well as increased fellowship opportunities for existing awardees. Funding will also support additional trainees for existing LEND awardees. 122 Autism and Developmental Disabi lities Monitoring Network (2016 data). 123 Kogan, et al. (2018) The Prevalence of Parent -Reported Autism Spectrum Disorder Among US Children. Pediatrics 142(6) 208 The unmet needs are due in part to a shortage of trained providers; as of 2016, only 775 pediatricians were certified by the American Board of Pediatrics as DBPs, resulting in a national average of 109,427 children per DBP.124 Geographically the shortages are even starker, with one state only having one DBP per 456,248 children, and t hree states not having any DBPs . There is also wide variability in the age of diagnosis of ASD by state and in many rural communities, children and families face disparities due to distance to subspecialists and a lack of available services . 125 According to the CDC's 2016 Autism and Devel opmental Disabilities Monitoring Network data there are disparities for Black children in early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD. 126 Hispanic children were identified as having ASD less frequently than White or Black children. A later age of first evaluation for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children also points to disparities by race and ethnicity. 127 These disparities may be due to barriers in accessing services, such as services not being available in the family's primary language, limited cultural and linguistic competence among providers and health systems, lack of awareness, and stigma. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow- up performance review s, and information technology and other program support costs.

While life expectancy of individuals with sickle cell disease has increased, affected populations have not benefitted equally from therapies. SCDTDP grantees work to address these barriers and improve the prevention and treatment of the complications of sickle cell disease by: C oordinating service delivery; A ssessing patient need for genetic counseling and testing, and providing referral as appropriate; P roviding guidance and technical assistance; I mplementing telehealth and telementoring strategies, to educate health professionals on evidence- based treatment of sickle cell disease; and E xpanding and coordinating patient education, treatment, and care continuity. T he program works to improve health equity by increasing access to evidence- based care provided in the communities in which SCD patients live, increasing access to the latest treatment options, and continuing telehealth support for access to services. The program also f osters partnerships between clinicians and community organizations, partners with communities of practice to improve the quality of care provided to patients with SCD, and educates providers, families, and patients to improve knowledge and capacities, part icularly as patient transition into adult health care settings. 213 A new funding cycle began in FY 2021 with five grants to develop and support Regional Coordinating Centers that cover the United States. The purpose of the SCDTDP is to increase access for i ndividuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) to quality, coordinated, comprehensive care by: 1) increasing the number of clinicians or health professionals knowledgeable about the care of SCD, 2) improving the quality of care provided to individuals with SCD, and 3) improving care coordination with other providers. HRSA expects to strengthen the SCD system of care and support by improving access to quality, coordinated, comprehensive care for individuals with sickle cell disease; increasing the number of clinicians and health professionals knowledgeable about the care of individuals with SCD, including those participating in both telementoring and telemedicine activities; and improving care coordination with other providers. F unding History FY Amount FY 2022 Budget Request for the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program of $7.21 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted level . This request will fund continued support for regional SCD infrastructure, whi ch strengthens the sickle cell disease system of care for individuals with sickle cell dise ase, their families, and clinicians. The program partners with states to develop and support comprehensive SCD care teams for supporting care across the lifespan; implements telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health informatio n services; increases access to evidence -based care and the latest treatment options; and increases collaboration and care coordination within each region. In response to the COVID - 19 global pandemic and needs identified by the sickle cell disease community, funding also supports technical assistance around accessing care via telemedicine; and webinars and educational opportunities to raise awareness about vaccination access and safety. T he funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 214 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measure Year and M ost Recent Result / Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2021 of sickle cell patients served by SCDTDP network providers in the past year (Developmental) (Output) FY 2019: 25,712131 Target: Baseline (Target Not in Place) N/A G rant Awards Enacted FY 2022 President's Budget 5 5 $847,497 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 Range of Awards $490,000 -$1,205,000 $1,000 ,000 $1,000,000 131 The data for this measure is collected from provider surveys via the SCDTDP National Coordinating Center. Survey administration was del ayed fro m May until September 2020 due to COVID -19. The program will identify trends over a two year period as the measure is developmental. Once the trend is analyzed, appropriate targets will be identified and included in the FY 2024 budget justification. 215 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention FY 2020 Final 4 4 --- A uthorizing Legislation - Public Health Service Act, T itle III, Section 399M, as amended by Public Law agreement P rogram Description and Accomplishments The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Program (formerly known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening program), reauthorized in 2017, supports the development of comprehensive and coordinated state and territory EHDI systems of care. EHDI assures that families with newborns, infants , and young children up to three years of age that are deaf or hard of hearing receive appropriate and timely services that include hearing screening, diagnosis, and early intervention. This program focuses on: I ncreasing health professionals' engagement in and knowledge of the EHDI system; I mproving access to early intervention services and language acquisition; and I mproving family engagement, education, partnership, and leadership to strengthen family support. T he EHDI Program funds 59 competitive grants to states and territories to develop comprehensive and coordinated statewide EHDI systems of care as well as two technical resource centers that support these efforts in addition to empowering families to serve as leaders in the EHDI system. To address health equity, grantees are required to develop plans to address diversity and inclusion in the EHDI system by the end of FY 2021 to ensure their activities are inclusive of and address the needs of the populations they serve. F unding also supports supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities training programs supported by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities program to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. Since the program's inception, states and territories have had significant success in identifying newborns and infants who are deaf or hard of hearing. 216 In 2018, 98.3% of births had hearing screening before 1 year of age.132 Additionally, the EHDI Program continues to work with states to meet the Healthy People 2020 objectives of screening no later than one month of age, conducting audiologic evaluations no later than 3 months of age, and enrollment in early intervention services no later than 6 months of age (1-3-6 objectives). In 2018, 97.0% of infants were screened before one month of age, 77.1% were diagnosed before 3 months of age, and 70.1% were enrolled in early intervention before six months of age. 133 A lack of comprehensive data reporting requirements for service providers in states and variability across states in timely access to such providers, among other factors, continues to be a challenge. The EHDI Program continues to focus on supporting early screening and diagnosi s as recommended by Healthy People 2030. Overall system impro vements have led to more infants being screened and identified as deaf or hard of hearing and fewer infants being lost to follow-up (when an infant does not receive the recommended follow up services) or lost to documentation (when an infant has received services, but results have not been reported to the EHDI Program and, therefore, cannot be documented). In addition, the EHDI Program encourages grantees to develop an integrated EHDI health infor mation system that allows communication and protected data sharing among health care providers to ensure that newborns, infants, and young children up to three years of age receive pertinent screenings and follow-up services. In response to the C OVID-19 pandemic, 55 grantees and the two technical resource centers used program funding to strengthen telehealth capacities at the state level. Example activities include promoting remote screening and follow-up via tele-audiology and access to teleinter vention and support for families. Funding History FY The FY 2022 Budget Request for the Earl y Hearing Detection and Intervention Program of $17.8 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted Level . The Budget Request will continue to support 59 competitive grants to states and territories, in addition to two technical resource cen ters and supplemental awards to 12 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities training programs to train future leaders in pediatric audiology. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award pr ocess, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 132 2018 CDC EHDI Hearing Screening & Follow -up Survey (HSFS) data. 133 Ibid 217 Out comes and Outputs Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result /Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) : Percentage of infants screened for hearing loss prior to one month of age.

The majority of the nation's children are treated in community and rural emergency departments (EDs) close to where they live, rather than in spe cialized pediatric medical care centers. In addition, emergency medical services (EMS) agencies and hospital EDs often lack the necessary equipment and resources to treat children adequately. The Em ergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program, reauthorized under the EMSC Reauthorization Act of 2019, is the only federal grant program specifically focused on ensuring that seriously ill or injured children have access to high-quality pediatric emergency care, no matter where they live in the United States. The EMSC Program aims to ensure that all EMS agencies and hospital EDs are equipped to provide appropriate medical care for children, including access to pediatric-specific equipment, medications, and transportation (e.g., ambulances). In addition, EMS personnel must be knowledgeable and skilled in carrying out pediatric eme rgency care and have access to pediatric transport guidelines. It is critical that EMS systems are optimally prepared to provide high-quality pediatric care in both prehospital and hospital settings. In recent years, the EMSC Program has invested in: The EMSC State Partnership Program which aims to improve pediatric emergency care across 59 states and jurisdictions; The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Pr ogram and Targeted Issues grants, which aim to carry out rigorous clinical r esearch to develop evidence- based optimal pediatric emergency care guidelines; 220 The EMSC Innovation and Improvement Center, which provides guidance to EMSC State Partners and other EMS stakeholders to disseminate and increase uptake of evidence- based appro aches to pediatric emergency care in each state and territory; and The EMSC Data Center, which tracks performance improvement efforts across all funded states and territories and s erves as a central data coordinating entity for ongoing PECARN research. Notable accomplishments of the EMSC Program include : Increased the Institutionalization of Pediatric Guidelines in Hospitals: Between 2013 and 2018, the proportion of hospitals wit h written interfacility transfer guidelines covering pediatric patients incr eased from 50% to 58%. 140 Increased Efforts to Drive Pediatric Quality Improvement in Hospitals: Between 2006 and 2020, the number of states that established a pediatric medical fac ility recognition program, which acknowledges organizations that invest and demonstrate their capacity to provide high quality pediatric emergency services, increased from five to 17 states. 141 Improved the Coordination and Management of Pediatric Mental Health Care in the Emergency Department: In 2019, in partnership with the Feder al Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP), MCHB developed the Critical Crossroads: Pediatric Mental Health Care in the Emergency Department Pathways Toolkit . This toolkit helps hospital EDs identify, manage, and ensure continuity of care for children and adolescents in mental health crisis. 142 In creased Pediatric Workforce Oversight in Prehospital EMS Agencies: The proportion of EMS agencies with a pediatric emergency care coordinator (PECC) increased si gnificantly from 23% in 2018 to 30% in 2020.143 Advanced EMSC Science and Clinical Practice: In 2019, PECARN developed a new guideline to evaluate the half million infants less than 2 months of age who present to the emergency department with fever. This helps to decrease physical and emotional risks for infants and their families and reduce health care costs. 144 Advanced Prehospital Emergency Services : In 2019, Targeted I ssues grants advanced our understanding of pediatric patient safety dosing errors, highlighting the need for expanded prehospital emergency services education. 145 This work has been included in the American Board of EMS core content for pediatric patient safety continuing medical education. 140 Data from interfacility transfer guidelines items from the National Pediatric Readiness Assessment , fielded and reported by the EMSC Data Center Data .

This increase in funding will provide additional funding to states to address critical gaps that remain for access to high quality emergency and trauma care, including pre-hospital and hospital emergency medical services, for children across the country. EMSC agencies are a critical resource in r esponding to childhood trauma, youth suicide (now the second leading cause of death for people aged 10-34148) and the health and social/emotional impact o f the COVID -19 pandemic on children. Currently, only 26% of EMS agencies require demonstration of effective use of pediatric equipment, less than a third of EMS agencies have dedicated p ediatric emergency care coordinators, and only 58% of hospitals have inter- facility transfer guidelines, all of which are critical for improving pediatric rea diness and improving outcomes.149 Additional funding to states will help to increase readiness in E MS agencies and hospitals across the country through additional personnel and quality/training supports. Funding will also support State EMSC programs to build mental health capacity for children in emergency departments. This growing issue is particularly important from an equity stand point\u2014black children had 1.5 times the rate of mental health diagnoses in the emergency department compared to white children, and the rate of ED visits is increasing faster for black 146 Goyal MK, Johnson TJ, Chamberlain JM, Cook L, Webb M, Alessandrini E, Bajaj L, Lorch S, Grundmeier RW, Alpern ER.

Major and persistent racial and ethnic disparities exist for infant mortality, maternal mortality, and other adverse outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Following a plateau between 2000 and 2005, the U.S. infant mortality rate declined nearly 18 percent overall and 20 percent for non- Hispanic Black infants between 2005 and 2019. However, the non- Hispanic Black infant mortality rate continues to be more than twice that for non- Hispanic whites. The five leading causes of infant mortality in the U.S. include birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, maternal pregnancy complications, sudden infant death syndrome, and injuries. There is a potential for reducing each of these causes o f death, particularly among low- income families and communities. Preterm birth (defined as birth at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation) is a key risk factor for infant death. More than two-thirds of all infant deaths occur among infants born preterm. After declining from 2007 to 2014, the U.S. preterm birth rate increased nearly 6.9 percent from 9.57 percent in 2014 to 10.23 percent in 2019. Non -Hispanic Black women continue to be more likely to experience preterm birth than non-Hispanic white women (14.38 and 9.26 percent, respectively, in 2019). Greater rates of preterm birth and preterm -related infant deaths among non- Hispanic Blacks account for over half of the infant mortality gap compared to non- Hispanic white s. Healthy Start aims to reduce these disparities by empowering high-risk women and their families to identify and access needed services to improve the health of mothers and children before, during, and after pregnancy. Healthy Start targets communities with infant mortality rates that are at least 1\u00bd times the U.S. national average and/or with high indicators of poor perinatal outcomes, particularly among non-225 Hispanic Black and other disproportionately affected populations. In FY 2021, Healthy Start funded 101 competitive grants in 34 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Healthy Start grantees use four approaches to reduce infant mortality through individual services and community support to women, infants, and families : Improve women's health before, during, and between pr egnancies; Improve family health and wellness to improve infant health and development; Promote systems change to maximize opportunities for community action to address social determinants of health ; and Assure impact and effectiveness by conducting ongoing HS workforce development, data collection, quality improvement, performance monitoring, and evaluation. Healthy Start implements community -based interventions and helps to ensure a well- prepared quality workforce; establishes an information system for client services coordination; and supports ongoing evaluation and quality improvement at the local and national levels. The Healthy Start service delivery model engages the entire family, working with women and their families before, during, and after pregnancy, and through the first 18 months after birth. With the recent emphasis on including the partners of enrolled women, the program has begun actively recruiting fathers/males in education, activities, services, and events. Service provision begins with direct outreach by Healthy Start community health workers to women who are at an increased risk of adverse maternal health outcomes. Each enrolled Healthy Start family receives a standardized, comprehensive assessment that considers physical and behavioral health, employment, housing, intimate partner violence risks, and more. Case managers link women and families to appropriate services and a medical home. Healthy Start delivers services using a range of approaches, including on-site provider/program locations, in-home visits, and community locations/events. Services incorporate: Referrals and ongoing health care coordination for well-woman, prenatal, postpartum, and well -child care; Case management and linkage to social services; Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use counseling; Nutritional counseling and breastfeeding support; Perinatal depression screening and linkage to behavioral health services; Inter -conception education and reproductive life planning; and Child development education and parenting support. Healthy Start works with individual communities to build upon their existing resources to improve the quality of, and access to, healthcare for women and infants. Every Healthy Start project has a Community Action Network (CAN) composed of neighborhood residents, key community leaders, perinatal care clients or consumers, medical and social service providers, as well as faith -based and business community representatives. Together they identify and address barriers in their community, including fragmented service delivery, lack of culturally appropriate health and social services, and barriers to accessing care. The CAN also coordinates care and helps ensure the maximum and non-duplicated use of resou rces and services. Healthy Start projects collaborate with federal, state, and local programs, including but not limited to: the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; Special 226 Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); Early Head Start; Title V State Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; and local perinatal systems such as those in community health centers. These collaborations strengthen the services provided and help reduce risk factors, such as subs tance use during pregnancy, while promoting healthy behaviors that can lead to improved outcomes for women and their families. Healthy Start may also provide home visiting services, but in communities whe re there is a home visiting program, programs are expected to collaborate in order to maximize coordination and minimize duplication. Regular collection of program data enables HRSA and grantees to monitor and evaluate ongoing activities, as well as to id entify technical assistance needs. HRSA is launching two new data systems to streamline and improve data collection and reporting efforts. The Healthy Start Monitoring and Evaluation Data System will enable grantees to more efficiently submit reports to HR SA and will facilitate monitoring of grantee data. A dditionally, HRSA is adapting CAREWare for voluntary use by Healthy Start grantees. This system will serve as a site- level data and case management system. HRSA supports ongoing technical assistance, training, and education for grantees through the Healthy Start EPIC Center ( www.healthystartepic.org ). EPIC Center services include strengthening staff skills to implement evidence- based practices in maternal and child health; facilitating grantee -to-grantee shar ing of expertise and lessons from the field; and sharing resources for effective program delivery. The EPIC center has been instrumental in providing COVID-19- related training to Healthy Start grantees whose programs and program participants have been impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Information gathered through grantee listening sessions conducted through the EPIC Center has informed trainings for grantees on how to adapt in-person services to remote or virtual services to protect the health and safety of their clients and staff. Grantee reports indicate mental and behavioral needs have increased during the COVID-19 public health emergency, including those needs linked to anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, suicidality, and substance use. Healthy Start program participants are also experiencing challenges such as job loss, food insecurity, and housing instability. HRSA anticipates the need for additional programmatic TA to help grantees meet these challenges will continue to grow. In FY 2019, Healthy Start began supporting a new initiative to reduce maternal mortality through hiring of clinical service providers (e.g., nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and other maternal- child advance practice health p rofessionals) to provide clinical services, such as well -woman care and maternity care services, within program sites nationwide. In FY s 2020 and 2021, HRSA used $15 million to support these activities within existing Healthy Start grants. To date, 92 grantees have received clinician funding. Program Accomplishments In CY 2019 there was a change in the composition of grantees funded by HRSA due to a re- competition of the program and new awards were made in April 2019 for the five- year period of 2019-2024. As a result of the re-competition in FY 2019, Healthy Start began funding 18 new grantees and stopped funding 17 grantees of the original cohort. The re-competition and funding of new grantees has had an impact on the overall data collected for FY 2019; new grantees, who 227 comprise 20 percent of the new cohort, will need additional time to demonstrate improvem ents in key indicators. For example, a number of program performance measures did not meet targets after having been relatively stable for several y ears prior. The infant mortality rate in the United States for 2017 -2018 (two- year average) was 5.73 per 1,000 live births. The 2017-2019 (three- year average) infant mortality rate among Healthy Start participants was 7.98 per 1,000 live births, which reflects the high risk populations targeted by the program.154 This is the second year in which the program is monitoring and reporting a multi- year infant mortality rate among the Healthy Start participants. Healthy Start is committed to data -driven and evidence- based decision -making. HRSA is investing in a one-year contract to design the next evaluation plan for the Healthy Start program with the secondary purpose of assessing grantee data collection and evaluation capacity. These efforts are building from evaluation work that began in 2017 when Healthy Start initiated a national evaluation to explore associations between program participation and participant- level characteristics. Findings from the evaluation showed positive outcomes related to program goals. 155 These include earlier and more -frequent prenatal care, greater engagement in infant safe sleep practices, and lower rates of low birth weight. HS participants also met or exceeded targets with respect to usual source of care and depression screening. Funding History FY Amount FY The FY 2022 Budget Request for the Healthy Start program of $128.0 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted Level . Within this total, funding is also continued at $15.0 million to allow grantees to hire clinical service providers at Healthy Start sites to provide direct access to well woman care and maternity care services. This will reduce barriers to care and better address 154 A multi- year infant mortality rate (IMR) is reported for 2017 -2019. This allows the Healthy Start program to track infant mortality while taking into consideration that infant death is a rar e event and when calculated within small populations, such as the Healthy Start program population, IMRs can appear to change substantially if there is even a small difference in the n umber of deaths within a single year. Such changes may be due to normal variation and are not necessarily caused by actual change in the underlying risk. The IMRs for the single years 2017 to 2019 are as follows: 2017: Healthy Start 9.47 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.79 per 1,000 live births 2018: Healthy Start 6.26 per 1,000 live births, United States 5.67 per 1,000 live births 2019: Healthy Start 8.05 per 1,000 live births, United States (2019 data not yet available from CDC/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 155 Abt Associates (2020).

In FY 2022, the program will continue to serve women and families across the nation through the 101 grants awarded in the FY 2019 funding cycle. Healthy Start expects to serve at least 80,000 participants in FY 2022 with case management services. Recognizing that improving birth outcomes begins with improving women's health before, during, and between pregnancies, funding will continue to improve access to quality healthcare and support services for women and children throughout the prenatal, p ostpartum, and interconception periods. HRSA will continue to collect program data through the Healthy Start Monitoring and Evaluation Data System in order to strengthen performance monitoring and program evaluation. The funding request also includes cos ts associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Four million newborns each year are screened for at least 30 of the 35 core conditions on the Recomm ended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), a list of conditions recommended by the Secretary of HHS for state newborn screening programs. Babies testing positive for one of these conditions receive early intervention and treatment to prevent serious problems such as brain damage, organ damage, and even death. Newborn screening saves or improves the lives of more than 12,000 babies in the U nited States each year. The program is composed of six different projects. The Newborn Screening Data Repository and Technical Assistance Program seeks to enhance, improve, and expand the newborn screening system by supporting state public health newborn screening programs, public health professionals, and primary and specialty care providers. The program also tracks and estimates the incidence of screened conditions. These data help the program assist states and territories to implement quality improvement activities, evaluate newborn screening program impact, and address gaps in newborn screening follow-up. In addition, the program supports states with implementing conditions recently added to the RUSP. The Quality Improvement in Newborn Screening Program supports states to improve the outcomes of newborns with conditions identified through newborn screening by improving: o The amount of time it takes to identify infants at high risk for having one of these conditions; 231 o The processes used for detecting out-of-range results and the procedures for reporting out-of-range results to providers; and o The methods state newborn screening programs use to confirm diagnoses. In addition, the program addresses emerging issues, or any other newborn screening process or procedure that could negatively affect the quality, accuracy, or timeliness of newborn screening. The program supports 30 states to use quality improvement methodology to improve the newborn screening system. The Newborn Screening Family Education Program seeks to increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of newborn screening for parents, families, patient advocacy and support groups, as well as the public at large. The purpose of this program is to develop and deliver educational programs about newborn screening, counseling, testing, follow-up, treatment, and specialty services. The Regional Genetics Networks address the challenges of enhancing, improving, or expanding access to screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having or at risk for genetic disorders. The networks link patients to genetic services and provide resources to genet ic service providers, public health officials, and families. Long- Term Follow -Up for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Implementation and Other Newborn Screening Conditions Program : The purpose of this program is to support comprehensive models of long- term follow -up that demonstrate collaborations between clinicians, public health agencies, and families. The program works to ensure that newborns and children identified through newborn screening achieve the best possible outcomes by expanding the abil ity of state public health agencies to provide screening, counseling, and services to these newborns and children . The program also supports collaboration with clinicians, public health agencies, and families to create a system of care that can assess and coordinate follow-up and treatment of SCID and/or other newborn screening conditions. The Newborn Screening Interoperability Program : The purpose of this program is to provide state newborn screening programs with expertise, training, and education in informatics and to support programs in the development and implementation of comprehensive data interoperability plans. The aim is to ensure accurate and timely data sharing between entities involved in the newborn screening system, including hospitals, providers, laboratories, registries, vital records and other state programs. The overall goal is to improve outcomes for newborns and children affected by a condition identified through newborn screening. In FY 2020, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children was re- established as a discretionary committee. The Committee continues to provide national newborn screening guidance and standards as well as advise the Secretary on reducing mortality or morbidity from heritable disorders, conduct evidence-based reviews of conditions to recommend updates to the RUSP, and consider ways to ensure state and territory capacity to screen for RUSP conditions. Since 2009, the program also supports the Clearinghouse of Newborn Screening Information as a central source of current educational and family support information, materials, resources, research, and data on newborn screening. The Newborn Screening Information Center is 232 interact ive and contains links to various resources including government-sponsored, non- profit organizations, laboratories, and other organizations with expertise in newborn screening; research -based information on newborn screening tests currently available throughout the United States; and information about newborn conditions and screening services available in each state. I n response to the COVID-19 global pandemic and needs expressed by newborn screening programs across the nation, NewSTEPs, the Newborn Screening Family Education Program, and the regional genetics networks provided technical assistance to states around laboratory supply and support needs; emergency and contingency planning tools and resources, including information about access to care through telehealth; and educational materials to their constituents and stakeholders. The program addresses health equity through the Regional Genetics Networks and the Newborn Screening Education program, which aim to increase access to genetic services and information for underserved populations. Additionally, The Western States Regional Genetics Network has developed a national minority genetics professional network to support and encourage increased diversity across all genetics professions. Funding His tory FY Amount FY 2022 Budget Request for the Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children program of $18.88 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted Level . This request will invest $1 8.88 million to continue support of the six projects and associated awards that comprise the Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children program. This includes continued support of state and local public health agencies, public health professionals, and primary and specialty care providers in their ability to provide screening, counseling, and health care services to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by heritable disorders in newborns and children. The program will continue to fund efforts to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding of newborn screening and enhance, improve, or expand access to screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having or at risk for genetic disorders. T he funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. 233 Grant Awards Table FY 2020 Final FY 2021 Enacted FY 2022 President's Budget 16 16 5 +3 Author izing Legislation - Public Health Service Act, Section 330M, as added by Public Law 114-255 FY 2022 Authorization.................................................................$9,000,000 Allocation Method Competitive co -operative agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary care by supporting the development of new, or the improvement of existing, statewide or regional pediatric mental health care telehealth access programs. These programs provide tele-consultation, training, technical assistance, and care coordination for pediatric primary care providers to diagnose, treat and refer children with behavioral health conditions. This program works to address the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and other behavioral health clinicians who can identify behavioral disorders in children and adolescents and provide appropriate services through telehealth technologies that support and promote long- distance clinical health care, clinical consultation, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration. Approximately 22.1 percent of children ages 17 and under living in the U.S. experience at least one mental disorder in a given year. 161 Of those, only 53.5 percent received mental health treatment or counseling in the past year.162 Significant disparities exist in access to behavioral health care. A 2019 study of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health related emergency department visits among children found that Non- Hispanic Black children have more frequent emergency department visits for men tal health than Non-Hispanic White children. 163 Compounding this, approximately 36.2 percent of the U.S population lives in a designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSAs) and only 26.8 percent of the need for mental 161 NCHS, 2018- 2019 National Survey of Children's Health, Indicator 2.10 : Does this child have a mental, emotional, developmental or behavior al (MEDB) problem, age 3 -17 years?. 162 Ghandour RM, Sherman LJ, Vladutiu CJ, Ali MM, Lynch SE, Bitsko RH, Blumberg SJ.

However, they may not have the knowledge and training to screen, diagnose, and treat behavioral disorders and patients may lack access to needed services, leading to conditions severe enough to impair child, adolescent, and family functioning, school performance, and safety. Telehealth strategies, like the ones supported by the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program, connect primary care providers with specialty mental and behavioral health care providers and can be an effective means of increasing access to mental and behavioral health services for children and adolescents, especially those living in rural and other underserved areas. Results from this program will be shared with the field a nd scaled up as feasible and appropriate. PMHCA programs are addressing increases in behavioral health concerns among children and adolescents related to the COVID -19 pandemic, including increased reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts. PMHCA programs are also supporting resilience strategies among families and clinicians. Section 2712 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) (ARP) provides $80 million in funding to support pediatric mental health care access, promoting behavioral health integration into pediatric primary care by supporting state or regional networks of pediatric mental health care teams. HRSA plans to support up to 32 additional PMHCA projects in areas without current HRSA-funded programs. This will bring the total number of PMHCA awards to 53. ARP funds also will be used to establish a new PMHCA Innovation Center to provide technical expertise and assistance to stat e PMHCA programs and to expand evaluation efforts to include newly- funded PMHCA projects. The funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

This program improves the mental health and well-being of pregnant and postpartum women and the social and emotional development of their infants. There are approximately 64 million U.S. women of childbearing age in the U.S and approximately 4 million women give birth in the United States each year. Despite advances in medical care and i nvestments in improving access to care, the maternal mortality rate has continued to rise, most recently reported as 17.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018. 167 Depression is one of the most common complication of pregnancy, experienced by one in seven women .168, 169 CDC data indicate that the rate of depression diagnoses at delivery among pregnant women increased by seven times from 2000-2015. Additionally, substance misuse can co- occur with mental disorders and is at least as common as many of the other medical conditions typically screened for and managed during 167 Maternal Mortality 168 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2018 committee opinion.

Intervening early, and offering integrated services and suppor t can prevent or reverse these effects. D espite the importance of screening and early intervention, these services are often unavailable due to limited access to behavioral health resources for front-line health care providers. A nationwide shortage of psychiatrists, especially perinatal psychiatrists, compounds this issue. Women in rural and medically underserved areas are especially vulnerable to these shortages and experience poorer health outcomes than urban women. The Screening and Treatment for Ma ternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program addresses these gaps by employing a myriad of strategies, including : P roviding front -line h ealth care providers with real -time psychiatric consultation and care coordination support, as well as training on evidence-based and culturally and linguistically appropriate screening, assessment, and treatment protocols; In creas ing universal screening in project areas ; and I mproving access to treatment and referral for maternal depression and related behavioral health disorders, such as anxiety and substance use disorder, for pregnant and postpartum women.

Staffed by family members who have first-hand experience using health care services and programs for CYSHCN, F2F HICs promote cost- effective, quality health care by providing patient-centered information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of CYSHCN and health professionals. Initially authorized by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the program funded one health information center in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since then, F2F HICs have been developed in all territories and also for Indian tribes. Most recently, the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-39) reauthorized the program through FY 2024. T he F2F HICs empower families of CYSHCN to be partners in health care decision making by: H elping families gain the knowledge and ski lls to make informed health care choices that promote good treatment decisions, cost effectiveness, and improved health outcomes; D eveloping models for building working relationships between families and health professionals to assist in providing appropri ate services and information; P roviding training and guidance to health professionals on the care of CYSHCN; C onducting outreach activities to families, health professionals, schools, and other appropriate entities to increase their knowledge of F2F HICs a nd the resources available for CYSHCN and their families; and E nlisting families of CYSHCN and health professionals to staff these efforts. 172 FY 2021 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 173 FY 2022 reflects the post -seques tration funding amount 243 Research supports the effectiveness of the F2F HIC strategy.174 Evidence shows CYSHCN experience improved health outcomes and cost-savings when families are empowered to make informed choices about their care and partner with health professional s.175 Documented outcomes include: Improved transition from pediatric to adult health care systems; Fewer unmet health needs, bet ter community -based systems; Fewer problems with specialty referral s; Lowered out-of-pocket costs; Improved physical and behavioral functions; and Increased access to preventive health care in a medical home. In FY 2019 F2F HICs provided services to 208,318 families, which exceeded the target of 174,300 families. In addition, in FY 2019, F2F HICs trained and provided information, resources, and referrals to 110,023 health professionals who serve CYSHCN and their families within community and state public heal th agencies, managed care and insurance organizations, medical practices, children's hospitals, universities, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and more.

To a ddress health equity, an objective of the F2F program is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented and diverse communities trained to partner with families at all levels of decision making. The F2Fs are doing this through targeted outreach and leadership development to specific populations. Additionally, F2Fs participated in community forums and town halls led by Family Voices to address the impact of racism on CYSH CN and their families. To addr ess the impact of COVID -19, in FY 2020, 56 grantees received funding through the CARES Act to help prepare families to access services through telehealth, especially those in underserved communities. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

The MIECHV Program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during pregnancy and in the first years of life have the potential to improve the lives of children and families by: H elping to prevent child abuse and neglect; Encouraging positive parenting; Improving maternal and child health; and Promoting child development and school readiness. By providing necessary resources and supports, home visiting empowers families. Evidence- based home visiting can be cost- effective in the long term, with the lar gest benefit s coming through reduced spending on government programs and increased individual earnings.188 185 FY 2020 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 186 FY 2021 reflects the pos t-sequestration funding amount. 187 FY 2022 reflects the post -sequestration funding amount. 188 Michalopoulos, C, et. al. (2017). Evidence on the Long -Term Effects of Home Visiting Programs: Laying the Groundwork for Long -Term Follow -Up in the Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE). OPRE Report 2017- 73. 247 States, territories, and tribal entities participating in MIECHV direct their home visiting efforts to at-risk communities. The statute defines at- risk communities as those with concentrations of: Premature birth, low birth weight infants, and infant mortality, including infant death due to neglect, or other indicators of at-risk prenatal, maternal, newborn, or child health; Poverty; Crime; Domestic violence; High rates of high Substance abuse; Unemployment; or Child maltreatment. 189 Grantees deliver services by implementing one or more of 19 evidence-based home visiting models, selected by the grantee, which meet HHS established ev idence of effe ctiveness criteria and MIECHV criteria for implementation. Administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness review (HomVEE) assesses the research literature to determine which hom e visiting mod els meet the HHS criteria for evidence of effectiveness. While there is some variation across the 19 evidence-based home visiting models from which grantees may select (e.g., some programs serve expectant mothers as well as parents with young children, whi le others only serve families after the birth of a child), all models share some common characteristics. In these voluntary programs, trained professionals meet regularly with expectant parents or families with young children in their homes, building stron g, positive relationships with families who want and need support. Home visitors work with families to determine their specific needs and provide services tailored to those needs, such as: Teaching parenting skills and modeling effective parenting techniques; Promoting early learning in the home with an emphasis on positive interactions between parents and children and the creation of a language- rich environment that stimulates early language development; Providing information and guidance on a wide range of topics including breastfeeding, safe sleep position, injury prevention, and nutrition; Conducting screenings and providing referrals to address caregiver depression, substance abuse, and family violence; Screening children for developmental delays and facilitating early diagnosis and intervention for autism and other developmental disabilities; and Connecting families to other services and resources as appropriate. MIE CHV grantees have the flexibility to tailor the program to serve the specific needs of their states and at -risk communities. In order to meet those needs, grantees conducted needs assessments, which were updated by October 1, 2020, as required under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, to identify eligible at-risk communities, determine priority populations, and choose which approved evidence-based models or promising approaches for home visiting will be used. MIECHV currently distributes funds for delivery of services under early childhood home visiting programs through two types of awards: 189 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 711(b)(1)(A). 248 1. F ormula Grants to states, territories, and nonprofit organizations. 2. C ompetitive Cooperative Agreements to Indian tribes (or a consortium of Indian tribes), tribal org anizations, and urban Indian organizations, as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Additionally, three percent is set aside for research, evaluation, and corrective action technical assistance to grantees. Formula grants to s tates and territories In FY 2020, HRSA awarded $341 million in MIECHV formula grants t o 56 states, territories, and nonprofit organizations.190 Grants are generally administered by the lead state agency for home visiting designated by the Governor or can be competitively awarded to a nonprofit organization in those states or territories that opted not to participate in the grant program. By law , state and territory grantees must spend the majority of their MIECHV funds to implement evidence -based home visiting models, with up to 25 percent of funding available to implement promising approaches for home visiting that undergo rigorous evaluation. In FY 2020, three states implemented and evaluated three promising approaches to better address the needs of their communities. Cooperative agreements to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations Three percent of funding ($12 m illion) is set aside for five -year competitive awards available to tribal entities. As of FY 2020, 29 tribal entities had received funding through the Tribal Home Visiting program, administered by ACF. There are currently 23 Tribal Home Visiting program grantees. The Tribal Home Visiting Program is designed to: Develop and strengthen tribal capacity to support and promote the health and well-being of American Indian and Alaska Native families through home visiting programs; Expand the evidence base around home visiting in tribal communities; and Support and strengthen cooperation and linkages between programs that serve Native children and their families. G rantees may choose to implement either Family Spirit, the one evidence-based home visiting model with evidence of effectiveness in tribal communities, or a promising approach for home visiting (which includes any model that meets the evidence of effectiveness criteria for the formula grants but does not have specific evidence of effectiveness in American Indian and Alaska Native populations). S ection 9101 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) (ARP) appropriated $150 million to enable MIECHV Program recipients to address the needs of ex pectant parents and families with young children during the COVID -19 public health emergency. HRSA will make formula -based awards to all current MIECHV recipients to support direct COVID- related costs (e.g., costs associated with shifting to virtual service including the provision of technology-related items, basic supplies such as formula, diapers, and groceries to families, and hazard pay 190 In FY 2020, N orth Dakota was awa rded one dollar, which allows them to apply for future funding. Further fundi ng for North Dakota will be determined upon satisfactory compliance with established HRSA programmatic and financial requirements for previous HRSA grants representing multiple fiscal years. 249 and other supports for staff) and expand services to families in communities at risk for poor maternal and child healt h outcomes. HRSA will make competitive awards to current MIECHV awardees to document and evaluate programmatic innovations intended to enable MIECHV awardees to better serve families in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, funds will be used to support current MIECHV recipients serving tribal communities and for administration of the program. Program Accomplishments MIECHV state and territory grantees provided over 7 .1 million visits from FY 2012 through FY 2020. In FY 2020 states reported serving more than 140,000 parents and children in 1,054 counties across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories. This is more than a 300 percent increase in the number of participants served since FY 2012 (see Tables 1 and 2 below). Tribal grantees provided over 123,000 home visits fro m FY 2012 to FY 2020 and served over 3,315 parents and children in FY 2020. Table 1: Number of State/Territory Participants (FY 2012 - FY 20 20) 191 Fiscal Year Number of Participants 2012 34,180 2013 75,970 2019 154,496 2020 140,606 191 Data in Tables 1 and 2 represent the number of participants and home visits provided by state and territory grantees (does not include tribal data). 192 Reflects changes HRSA made to reporting definitions beginning in FY 2017 clarifying that only participants whose services were directly supported with federal funds should be included in MIECHV reports. 193 Does not include data from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to reporting delays caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. 194 Does not include data from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to reporting delays caused by Super Typhoon Yutu. 250 Table 2: Number of Home Visits by State/Territory Grantees (FY 2012 - FY 20 20) Fiscal Year Number of Home Visits 2012 174,257 2013 at -risk families. In FY 20 20: 70 percent of participating families had household incomes at or below 100 percent of the federal povert y guidelines ($26,000 for a family of four), and 41 percent were at or below 50 percent of those guidelines; 25 percent of adult program participants had less than a high school education, and 38 percent had only a high school degree or equivalent; and 10 percent of households included pregnant teens; 21 percent of households reported a history of child abuse and maltreatment; and 15 percent of households reported substance abuse. Performance data collected to fulfill the statutory requirement of a three -year assessment of improvement 198 were most recently updated in FY 2016. These data indicate that 98 percent of states, territories, and non-profit grantees demonstrated improvement in at least four of the six benchmark areas for demonstrating program improve ments as outlined in the legislation: Improving maternal and newborn health; Preventing child injuries, maltreatment, and emergency department visits; Improving school readiness and achievement; Reducing crime or domestic violence; Improving family ec onomic self -sufficiency; and Improving service coordination and referrals for other community resources and supports. Since FY 2017, following a redesign of the MIECHV performance measurement system, grantees have been reporting on 19 standardized performance indicators and systems outcome measures. These performance measures allow grantees to more effectively monitor and 195 Reflects changes HRSA made to reporting def initions beginning in FY 2017 clarifying that only participants whose services were directl y supported with federal funds should be included in MIECHV reports. 196 Does not include data from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to reporting delays caused by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. 197 Does not include data from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to reporting delays caused by Super Typhoon Yutu. 198 Performance data represent data submitted after three years of program implementation a s required under Social Security Act, Title V, \u00a7 511(d)(1)(B) 251 understand program performance, and implement continuous quality improvements in home visiting. The statute requir es an evaluation of the MIECHV Program. To fulfill this requirement, the Mother and Infant Home Visiting Program Evaluation (MIHOPE) was initiated in 2011. Released in November 2018, 199 findings from the MIHOPE Implementation Report include: that the local programs that participated in MIHOPE served eligible families in disadvantaged communities with high levels of socioeconomic risk as intended by the program; most home visitors were well educated, trained and experienced; local programs focused on improving parenting and child development outcomes; and the tailoring of services to families' needs was especially evident in areas of substance use, mental health, and intimate partner violence. The MIHOPE Impact Report, released in January 2019, 200 presents evidence that MIECHV -funded home visiting services had positive effects for the families that participated in services, including in the quality of the home environment and the frequency of psychological aggression towards the child. The study provides evidenc e that differences in effects among the evidence -based models that were included in the study are generally consistent with the models' focuses.

Funds will continue to support the statutory directive for an ongoing portfolio of research and evaluation on home visiting, which includes the MIHOPE Long- Term Follow -Up evaluation, the Home Visiting Research and Development Platform, the Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network, a multi- site imp lementation study of Tribal Home Visiting, and a tribal early childhood research center. Technical assistance to grantees is of vital importance to ensure that home visiting services are provided with quality and fidelity to evidence-based and promising approach home visiting service delivery models. The funding will support contracts for technical assistance to state, territory, and tribal grantees for performance measure ment, implementation, data systems, quality improvement, and research and evaluation to help grantees enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their home visiting programs.

Nearly sixty one percent of clients (patients) live at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and approximately three-quarters of RWHAP clients are racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP statute requires that the program is the \"payor of last resort,\" meaning RWHAP funds can only be used for allowable services not covered by other federal or state programs, or private insurance. Since 1990, RWHAP has developed a comprehensive system of safety net providers who deliver high quality direct health care and support services to over half a million people with HIV 215 - more than 50 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV in the United States.216 This is one of the many reasons why the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is leading key components of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative . Working within the RWHAP statute, funding priorities are guided by stakeholders at local and state levels, resulting in uniquely structured programs that address t heir jurisdictions' critical gaps and needs. HRSA also works in partnership with RWHAP recipients at state and local levels to use innovative, evidence informed approaches for community engagement, needs assessment, planning processes, policy development, service delivery, clinical quality improvement, and workforce development activities that are needed to support a robust system of HIV care, support and treatment. The RWHAP provides HIV care and treatment services to a higher proportion of certain populations with HIV than their representation in the epidemic nationally. For example, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, 71 percent of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States are racial and ethnic minori ties, while 73 percent of RWHAP clients are racial and ethnic minorities, meeting the target of not being lower than 3 percentage points of the national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC.217 Similarly, 24 percent of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States are women, while 26 percent of RWHAP clients are women, meeting the target of not being lower than 3 percentage points of the national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. The RWHAP is critical to ensur ing that individuals with HIV are linked to care, retained in care, able to adhere to medication regimens, and ultimately, achieve viral suppression. These steps are not only crucial to ensuring optimal health outcomes of people with HIV but to preventing 215 Health Resources and Services Administration.

According to a Clinical Infectious Diseases study, clients receiving care and support at RWHAP- funded facilities are associated with improved outcomes (such as viral suppression), compared to those not served by the RWHAP.225 Furthermore, RWHAP patients are more likely to reach viral suppression regardless of other health care coverage (e.g., uninsured, Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance). Not only do improved viral suppression rates reduce the transmission of HIV, they also result in significant cost- savings to the health care system. 226 The RWHAP has made tremendous progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States: from 2010 to 2019, HIV viral suppression among RWHAP patients has i ncreased from 69.5 percent to 88.1 percent, and racial and ethnic, age-based, and regional disparities have decreased. 227 However, even with these positive outcomes, fully addressing the HIV epidemic domestically continues to be a challenge as t he CDC estimates more than 1 .1 million people in 218 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on Friday, March 27, 2020, provided this funding. The FY 2020 CARES Act funding supports RWHAP P arts A -D and the RWHAP AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC) recipients to prepare for, prevent, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. HRSA continues to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the RWHAP. As states, cities, clinics, and community -based organizations adjusted to the rapidly changing health care environment, HRSA worked to more fully understand the impact that these adjustments, including transitioning to telehealth, diverting staff to work on COVID-19, etc., would have on program imple mentation, access to care and support services, and patient health outcomes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, Division M, \u00a7 307 included language which allowed flexibilities related to penalties and administrative requirements th at the Secretary could exercise to provide relief to RWHAP recipients. After careful review of RWHAP penalties and requirements, HRSA responded by providing opportunities to reduce or delay requirements without compromising the integrity, scope, and implementation of the RWHAP. Given the on-going nature of the pandemic, the Budget proposes to extend this language in FY 2022 to allow continued flexibilities. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative, which began in FY 2020, aims to reduce new HIV infections to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. The multi- year EHE initiative focuses on 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden. The initiative will bring the additional expertise, technology, and resources needed to end the HIV epidemic in the United States. The four pillars of the initiative (Diagnose, Treat, Prevent, and Respond) will be implemented across the entire U.S. over the next 10 years. W ithout this EHE initiative, new infections will continue and could increase, costing more lives and the U.S. government more than $200 billion in direct lifetime medical costs for HIV prevention and medication. In FY 2021, HRSA awarded funds to the 39 RWH AP Part A recipients and 8 Part B recipients that encompass the 48 counties, Washington, D.C., San Juan (PR), as well as 7 states that have a substantial rural HIV burden. Jurisdictions will utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States.

The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support services and effective system for medication de livery cre ates a very efficient and effective service delivery mechanism for this initiative. Additional Priorities and Collaborative Efforts In FY 2022, the HRSA RWHAP will continue to ensure effective use of resources and a coordinated and focused publi c health r esponse to HIV. HRSA will also continue to coordinate and collaborate with other federal, state, and local entities as well as national HIV organizations to further leverage and promote efforts to address the unmet care and treatment needs of people with H IV who are uninsured and underserved. These efforts help to align priorities, policies, and activities in sustaining a multi- faceted and comprehensive federal response to the HIV epidemic. Federal partners include the Office of the Assistant Secr etary for Health (OASH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Indian Health Service (IHS), the National Institutes of H ealth (NIH), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as other HRSA-funded programs, such a s the Heal th Center Program. With many clients in common, HRSA RWHAP will also coordinate with the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to leverage existing resources in both programs to advance the health outcomes of older adults living with HIV. The HIV National Strategic Plan: A Roadmap to End the HIV Epidemic for the United States (2021 - 2025: HIV Plan): The HIV Plan builds on the targets for ending the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030. For stakeholders across the nation, the HIV Plan a rticulates goals, objectives, and strategies to prevent new infections, treat people with HIV to improve health outcomes, reduce HIV- related disparities, and better integrate and coordinate the efforts of all partners to achieve the bold targets for ending the HIV e pidemic in the United States. The RWHAP will continue to coordinate with other federal partners, grant recipients, and other partners to work towards achieving these four goals. 230 HRSA Press Release. FY 2021 Ending the HIV Epidemic Awards . Date accessed: March 2021. 260 The HRSA RWHAP will also coordinate with federal partners, grant recipients, and other partners to address the syndemics of HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs, and substance use disorders through the following HHS efforts: Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021-2025: The STI plan will develop, enhance and expand STI prevention and care programs over the next five years. The aim is to reverse the recent dramatic rise in STIs in the United States. The STI Plan includes a set of goals, objectives, and strategies to respond to this STI epidemic and includes indicators with measurable targets to track progress. Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States: A Roadmap to Elimination 2021-2025: The Viral Hepatitis Plan is intended to serve as a comprehensive, data-driven roadmap for federal and other stakeholders to reverse the rates of viral hepati tis, prevent new infections, improve care and treatment and ultimately eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in the United States. Substance Use Disorder/Opioid Epidemic: In support of HHS's efforts to lead a national response to the opioid crisis, HRSA will continue to work collaboratively with other federal partners to address opioid use disorder screening, treatment, and support for people wit h HIV. Measu ring Future Performance Together, in FY 2022 RWHAP Parts A- D programs are anticipated to achieve the following performance goals: In FY 2022, the RWHAP will serve racial and ethnic minorities at a proportion not lower than three percentage p oints of national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. In FY 2022, the RWHAP will serve women at a proportion that is not lower than three percentage points of national HIV prevalence data as reported by CDC. In FY 2022, at least 83 percent of all patients receiving HIV medical care and at least one viral load test will be virally suppressed. Additional RWHAP Part- specific performance targets are in the sections that follow. 261 Outcomes and Outputs Table for Over -Arching Performance Measures Measur e Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY Percentage of people with diagnosed HIV served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program who are racial and ethnic minorities.

These jurisdictions are funded as either an Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) or a Transitional Grant Area (TGA), depending on the severity of the epidemic in their jurisdiction. Seventy-one percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside in a RWHAP Part A EMA or TGA. 231,232 F ormula and supplement al grants assist eligible areas in developing and enhancing access to a comprehensive continuum of high quality, community- based care for low -income people with HIV. The RWHAP requires EMAs and TGAs to utilize local needs ass essments and planning processes to develop coordinated systems of HIV care in order to improve health outcomes for low-income people with HIV, thereby reducing transmission of HIV. RWHAP Part A prioritizes primary medical care, access to antiretroviral treatment, and other core medic al and supportive services in order to engage and retain people with HIV in care. These grants fund systems of care to provide services for people with HIV in 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. EMAs are jurisdictions with 2,000 or more AID S cases over the last five years, whereas TGAs are jurisdictions with at least 1,000 but fewer than 2,000 AIDS cases over the last five 231 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Accessed March 2021. 263 years as reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two-thirds of the funds available for EMAs and TGAs are awarded according to a for mula, based on the number of people with diagnosed HIV in the EMAs and TGAs. The remaining funds are awarded as discretionary supplemental grants based on the demonstration of additional need by the eligible EMAs and TGAs, and as Minority AIDS Initiativ e (MAI) grants. The MAI funds are a statutory set-aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D, and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center programs to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and t he disparities in access, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities . MAI funds are also awarded based on a formula utilizing the number of minorities with diagnosed HIV and AIDS in a jurisdiction and support HIV care, treatment, and s upport services to racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP Part A funds are awarded to the Chief Elected Official who is required to establish a local Planning Council/Body that determines the allocation of RWHAP resources based on local needs assessments . Seventy -five percent of RWHAP Part A funds must be used to support core medical services . Eligible sub- recipients are community health centers, health departments, ambulatory care facilities, and other non-profit organizations providing services for people with HIV. In 2019, 78 percent of RWHAP Part A clients were racial and ethnic minorities and 26 percent were women. In 2019, RWHAP Part A funded sites provided nearly 3.3 million core medical service visits for health -related care utilizing a combinatio n of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The number of visits for health- related services demonstrates the scope of RWHAP Part A in delivering primary care and related services for people with HIV by increasing the availability and accessibility of care. Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - RWHAP Part A Jurisdictions Thirty nine of the RWHAP Part A jurisdictions received a cooperative agreement to implement EHE initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2021 . This initiative is now in its second yea r and j urisdictions will utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. See the final pages of the RWHAP section for more information on the EHE initiative. 264 RWHAP Part A Funding History FY Amount FY 2012 2022 President's Budget request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part A of $665.9 million is $10.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level. The President's Budget request will support the provision of core medical and support services for people with HIV in the 24 EMAs and 28 TGAs. The RWHAP has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic due to people with HIV losing other sources of health coverage (such as employer insurance), and state governments' revenue dropping, resulting in state funding cuts. The Budget requests an additional $10.0 million for the RWHAP Part A program to expand services for significantly impacted populations, particularly racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part A jurisdictions encompass over 70 percent of all HIV cases in the US, therefore an increase in funding will help meet this need driven by the pandemic. I n 2019, 65 percent of all RWHAP clients were served by one of the 52 metropolitan areas funded under the RWHAP Part A. Nearly 71 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV reside within these metropolitan areas. The RWHAP serves populations that are diverse with multiple structural barriers to care (e.g., people with HIV at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level and/or those who are homeless). T he FY 2022 funding request will support the RWHAP Part A in achieving its target of providing 3.3 million core medical servi ce visits for health -related care. RWHAP Part A jurisdictions are experienced in data-driven, community-based needs assessment, responsive procurement of a variety of direct medical and supportive services, working across service providers to develop and maintain a system of services, and serving diverse populations. RWHAP Part A funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2022 targets for performance goals that relate to cross -cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minoritie s and women served, percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression, and percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women served by RWHAP who receive antiretroviral medications. 265 The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and a ward process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

RWHAP Part B grants support outpatient ambulatory medical care, HIV-r elated prescription medications, case management, oral health care, health insurance premium and cost -sharing assistance, mental health and substance abuse services, and support services. RWHAP Part B funds are distributed through base and supplemental grants, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) base and ADAP supplemental grants, Emerging Communities (ECs) grants, and Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) grants. The base awards are distributed by a formula based on a state or territory's prevalent HIV cases weighted for cases outside of the jurisdictions that receive RWHAP Part A funding. The ECs are metropolitan areas that do not qualify as RWHAP Par t A EMAs or T GAs but have 500-999 cumulative reported AIDS cases over the last five years. States apply on behalf of the ECs for funding through the RWHAP Part B base grant application. RWHAP Part B supplemental grants are available through a competitive p rocess to eli gible states with demonstrated need. 269 A portion of the RWHAP Part B appropriation supports ADAP, which supports the provision of HIV medications and related services, including health insurance premium and cost-sharing assistance. These fund s are distrib uted by a formula based on prevalent HIV cases. In addition, ADAP supplemental funds are a five percent set aside for states with severe need. ADAP provides FDA-approved prescription medications for people with HIV who cannot afford HIV medications. ADAP i s instrumental in efforts to end the HIV epidemic across the nation. ADAP provides the access to medications and insurance necessary for people with HIV to achieve optimal health outcomes and viral suppression. Individual ADAPs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. T he M AI funds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center programs to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, and the disparities in access, treatment, care, and outcomes for, racial and ethnic minorities. The RWHAP Part B MAI funding is statutorily required to specifically support education and outreach services to increase the number of eligible racial and ethnic minorities who have access to the RWHAP ADAP. O f all the c lients served by the RWHAP Part B program in 2019, 73 percent were racial and/ethnic minorities, and 26 percent were women. Per statute, 75 percent of RWHAP Part B funds must be used to support core medical services and in 2019, RWHAP Part B funded sites provided 2.7 m illion core medical service visits for health -related care utilizing RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. The number of visits for health- related services demonstrates the scope of RWHAP Part B in delivering primary care and related services fo r people with HIV by increasing the availability and accessibility of care. E nding the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. - States S even RWHAP Part B recipients and the state of Ohio (on behalf of Hamilton County, which is currently not part of an EMA/TGA), rece ived a cooperative agreement to implement EHE initiative activities related to Pillar Two (Treat) and Pillar Four (Respond) in FY 2021. This initiative is now in its second year and j urisdictions will continue to utilize their existing infrastructure to implement effective and innovative strategies, interventions, approaches, and services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. See the final pages of the RWHAP section for more information on the EHE initiative. A IDS Drug Assistance Program The R WHAP Part B has been successful in helping to ensure that people with HIV have access to the care and treatment services they need to live longer, healthier lives. According to the RWHAP ADAP Report, ADAPs, which are run by states and territories, continue to provide robust formularies of antiretroviral medications to treat HIV infection, prevent and treat opportunistic infections, manage side effects, and treat co- morbidities. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with HIV on antiretrovira l medications who achieve viral suppression are not at risk to transmit HIV to others. The RWHAP provides the care and 270 treatment services that support the achievement of viral suppression and therefore, has a significant public health impact on HIV inciden ce as well. These efforts demonstrate the central role of the RWHAP in ending the HIV epidemic by ensuring that people with HIV have access to regular care, are started on, and adhere to, their antiretroviral medications. A ccording to the RWHAP ADAP dat a, the number of people with HIV receiving ADAP services has grown 42 percent over the last nine years from 208,809 clients in 2010, to 296,930 clients in 2019, exceeding the FY 2019 target by 37,399. In FY 2019, the RWHAP ADAP provided medication and heal th care coverage assistance for 28 percent of people diagnosed with HIV in the United States and 70 percent of all clients served by ADAPs were racial and ethnic minorities. Of all the ADAP clients served nationwide, nearly 72 percent had incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. ADAP Cost Containment: Increased demand for RWHAP ADAP services has led States to implement cost- containment strategies for their ADAPs. Cost- containment measures include using drug-purchasing strategies su ch as cost recovery through drug rebates and third party billing and direct ly negotiating pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, states have implemented cost-savings strategies such as recovering costs when another payor was primary, coordinating benefits wi th Medicare Part D, and improving drug-purchasing models. ADAPs have reported significant savings by participating in manufacturer rebate programs and recovering costs through insurance reimbursement. Across the RWHAP, grant recipients are encouraged to m aximize resources and leverage efficiencies. One example of this is within RWHAP Part B, where ADAPs use a variety of the above-mentioned strategies to maximize resources, which result in effective funds management, enabling ADAPs to serve more people. In 2019, ADAPs participating in cost- savings strategies on medications saved $2.6 billion, exceeding the FY 2019 performance target of $2.1 billion. Over the last 5 years, ADAPs participating in medication cost-savings strategies saved $8.9 billion. Elimina tion of ADAP Waiting Lists: Because of investments in RWHAP Part B, ADAP and the increased technical assistance activities for cost -containment measures, ADAP waiting lists decreased from a peak of 9,310 in September 2011, to zero in August 2015. Since FY 2010, HHS has taken several actions to stabilize the ADAP, including using emergency authority to target States with waiting lists or potential waiting lists, and to implement cost containment and cost savings measures. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue the use of RWHAP ADAP Emergency Relief Funds (ERF) through \"311 authority\" in order to maintain infrastructure in the states and territories that had previously imposed waiting lists and to mitigate the risk of the establishment new wait lists. This is partic ularly important as EHE initiative efforts diagnose more people with HIV and engage people who are out of HIV care and treatment. This funding also addresses the gaps in access created by ongoing cost- containment measures in many ADAPs such as HIV medicati on formulary reductions, lower client financial eligibility levels, and capped enrollment. However, with no individuals on the ADAP waiting lists, states requested and HRSA distributed $75 million in ERF funding in FY 2021. These funds are required to be used f or ADAP services, including the purchase of medications, insurance premium assistance, and medication copay 271 assistance. States that developed need through unforeseen events also have the ability to request RWHAP Part B supplemental funds to assist in meeti ng shortfalls. HRSA continues to closely monitor the impact of COVID -19 on the ADAPs as they anecdotally report an increase in client applications due to the loss of employment and/or health care coverage. The RWHAP ADAP plays a crucial role that ensur es access to HIV medications for pregnant women. Due to availability of effective HIV medications , mother- to-child transmission in the United States has decreased dramatically since its peak in 1992 due to 1) an increased focus on HIV testing for all pregnant women; and 2) the use of antiretroviral therapy, which significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission from the mother to her baby. In 2019, 99 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP were prescribed antiretroviral therapy to prevent maternal -to-child transmission of HIV, exceeding the FY 2019 performance target by 3 percentage points. Funding History FY Amount ADAP 2022 President's Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part B of $1.3 billion is $30.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level. This request includes $900.3 million for RWHAP ADAPs to provide access to life saving HIV related medications and direct health care services to people with HIV in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puer to Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and five Associated Pacific Jurisdictions. HRSA will continue to utilize the 311 authority to implement the Emergency Relief Fund to prevent, reduce, or eliminate ADAP waiting lists through cost containment and/or cost sav ings measures. The RWHAP Part B A DAP program has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to people with HIV losing other sources of health coverage (such as employer insurance) and state government revenue dropping, resulting in state funding cuts. The Budget requests an additional $30.0 million for the RWHAP Part B program base to meet this greater need. By increasing the RWHAP Part B program base, states will have the greatest flexibility in utilizing the funds, whether for ADAP or for other critical services. Additionally, a portion of the additional funding will be directed by statute to the RWHAP Part B supplemental, which will be available to states with the highest unmet needs. As part of the program's efforts t o continue to provide access to li fe-saving medications and related services for low -income people with HIV, the RWHAP has established a target for FY 2022 of serving at least 280,000 RWHAP ADAP clients. This target is based on anticipated steady funding - not demand. While the number of A DAP clients is projected to remain constant in future years with anticipated steady funding, health care coverage and costs related to co-pays, co-insurance, premiums, etc., are difficult to anticipate. The increased deman d for ADAP services in recent years has required many states to r ecover costs when possible by coordinating benefits with Medicare Part D or exhausting all coverage options, participating in rebate programs, and improving drug-purchasing models. An important contributing factor to the demand for services for RWHAP ADAP continues to be access to HIV medications and high cost-sharing requirements for these medications. In order to meet this demand, the number of ADAPs participating in cost-savings strategies on medications will need to remain steady (the FY 2022 target is to maintain the previous year's output measure). The FY 2022 funding request will support the RWHAP Part B in achieving its target of providing 2.7 million core medical service visits for health -related care. RWHAP Part B grant recipients will continue to work directly with uninsured people with HIV to ensure access to health care coverage and will continue to support HIV medications not on health plan formularies and the cost sharing required by health coverage plans. ADA P resources will also support the continued: increase in RWHAP clients as more people with HIV are diagnosed, linked to care, and retained in care; increase in RWHAP growth as more people enter the health care system with coverage who require assistance with insurance premiums and cost-sharing; and, 273 need for medication and/or health care coverage assistance for clients who remain uninsured. H RSA and the CDC continue to collaborate to accelerate the elimination of pe rinatal HIV transmission in the United States. The FY 2022 funding request will support RWHAP ADAP to ensure that at least 96% of HIV-positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP will receive antiretroviral medications. RWHAP Part B funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2022 targets for performance goals that related to cross -cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, and percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 274 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY care.

RWHAP Part C supports comprehensive primary health care and support services in an outpatient setting for low-income, uninsured, and underserved people with HIV. M inority AIDS Initiative (MAI) fun ds are a statutory set -aside funding component for RWHAP Parts A - D, and Part F AIDS Education and Training Center programs to evaluate and address the disproportionate impact of HIV on, racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part C MAI funding supports HIV care, treatment, and support services to racial and ethnic minorities. RWHAP Part C is also authorized to fund capacity development grants that strengthen organizational development and infrastructure, resulting in a more effective delivery of HIV care and services. The RWHAP Part C provides services for people with HIV disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic and who have poor health outcomes, including ethnic and minority populations and youth. In 2019, RWHAP Part C funded sites served over 330,000 clients utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. Of the total clients served, 73 percent were raci al and ethnic minorities and 26 percent were female. The RWHAP has a history of creating effective patient -centered services that support strong provider and patient relationships. Providers funded through RWHAP Part C have the clinical 278 expertise and cu ltural competency to provide quality care and treatment to low-income, diverse people with HIV. In 2019, RWHAP Part C funded sites provided nearly 2.3 million medical service visits for health -related care utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, an d D funding. The number of visits for health- related services demonstrates the scope of RWHAP Part C in delivering primary care and related services for people with HIV by increasing the availability and accessibility of care. E xpansion of Services I n 2019, HRSA funded 10 RWHAP Part C clinics to provide comprehensive medical care and support services. Six of the ten recipients are located in the southern United States, where there is the greatest burden of new HIV diagnoses, HIV cases, and deaths from HIV. Expanding patient access to direct HIV care services is a priority for HRSA. F unding History B udget R equest The FY 2022 President's Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part C of $207.1 million is $6.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted Level. This funding will support comprehensive medical, treatment and support services necessary to achiev e improved health outcomes, such as improved viral suppression rates, essential to ending the HIV epidemic. The RWHAP has seen a significant increase in utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic as people with HIV have lost other sources of he alth coverage (such as employer insurance) and state governments' revenue has dropped, resulting in state funding cuts. The Budget requests an additional $6.0 million to fund new RWHAP Part C community based clinics in areas of the country with the greates t need. 236 Reflects Ryan White B udget Authority only (does not include $5.089 million in Health Center Program B udget Authority for RWHAP Part C grant recipients in FY FY Part C supports direct health care services for low-income people with HIV who are uninsured or underserved. These services are considered essential to improving health outcomes and are a crucial part of the care network that links and retai ns people with HIV into health care. Such critical health care services include intensive case management and care coordination services, linking and retaining people with HIV into care, and getting them on antiretroviral medications as early as possible. T he fu nding request will support the RWHAP Part C in achieving its target of providing 2.2 million visits for health -related care in FY 2022. RWHAP Part C funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2022 targets for performance goals that relate to cross -cutting activities, such as percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression, and percentage of HIV -positive pregnant women served by the RWHAP who receive antiretroviral medications. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

RWHAP Part D MAI funding supports HIV care, treatment, and support services to racial and ethnic minorities. In 2019, RWHAP Part D funded sites provided nearly 1.6 million visits for health -related care and support services utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. 237 Support services are available for family members who do not have HIV. Some examples are family -centered case management, childcare services during medical appointment attendance, and psychosocial support service s that focus on equipping affected family m embers, and caregivers, to manage the stress associated with HIV. 282 The RWHAP Part D serves women, infant, children, and youth - populations disproportionately affected by HIV epidemic that have poor health outcomes. In 2019, RWHAP Part D funded sites served 219,813 clients utilizing a combination of RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D funding. Of the total clients served, 75 percent were racial and ethnic minorities and 28 percent were female. RWHAP Part D providers have the clinical expertise and cultural competency to provide quality care and treatment to low -income, diverse women, infant, children, and youth with HIV. Funding History FY Amount FY 2012 FY he 2022 President's Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/A IDS Program (RWHAP) Part D of $75.1 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted Level. This funding will support the comprehensive array of medical and supports services necessary to achieve improved health outcomes, such as improved viral suppression rates, essential to ending the HIV epidemic. R WHAP Part D supports health care services for low -income people with HIV who are uninsured or underserved. These services are considered essential to improving health outcomes and are a crucial part of the care netw ork that links and retains people with HIV into health care, especially for women, infants and children and youth. Such critical health care services include intensive case management and care coordination services, linking and retaining people with HIV in to care, and getting them on antiretroviral medications as early as possible. The funding request will support the RWHAP Part D in achieving its target of providing at least 1.5 million heal th-related care and support service visits in FY 2022. RWHAP Part D funding will also contribute to achieving the FY 2022 targets for performance goals that relate to cross - cutting activities, such as the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities and women served, percentage of clients who achieved viral suppression, and percentage of pregnant women with HIV served by the RWHAP who receive antiretroviral medications. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award proce ss, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs. 283 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY care and support services (Output) 2019: 1.5M Target: 1.7M (Target Not Met) 1.5M Enacted FY 2022 President's Budget 115 115 Average Award $583,894 $583,894 $583,894 Range of $113,823 - $2,185,691 284 RWHAP Part F - AIDS Education and Training Programs FY 2020 Final $33,611,000 FTE 5 6 6 --- Authorizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Sec. 2692(a), as amended by Public Law 111-87. FY 2020 Authorization...............................................................................Expired Allocation Method: Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements C ontracts P rogram Description and Accomplishments The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) program supports a network of eight regional centers and two national centers that conduct targeted, multidisciplinary education and training programs for health care providers serving people with HIV in all states, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Associated Ju risdictions. The RWHAP AETC improves the quality of life of people with or at- risk of HIV through the provision of specialized professional education and training. The program uses a strategy of implementation of multidisciplinary education and training programs for health care providers in the prevention and treatment of HIV. T he RWHAP AETCs target training to health care providers who serve minority populations, the homeless, rural communities, incarcerated persons, federally qualified community and migrant health centers, and RWHAP sites. In addition, nearly half the providers themselves are racial and ethnic minorities. In 2018-2019, the proportion of racial and ethnic minority health care providers participating in RWHAP AETC training intervention programs was 51 percent, exceeding the most recent performance target by 8 percentage points. 238 R WHAP AETCs currently train providers through a variety of training modalities, including didactics, clinical preceptorships, self-study, clinical consultation, communities of practice and distance-based technologies. A variety of educational formats are u sed including skills building 238 Due to changes in the reporting instrument, an estimated proportion of racial and ethnic minority providers was calculated using data from the past three reporting years. 285 workshops, hands-on preceptorships and mini- residencies, on -site training, tele -education, and technical assistance. For example, the RWHAP AETC implemented an online interactive platform that hosts an HIV care and treatment curriculum targeted to health care professionals. Clinical faculty also provides timely clinical consultation in person or via the telephone or internet. F undi ng History FY Amount FY Budget Request for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part F AETC of $33.6 million are equal to the FY 2021 Enacted Level. This funding will support targeted, multidisciplinary education and training programs for novice and experienced health care providers treating people with HIV in order to assure access to high quality HIV care delivered by competent providers. The RWHAP AETC program also provides expert advice to providers across the country on HIV treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV transmission, substance use disorders, viral hepatitis co-infection, post-exposure prophylaxis, and the treatment of pregnant women with HIV and their newborns to prevent mother- to-child transm ission. T he RWHAP AETC program funds a national curriculum for medical providers on HIV care and treatment to assure continued training of providers from medical/nursing school through in- service training. The central focus of RWHAP AETC training is to ensure high quality care and good patient outcomes through HIV care and treatment that is consistent with established treatment guidelines and reflects current research. This is increasingly important as people with HIV are living longer. In addition, the number of experienced HIV care profess ionals is projected to decrease as many of those who have worked in the epidemic since its inception reach retirement age. Training an expanded cadre of culturally competent, high quality providers is vital to increasing access to quality HIV care and treatment and improving health outcomes for people with HIV. HRSA will continue to prioritize interactive training and technical assistance that result in health system strengthening and transformation. Focus will be on training health care providers, 286 particularly racial and ethnic minority providers, to deliver high quality HIV care and treatment services in primary care settings - settings that have typically not provided services to people with HIV. The funding request also includes costs associated wi th the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

The RWHAP DRP ensures access to oral health care for low -income people with HIV by reimbursing dental education programs for the non- reimb ursed costs they incur providing such care. By offsetting the costs of non- reimbursed HIV care in accredited dental education institutions, the RWHAP DRP improves access to oral h ealth care for low -income, people with HIV and ensures quality services by dental students, dental hygiene students, and dental residents for providing oral health care services to people with HIV. The care provided through the program includes a full range of diagnostic, preventive, and treatment services, including oral surgery, as well as oral health education and health promotion. Dental schools, post-doctoral dental education programs, and dental hygiene education programs accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation that have documented non-reimbursed costs for providing oral health care to people with HIV are eligible to apply for reimbursement. Funds are then distributed to eligible organizations taking into account the number of people served and the cost of providing care. In FY 2019, the RWHAP DRP awards were able to provide over 39 percent of the total non-reimbursed costs requested by 50 participating institutions in support of oral health care. These institutions reported providing care to 26, 929 people with HIV (13,008 for whom no other funded source was available). In FY 2019, the demographic characteristics of patients who were 288 cared for by institutions participating in the RWHAP DRP were 63 percent minority and 28 percent women. The RWHAP CBDPP supports collaborations between dental education programs and community -based partners to deliver oral health services in community settings while supporting students and residents enrolled in accredited dental educations programs. In FY 2019, RWHAP CBDPP funded 12 partnership grants to support collaboration and coordination between the dental education programs and the community-based partners in the delivery of oral health services.

Through its demonstration projects, SPNS evaluates the design, implementation, utilization, cost, and health- related outcomes of treatment models while promoting the dissemination and replication of successful interventions. This unique program advances knowledge and skills in the delivery of health care and support services to underserved populations. A s healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic conditions, evidence- based, evidence- informed, and emerging strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these effort s. RWHAP SPNS -funded projects use implementation science - the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings into routine practice - to document and capture how well interventions and strategies improve the quality and effectiveness of health services, maximize resources, and improve health outcomes for people with HIV. The RWHAP SPNS evaluates the effectiveness of various models, interventions, strategies, implementation, utilization, cost, and health -related outcomes. Systematic strategies are used to identify emerging strategies among RWHAP recipients and to coordinate, develop tools kits and other modalities that allow for rapid dissemination and uptake. Through these special projects, RWHAP SPNS grant recipients implement a variety of interventions, which contribute to the advancement of public health knowledge and the ultimate goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. 291 Of the 55 FY 2020 RWHAP SPNS grant recipients currently funded, 19 percent are community - based/AIDS services organizations; 9 percent are state/county/local departments of health ; 26 percent are community health centers; 13 percent are academic- based clinics; and 33 percent are universities/evaluation and technical assistance providers. Current SPNS initiatives focus on: Leveraging a data to care approach to cure hepatitis C within RWHAP; building capacity to implement rapid start of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for improved care engagement in RWHAP; improving care and treatment coordination focusing on black women with HIV; building capacity to support innovative program model replication among RWHAP jurisdictions; enhancing linkages of sexually transmitted infections and HIV surveillance data in the RWHAP; strengthening systems of car e for people with HIV and opioid use disorder; improving sexually transmitted infection screening and treatment among people living with or at risk of HIV; and gathering evidence-informed approaches to improve health outcomes for people with HIV.

HRSA's focus is on linking people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, diagnosed but currently not in care, or are diagnosed in care but not yet virally suppressed to the essential HIV care and treatment and support services needed to help them achieve viral suppression. In 2020, the first year of the EHE initiative, HRSA RWAP anticipated serving 18,000 new or re-engaged people with HIV. Achieving this goal is supported by preliminary data which show that nearly 10,000 clients were either new or had been re-engaged in RWHAP services during the first six months of the initiative. RWHAP EHE grant recipients made significant progress toward imple menting the EHE work plans in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. This progress included developing administrative infrastructure and service delivery infrastructure, engaging with community members and new partners, and delivering services to clients. In 2021, HRSA RWHAP expects to serve 27,000 people with HIV through the EHE initiative (includes continued care for 18,000 people from year 1 and 9,000 new and re-engaged people in year 2). In 2022, HRSA RWHAP expects to serve 50,000 people with HIV through the EHE initiative (includes 27,000 people from year 2 and 23,000 new and re-engaged people in year 3). HRSA continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the RWHAP and is working to more fully understand the impact the pandemic is having on the EHE initiative. In FY 2022, RWHAP Part A and Part B jurisdictions that encompass the 48 counties, Washin gton, D.C., San Juan (PR), and seven states that have a substantial rural HIV burden will continue their focus on engaging people newly diagnosed with HIV , or are d iagnosed but currently not in care, or diagnosed in care but not yet virally suppressed. The se jurisdictions will 294 continue to build off of their locally developed five-year work plans submitted through the Notice of Funding Opportunity in FY 2020 and reviewed annually. The jurisdictions will continue using evidence- based strategies to engage thes e populations into HIV medical care, treatment, and support services that will ensure retention and viral suppression. As patients are linked and retained in care, the jurisdictions will support the HIV care and treatment needs of the newly identified and re -engaged people with HIV. The EHE funded technical assistance (TA) and systems coordination cooperative agreements will support strategies such as data to care ef forts; using acuity tools to identify and provide care for the most challenging patients; developing models such as low- barrier clinics to meet patients where they are; rapid engagement and medication initiation protocols; and others that have been success ful in the field. As lessons are learned from the first year, HRSA and the TA entity will work to utilize and disseminate those lessons nationally. The HRSA funded jurisdictions will work with their respective AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) to ensur e necessary resources are available to provide assistance for medications and health care co verage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re- engaged in care through the EHE initiative. As part of the EHE initiative, the RWHAP AI DS Education and Training Centers (AETCs) will work to expand workforce capacity by providing training and technical assistance to health care providers and paraprofessionals. This will include activities such as training health care providers on HIV medic al care and treatment and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) service delivery; working with clinics and health care providers to develop culturally competent settings and approaches to the populations reached through the EHE initiative; and providing technica l assistance on practice transformation in clinics to increase HIV testing, linkage to care, rapid antiretroviral therapy delivery, and improved viral suppression.

The additional resources will support HIV care and treatment services in the identified jurisdictions. Funding will also support evidence informed practices to link, engage, and retain people with HIV in care. The request provides funding for capacity building, technical assistance, and resources for program implementation and oversight. Under the FY 2022 President's Budget Request , HRSA estimates that 50,000 clients will be served by this initiative through FY 2022. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue to direct RWHAP funding to the 48 counties, DC, San Juan (PR), and seven states that contain more than 50% of new HIV infections. Funding will continue to be awarded to the current 39 RWHAP Part As that co ntain one or more of the counties and the current eight RWHAP Part B states (including funding to the state of Ohio for Hamilton County, which is not a RWHAP Part A). HRSA requires coordination with the respective AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAPs) to ensure necessary resources are available to provide assistance for medications and health care coverage premiums and cost sharing for people newly diagnosed with HIV or re -engaged in care through the initiative. The RWHAP's comprehensive system of HIV care and support service s and effective system for medication delivery creates a very efficient and effective service delivery mechanism for this initiative. Starting in FY 2020 and continuing into FY 2022, HRSA will fund the AETCs to provide training and techni cal assistance to health care providers, clinics, and paraprofessionals as well as health departments to increase HIV testing, care and treatment, the p rovision of PrEP services, and retention in care. HRSA will continue to direct funding to support technical assistance and systems coordination to enhance the current RWHAP data collection systems to provide timely monitoring of the initiative; to support dissemination of effective interventions to increase the number of people with HIV served by the initia tive; to provide additional technical assistance to jurisdictions to implement models of care that work to identify and link and retain the key populations for the EHE initiative. 296 Outcomes and Outputs Table Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY Number of new clients served through the EHE initiative (Output) 239 N/A 43,000 50,000 --- 60.2 Viral suppression among new clients served by the EHE initiative ( Outcome) [1] N/A TBD TBD Enacted FY 2022 President's Budget Number of 47 47 47 Average Award $1,200,000 $2,900,000 $6,700,000 Range of Awards $750,000 - $6,553,979 $1,000,000 $10,925,485 N/A 239 The first tar get is 18,200 new clients in FY 2020, for FY 2021, the estimated number of clients served is now 27,000 people with HIV, based on amount of funds appropriated.

Expired Allocation Method: Contracts Competitive Grants/Co -operative Agreements Other (Interagency Support) P rogram Description P rogram Description T he Organ Transplantation Program extends and enhances the lives of individuals with end- stage organ failure for whom an organ transplant is the most appropriate therapeutic treatment. HRSA oversees a national system, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), to allocate and distribute donor organs to individuals waiting for organ transplants. Organ allocation is guided by OPTN policies informed by analytic support from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). HRSA funds the Livin g Organ Donation Reimbursement Program (LODRP) (formerly Reimbursement of Travel and Subsistence Expenses toward Living Organ Donation Program) to provide financial assistance to eligible living organ donors. HRSA also invests in public education and outr each to increase the number of registered organ donors, increase the supply of deceased donor organs for transplantation, and to ensure the safety of living organ donors. T he OPTN is a critical system that facilitates matching donor organs to individuals needing organ transplants. Given the high demand for and limited supply of organs, OPTN policies are under continual review and refinement to achieve the best outcomes for patients, attain the maximum benefit for the maximum number of waitlist candidates, make the best use of donor organs, and align with policy requirements of the OPTN final rule (42 CFR 121). OPTN operating costs are covered by appropriated funds and revenues generated by registration fees paid by transplant centers for each transplant candidate placed on the waiting list. T he OPTN collects fees under the authority of 42 CFR \u00a7121.5(c). 300 The OPTN final rule (42 CFR \u00a7121.12) established the Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation (ACOT), which is composed of experts in organ transplantation, to provide recommendations to the Secretary on issues related to organ donation and transplantation. HRSA provides logistics and analytic support for periodic ACOT meetings. HRSA also engages in interagency activities that support organ donation and transplantation. The SRTR provides analytic support to the OPTN in the development of organ allocation policies and performance evaluation. Additionally, the SRTR provides analytic support to HHS, including the ACOT. SRTR shares information publicly about the performance of transplant programs and organ procurement organizations at www.srtr.org . It publishes online transplant program risk -adjusted patient and graft outcomes data and organ procurement organization risk- adjusted data on organs procured per donor. SRTR also publishes a comprehensive Annual Data Report that includes the most current ten years of data on waitlist, transplant, and deceased donor organ donation. HR SA collaborates with the organ donation and transplantation community to promote awareness of the need for donated organs and to encourage public enrollment on organ donor registries (state or national). Outreach activities include: Public service announcement campaigns for radio, TV stations, and publications nationwide Educational web videos for reposting, download, and social media Radio Ad Spotlights during high traffic drive-time hours in designated markets with the highest numbers of African Americans, Asians, Hispanics or Latinos, and people 50 years and older. Data reveals gaps between the numbers of patients waiting for an organ and the number of donors from these groups. Organ donation and transplantation related articles for newspapers and journals Downloadable print ma terials on a variety of organ donation and transplantation topics for multiple audiences HRSA's organ donation sites: www.organdonor.gov and https://donaciondeorganos.gov Grant projects to test approaches to promote public awareness of the need for organ donation and increase registration in donor registries In September 2020, HRSA increased the income eligibility threshold for the LODRP from 300 percent to 350 percent of the HHS Poverty Guidelines. The program also expanded the qualified reimbursable expenses to include reimbursement of lost wages and dependent care expenses (child -care and elder -care). The changes are aimed at increasing the number of kidney transplants from living donors and decreasing recipient waiting times. Program Accomplishments The COVID -19 pandemic significantly affected organ donation and transplantation in the United States. Deceased donor organ procurement and transplantation fell by app roximately 50 percent in early April 2020 before returning to an upward trajectory in late May 2020. Most transplant programs temporarily deferred living donor transplantation in areas particularly affected by 301 outbreaks of the virus due to concerns of unnecessarily exposing potential living organ donors and recipients to possible COVID-19 infection. Beginning in June 2020, living donor transplants also returned to rates more similar to pre -pandemic levels. Post -transplant data collection for recipient s and living donors was temporarily modified in March 2020 to reduce patient exposure to COVID -19 infection at transplant hospitals. As of April 2021, post- transplant data collection has returned to normal. One of HRSA's primary goals for the Organ Transplantation Program is to increase the annual number of transplants using deceased donor organs. The organ procurement and transplantation community has achieved record-breaking annual numbers of deceased donor organs procured and organ transplants perform ed, year after year since 2015. In CY 2020, in spite of the downturn at the beginning of the COVID- 19 pandemic, another CY record was set for procurement and transplantation of deceased donor organs. The number of deceased donor organs transplanted in CY 2020 was 36,544, a 2.2 percent increase over the CY 2019 total of 35,746. Another important program goal is to increase the deceased organ donor conversion rate, which is the rate potential organ donors become actual organ donors after death. The convers ion rate has been a key performance metric and a priority for the Organ Transplantation Program since 2003. The conversion rate has averaged at approximately 71 percent for the last five years, as shown in Table 1. HRSA will continue to monitor conver sion rates and determine potential next steps. The organ donor conversion rate is based on \"eligible deaths,\" including potential donors aged 75 or below who are legally declared dead by neurologic criteria (brain death) and not excluded for other defined reasons related to certain risk factors. The number of \"eligible deaths\" does not include: 1) donors declared dead by circulatory determination of death (cardiac death) rather than neurologic criteria and 2) donors whose organs were transplanted despite do nor age or other risk factors that may have excluded them from being counted as \"eligible deaths.\" Tabl e 1.

With this additional funding, HRSA will target up to $13.8 million towards increasing access to transplants by removing financial barriers to living organ donation. HRSA will accomplish this work through the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program, which provides reimbursement to living organ donors who lack other forms of financial support. HRSA will use funds to scale up the program to serve more living donors to provide life-saving organs to patients on the waiting list . T his request also includes $13.7 million for the OPTN, SRTR, and public and professional education to increase public awareness about organ donation. Additionally, this request includes approximately $1.5 million for activities related to the Advisory Committee, interagenc y agreements, and other internal support and P rogram -related activities. Th e funding request includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow- up performance reviews, and other program support costs.

HRSA achieves this goal by: 1) providing a national system for recruiting potential bone marrow donors; 2) tissue typing potential marrow donors; 3) building a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of at least 150,000 new units of high-quality umbilical cord blood units (CBU) for transplantation; 4) coordinating the procurement of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood units for transplantation; 5) offering patient and donor advocacy services; 6) providing public and professional education; and, 7) collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on transplant outcomes. These activities, which were previously implemented and reported through two separate programs, the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) Program and the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program (CWBYCTP), have been combined in FY 2022. B lood stem cell transplantation, which includes bone marrow and cord blood, is a potentially curative therapy for many individuals with leukemia and other life-threatening blood and genetic disorders. Each year, nearly 18,000 people in the U.S. are diagno sed with life - threatening illnesses where blood stem cell transplantation from matched donors is the best treatment option. Often, the ideal donor is a suitably matched family member, but only 30 percent of people have a fully matched relative. The other 70 percent, or approximately 12,600 people, often search for a matched unrelated adult donor or umbilical cord blood unit. The BSCTP operates through four major contractual functions that require close coordination and oversight and supports an Advisory Council that provides recommendations to the HHS Secretary and HRSA on activities related to the BSCTP. The major functions of the BSCTP are: 241 Public Health Service Act, Sections 379 -379B, as amended by P.L. 114- 104 states that the term 'bone marrow' means the cells found in the adult bone marrow and peripheral blood. 305 T he combined Single Point of Access - Coordinating Center (SPA- CC) main tains a system for health care professio nals and physicians, searching on behalf of patients, to search electronically for cells derived from adult marrow donors and cord blood units through a single point of access and supports coordination activities for bone marrow and cord blood. The Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) maintains a system for patient advocacy, which provides individualized patient services for ongoing searches for bone marrow donors or cord blood units. The OPA also assists patients with information regarding treatment options and payment matters. T he Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database (SCTOD) provides an electronic blood stem cell transplant outcomes database for researchers and health care professionals. The SCTOD provides a repository that stores donor and recipient s amples for research and the collection and analysis of data on clinical outcomes of blood stem cell transplants. The Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program (BSCTP) provides funds through competitive contracts for the collection and storage of qualified cord blood units (CBUs) by a network of cord blood banks in the U.S. HRSA prioritizes cord blood banks that have b iological license agreement (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the demonstrated cap ability to collect and bank significant numbers of CBUs from genetically and ethnically diverse populations. T he NCBI provides funds through competitive contracts for the collection and storage of qualified CBUs by a network of cord blood banks in the U.S. The NCBI program selects cord blood banks based on assessments of technical merit, overall quality, geographic dispersion of collection and storage sit es, evaluation of past performance, and evaluation of proposed costs. Additionally, HRSA prioritizes the demonstrated ability of cord blood banks to collect and bank significant numbers of CBUs from genetically and ethnically diverse populations. P rogram Accomplishments T he BSCTP continues to serve a diverse patient population, with volunteer adult donors and umbilical cord blood units playing a vital role in expanding transplant access to patients from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. Increasing the number of blood stem cell transplants facilitated for patients from genetically and ethn ically diverse backgrounds addresses the statutory aim of ensuring comparable access to transplantation for patients from all populations. As of the end of FY 2020, more than 23 million potential adult volunteer donors and 111,500 HRSA- funded CBU (see Table 1) were listed on the BSCTP's registry. 306 Table 1. Cord Blood Collections F iscal Year Number of Units Contracted Cord Blood Units Collected and Made Available242 for Patient Searches Cumulative Units goal of 4.08 million adult donors who self-identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population was not met. One of the primary reasons for the unmet goal was the limited in -person recruitment activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the anticipated ongoing impact of COVID-19, HRSA expects the registry will add 4 million adult donors who self-identify as belonging to an underrepresented racial or ethnic population and 2,400 cord blood units in FY 2022. The number of cord blood units collected varies from year to year, based on funding levels and the contractors' abilities to collect and store units from diverse populations. A s shown in Table 2, the number of cord blood units released for transplants decreased in FY 2020 from FY 2019, at 344 and 459 cord blood units, respectively. The total number of cord blood units released for transplantation have been decreasing since FY 2016 due to the increasing use of alternative therapies. In particular, haploidentical transpl ants, which use blood stem cells from a donor who is biologically related to the recipient- patient, are still on the rise. Despite this recent trend, co rd blood remains key in servicing a diverse population. Table 2. Cord Blood Units Released for Transplantation Fiscal Year Units Released for Transplantation Total Cord Blood Units (HRSA - funded and Non- HRSA funded) released for h the BSCTP 2016 529 1,154 2017 494 1,050 2018 493 949 2019 459 848 2020 344 702 242 Due to the lag between when cord blood units are collected and when they have been fully tested and qualified for listing on the public registry, not all of the units collected with funds from a given fiscal year will be available on the registry during that same fiscal year. 307 Funding History FY Amount FY 2018 The FY 2022 Budget Request for the Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Program of $49.3 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted level. This Budget request supports continued progress toward the statutory goal of building a genetically and ethnically diverse i nventory of at least 150,000 new units of high-quality cord blood for transplantation. HRSA estimates that approximately 2,400 additional cord blood units and 4.0 million adult volunteer donors from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations will be a dded and made available for patient searches in FY 2022. The budget request also continues the following activities: 1) collecting comprehensive outcomes data on both related and unrelated-donor blood stem cell transplants; 2) assessing the quality of lif e for transplant recipients; 3) working with foreign transplant centers to obtain data on U.S. stem cell products provided for transplant; and, 4) continuing critical planning in collaboration with HHS on a response to a potential national radiation or che mical emergency. In such an event, casualties could involve temporary or permanent marrow failure and could require emergency transplants for individuals unable to recover marrow function.

The P CP grant program supports Poison Control Centers ' efforts to: 1) prevent and provide treatment recommendations for poisonings; 2) comply with operational requirements to sustain accreditation and/or achieve accreditation; and 3) improve and enhance communications and response capability and capacity. Funds may also be used to improve the quality of data uploaded from poison centers to the National Poison Data System in support of national toxic surveillance activities conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The national toll- free Poison Help line was established in 2001. Individuals can call from anywhere in the U.S. and its territories and connect to the poison centers that serve their respective areas. The PCP maintains the number, provides interpretation services in over 150 languages, and offers servi ces for the hearing impaired. Today, a network of 55 Poison Control Centers, supported by 52 grant awards, provide cost-effective, quality health care advice regarding poisoning to the general public and health care providers across the U.S., including Am erican Samoa, the District of Columbia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, health care providers and other specially trained poison experts provide poisoning triage and treatment recommendations at no cost to callers. A hallmark of poison 311 center case management is the use of follow up calls to monitor case progress and medical outcomes. Poison centers are consulted, not only when children get into household products, but also when seniors and people of all ages mismanage medicine or when workers are exposed to harmful substances on the job. Emergency 911 operators refer poison- related calls to Poison Control Centers, and health care professionals regularly consult Poison Control Centers for expert advice on complex cases. Poison Control Centers are a critical resource for emergency preparedness and response as well as for other public health emergencies. The PCP ensures that the Poison Help line is operational, calls are routed seamlessly to the appropriate poison center, and multilingual interpreter services are available. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, poison centers managed 2.5 million cases in 2019, a 1.7 percent increase from 2018. Of the approximate 2.1 million human exposure poisonings reported in 2019, Poison Control Centers managed about 66 percent at the site of exposure, avoiding unnecessary visits to emergency departments and reducing health care costs. Health care facili ties represented less than one percent of exposures, but made approximately 24 percent of poison control calls. Consistent with the previous year, the top 5 substance classes most frequentl y involved in all human exposures were analgesics (11.0%), household cleaning substances (5.21%), and antidepressants (5.32%). 249 Multiple studies have demonstrated that poison centers' accurate assessments and triage of poison exposures save dollars by reducing the severity of illness and death, and by eliminating or reducing the expense of unnecessary trips to emergency departments. Poison center consultations also decrease patients' length of stays in hospitals and decrease hospital c osts. Health care facilities' use of poison centers continues to increase, indicating an increase in the severity of poisonings and the need for toxicological expertise in clinical settings. Through the nationwide Poison Help media campaign, the PCP has been educating the public about the toll-free number and increasing awareness of poison center services. In FY 2020, the Poison Help media campaign included an investment of $393,392. Based on over 892 million media impressions through television, radi o, and social media, the PCP was able to leverage an advertising return on investment of over $21.8 million. Another critical function of the Poison Control Centers is to collect poison exposure and surveillance data. Multiple federal agencies, including the CDC, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, use these data for public health surveillance, including timely identification, char acterization, or ongoing tracking of occurrences and other public health threats. Many state health departments collaborate directly with poison centers within their jurisdictions, using data from poison control centers to monitor exposures to e-cigarette devices and liquid nicotine, synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids, opioids, hand sanitizer, and laundry detergent packets. 249 David D. Gummin, James B. Mowry, Daniel A. Spyker, Daniel E. Brooks, Krista O. Osterthaler & William Banner: 2019 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 3 7th Annual Report, Clinical Toxicology. 312 According to the CDC, in 2018, the most recent year for which da ta are available, unintentional poisoning continues to be the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths and the sixth leading cause of nonfatal emergency department visits. Opioid-involved overdose deaths rose from 21,088 in 2010 to 46,802 in 2018 and increased in 2019, to 49,860250. Poison Control Centers play a critical role in combatting opioid drug-related abuse and misuse, from helping to define and trace the problem within a local and national context to responding to calls from health care provider s seeking treatment advice for patien ts. I n addition, Poison Control Centers provide public and health care provider education and actively seek to change behaviors to reduce poisonings and promote awareness and utilization of poison center services. Education efforts include: partnering with health departments, education departments, and other state agencies; promoting safe prescription medication use and storage; messaging at health fairs and community events; and collaborating to develop media campaigns focused on preventing poisonings. Th ey participate in National Prescription Drug Take- Back events sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Agency to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of prescription drug disposal, while also educating the public about potential medication abuses. Finally, it should be noted that the above does not include the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding of roughly $5 million , awarded to all 55 Poison Centers last Fiscal Year to improve their capacity to respond to increased cal ls to the Help and Language lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding History FY Amount FY FY 2022 Budget Request of $24.8 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will support the Poison Control Centers' infrastructure and core triage and treatment services. They predominantly rely on state and local funding, as Federal funding accounts for approximately 13 percent of total funding. While Poison Control Centers have innovatively secured funding from a variety of local sources, including philanthropic organizations, their financial stability is ten uous. Federal funding helps reinforce the nationwide Poison Control Center infrastructure, enabling the sustainability of public health and toxic surveillance efforts. 250 Trends and Geographic Patterns in Drug and Synthetic Opioid Overdose Deaths \u2014 United States, 2013 -2019 - Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), February 12, 2021 313 In FY 2022, the PCP plans to issue grant continuation awards to 52 recipients and ma intain the funding of the national toll-free Poison Help line and translation services for non-English speaking callers. The Nationwide Media Campaign will continue to educate the public and health care providers about the national toll-free number and build upon efforts to highlight the role of Poison Control Centers in the public health system The campaign's goal includes increasing public awareness of the national Poison Help toll-free number; providing education on poisoning risk and prevention; and showcasing the role of the national network of Poison Control Centers and the services they provide. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

These include Federally Qualified Health Centers, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, and certain disproportionate share hospitals. The 340B Program helps these designated hospita ls and clinics provide more care to additional patients. The 340B ceiling price - the maximum amount a drug manufacturer can charge a covered entity for a given drug - is equal to the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) minus the Unit Rebate Amount, both s et by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Covered entities purchase 340B drugs that are at least 23 percent below AMP for brand name drugs; 13 percent below AMP for generic drugs; and 17 percent below AMP for clotting factor and pediatric d rugs. In 2019, total sales in the 340B Program were approximately $29 billion. Covered entities saved between 25 to 50 percent on what they would have otherwise paid for covered outpatient drugs. HRSA estimates 340B sales ar e approximately 6 percent of the total U.S. drug market. HRSA places a high priority on the integrity of the 340B Program and continually works to improve Program oversight. HRSA conducts the following activities to ensure both covered entities and manuf acturers are in compliance with program requirements: P erforms initial eligibility checks of all entities seeking to register with the Program. R ecertifies covered entities annually including an attestation to compliance with all Program requirements. P erforms audits of covered entities to assure compliance within the Program. Since FY 2012, HRSA completed 1,588 covered entity audits, which included review of 21,406 offsite outpatient facilities and 36,274 contract pharmacies. Final audit results, including statuses of corrective actions, are available on HRSA's website. As of April 1, 2021, 316 HRSA closed out and finalized 1,473 of the 1,588 audits conducted, with 35 percent of findings related to diversion and 31 percent related to duplicate discount. Re views every non- compliance allegation received through targeted communication and, if necessary, performs on- site audits. P erforms 5 audits of manufacturers. P rovides assistance to covered entities that self -disclose compliance issues, including devel oping corrective action plans and working with affected manufacturers. S upports an integrated system of compliance tracking for covered entities and manufacturers, enabling enhanced communication to ensure that all covered entities and manufacturers are in compliance with 340B program requirements. P ublishes verified ceiling prices of covered outpatient drugs available for purchase under the 340B Program on a quarterly basis in the 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System (OPAIS), Pricing Component. T he 340B Program includes the establishment of a Prime Vendor Program (PVP) to develop, maintain, and coordinate a program capable of facilitating distribution of covered outpatient drugs. By the end of 2020, the PVP had nearly 4,400 products available to participating entities below the 340B ceiling price, including 2,600 covered outpatient drugs with an estimated average savings of 29 percent below the 340B ceiling price. From 2009 to 2019, the PVP contracts provided over $4.1 billion in additional sub-ceiling savings for covere d entities. Funding History FY T he FY 2022 Budget Request for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs/ 340B Drug Pricing Program of $17.2 million is $7.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. Appropriated resources will support implementation of 340B Program statutory obligations, oversight of participating manufacturers and covered entities, operational improvements, and increased efficiencies using information technology. The $7.0 million increase will allow the 340B Program to continue to build on its program integrity efforts. First, the Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) added a provision to the 340B statute that requires the Secretary to issue regulations concerning an Administrative Dispute Resolution process designed to resolve (1) claims by covered entities that they have been overcharged for covered outpatient drugs by manufacturers and (2) claims by manufacturers, after the manufacturer has conducted an audit of a covered entity, that a covered entity has violated the prohibition on diversion or duplicate discounts. The Office of Pharmacy Affairs requires additional resources to establish this formal dispute resolution proce ss. Implementation 317 includes establishment of a system to intake and handle the workflow of documents between internal and external parties, and creating a secure environment for exchanging information, much of which is expected to be proprietary across multiple agencies. Further, additional funding is required to increase the number of full-time equivalents by two personnel and to increase audit and oversight of the program including regulation support, systems support and up to 25 additional audits of covered entities and up to an additional fi ve audits of manufacturers. HRSA is also proposing general rulemaking authority to reform the 340B Program. HRSA's enforcement ability is limited, as guidance does not provide HRSA appropriate enforcement capabi lity. Binding and enforceable regulations for all aspects of the 340B Program would provide HRSA the ability to more clearly define and enforce policy and would significantly strengthen HRSA's oversight of the Program. Th ese reforms would strengthen progra m integrity and oversight activities. HRSA would also address issues raised by various stakeholders to assist covered entities and manufacturers in their ability to satisfy 340B Program expectations and where oversight needs to be enhanced. T he FY 2022 Budget Request also provides resources for the 340B Program to educate participating covered entities and prospective sites on compliance with statutory requirements. For participating covered entities, HRSA will continu e to expand its oversight activities, producing a sentinel effect of increased compliance. PVP data shows education based on oversight measures reduces the risk of future compliance issues. HRSA will conduct audits of manufacturers, which should not only increase compliance, but also provide greater insight into the tools and mechanisms used by companies to comply with 340B statutory requirements and guide future technical assistance. The request supports facilitation of refunds and credits to entities that are overcharged by participating manufacturers as well as enhancements to the Pricing Component of the 340B OPAIS whereby covered entities access 340B ceiling price information via a secure website. System implementation began in the first two quarters of calendar year 2019, with manufac turers reporting data during the first quarter and prices have been available to covered entities, after review and validation, on April 1, 2019. Performance Measures H RSA measures 340B Program performance by two key metrics: numbers of covered entities and manufacturers audits. As of April 1, 2021, participation levels included 13,214 covered entities and 37,738 associated sites participating in the 340B Program, for a total of 51,952 registered sites. 318 Outputs and Outcomes Tables Measure Year and Most Recent Result/ Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY 2020: 20 0 Target: 200 (Target Met) 200 225 +25 39.I.A.2: Manufacturer Audits Conduc ted (Output) FY 2020: 5 Target: 5 (Target Met) 5 10 +5 Co ntracts Awards FY FY President's Budget Contract $3,000,000 $4,800,000 45 --- Aut horizing Legislation: Public Health Service Act, Section 320, as amended by Public Law 105-78, Section 211 FY 2022 Authorization ...................................................................................................... Indefinite Al location Methods: Direct Federal/Intramural Contract Program Description and Accomplishments The National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) provides medical care, education, and research for Hansen's disease (HD, leprosy) and related conditions as authorized since 1917. Medical care includes providing direct patient care (diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation), HD drug regimens at no cost to patients, consultations, laboratory services, and outpatient referral service s to any patient living in the United States (U.S.) or its terr itories. The Program strengthens the safety net infrastructure for patients with this rare disease by focusing on case management, patient compliance, and clinical training on the diagnosis and management of Hansen's disease. The Program makes specific o utreach efforts to health care providers who are likely to encounter and treat patients in geographic areas most impacted by the disease. More complicated HD cases are treated as short -term re ferrals in the NHDP clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ninety -five percent of the human population is not susceptible to infection with Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis, the bacterium that causes leprosy. Hansen's disease is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and, early diagnosis and tre atment prevent nerve involvement and the disability it causes. Treatment with standard antibiotic drugs is very effective, and patients become noninfectious after taking only a few doses of medication and need not be isolated from family and friends. However, diagnosis in the U.S. is often delayed because many health care providers are unaware of Hansen's disease and its symptoms. People with leprosy can generally continue their normal work and other activities while under treatment, which may last several years. Inc reasing Quality of Care: Increasing health care provider knowledge about Hansen's disease will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, which are key to blocking or arresting the trajectory 320 of Hansen's disease -related disability and deformity. The Program facilitates outpatient management of leprosy by providing additional laboratory, diagnostic, consultative, and referral services to private-sector physicians. NHDP increases U.S. health care providers' knowledge by serving as an education a nd referral center. The NHDP outpatient care is comprehensive and includes treatment protocols for multi-drug therapy, diagnostic studies, provider consultations, ancillary medical services, clinical laboratory analysis, hand and foot rehabilitation, leprosy surveillance, and indigent patient transportation. Improving Health Outcomes : The Program is improving health outcomes through scientific research. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for decreasing HD -related disability. With advanced scientific knowledge and breakthroughs in genomics and molecular biology, the Program has been advancing the standard- of-care for leprosy diagnosis and treatment. Currently, lab research uses rapi d techniques for diagnosis, assessment of drug resistance, and strain typing of leprosy bacilli to support effective treatment selection and to determine the origin and transmission of infection. Fostering Collaboration : NHDP is the sole worldwide provider of reagent grade viable leprosy bacilli and collaborates wit h researchers across the globe to further scientific investigations and advances related to the disease. NHDP coordinates and collaborates with Federal, state, local, and private programs to further leverage and promote efforts to improve the quality of c are and health outcomes related to Hansen's disease. Funding History FY Amount The FY 2022 Budget Request of $13.7 million is equal to the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request supports the Program's primary focus on direct patient care activities and improving health outcomes for Hansen's disease patients. The funding level reflects improvements in health outcomes through research and health care provider education. Two new performance measures related to laboratory research output are implemented for FY 2022; the shipment of reagent grade viable leprosy bacilli for worldwide research activities and the number of human pathology samples on which NHDP staff performs diagnostic polymerase chain reactions. The FY 2022 request will allow the NHDP to expand and enhance outreach and training activities to providers to improve early diagnosis and treatment to reduce permanent disability in patients. Due to COVID -19 rela ted travel restrictions, NHDP's training target was not met for 321 FY 2020 and reduced for FY 2021. The lifting of travel restrictions should allow the resumption of NHDP's training target for FY 2022 and beyond. NHDP wil l fund eleven ambulatory care contracts in FY 2022 with continuing efforts to align resources with levels of care. Hansen's disease patients with severe complications who are advanced on the HD spectrum or who have HD related disabi lities may be referred to the primary clinic in Baton Rouge free of charge. The National Hansen's Disease Program also provides free HD medication to all providers upon request for the care and treatment of HD patients in the U.S. and its territories. Th e funding request also includes costs associated with the contract review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, information technology, and other program support costs.

Indefinite Allocation Method ............................................................... Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program Description and Accomplishments The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) is charged with advising the HHS Secretary on how rural health care is affected by current policies as well as proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative, and budgetary changes in the Medicare, Medicaid and other key HHS programs. The authorizing legislation requires FORHP to advise on: (1) the financial viability of small rural hospitals; (2) the ability of rural areas (particularly rural hospitals) to attract a nd retain physicians and other health professionals; and (3) access to and quality of health care in rural areas. FORHP is also charged with overseeing compliance, per the requirements of section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, related to assessing the impact of key regulations affecting a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Rural Health Policy Development funds a number of programs to carry out these advisory and compliance roles, including supporting clearinghouses for collecting and dissemin ating information on rural health care issues, promising approaches to improving and enhancing health care delivery in rural communities, and policy- relevant research findings addressing rural health care delivery. FORHP provides funding for the only Fe deral research programs specifically designed to provide publicly available, policy relevant studies on rural health issues. The Rural Health Research Center (RHRC) Prog ram funds eight core research centers to conduct policy-oriented health services research. The RHRCs produce policy briefs and peer-reviewed journal manuscripts and make their publications available to policy makers and other rural stakeholders at the Fed eral and state levels. The RHRC publications also align with Administration priorities , such as addressing opioid use and issues related to health and geographic inequities. The Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Rural Research Studies Program supports one award to conduct rapid data analyses and short- term rural resea rch studies. The 327 Rural Health Research Dissemination Cooperative Agreement, currently awarded to the Rural Health Research Gateway, disseminates and promotes FORHP funde d rural health services research to stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels with the goal of informing and raising awareness of key policy issues important to rural communities. In FY 2020, these Federally-funded research programs conducted and disseminated 107 research reports, including policy briefs posted on the Rura l Health Research Gateway website and manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals. The National Rural Health Information Clearinghouse Program, currently awarded to the Rural Health Information Hub, serves as a clearinghouse for information on rural health, including HRSA's rural health programs, for residents of rural areas in the United States and other rural health stakeholders. In FY 2020, FORHP established a Rural Telementoring Training Center Program to provide training for academic medical centers and other centers of excellence to create technology-enabled telementoring learning programs that focus on reaching regionally diverse populations and addressing unique cultural aspects across rural areas. This three- year grant will continue in FY 20 22. Rural Health Policy Development also supports the staffing for the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS), which advises the HHS Secretary on rural health and human service programs and policies, produces policy briefs, and makes recommendations on emerging rural policy issues. In addition, in alignment with its authorizing legislation, FORHP continues to monitor and track the number of rural hospitals across the country that have closed completely or converted to another type of facility that provides only non- inpatient care. From January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2021, 136 rural hospitals have closed. FORHP has funded a number of grants that focus on addressing hospital closures, particularly mitigating the loss of services due to hospitals closing or facing financial distress. Funding History FY Amount FY FY 2022 Budget Request of $11.1 million is the same as the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request would allow FORHP to fully fund the following: Rural Health Research Center Cooperat ive Agreement; Rapid Response Rural Data Analysis and Issue Specific Rural Research 328 Studies Program; Rural Health Research Gateway; Rural Health Information Hub; National Rural Health Policy, Community, and Collaboration Program; Rural Telementoring Training Center Program; Rural Health Clinic Technical Assistance Program; Rural Health System Analysis & TA Program; and the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. The Rural Health Research Center program will produce 43 rural policy br iefs or journal manuscripts in FY 2022. The funding request also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Indefinite Allocation Method ............................................ Competitiv e Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Health Care Services Outreach, Network and Quality Improvement Grants (Outreach programs) improve rural community health by focusing on quality improvement, increasing health care access, coordination of care, and integration of services. Outreach grant programs support collaborative models to deliver basic health care services to rural areas and are uniquely designed to meet rural needs. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Rel ief, and Economic Security Act, the Outreach grants were reauthorized to expand eligibility to include both rural and urban applicants with the demonstrated experience or capacity to serve rural underserved populations, and allowed for increased flexibility of project period length for programs. 253 The Outreach programs are among the only non-categorical grants within HHS, allowing grantees to determine the best ways to meet local needs. This flexibility responds to the unique health care challenges in rural communities and enables communities to determine the best approaches for addressing needs. Outreach Service Grants f ocus on improving access to health care in rural communities through community coalitions and evidence based and promising practice model s. These grants focus on disease prevention, health promotion, and can support the expansion of services around primary care, opioid use disorder treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and oral health care. HRSA will support 61 continuing awards. 253 42 USC 254c: Rural health care services outreach, rural health network development, and small health care provider quality improvement grant programs 330 Rural Network Development Grants support formalized partnerships among health care providers and social and community service organizations collaborating to improve access and enhance the quality of healthcare in rural areas. The program focuses on demonst rating improved health outcomes resulting from network collaboration, as well as positioning healthcare networks and their products and services to be sustainable as the health care landscape continues to evolve. Grantees under this program are likely to focus on improving health outcomes, enhancing health care quality, and increasing services provided by the network. HRSA will support 44 continuing awards. Network Planning Grants assist in the development of integrated healthcare networks to address local health care challenges. The Network Planning program provides an opportunity for grantees to work on priority and emerging local public health issues, such as care coordination, patient engagement, rural hospital closure/conversion, telehealth, mental health, and substance use (particularly opioid use disorder). HRSA will make new awards in FY 2022. Small Healthcare Provider Quality Improvement Grants help improve patient care and chronic disease outcomes by assisting rural primary care providers with the implementation of quality improvement activities. Specifically, program objectives include increased care coordination, enhanced chronic disease management, and improved health outcomes for patients. An additional program goal is to prepare rural health car e providers for quality reporting and pay- for-performance programs. HRSA will make new awards in FY 2022. The Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program provide s network development grants to the eight states in the Mississippi Delta for netw ork and rural health infrastructure development. This program is geographically targeted, given the health care disparities across this eight -state region. The program supports chronic disease management, oral health services, and recruitment and retention efforts for health professionals. The program requires grantees to focus on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity and to develop programs based on promising practices or evidence- based models. HRSA will support 12 continuing awards in FY 2022. Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program helps rural communities address their health care needs in a targeted manner and assists small rural hospitals and clinics improve their financial and operational performances. The program also provides resources to help rural communities develop partnerships and jointly address health problems that affect the Delta region. HRSA will support 20 continuing communities and several new communities in FY 2022 in coordination wit h the Delta Regional Authori ty. Rural Health Care Coordination Program supports rural health consortiums/networks aiming to achieving the overall goals of improving access, delivery, and quality of care through the application of care coordination1 strategies in rural communities. The goals of the program is to 1) enhance integrated systems to collaborate and share data among member organizations; 2) develop effective care coordination workforce to meet needs 331 within the rural communities; 3) improve access, delivery, and quality of s ervices and overall patients' health outcomes; and 4) increase program financial sustainability. HRSA will support 10 continuing awards in FY 2022. Rural Northern Border Region Planning Program supports planning activities to identify key rural health iss ues, assess rural health challenges, and engage in strategic planning activities to inform rural health plans across the Northern Border Regional Commission service area. The goal of the program is to help underserved rural communities identify and better ad dress their health care needs. Projects may include planning activities that address challenges related to access to care and health care workforce or assist small rural hospitals improve their financial and operational. HRSA plans to make new awards in FY 2022. Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS) gr ants improve access and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities. In FY 2019, HRSA created RMOMS in response to research by the University of Minnesota that revealed a decreasing availability of obstetric units in rural areas. 254 RMOMS goals include: (1) Developing a sustainable network approach to coordinate maternal and obstetrics care within a rural region; (2) Increase the delivery and access of preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum services; (3) Develo ping sustainable financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics care; and (4) Improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. The HHS Rural Health Taskforce further validated these study results. In FY 2021, HRSA launched an HHS- wide initiative to improve maternal health , which focused on a four- pillar strategy to achieve: 1) Healthy Outcomes for All Women of Reproductive Age by improving prevention and treatment, 2) Healthy Pr egnancies and Births by prioritizing quality improvement, 3) Healthy Futures by optimizing post-partum health, and 4) Improved Data and Bolster Research to inform future interventions. HRSA will provide continuation funding for six grantees in FY 2022. HR SA plans to make new RMOMS awards in FY 2022 to support this materna l health initiative in rural communities. HRSA plans to respond to emerging public health needs including COVID-19 and priorities through strategic initiatives and efforts that would strengthen the health care infrastructure and capacity in rural areas and improve health outcomes. The Outreach programs continue to conduct program evaluations and build evidence- based models for new ways to improve health care in rural communities. Evaluations focus on 254 Hung P, Henning- Smith C, Casey M, Kozhimannil, K. Access to Obstetric Services in Rural Cou nties Still Declining, with 9 Pe rcent Losing 1663- 1671. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0338 332 measuring program impact on the health status of rural residents with chronic conditions and economic impact of the Federal investment in rural communities. Grantees use the Rural Health Information (RHI) Hub's Economic Impact Analysis 255 tool to assess the economic impact of Federal investments. The tool tra nslates project impacts into community -wide benefits, such as number of jobs created, new spending, and impacts of new and expanded services. Grantees are also required to demonstrate pro gram impact through outcome- focused measures. Grantees track and s ubmit to HRSA baseline data throughout their project periods and implement programs that are adapted from promising practices or evidence-based models. The programs support innovative models that offer rural communities the tools and resources to enhance h ealth care services and ease the transition to health care models focusing on improved quality and value. While making the initial Federal investment in a rural area, each of the grant p rograms expects the communities to continue providing the services at the conclusion of the grant funding. As each project periods end, the Outreach programs continually assess program sustainability. While sustainability rates may vary across grantee coho rts, HRSA expects the majority, at least 75 percent, of projects to continue after Federal funding. Across the investments made in the Outreach programs, findings and key lessons learned from evaluations and case studies are gathered and made available on the RHI Hub's Community Health Gateway 256 so that rural communities from across the country can benefit from Outreach program investments and results. Funding History FY Amount FY Budget Request of $90.0 million is $7.5 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will support the continuation of existing grantees, and new competitive grants , including $5.0 million to support a new cohort for the RMOMS program in FY 2022, that will positively af fect health care service delivery for over 430,000 people. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Expired Allocation Method ............................................................................................. Competitive Grants Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants are offered through three grant programs: Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant (Flex) Program supports a partnership between 45 states and more than 1,300 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to work on quality and performance improvement activities, as well as help eligible rural hospitals convert to CAH status and enhance CAH- related emergency medical services. The Flex Program's goal is to help CAHs maintain high -quality and economically viable facilities to ensure that rural community residents, particularly Medicare beneficiaries, have access to high -qual ity health care services. States use Flex resources to addr ess identified CAH needs and to achieve improved and measurable outcomes in each selected program area. With FY 2021 funds, HRSA continues to support year three of a three- year initiative supportin g emergency medical services (EMS) across eight states and focusing on quality and operational improvement initiatives. The F lex Program plays a key role in ensuring that CAHs are aligned with certain Medicare Program quality initiatives. All prospective payment system hospitals (PPS) are required to submit qual ity data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to receive a full Medicare payment update. While not subject to this CMS requirement, CAHs, through this program, can elect to submit quality data to CMS to demonstrate areas of high quality while also identifying areas for improvement. This provides an avenue for ensuring that CAH quality efforts are aligned with broader Medicare quality initiatives. HRSA has initiated a project to gather input for rural stakeholders to inform the future direc tion of the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project to ensure it aligns with hospital priorities in providing high quality care, and in FY 2021, to encourage focus on quality improvement in key priorities even during a pandemic, established a program to encourage peer learning. State Flex grantees adjusted their activities, moved trainings online, and adjusted topics based on the emerging needs of hospitals given the impacts on the pandemic. Given the focus of hospitals during the pandemic, the results below show a decrease in the percent of hospitals showing 335 improvement as hospitals focused on pandemic related care and not on planned grant improvement initiatives. The participation in CAH s in HCAHPS patient experience reporting continued to improve, with the most recent result for a reporting period that ended just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the focus of hospitals on pandemic response, the target for FY 2022 has been adjusted to r eflect this change. S mall Rural Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP) provides support to rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds to enhance their administrative capabilities in meeting information technology and reporting requirements under value- based car e through awards to 46 states with eligible hospitals. SHIP provides funding for equipment and training to upgrade billing requirements, such as incorporating new ICD-10 standards, and for software that captures patient satisfaction data. HRSA will make co ntinuation awards in FY 2022. I n FY 2020, SHIP received $150 million through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES) Act to support COVID-19 detection, treatment and prevention activities for over 1,770 rural hospitals. Hospitals recei ved approximately $80,000 each, and state grantees quickly got money to the hospitals and the hospitals had flexibility to spend funds based on their needs. Flex Rural Veterans Health Access Program focuses on increasing the delivery of mental health services or other health care services to meet the needs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans living in rural areas. Grantees focus educating community providers on how to best serve veterans. HRSA continues to partner with the Veteran's Health Administration Office of Rural Health to connect th e state level grantees with VHA knowledge and expertise. HRSA plans to make new awards in FY 2022. Funding FY T FY 2022 Budget Request of $57.6 million is $1.9 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level.

Expires after FY 2022 Allocation Method ............................................................................................. Competitive Grants Program Description and Accomplishments This grant program provides funding to establish and ma intain a State Office of Rural Health (SORH) within states to strengthen rural health care delivery systems. Every dollar of Federal support is matched by three state dollars. SORHs serve as focal points and clearinghouses for the collection and dissemination of information on rural health issues, research findings, innovative approaches, and best practices pertaining to the delivery of health care in rural areas. As the state's rural institutional framework, SORHs help link rural communities with state an d Federal resources to develop long-term solutions to rural health problems. SORHs form collaborative partnerships to better c oordinate rural health activities, maximize limited resources, and avoid duplication of effort and activities. SORHs facilitate cl inical placements through recruitment initiatives and help rural constituents meet recruitment challenges by sharing information. SORHs identify Federal, state , and nongovernmental programs and funding opportunities and provide technical assistance to public and nonprofit private entities regarding participation in rural health programs. All SORHs played a role in supporting COVID-19 information sharing on public health information during the pandemic, and many SORHs were actively involved in state response efforts. The number of TA encounters increased this year as a result to the amount of information going out to rural communities during the pandemic. 339 Funding History FY Amount FY 2018 $10,000,000 FY Request The FY 2022 Budget Request of $12.5 million is the same as the FY 2021 Enacted level.

Indefinite Allocation Method ............................................................................................. Compet itive Grants Program Description and Accomplishments The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides grants to states, local governments, and appropriate health care organizations to support programs for cancer screening for individuals adversely affected by the mining, transport and processing of uranium and the testing of nuclear weapons for the Nation's weapons arsenal. The RESEP grantees also help clients with appropriate medical referrals, engage in public information development a nd dissemination, and facilitate claims documentation to aid individuals who may wish to apply for support under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. In FY 2019, the number of individuals screened under RESEP was 605. Screening numbers for RESE P clin ics were impacted by the escalation of the COVID -19 pandemic during FY 2019. Due to strict travel restrictions put in place in states across the U.S in order to detain the spread of the virus, many RESEP clinics were unable to perform in person screenings. The utilization of Lung Spirometry, a common breathing test, at RESEP clinics also created an obstacle to continuing work during an outbreak of a virus such as COVID- 19 with airborne transmissibility. Due to these factors, the collective number of individuals screened at RESEP clinics was lower than in prior years. Funding History FY Amount FY 2022 Budget Request of $2.7 million is $900,000 above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will increase support activities such as: implementing cancer screening programs; developing education programs; disseminating information on radiogenic d iseases and the importance of early detection; screening eligible individuals for cancer and other radiogenic diseases; providing appropriate referrals for medical treatment; and facilitating documentation of Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) claims. F unding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs. Outputs and Outcomes Tables RESEP is authorized under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) , the compensation portion of the Act is under the authority of the Department of Justice while the RESEP portion is under the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services . Per RECA, compensation claims cannot be process ed after Jul y 9, 2022. However, RESEP will continue providing referrals for medical treatment and increased screening services past July 2022. HRSA has updated its performance measure targets in alignment with the statute and the upcoming end of compensat ion claim pr ocessing.

Indefinite Allocation Method ............................................... Competitive Grants and Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Black Lung Clinics Program (BLCP) funds eligible public, private, and state entities that provide medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling services to active, inactive, retired, and disabled coal miners throughout the United States with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with occupationally related coal-mine dust lung disease. To support the longer-term need faced by miners with severe disability due to black lung disease, grantees may also assist coal miners and their families in preparing the detailed application for Federal Black Lung benefits from the Department of Labor (DOL). In the recent years, most grantees have been able to use funds to upgrade equipment, enhance their workforce capacity and increase behavioral health screenings and care integration. HRSA funds the Black Lung Data and Resource Center (BLDRC), formerly known as the Black Lung Center of Excellence, to improve patient- level data collection and analy sis, clinic operations, and the quality and breadth of services provided by the BLCP recipients. In FY 2019, HRSA deployed a new patient- level data reporting system across all 15 recipients to better capture the number of coal miners served, and the number and types of medical and benefits counseling services received. HRSA can track a unique coal miner patient's disease and case progression to better assess the quality and breadth of services provided. The data collected also better aligns with other publicly available data such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) and Department of Labor's (DOL) Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation (DCMWC) program. Published data highlights the continued need for black lung services. T he National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) identified a cluster of 60 progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) cases among current and former Appalachian coal miners at a single eastern Kentucky radiology practice from January 2015 to August 2016. This figure exceeded the 19 PMF cases in 345 Kentucky detected by NIOSH's National Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program between August 2011 and July 2016.264 The most recently published prevalence data for CWP among underground coal miners with 25 years or more of underground mining tenure in central Appalachia (Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia) is 20.6 percent and the national prevalence is over 10 percent. 265 Servi ces pro vided to Black Lung Clinic recipients were impacted by the escalation of t he COVID-19 pandemic. Coal miners suffering from the suite of coal dust respiratory diseases were especially susceptible to severe illness or death.266 The clinics had to initially s uspend then greatly reduce the services provided in order to keep their coa l miner patients safe. The primary method of diagnosing Black Lung diseases involves the Pulmonary Function Test which requires the rapid inhalation and expiration of breath. As an aerosol generating procedure, this puts both the coal miner and clinic sta ff at risk for COVID -19 exposure. With BLCP funds, clinics were able to obtain PPE, cleaning and sanitizing supplies; install filters, fans, and negative pressure rooms; and admini ster rapid tests in order to resume critical services to coal miners. After a decrease in coal miner patient volume in the late FY19 and early FY20 project years, most clinics have been able to welcome coal miners back to their clinics. In FY 2021, clinics are still limited in their outreach and education services due to continued travel and group size restrictions. HRSA anticipates the services to increase in FY 2022. Funding FY of $12.2 million is $690,000 above the FY 2021 Enacted level. HRSA will increase funding to 15 Black Lung Clinic Program awards that provide primary care and other services to coal miners and a cooperative agr eement with one Bla ck Lung Data and Resource (BLDRC) to enhance the quality of services provided by BLCP grantees. The BLDRC cooperative agreement recipient will work closely with HRSA to strengthen the quality of data collection and analysis. The primary medical services pr ovided to coal miners at Black Lung clinics include aerosol generating procedures to screen for, diagnose, and treat Black Lung diseases. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the clinics have been burdened with additional disinfecting and sanitizing protocols, staffing shortages, facility renovations, and travel 264 Blackley DJ, Crum JB, Halldin CN, Storey E, Laney AS . \"Resurgence of Progressive Massive Fibrosis in Coal Miners \u2014 2016.\" MMWR 265 Blackley DJ, Halldin Increase in Prevalence of Coal Workers' P neumoconiosis in the United States, 1970- 2017\" , American Journal of Public Health 108, no. 9 (September 1, 2018): pp. 1220- 1222. 266 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \" People with Certain Medical Conditions \" Updated Mar. 29, 2021 346 restrictions.

Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreements Program Description and Accomplishments The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) promotes the use of telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services. OAT plays two distinct roles with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The f irst is to serve as the central focal point for the Department's broad efforts in leveraging telehealth programs and policies to improve access, enhance outcomes, and support clinicians and patients. The second is to administer grant programs focused on te lehealth for direct services, research, and technical assistance. OAT's investments advance the provision of telehealth services to rural and underserved communities while simultaneously building the evidence- base for telehealth. OAT administers the follow ing grant programs: Telehealth Network Gran t Program (TNGP) funds programs that demonstrate how telehealth networks improve healthcare services in rural communities. More specifically, the networks are used to: expand access to, coordinate, and improve the quality of health care services, improve and expand the training of health care providers; and/or expand and improve the quality of health information available to health care providers, patients, and their families. The current cohort is aimed towards promoting rural tele -emergency services by en hancing telehealth networks to deliver 24-hour emergency department (ED) consultation services via telehealth to rural providers without emergency care specialists. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY Telehealth Network Progr am (EB THNP) demonstrates how healthcare systems can increase access to healthcare services and improve health outcomes by using direct -to-consumer technologies. The EB THNP grantees will conduct evaluations of these efforts to establish an evidence base for direct -to-consumer telehealth services. The emphasis on data collection and research to further the telehealth evidence base separates this program from the other Telehealth Network Grant Program. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY 2022. In addition, HRSA plans to support new EB THNP 348 awards to increase access to healthcare services and improve health outcomes by using direct -to-consumer technologies. Telehealth Resource Center (TRC) Program provi des expert and customizable telehealth techni cal assistance across the country. The TRCs provide training and support, disseminate information and research findings, promote effective collaboration, and foster the use of telehealth technologies to provide health care information and education for pro viders who serve rural and medically underserved areas and populations. The National Telehealth Resource Center Program (NTRC) and the Regional Telehealth Resource Center Program (RTRC) are designed to expand the availability of technical assistance in th e development of telehealth services, leveraging the experience of mature programs with expertise in providing and implementing telehealth services. HRSA will support regional and national TRC continuation awards in FY 2022. Telehealth Center of Excellen ce (COE) Program examines the efficacy of telehealth services in rural and urban areas and serves as a national clearinghouse for telehealth research and resources . The purpose of this program is to assess specific telehealth uses, operate as incubators to pilot, track and refine telehealth, examine the efficacy of telehealth services in rural and underserved areas and explore new telehealth applications, for telehealth research and resources. The program focuses on the delivery and impact of telehealth ac ross diagnosis-based projects, numerous care settings and telehealth education and incorporate wide-ranging technology and modalities to advance telehealth. HRSA awards in 2022. Telehealth cused Rural Health Research Center (TF-RHRCs) Program conducts telehealth research to expand the evidence base of telehealth services in rural and underserved areas. The TF -RHRCs focus on pol icy-relevant, clinically informed telehealth research and comprehensive evaluation of nationwide telehealth investments in rural areas and populations. As part of the research and evaluation, the Telehealth Research Centers will also work with Telehealth N etwork Grant Program (TNGP) awardees, helping them quantify and analyze their results and preparing summaries and publications of TNGP's clinical impact. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY 2022. Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP) provides support to state professional licensing boards to carry out programs under which the boards cooperate to develop and implement state policies that will reduce statutory and regulatory barriers to telemedicine. This assistance benefits practitioners who would like to provide telehealth services across state lines. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY 2022. Telehealth Technology-Enabled Learning Program (TTELP) connects specialists at academic medical centers with primary care providers in rural an d underserved areas, providing evidence-based training and support to help treat patients with complex conditions in their communities. TTELP recipients develop telehealth technology-enabled collaborative learning and capacity building models (such as Project ECHO, ECHO-like models, distance learning, tele-mentoring, clinical decision support, and othe r 349 emerging models in the field), and share freely accessible tools and resources that are adaptable to culturally and regionally diverse populations to provide training nationwide to facilitate the dissemination of best practice specialty care to primary c are providers and care teams in rural and underserved areas. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY 2022. Funding 2022 Budget Request of $36.5 million is $2.5 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. HRSA will continue to utilize telehealth to provide access to healthcare in rural and underserved areas. This request will allow HRSA to expand the EB THNP with new awards in support of increasing access to healthcare services and improving health outcomes by using direct- to- consumer technologies. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue to support grant awards to strengthen the networks and the technical assistance providers that support effective imp lementation of telehealth services. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs .

Indefinite Allocation Method ..................................................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The purpose of the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program is to expand the number of rural residency training programs and subsequently increase the number of physicians choosing to practice in rural areas . For the purpose of this program, rural residencies are allopathic and osteopathic physician residency training programs that primarily train in rural communities. This includes Rural Training Tracks (RTTs), a specific model of rural residency training in which residents receive more than 50 percent of their training in a rural location after spending their initial year in a larger, often urban, residency setting. Research has shown that residents often practice near where they complete their residency tr aining. RTT graduates are twice as likely to practice family medicine in a rural setting as compared to family medicine residents trained in an urban program. The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy collaborates with HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce (B HW) to fund two rural residency programs: Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) creates new physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas and that are sustainable beyond the grant performance period through public (i.e., Medicare or Medicaid), other state or private funding. Gra ntees may use funds to cover planning and development costs incurred while achieving program accreditation through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Rural Residency Planning and Development Technical Assistance (RRPD -TA) funds a cooperative agreement that serves as a technical assistance center to support RRPD awardees. In FY 2019, H RSA funded the first cohort of 27 three- year RRPD awards across 21 states and in FY 2020, HRSA funded a new cohort of 11 three- year RRPD awards acr oss 10 states. In FY 2021 HRSA anticipates awarding approximately eight additional RRPD awards as well as making one new award for the RRPD- TA cooperative agreement. The awardees from all three RRPD cohorts and the RRPD-TA program were fully funded at th e start of the project period and will be active in FY 2022. These awards support new rural residency programs in family 352 medicine, internal medicine and psychiatry; applicants also had the opportunity in FY 2020 to develop rural residency programs in general surgery, OB/GYN, and preventive medicine. To date, 13 RRPD grantees have already received ACGME accreditation. The RRPD competitions have generated significant interest from rural stakeholders. Funding History FY Amount FY Budget Request of $12.7 million is $2.2 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will support new RRPD awards and provide funding for the RRPD TA program. Funding also includes costs associated with the grant review and award process, follow-up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Indefinite Allocation Method ..................................................... Competitive Grants/Cooperative Agreement Program Description and Accomplishments The Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) initiative aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality asso ciated with substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid use disorder (OUD), in high risk rural communities by providing funding and technical assistance to multi-sector consortia to enable them to identify and address OUD prevention, treatment, and recovery needs at the community, county, state, and/or regional levels. HRSA supports three grant programs through RCORP: RCO RP -Implementation provides multi-year support to rural communities to strengthen and expand SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, and recove ry services with an emphasis on implementing evidence-based, promising, and innovative approaches and improving organizational and infrastructural capacity at the regional and state levels. HRSA awarded 90 Implementation awards in FY 2020. HRSA plans to award new Implementation awards in FY 2022. RCO RP -Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome provides multi-year support to rural communities to reduce the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome by improving systems of care, family supports, and social determinants of health. HRSA will support continuation awards in FY 2022. RCO RP -Psychosti mulant Support provides multi-year funding to rural communities to address psychostimulant misuse, including methamphetamine misuse, through prevention, treatment, and recovery interventions. HRSA plans to award new Psychostimulant Support awards in FY 2022. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue funding the Rural Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorders program that supports the dissemination of best practices related to the trea tment for and prevention of substance use disorders within rural communities. HRSA will also continue supporting a cooperative agreement to conduct program- wide evaluation activities for the 355 RCORP Initiative and will re -compete funding for one cooperative agreement award to provide technical assistance to RCORP grantees. HRSA wil l continue to support the four Rural Behavioral Health Workforce Centers cooperative agreements, which aim to improve access to behavioral health care services and gainful employment opportunities for rural residents in the Northern Border Regional Commiss ion service area. Funding History FY Amount 2022 Budget Request of $165.0 million is $55.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will enable HRSA to fund new RCORP-Implementation grants that provide needed SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, and recovery services to rural residents. This request will provide HRSA with flexibility to respond to the evolving needs of the epidemic. Drug overdose deaths in rural counties have increased from 4.0 per 100,000 in 1999 to 19.6 in 2019. In 2019, the rate of drug overdose deaths involving psychostimulants with abuse potential was 1.4 times higher in rural counties than in urban counties.272 Drug overdose deaths have accelerated during the COVID -19 pandemic.273 In FY 2021, HRSA expanded RCORP's methamphetamines and for FY 2022, HRSA plans to fund additional awards to address psychostimulants as well as continue to allow rural communities to broaden their focus on other SUDs in addition to opioids. HRSA recognizes that about half of those who experience a substance use disorder during their lives will also experience a mental illness, and vice versa.274 RCORP award recipients have noted continuing problematic or worsening COVID -19 impacts on behavioral health. Approximately 58 percent of M ental Health Professional Shortage Areas are in rural areas, representing nearly 26 million people who do not have adequate access to mental healthcare providers.275 In FY 2022, HRSA will fund new awards for the existing Psychostimulant Support program allowing rural communities to respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents impacted by SUD/OUD. HRSA will also continue to solicit feedback from rural stakeholders and engage and partner with other Federal agencies to promote a coordina ted approach to combatting this devastating epidemic and identifying additional priority areas. 272 Urban -Rural Differences in Drug Overdose Death Rates, 1999- 2019 273 Overdose Deaths Accelerating During COVID -19 see al so Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts 274 Common Comorbidities with Substance Use Disorders Research Report 275 Designated HPSA Quarterly Summary, 2020 356 HRSA will include health and racial equity as a key component of any FY 2022 funded RCORP programs.

One of HRSA's goals is to strengthen program management and operations by improving program customer satisfaction, increasing employee engagement, and implementing organizational improvements and innovative projects. Program Management is the primary means of support for staff, business operations and processes, information technology and overhead expenses such as rent, utilities, and miscellaneous charges for HRSA. I mproving Processes and Business Operations H RSA continues to improve operational planning processes to foster cross- agency collaboration. HRSA has automated its contracting process to operate in a totally pap erless environment, including the receipt of committed funds, the obligation of funds, and the generation and storage of contract documents. Over the past several years, HRSA has supported telework participation by increasing the agency- wide u tilization o f real -time web collaboration tools. Real -time collaboration is accomplished using automated tools that support a full range of requirements from one-on-one for teleworkers to web-based meetings supporting as many as 500 participants. D evelop ing a 21st C entury Workforce N umerous efforts are underway to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the agency and to ensure the workforce is positioned to succeed in the 21st century. The hiring process has been improved, reducing the time it takes to complete the hiring cycle from recruitment to onboarding. HRSA is focused on intense employee engagement improvement efforts. The agency had over an 85% participant rate in the 2019 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). HRSA performs custom analysis and consultations with organizations at all levels to infor m improvement strategies. Maintaining a skilled workforce is a top priority. In 2018, The HRSA Learning Institute (HLI) delivered 246 classes, including both in person and virtual. More than 1,330 HRSA employees participated in at least one class, an in crease of 10 percent compared to 2017. HLI received and 360 assisted agency staff on requests for organizational development facilitation services, and collaborated with the Bureaus/Offices to create custom training curriculum. Sharing Quality Services HRSA r elies on HHS -provided shared services for many of the services represented in this CAP goal, such as human resources, financial management, grants, and procurement. HRSA actively seeks out and deploys shared services to improve and simplify processes, and to maximize the efficiency of shared services with other components of HHS. Creating a Culture of Program Integrity Program Management also supports Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) activities that align with core principles and performance and strategic planning activities to reduce programmatic risk and improve performance. HRSA has established a HRSA -wide governance structure for enterprise -wide business operations and risk management activities to ensure a proactive and customer -focused suite of business operation services and risk management functions. HRSA is currently engaged in ERM implementation strategies aligned with the revised OMB Circular A -123. Recent revisions to the circular's Appendices A and C, respectively, include prioritizing risk based assessments and a focus on fraud identification and prevention activities. HRSA's ERM efforts include Governance and Process support for the promotion of a risk- aware organizational culture, the creation of a comprehensive view of risks to drive strat egic decision making and the establishment and communication of risk appetite. Operations during the COVID -19 Pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, HRSA used its secure and mobile infrastructure to immediately transition to 100 percent telework for all s taff. HRSA averages approximately 3,000 Virtual Private Network sessions per day. HRSA also implemented new technologies to quickly disperse Provider Relief funds to hospitals and healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response. Using enhanced technologies HRSA was able to reduce its grant award cycle from 90 -120 days to 12-18 days for COVID-19 grants. These key IT enhancements expedited the time to award for over 5,000 grants bet ween March and May, 2020. Funding History FY Amount Budget Request of $168.0 million is $12.7 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This funding level supports program management activities to effectively and efficiently 361 support HRSA's operations. An additional $12.7 million is requested to further support HRSA operations at an overall increased funding level of $2.1 billion over FY 2021 Enacted. HRSA is committed to improving quality at a lower cost and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations. HRSA supports telework by increasing the agency- wide utilization of web collaboration tools, which have led to greater business productivity. HRSA also continues to enhance its program integrity activities by supporting analytical tools using HRSA's electronic grants system, program data, Office of Federal Assistance Management data sources, HHS sources, and government-wide sources. The goal is for HRSA to identify potential issues in the pre- and post- award processes and to address issues before they become audit findings. HRSA plans to focus on a risk-based approach to grantee monitoring using the information and corresponding analysis to help staff spend their time on grantees at risk of noncompliance. HRSA will also continue to provide training for grants management and program staff to support the alignment of program integrity initiatives with planning and performance activities. These efforts will enhance HRSA grantees awareness and ability to avoid potential financial integrity issues. IT Investments Significant progress has been made in a range of program ma nagement activities. Some highlights include: Improve cybersecurity efforts by enhancing HRSA's public-facing websites in compliance with OMB and DHS requirements, by implementing enterprise- wide Security Event Management using Splunk, and by initiating a successful \"PhishMe\" campaign to train HRSA staff to recognize and properly report suspicious emails. Continue implementation of the Enterprise Architecture, Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) and Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) proc esses. E nhance Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) by adding a team based approach to all modules, adding auto-save, and implementing a Modern Business analytics Platform (MDAP) using Tableau. Launched a new EHBs user interface for grantees with simpler navigation, widgets, fly-out menus, and other shortcuts. C ontinue modernizing the Data Warehouse. Developed a series of colorful and interactive Tableau dashboards to replace 130 legacy reports, giving HRSA staff and the public deeper analytical insight into HRSA funding, location, and program performance. Upgraded geocoding technology, resulting in 20 percent faster map generation and improved accuracy of Health Center site locations. Collapsed 250 web pages into 75, resulting in a simpler, more organized site that is easier to search and navigate. 362 Outcomes and Outputs Tables Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result (Summary of Result) FY RM) (Output) FY 2019: Assessed HRSA's ERM implementation efforts, including alignment with revised OMB Circular A -123 (Target Met) Target: Assess HRSA's ERM implementation efforts, including alignment with HHS and OMB Circular A - 123 ERM guidance.

Enacted in 1970 as part o f the Public Health Service Act, the mission of the Title X Program is to assist individuals and families in determining the number and spacing of children and to provide access to voluntary family planning methods, services, and information to all who want and need them. Title X authorizing legislation requires that projects provide a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods and services, including fertility awareness-based methods, infertility ser vices and services for adolescents. By law, priority is given to persons from low- income families. The Title X Program is administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). The Title X Program fulfills its mission through awa rding competitive grants to public and private nonprofit organizations. According to the 2019 Family Planning Annual Report (FPAR) data (the most recent data available), in 2019 Title X services were provided through 100 family planning service grants that supported a nationwide network of 3,825 community- based sites that provided clinical and educational services to more than 3,095,666 persons. As a result of the provision of a broad range of effective and acceptable family planning methods, counseling and education, and other clinical services, the Title X Program was responsible for the prevention of an estimated 672,638 unintended pregnancies. As of August 2020, there was at least one Title X services grantee in 44 of the 50 states, the District of Co lumbia, and in each of the U.S. territories, including the six Pacific jurisdictions. C urrent Title X grants are entering their third and final year of their project period in FY 2021. OPA will conduct a national compe tition for all Title X services for a new project period starting in FY 2022. Through screening and testing, Title X service providers help to prevent and treat STDs. STD services are integral to family planning services because they improve health and ca n affect a 368 person's ability to conceive and have a healthy birth outcome. In 2019, Title X service sites tested 1,577,243 female and male clients for chlamydia. Screening for chlamydia is important not only in reducing the impact of STDs, which continue t o rise in the United States, but als o reducing infertility. Untreated chlamydia infection may lead to the development of pelvic inflammatory disease, which if left untreated may cause infertility. In addition to screening for chlamydia, Title X service sites tested 1.8 million clients for gonorrhea; tested 674,764 clients for syphilis; and conducted 961,859 confidential tests for HIV. Of the confidential HIV tests performed, 3,685 were positive for HIV. I n addition to providing grants to clinical service providers, the Title X Program supports HHS and OASH's initiative to identify and provide solutions to reduce substance use disorders (SUD) and the impact that they have on future health outcomes. In 2019, the Title X Program built off of a previously held expert work group focused on the identification of interventions to better incorporate and link SUD screening, referral, and treatment with Title X family planning centers. As a result of this, OPA is funding research programs that focus on innovative ideas to improve the delivery of Title X family planning services, including funding programs that integrate SUD screening, referral, and/or treatment with family planning and related reproductive health services. The awards were made in fall 2019. OPA also continues to collaborate with SAMHSA's Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) and other Federal and community -based programs in order to improve counseling, screening and referral for treatment services at Title X service sites. In FY 2019, the program completed a 3 -year init iative to improve the ability of Title X family planning projects to provide Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) services on- site or by referral. This initiative included the development of a comprehensive tool, guidance and technical assistance for Title X f amily planning projects interested in providing PrEP services to reduce the risk of HIV infection. While the audience of this tool is Title X family planning service providers, it can also be used by other clinical care providers, including but not limite d to STI clinics and other service sites which provide family planning and related preventive health services. The Title X Program also played a key role in helping to develop the STI Federal Action Plan. Emphasis is placed on underserved populations or communities where high rates of STIs impact the ability of individuals to achieve healthy pregnancies. OPA and the Title X grantees are committed to continuously improving and enhancing the services provided to clients by providing training and technical assistance for all levels of family planning personnel, collecting and using data to assess and improve program performance, and researching improved delivery mechanisms for family planning services. OPA continues to focus on providing quality family planning services, including emphasizing the importance of making the broad range of family planning methods and services available at Title X family planning centers. Supporting the overall health of clients will continue to be an important focus of the program. Therefore, each Title X project is strongly encouraged to ensure access to primary health care serv ices, either onsite or through robust referral linkages. OPA will continue its work with other HHS OPDIVs to update clinical guidance and recommendations to ensure that high-quality counseling, education and family planning services are available to clients and providers. 369 The Title X program continues to provide targeted technical assistance on financial and progra m management topics, including effective billing practices, billing all appropriate third -party payers, and other cost recovery methods. Thes e and other technical assistance and trainings are provided through the Title X National Training Center. Grantee s are urged to implement more efficient administrative systems such as health information technologies, electronic health records, and payment management systems. Focusing on these areas will also assist in better data collection and increase the ability to report on the outputs and outcomes of Title X projects and the overall program. On March 4, 2019, the Final Rule, Compliance with Statutory Program Integrity Requirements - 84 FR 7714, pp. 7714-7791, to revise 42 CFR 59, was published in the Federal Register. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued a \"Memorandum on Protecting Women's Health at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the 2019 Title X Final Rule and \"consider, as soon as practicable, whether to suspend, revise, or rescind, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding, those regulations, consistent with applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act.\" HHS conducted an extensive review an d consideration of the 2019 Title X Final Rule (84 Fed. Reg. 7714) pursuant to this Presidential memorandum. After reviewing the 2019 rule, HH S published a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on April 15, 2021 that is substantively similar to those issued in 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 41270), under which the program operated successfully for years, with a few definitional updates that account for minor operational changes over the past 20 years. HHS will review and carefully consider al l comments submitted in response to this NPRM and plans to have any Title X Final Rule in place by early fall and effective in time for the Fiscal Year 2022 funding announcement. Funding History Fiscal Year Amount FY 2018 FY FY 2022 President's Budget request for Title X Family Planning Program is $340.0 million , which is $53.5 million above the FY 2021 Enacte d Level. In FY 2022, OPA will conduct a national competition for all Title X services funding. The additional funds requested will enable the Title X program to expand access to family planning services to address unmet needs across communities and populations throughout all 50 States and Territories. The FY 2022 Budget is expected to support family planning services for approximately 3.5 million persons, with approximately 90 percent having family incomes at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level. The FY 2022 request provides funding for 370 family planning methods and related preventive health services, as well as, related training, information, education and research to improve family planning service delivery. T he FY 2022 request will also allow the program to continue supporting the operation of Family Planning National Training Centers. These training centers focus on improving grantee capacity and skills of clinical providers in Title X serv ice grant projects in order to increase access an d the quality of services for all individuals seeking Title X family planning services. The targets for FY 2022 assume other sources of revenue that contribute to the family planning program at the grantee level will remain at current levels, includin g Medicaid, state and local government programs, other federal, state, and private grants, and private insurance. OPA is increasing its focus on improving chlamydia screening rates within the Title X proje cts. While OPA has always stressed the importance of screening for chlamydia infection, following CDC's clinical recommendations, the continued increase in STIs over the past decade stresses the added importance of identifying and treating this preventable infection as early as possible. In addition, OPA is continuing to stress the importance of vaccination against HPV, screening for undiagnosed cervical tissue abnormalities, providing preconception care and counseling and basic infertility services, prov iding pregnancy testing and counseling, increasing access to fertility awareness -based methods (FABM) \u2014which includes natural family planning methods\u2014 hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives methods, adolescent services and related education and counseling. These services, along with community-based education and outreach, assist individuals and families with effective family planning services, whether it be to prevent or achieve pregnancy to the extent practicable, Title X clinics also encourage family par ticipation when delivering such services. OPA will also coordinate with other federal agencies, and with other data collection efforts reflecting performance and impact. The program is anticipating that additional investment in training on third party billing, an increase in the proportion of clients who have health insurance, and better adoption of electronic health records and related health IT systems will increase revenue and allow the Title X Program to reach more of the population it is intended to serve. Based on the FPAR, billing revenue has continued to increase over the past decade. In addition, the program is assessing traditional and innovative ways to increase access to family planning and related preventive health services, specifically in rural and hard to reach areas.

This resulted in Title X serving fewer clients and therefore not meeting the performance targets for 2019. Grant Awards Tables Note: OPA funded 90 Title X service grantees at the beginning of FY 2019. After implementation of the final rule in FY 2019, 19 grantees discontinued participating in the Title X Program, resulting in 71 Title X service grantees. OPA funded an additional 5 Title X grantees in FY 2020. In FY 2022, OPA will compete all Title X service delivery funds and anticipates funding additional grantees.

Additional projects may be funded from the FY 2021 notification letter upon approval from OMB. 285 HHS has not yet notified for FY 2022 286 Pursuant to Section 223 of Division G of the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2008, notification is required of planned use 375 Data visualization and GIS mapping tools will provide HRSA more robust business intelligence to enhance program decision -making and reporting. In F Y 2020, HRSA received $1.1 million to continue a lift and shift cloud migration of HRSA's BHW Management Information System Solution (BMISS), which supports facilitating loan repayment, scholarship, shortage designations, and business operations. The migration of BMISS to a cloud environment aligns with the HHS Office of the CIO's adoption of the Federal Cloud First policy, the Office of Management and Budget's M-11-29 mandate, and the HHS 2017-2020 Information Technology Strategic Plan. The migration will resu lt in savings from data center hosting fees and enable business flexibility and scalability for HRSA's computing needs. HRSA also received $1.95 million in FY 2020 to continue a project that provides critical enhanc ements and upgrades to HRSA's cybersecurity capabilities and operations. HRSA has initiated efforts to procure a feature -rich, cutting-edge endpoint detection and response solution to effectively defend against adversaries and efficiently respond to cybersecurity incidents. HRSA will a lso procure a tool focused on monitoring enterprise databases for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, unauthorized access, and data loss prevention. Progra m Accomplishments NEF resources have allowed HRSA to make critical capital investments in information technology that modernize and secure HRSA's systems and improve the effectiveness of agency operations and the ways HRSA utilizes data. HRSA continues to make critical upgrades to its cybersecurity infrastructure wit h NEF funding since FY 2016, including implementing new cybersecurity tools and enhanced authentication practices for HRSA systems users. These cybersecurity investments increase the effectiveness of HRSA's technology infrastructure safeguards that protect valuable data and information systems, while supporting standards and requirements set forth by various federal agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Homeland Security. With NEF funding, HRSA moderniz ed its enterprise data repository, the HRSA Data Warehouse. HRS A overhauled a legacy mapping system with cutting- edge Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, added a wider range of data and advanced analytics, and improved the user experience. New interactive web -based mapping capabilities allow HRSA to quickly respond to emerging public health threats with data and maps. In FY 2019, HRSA developed Clinician Dashboards that provide aggregate information on over 28,000 clinicians that have been supported by HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) with NEF funding. Leveraging GIS technology, HRSA rolled out the first series of maps that show detail on all bureau loan repayment, scholarship, and grant training programs. NEF resources have also provided HRSA the opportunity to initiate the migration of several platforms to a cloud environment. HRSA has completed cloud migration for certain IT systems, including non-production and general system support (GSS) platforms. HRSA's cloud migration efforts al ign with OMB's Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) to de crease systems 376 installations at on -premise data centers, utilize cloud virtualization and on demand storage, and to realize cost savings or cost avoidance over the life of HRSA's IT systems. With a focus on cloud-based solutions, HRSA has also invested i n two critical initiatives to modernize the EHBs using FY 2019 NEF resources. HRSA has either completed or is working on a number of cloud adoption proof-of-concepts and platform improvements t o enable microservices architecture (MSA), which promotes the m ore effective and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. MSA are processes that communicate over a network by using technology-agnostic protocols and are independently deployable. HRSA is also engaged in activities to enhance EHBs security featu res by remediating legacy code vulnerabilities and expanding two-factor authentication to external users. 377 Supplementary Tables TAB 378 Object Class Tables (dollars in thousands) DISCRETIONARY OBJECT CLASS FY 2020 Final personnel (11.7) 20,037 21,543 22,189 personnel services payments (11.8) +1 Subtotal personnel compensation 2,168 former Total Pay Costs of 1,414 1,406 -8 Transportation of things (22.0) 157 157 157 -

Subsequently in FY 2020, HRSA found that 36 health centers were unable to demonstrate sufficient progress to merit continuing their AIMS awards, resulting in a $2 million total reduction in drug control funding. For FY 2021, HRSA found that 63 health centers were unable to demonstrate sufficient progress to merit continuing their SUD-MH awards, resulting in a $3 million total reduction in drug control funding. All of this targeted supplemental funding is scored as drug control funding. 399 FORHP The allocation of funds for the Rural Community Opioid Response Program (RCORP) is through competitive grants and cooperative agreements. The entirety of these programs is scored as drug control funding. BUDGET SUMMARY The drug c ontrol budget for the Health Resources and Services Administration at the FY 2022 President's Budget Request is $705.0 million, which is $55.0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted. Bureau of Primary Health Care FY Budget Request: Enacted) In FY 2022, the Health Center program plans to support more than 1,400 grantees and provide primary health care services to over 31 million patients, including access to ongoing SUD services. Health centers will continue to p rovide SUD services for all age groups. In FY 2019, the Health Center Program awarded $201 million in new SUD/MH ongoing annual awards. The reported amount of estimated drug resources for FY 2019 and FY 2020, and those projected for FY 2021 through FY 2022, reflect the ongoing annual SUD/MH awards initiated in FY 2016 through FY 2019, health center continuation awards made in FY 2020, and projections for FY 2021 through FY 2022. Federal Office Enacted) In FY 2022, the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy will continue to invest in ini tiatives and support evidence- based strategies that address the specific substance use disorder issues and mental healt h services needs in rural communities. The FY 2022 President's Budget Request will fund new and continuing grants and cooperative agreements for RCORP to strengthen the infrastructure and capacity within rural communities at high risk for substance use disorders and provide needed prevention, treatment, and recovery services to rural residents. The RCORP initiative is currently composed of three active grant programs and four cooperative agreements that provide technical assistance coordination, program ev aluation, and dissemination of evidence- based programs and best practices. RCORP -Imp lementation provides multi-year support to rural communities to yield large- scale organizational and infrastructural improvements at the regional and state levels to address opioid use disorder, with a particular focus on treatment and recovery. 400 The Implementation grants that HRSA fully funded in FY 2020 and FY 2021 will remain active in FY 2022. HRSA will new RCORP -Ne onatal Abs tinence Syndrome provides multi-year support to rural communities to reduce the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome by improving systems of care, family supports, and social determinants of health. HRSA will support the continuation of 30 awards in FY 2022. RCORP -Psy chostimulant Support provides multi-year funding to rural communities to address psychostimulant misuse, including methamphetamine misuse, through prevention, treatment, and recovery interventions. The three- year grants that HRSA will fully fund in FY 2021 will remain active in FY 2022. HRSA will also make new FY 2022. In FY 2022, HRSA will continue funding the Rural Centers of Excellence on Substance Use Disorders program that supports the disseminat ion of best practices related to the treatment for and prevention of substance use disorders within r ural communities. HRSA will also continue supporting a cooperative agreement to conduct program- wide evaluation activities for the RCORP Initiative and will re -compete funding for one cooperative agreement award to provide technical assistance to RCORP grantees. Additionally, HRSA will continue to support the Rural Behavioral Health Workforce Centers cooperative agreements, which aim to improve access to behavioral health care services and gainful employment opportunities for rural residents in the Northern Border Regional Commission service area. The request will also provide HRSA with flexibility to respond to the evolving needs of the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths in rural counties have increased from 4.0 per 100,000 in 1999 to 19.6 in 2019. In 2019, the rate of drug overdose deaths involving psychostimulants with abuse potential was 1.4 times higher in rural counties than in urban counties.287 More over, drug overdose deaths have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.288 In FY 2021, HRSA expanded RCORP's focus methamphetamines and for FY 2022, HRSA plans to fund additional awards to address psychostimulants as well as continue to allow rural communities to broaden their focus on other SUDs in addition to opioids. Additionally, HRSA recognizes that about half of those who experience a substance use disorder during their lives will also experience a mental illness, and vice versa.289RCORP award recipients have noted continuing problematic or worsening COVID-19 im pacts on behavioral health . Approximately 58 percent of Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas are in rural areas, representing nearly 26 million people who do not have adequate access to mental healthcare providers.290 As a result, in FY 2022, HRSA will fund new awards for a pilot program allowing rural communities to respond to new and ongoing behavioral health needs of rural residents impacted by SUD/OUD. H RSA will also continue to solicit feedback from rural stakeholders and engage and partner with other Federal agencies to promote a coordinated 287 Urban -Rural Differences in Drug Overdose Death Rates, 1999- 2019 288 Overdose Deaths Accelerating During COVID -19; see also Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts 289 Part 1: The Connection Between Substance Use Disorders and Mental Illness 290 Designated HPSA Quarterly Summary, 2020 401 approach to combatting this devastating epidemic and identifying additional priority areas. HRSA will include he alth and racial equity as a key component of any FY 2022 funde d RCORP programs. PERFORMANCE Information regarding HRSA 's Health Center Program's performance is based on the UDS . The table and accompanying text represent highlights of their achievements for the latest year for which data are available. Health R esources and Services Administration Selected Measures of Performance FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Achieved \u00bb \u00bb Number of Health Center Program grantees providing SBIRT services 730 802 Number of H ealth Center Program grantees providing substance use disorder counseling and treatment services 760 865 HRSA i s taking several approaches to improve access to high quality substance use disorder (SUD) services for medically underserved communities through the Health Center Program. General approaches include developing the infrastructure for high quality care through the adoption of health information technology (HIT) and the transformation of health centers to patient -centered medical homes (PCMH). PC MH and the meaningful use of HIT enable enhanced access to care, better care coordination, and improved pat ient engagement. Transformed health centers are better positioned to partner with other addiction- related services in the community including inpatient and outpatient SUD services. To further improve access and raise the quality of SUD services, the av ailability of services on - site is essential. This is achieved by training health center clinicians to provide high quality and expanded services for those with addiction disorders. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an ev idence-based process used by primary care providers in health centers to detect and treat addiction effectively. Because many communities served by health centers have a high burden of addiction disorders, many health centers have chosen to co- locate and integrate SUD specialty services reflecting efficient and effective approaches in meeting patient needs. The integration of SUD services may include the provision of enhanced services, such as medication -assisted treatment (MAT), by primary care clinician s. In addition, HRSA provides guidance to health centers on collaboration with State agencies to ensure that appropriate standards of care are implemented and that referrals are coordinated. Screening for substance use disorders has increased 93 percent since 2016 with the number of patients receiving screening, brief intervention, referral and treatment (SBIRT) increasing from 716,677 in 2016 to 1,381,408 in 2019. From 2016-2019, the number of health center providers eligible to prescribe MAT increased over 300 percent (from 1,700 in 2016 to 7,095 in 2019) and the number of patients receiving MAT increased 266 percent (from 39,075 in 2016 to 142,919 in 2019). 402 In 2019, 865 health centers provided SUD counseling and treatment services, exceeding the program 2019 target. Also in 2019, 802 health centers provided SBIRT services, exceeding the program FY 2019 target. T he Rural Communities Opioid Response Program's goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid overdoses in rural communities through the strengthening of the organizational and infrastructural capacity of multi-sector consortiums. HRSA has developed OMB -approved performance measures to support this large- scale initiative, and the baseline data is being analyzed in order to identify appropriate targets . 403 Significant Items TAB 404 SIGNIFICANT ITEMS FOR INCLUSION IN L -HHS APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FY 2022 CONGRESSIONAL JUS TIFICATION CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 P.L. 116 -260 (December 27, 2020) 1.

(Page 10) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA plans to award up to 8 new cooperative agreements to support experiential learning opportunities through simulation labs. This training program is designed to develop and enhance education and training networks between communities, academic institutions, and community -based organizations through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. It includes expanding experiential learning through the use of innovative simulation-based technology and equipment to strengthen the capaci ty of community- based training. It will augment traditional AHEC program activities, including the AHEC Scholars Program to increase diversity and distribution among health professionals, enhance health care quality, and improve health care delivery to rural and underserved areas and populations. The AHEC- SET Program intends to enhance the capacity of health professions students to address the complex health care needs of those living in rural and medically underserved areas as authorized in Section 751 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. 2. Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention. \u2014The agreem ent includes an increase of $3,000,000 for new competitive grants to expand experiential learning opportunities that shall include as an allowable use the purchase of simulation training equipment. HRSA shall give priority to grantees located in a medically- underserved area in a State with an age-adjusted high burden of stroke, heart disease, and obesity, and HRSA is encouraged to prioritize submissions that support high poverty rate communities . (Page 11) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA plans to award an estimated 11 new grants using the rank order list from the FY 2020 NEPQR-SET competition. HRSA published the NEPQR- SET NOFO with the goal to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. This includes using simulation-based technology, including equipment, to advance the health of patients, families, and 405 communities in rural an d medically underserved areas experiencing diseases and conditions that affect public health such as: high burden of stroke, heart disease, behavioral and mental health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and/or obesity. This program strengthens the capacity of undergraduate public health nursing students to address the complex health care needs of those liv ing in rural and medically underserved areas. 3. Regional Pediatric Pandemic Network. \u2014The agreement provides $10,000,000 within SPRANS to establish a regional pediatric pandemic network comprised of five children's hospitals (centers) as defined by section 340E of the PHS Act (Public Law 106-129) or their affiliated university pediatric partners. The Network shall coordinate among the Nation's pediatric hospitals and their communities in preparing for and responding to global health threats, including the coordination, preparation, response, and real- time dissemination of research -informed pediatric care for future pandemics. Funding shall be equitably distribut ed among the five centers and the centers shall be located in geographically diverse areas of the country to ensure a regional approach to the network. HRSA is urged to consider eligible pediatric quaternary hospitals or their affiliated university pediatr ic partners that have participated in a recent pediatric therapeutic or vaccination clinical trial o r other pediatric disaster care program. HRSA is directed to establish at least one such center in a State within both the Delta Regional Authority and Appalachian Regional Commission. HRSA is directed to establish at least one such center at a pediatric h ospital in each of HRSA's regions V and VII, and at least one such center in region VIII or X. HRSA is also directed to establish at least one such center at a pediatric hospital that is a primary National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science A ward grantee or a partner that contributes to the budget request of an academic medical center's application. (Page 13) Action to be Taken HRSA plans to issue a cooperative agreement by September 2021 to support the establishment of a Regional Ped iatric Pandemic Network, which will be comprised of five children's hospitals located in geographically diverse areas across the United States, as described in the Joint Explanatory Statement to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021. The Network will coordinate among the Nation's pediatric hospitals and their communities in preparing for and responding to global health threats, including the coordination, preparation, response, and real- time dissemination of research -informed pediatric care for future pandemics. 4. Ending the HIV Epidemic. \u2014The agreement includes $105,000,000 within the Ryan White program for the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. The agreement encourages the acceleration of the development of oral, ultralong-acting, sustained- release therapies as part of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. (Page 15) Action to be Taken Once approved by the Food and Drug Administration, people with HIV would benefit greatly from an oral, ultralong- acting sustained -release therapy to increase adherence t o 406 medication and achieve viral suppression. Research studies demonstrate that people with HIV who take HIV medications as prescribed, and achieve and then maintain an undetectable viral load, have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner. The HRSA Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) could include these new therapies on their formulary, once they are approved. RWHAP ADAPs are required to include at least one drug from each approved class of HIV antiretroviral medications on their formulary. However, both the development of such therapies and their approval are outside the p urview of HRSA. 5. Organ Allocation Policy.\u2014HRSA and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network are encouraged to ensure the process for changing organ allocation policies is transparent, thorough, and accommodates the recommendations of transplantation and organ donation professionals. (Page 16) Action to be Taken HRSA and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), which is comprised of organ transplantation and donation professionals as well as representatives of donor and recipient f amilies, are committed to an open and deliberative process for OPTN policy development including organ alloc ation policies. HRSA will continue to ensure that these processes are thorough and transparent with opportunity for the public to comment on all proposed OPTN policy changes. 6. Rural Health Outreach. \u2014The agreement provides not less than $24,000,000 for the Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program, including $12,000,000 to support HRSA's collaboration with the Delta Regional Authority, as described under this heading in Conference Report 115-952. The agreement encourages HRSA to consult with the N orthern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) on awarding, implementing, administering, and monitoring grants under rural health outreach and to align a wards as closely as possible with the region's strategic vision and economic and community development plans. The agreement provides no less than $1,000,000 to support HRSA's collaboration with the NBRC to help underserved rural communities identify and be tter address their health care needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial and operational performance. (Page 16) Action to be Taken HRSA will continue to collaborate with DRA, utilizing $12,000,000 to support technical assistance and rural hospitals in the Delta region. In collaboration with the NBRC, HRSA is developing a new network planning program and invest $1,000,000 in NBRC counties. The goal of this program is to help rural communities, in the NBRC service area, identify and better address their health care needs. This includes solutions related to access to care and workforce, or a focus on 407 helping small rural hospitals improve their financial viability and operational performance. 7. T elehealth Centers of Excellence (COE). \u2014The agreement includes $6,500,000 for the Telehealth COE awarded sites. The agreement directs HHS and HRSA t o continue to utilize the expertise of the COEs in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative to develop best practices for utilizing telehealth in HIV prevention, care, and treatment.

Within the funding provided, the agreement includes $10,000,000 to continue the three Rural Centers of Excellence (Centers), as established by Public Law 115-245 and as directed by Conference Report 115-952, and continued in Public Law 116-94 and further directed in the explanatory statement to accompany Public Law 116-94. In addition to the conditions set forth in Conference Report 115-952, the Centers shall work to create a collaborative, multi-partner regional clearinghouse to identify predictor s of substance use disorder treatment response. (Page 17) Action to be Taken In collaboration with the NBRC, HRSA will provide $1,500,000 to support cooperative agreements in the NBRC service area. The cooperative agreements will establish Rural Behaviora l Health Workforce Centers to improve access to behavioral health care services and gainful employment opportunities for rural residents with behavioral health needs, particularly substance use disorder. 9. Rural Populations.\u2014The agreement directs HRSA to pr ovide a briefing to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on changes to the rural designation methodology and additional factors that affect eligibility for the purposes of rural health grants funded by this Act. (Page 17) Action to be Taken HRSA issued a Federal Register Notice in January 2021 responding to comments and describing a change to the definition of rural for the determination of geographic areas eligible to apply for or receive services by rural health grants. 408 HOUSE REPORT 116-450 (July 15, 2020) 1. Health Care for the Homeless. \u2014Recognizing the complex and serious health challenges homeless individuals face, the Committee urges HRSA to prioritize access to expanded behavioral health services, including mental health services and substance use disorder treatment services. (Page 41) Action to be Taken In each year from FY 2016 to FY 2019, through increased Health Center Program appropriations, HRSA provided targeted ongoing grant awards to existing health centers to expand subs tance use disorder and mental health services to health center patients, including homeless patients. HRSA estimates that the FY 2021 enacted appropriation level will support approximately $540 million to the provision of mental health and substance use d isorder services in ongoing health center continuation awards, including approximately $139 million in Health Care for the Homeless funding for 298 health centers. Additionally, approximately $329 million in supplemental funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and approximately $1.7 billion in supplemental funding under the American Rescue Plan Act was awarded by HRSA to health centers receiving annual Health Care for the Homeless funding which can also be used to supported behavioral health services. 2. Health Centers and Home Visiting Programs.\u2014The Committee supports HRSA's continued promotion of expanded partnerships between Health Centers and evidence-based home visiting programs to improve maternal and child health outcomes in high-need communities. Home visiting programs can also provide cost- effective benefits such as care coordination and service referral that help Health Centers achieve community health goals. As such, the Committee directs the Bureau to issue written guidance on how these partnerships fit within Health C enters' scope of practice. (Page 42) Action to be Taken HRSA will continue to promote and encourage partnerships between health centers and home visiting programs, including the provision of written communication to health centers regarding coordination with home visiting programs. 3. Health Centers as Primary Dental Homes. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of Health Centers in providing integrated care to the nation's underserved communities. Health Cen ters serve as a primary dental home for many who would otherwise face barriers to dental care. The Committee is aware that some Health Centers have partnered with Community Dental Health Coordinators (CDHCs) to provide patients with greater access to dental care. CDHCs provide community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to underserved populations in rural, urban, and Native American communities. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with Health Centers to expand their work in this area. (Page 42) 409 Action to be Taken HRSA will con tinue to work with health centers to increase and enhance access to integrated oral health services, including the promotion of partnerships with Community Dental Health Coordinators, as appropriate. Oral health continues to be a priority area and health center data is collected through annual Health Center Program uniform data system (UDS) measures for clinical quality reporting and improvement strategies. Health centers continue to experience an increase i n the number of dental patients served, approximately 6.7 million dental patients were served in 2019, a 29% increase in the number served since 2015. In 2015, we introduced the Dental Sealants Measure into the UDS to capture the percentage of children age 6 to 9 years, at moderate to high risk, who received a sealant on a first permanent molar during the reporting period. In 2019, health centers achieved a 17.9% increase from 2016 UDS sealant measure data (42.4% vs 56.8%). BPHC has also supported a training and technical assistance (T/TA) cooperative agreement with the National Network for Oral Health Access (NNOHA) since 2015. Current T/TA priorities and activities include optimizing oral health care as part of integrated, comprehensive primary health care; improving performance on the UDS oral health clinical quality measure; supporting health center oral health workforce recruitment and retention, oral health and primary services HIT integration; and care team capacity building. This T/TA is provided through learning collaboratives, state/regional/national trainings, webinars, newsletters, toolkits, and fact sheets. Dental workforce is also a priority and is collected annually in our UDS data. The Health Center Program's dental workforce (dentists and dental hygienists) has experienced a 35 percent increase since 2015. Workforce well -being and satisfaction is also a p riority. In 2020 and over the next few years, HRSA will be supporting learning collaboratives, listening sessions, well- being assessment th rough survey administration and data analysis, and targeted technical assistance based upon workforce well -being need s to all of our health center FTEs, including the dental workforce. Additionally, the role of telehealth in increasing access and quality of care will continue to be a priority area after the response to COVID-19, and will likely include a focus on the role of tele -dentistry. 4. Rural Health Workforce. \u2014The Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities for collaboration and partnership with schools and programs that offer rural residencies, rural health certificates, or otherwise recognized rural curriculum in order to increase the placement of health care providers and professionals with rural health training in HRSA Health Workforce Prog rams. The agency shall report to the Committees on these efforts within 60 days of enactment of this Act. (Page 43) Action to be Taken The information contained in the Rural Health Workforce Report to Congress (RTC) will be provided in the Rural Medical Provider Shortage Appropriation RTC. HRSA anticipates the Rural Medical Provider Shortage RTC will be sent to Congress in 2021. 410 5. Health Professionals Staffing Shortages Report.\u2014The Committee recognizes the cur rent and growing shortage of primary care physicians, psychiatrists, behavioral health specialists, and geriatric medical professionals. The Committee looks forward to receiving the Health Professional Staffing Shortages report requested in House Report 116-62, which was due by June 20, 2020. (Page 44) Action to be Taken The requested report was provided to the Committees July 17, 2020. 6. National Health Service Cor ps.\u2014The Committee directs HRSA to examine the application processes and eligibility requirements for both NHSC recruits and provider locati ons, including the HPSA qualification and scoring. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report, as directed i n House Report 116-62, with recommendations on how the NHSC program, including the HPSA application and scoring process, may be modified to increase recruitment and field strength as well as diversify provider sites on the roles of Department agencies in addressing gaps in maternal mental health, within 60 days of enactment of this Act. (Page 44) Action to be Taken The requested report was p rovided to the Committees July 22, 2020. 7. Centers of Excellence. \u2014The Committee notes that COEs disproportionately educate health professionals from minority and underserved backgrounds and address the need for a diverse and culturally competent American he althcare workforce. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report requested in House Report 116-32 on achievements and challenges faced by COEs and the contribution COEs make to workforce development. (Page 45) Action to be Taken The requested repo rt was provided to the Committees June 15, 2020. 8. Health Careers Opportunity Program. \u2014The Committee notes that HCOPs assist students from minority and economically disadvantaged backgrounds navigate careers into the health professions. Given the volume of HCOP scholars that return or remain in medically underserved communities, the Committee encourages HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce to continue its improvement of the diversity and distribution of needed health care professionals through National Health Career Opportunity Program Academies and urges HRSA to rep ort updates on HCOP pipeline activity back to Congress within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. (Page 45) Action to be Taken Updates were provided to the Committees on July 1, 2020. 411 9. Oral Healt h Training and Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program.\u2014Wit hin the total for Oral Health Training, the Committee includes not less than $12,000,000 for General Dentistry Programs and not less than $12,000,000 for Pediatric Dentistry Programs. The Committee d irects HRSA to provide continuation funding for section 748 Dental Faculty Loan Program (DFLRP) grants initially awarded in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The Committee continues to support DFLRP awards with a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty supervising dental students or residents and providing clinical services in dental clinics located in dental schools, hospitals, and community-based affiliate sites. (Page 45) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA plans to provide continuation funding for the 27 Postdoctoral Training in General, Pediatric and Public Health Dentistry grantees initially awarded in FY 2020 and 6 Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry Clinician Educator Career Development awards. In FY 2021, HRSA published the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment NOFO that included a preference for pediatric dentistry faculty, funding an estimated 8 awards. HRSA will provide full continuation funding for 10 DFLRP grantees initially awarded in FY 2017 and 11 DFLRP grantees awarded in FY 2018. HRSA also published the Primary Care Faculty Career Development NOF O and will have 1 awardee. In FY 2022, HRSA anticipates funding 15 awards in the Predoctoral Training in General, Pediatric and Public Health Dentistry and Dental Hygiene, 8 awards in the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program, 8 awards in the Primary Care Dental Faculty Development Program and 32 awards in the Grants to States to Support Oral Health Workforce Activities. 10. AHEC Oral Health Projects. \u2014The Committee encourages HRSA to support AHEC oral h ealth projects that establish primary points of service a nd address the need to help patients find treatment outside of hospital emergency rooms. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with programs that have already been initiated by some State dental associations to refer emergency room patients to dental networks. (Page 45) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA will continue to support 48 Area Health Education Centers (AHEC), originally funded in 2017. A portion of this funding will assist grantees in the ir efforts to expand oral health projects. AHEC awards w ill allow grantees to continue to collaborate with community -based organizations to expand access to oral health care, including state dental associations, community health centers, and state offices of rural health. In addition, AHEC grantees will utiliz e funding to increase their expansion of continuing education opportunities for practicing oral health care professionals and expand rural/underserved interprofessional experiential clinical training opportunities. The funding also allows AHECs to enhance community health worker trainings focused on preventing oral disease, promoting healthy behaviors, developing self- management goals, and improving access to care for diverse and underserved patient populations. 11. Graduate Psychology Education.\u2014Within the total for MBHET, the Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted 412 level and the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for the interprofessional Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program to support health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. In addressing the opioid epidemic, the Committee recognizes the growing need for highly trained mental and behavioral health professionals to deliver evidence- based behavioral interventions for pain management. The Committee encourages HRSA to help integrate health service psychology trainees at FQHCs. (Page 46) Action to be Taken HRSA provided supplemental funding to the Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) programs in FY 2021. The supplement helps integrate health service psychology trainees in FQHCs by providing training to existing and potential partnering HRSA-supported Healt h Center sites on the utilization of evidence-based pain management interventions for the prevention and treatment of OUD and other SUD and its relationship with social determinants of health. 12. BHWET Support in Rural Settings. \u2014The Committee is concerned ab out the utilization of BHWET programs by rural residents and in rural areas. In the 2017-2018 academic year, only 27 percent of BHWET trainees were from rural areas, 25 percent of BHWET clinical sites were located in rural settings, and 20 percent of BHWET trainees were receiving training in rural areas. The Committee encourages HRSA to increase the number of trainees from rural areas, clinical sites located in rural areas, and trainees receiving training in rural areas. The Committee directs HRSA to update the Committee on such efforts within 180 days of enactment of this Act. (Page 46) Action to be Taken HRSA competed the BHWET Pro and BHWET Para programs in FY 2021. Both programs included a funding priority for applications that supported rural or underserved communities. HRSA will provide an update to Congress once those awards are made. 13. Peer Support Specialists in the Opioid Use Disorder Workforce. \u2014Within the total for BHWET, the Committee includes $15,000,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to fund training, internships, and national certification for mental health and substance abuse peer support specialists to create an advanced peer workforce prepared to work in clinical settings. The Committee further recommends that consideration should be given to community -based experiential training for students focusing on veterans, first responders, or marginalized populations. (Page 46) Action to be Taken In FY 2 021, HRSA competed the BHWET Paraprofessional program. This program focuses on increasing the number of peer support specialist and other behavioral health related paraprofessionals receiving training in behavioral health including but not limited to OUD and other SUD prevention and treatment. 413 14. Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Demonstration. \u2014The Committee remains concerned by the lack of pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry expertise. Currently, there are insufficient opportunities to effectively train a robust mental health and substance use disorder workforce. Only 75 of the nation's 179 accredited medical schools offer addiction medicine fellowships, and only one program focuses on fellowship opportunit ies for pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. This gap is even more troubling given that the onset of mental health disorders and substance use disorders are most likely to occur at a young age. Substance use disorders prevent children and adolescents from reaching their full potential and are antecedent to addiction in adulthood, and it is evident that our nation is not equipped to support this population. Therefore, the Committee strongly encourages HRSA to include an adequ ate number of funding awards to fellowship programs focused on increasing the number of board- certified pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry subspecialists. (Page 47) Action to be Taken In FY 2022, HRSA anticipates making $24 million in continuing awards for the Addiction Medicine Fellowship (AMF) program, which will increase the number of board certified addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry specialists working in underserved, community- based settings that integrate primary care with mental health disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) prevention and treatment services. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, HRSA will also fund the Integrated Substance Use Disorder Training Program (ISTP) to expand the number of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, and social workers trained to provide mental health and SUD services in underserved community- based settings that integrate primary care and mental health and SUD services. 15. Nurse Practitioner Option al Fellowship Program.\u2014The Committee provi des $5,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to make grants to establish or expand optional community -based nurse practitioner fellowship programs that are accredited for practicin g postgraduate nurse practitioners (NPs) in primary care or behavioral health. The Committee directs HRSA to give preference to FQHCs, as defined by section 1861(aa)(4) of the Social Security Act. (Page 47) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA plans to provide continuation funding for the 10 Advanced Nursing Education Nurse Practitioner Residency Integration Program (ANE- NPRIP) grantees initially awarded in FY 2020. HRSA published the ANE- NPRIP NOFO with the goal o f preparing new primary care or behavioral health nurse practitioners (NPs) to work in integrated, community-based settings. The NOFO included a preference for service to rural and underserved populations, and Federally Qualified Health Centers; and is ai med at the expansion and/or enhancement of existing 12-month NP residency programs in primary care or behavioral health and in an integrated, community-based setting. The NP Residency Programs grant recipients must be accredited or in the accreditation pr ocess. For this program, HRSA received 15 Applications, planned for 5 awards, but was able to 414 make 10 awards. Out of the 10 awards, 5 grantees are FQHCs (50%) and 3 of the grantees partner with FQHCs (30%). One of the 10 grantees is mainly focused on serving rural areas, while 3 of the 10 awardees are partnered with rural health clinics. 16. Experiential Learning Opportunities. \u2014Within the total for NEPQR, the Committee includes not less than $2,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for competitive grants to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. The Committee encourages HRSA to support qualifying nurse education training programs at community colleges throughout the country. The Committee directs HRSA to ensure that these grants include as an allowable use the purchase of simulation training equipment. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to grantees located in a health professiona l shortage area in a State with an age adjusted high burden of stroke, heart disease, and obesity, and to prioritize submissions that support high poverty rate communities. (Page 48) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA plans to provide new grant funding to an estimated 11 awards using the rank order list from the FY 2020 NEPQR-SET competition. HRSA published the NEPQR -SET NOFO with the goal to enhance nurse education and strengthen the nursing workforce through the expansion of experiential learning opportunities. This includes using simulation -based technology, including equipment, to advance the health of patients, families, and communities in rural and medically underserved areas experiencing diseases and condi tions that affect public health s uch as: high burden of stroke, heart disease, behavioral and mental health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and/or obesity. This program strengthens the capacity of undergraduate public health nursing students to address the complex health care needs of those living in rural and medically underserved areas. 17. Experiential Learning Opportunities. \u2014 The Committee recommends $55,000,000, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $55,000,000 above the fiscal year 2021 budget request, to support colleges of medicine at public universities located in the top quintile of States projected to have a primary care provider shortage. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applications from universities located in State s with the greatest number of Fed erally -recognized Tribes. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to applications from public universities with a demonstrated public-private partnership. (Page 48) Action to be Taken In accordance with the final appropriations, in FY 2021 HRSA plans to provide supplemental funding in the amount of $50,000,000 to the 10 recipients. There are two cohorts of five recipients each from FY 2019 and FY 2020. The amount of supplemental funding for each recipient will result in every recipient bei ng awarded the same total grant amount from FY 2019 through FY 2021 provided the recipients can justify the expenditure of the funds. The supplemental award amount is subject to a matching requirement of non-Federal funds not less than 10 percent of the t otal amount of Federal 415 funds provided in the grant to such recipient. The program is designed to prepare and encourage medical students who are training in the most underserved states to choose residencies and careers in primary care that serve tribal com munities, rural communities, and/or medically underserved communities after they graduate. 18. H eredit ary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). \u2014In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the committee provided $200,000 to CDC to support a collabora tive pilot model that enables up to three existing Federally- funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) to serve as specialty centers for the evaluation and management of HHT. If proven effective, these joint HTC -HHT Centers have the potential to provide cr itical diagnostic and treatment services to both hemophilia and HHT populations. The Committee encourages HRSA to work closely with CDC and stakeholder organizations to track the progress of this pilot initiative for potential replication. (Page 49) Actio n to be Taken HRSA will con tinue to coordinate with stakeholder organizations on care for patients with hemophilia and related blood or clotting disorders and connect with CDC to learn about the progress and results of the HTC-HHT pilot model. 19. Maternal, I nfant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.\u2014The Committee recognizes that good oral health is an important component for improving the health and well-being of children and families. The Committee encourages HRSA to explore opportunities to integrate oral health in the agency' s Home Visiting Program and provide the home visitors with the training to become a Community Dental Health Coordinator. The Committee also encourages HRSA to work with oral health initiatives such as Community Dental Health Coordinators that have already been initiated by dental organizations to provide dental education, community-based prevention, care coordination, and patient navigation to children and vulnerable families. (Page 49) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA continues to integrate oral health into the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program by requiring awardees to establish appropriate linkages and referral networks to community resources as specified in statute. HRSA has initiated collection of additional data on whether children enrolled in home visiting programs have a usual source of dental care by 12 months of age. In FY 2020, approximately 67 percent of children enrolled in home visiting had a usual source of dental care. HRSA continu es to promote linkages with Community Dental Health Coordinators to MIECHV awardees, where available, and to the extent practical. 20. State Oral Health Programs. \u2014The Committee continues to include $250,000 to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of integrating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should model the core clinical oral health competencies for non- dental providers that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report Integration of Oral Health and P rimary Care Practice. The C ommittee 416 encourages the Chief Dental Officer to continue to direct the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of these projects. (Page 50) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, with consultation/direction from HRSA's Chief D ental Officer, HRSA will continue support for the National Maternal and Child Center for Oral Health Systems Integration and Improvement program (COHSII) for the Partnership for Integrating Oral Health Care into Primary Care (PIOHCPC) project with $250,000 in funding. This f unding supports the continued provision of technical assistance, training, and other support to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of oral health and primary care practice integration, modelled after the 2014 HRSA report, Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice. 21. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Set -Aside. \u2014Recognizing that as many as one in 20 school-age children are affected by fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), yet few have access to essential diagnostic and mult idisciplinary services, the Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2020 level for HRSA to continue activities funded by the FAS set -aside. The Committee also encourages HRSA to consider support for an established FASD -specific national network to improve the well-being of children and families with FASD. (Page 50) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA will continue to support the SAFEST Choice Learning Collaborative for the Supporting Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Screening and Intervention Progr am at the fiscal year 2020 enacted level. The aim of this three-year program is to reduce the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure and improve outcomes in children with suspected or diagnosed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). SAFEST Choice expan ds national access to essential services by providing education, training, and technical assistance to multidisciplinary healthcare teams in community settings located in high- risk areas. Teams receive education and training on screenin g, diagnosis, and treatment for pregnant women and children with suspected or diagnosed fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. 22. Infant -Toddler Court Teams. \u2014The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, for the fourth year of a cooperative agreement to support research -based infant -toddler court teams to change child welfare practices to improve well-being for infants, toddlers, and their families. The Committee encourages HRSA to use these funds to: (1) build upon the work of sites established o r currently supported through the Infant-Toddler Court Program, including by providing training, technical assistance, and additional support for such court teams' efforts across the country; and (2) plan and support additional infant-toddler court teams. (Page 51) Action to be Taken 417 In FY 2021, HRSA will support the fourth year of the Infant Toddler Court Program (ITCP) to support research-based infant- toddler court teams to change child welfare practices to improve well -being for infants, toddlers, and t heir families. The program is sustaining the work of sites already established; developing resources and supports for sites interested in starting an infant-toddler court team; and building the evidence regarding effective infant -toddle r court team impleme ntation and outcomes for infants, toddlers, and their families. 23. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID). \u2014Within the total amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $3,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2020 enacted level, to support wider implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening and follow-up for SCID and other newborn screening disorders. The Committee applauds HRSA's ongoing work to ensure screening of all newborns for Severe Combined Immune Defici ency (SCID), including through initiatives that help parents of newborns diagnosed with SCID understand the disease and treatment options and to navigate the path forward. The Committee encourages HRSA to support efforts to develop telehealth approaches to link families in ru ral and underserved communities with support and resources, engage providers in education or training related to SCID, and establish mechanisms to obtain long-term outcomes information on infants with SCID through newborn screening. (Pa ge 53) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA will continue to support newborn screening and follow-up for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and other newborn screening disorders. The program works to ensure that newborns and children identified through newborn screenin g with SCID or other newborn screening disorders achieve the best possible outcomes. The program expands the ability of state public health agencies to provide screening, counseling and services to these newborns and children. The program also supports education, training and collaboration with clinicians, public health agencies and families to create a system of care that can assess and coordinate follow -up and treatment of SCID and other newborn screening disorders. Grantees create follow-up models that provide evidence-based/informed, condition- specific treatments and age- appropriate preventive care for infants and children with SCID or other newborn screening disorders, including using telehealth to link rural and medically underserved populations to knowledgeable clinicians, support, and resources. In addition, grantees collect and analyze long -term follow -up data to evaluate outcomes on infants with SCID and other newborn screening disorders. 24. Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Ut ilization. \u2014The Committee supports the goal of significantly increasing kidney transplants, established by the President's Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health, and supports efforts to establish objective outcome measures for Organ Procuremen t Organizations (OPO) as well as efforts to decertify underperforming OPOs at the conclusion of the current contract cycles. The Committee encourages HHS and HRSA to monitor transplant center listing and acceptance practices as recorded w ith the Organ and Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), and to make publicly available its 418 findings based on one calendar year of data. The listed screening criteria for each patient receiving an organ offer should be compared to center refusals codes for those organs not accepted for transplant by the patient's transplant center. Further, the utilization rates by center should be reported for all organ offers and for both the brain dead and donation after circulatory death subcategories. The Comm ittee supports HHS 's Request for Information for the technology system over which these organ offers are facilitated and encourages HHS to promote competition for this contract. (Page 55) Action to be Taken HRSA fully supports all goals associated with increasing kidney transplants and establishing objective outcome measures for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs). HRSA will also take the Committee's recommendations under advisement to maximize organ recovery and increase transplants performed in the U.S. 25. Office of Pha rmacy Af fairs. \u2014 The Committee acknowledges the request for additional regulatory authority and notes that HRSA already has existing oversight authority that allows the agency to conduct audits of stakeholders who participate in the progra m to ensure compliance. The Committee recognizes that HRSA has used this authority to conduct 1,300 audits of covered entities, but only 20 audits of manufacturers. The Committee is concerned that HRSA is not using their existing oversight authority to pursue balanced overs ight of both providers and drug manufacturers. We encourage HRSA to use its existing oversight authority to pursue more balanced oversight of both providers and manufacturers to ensure compliance and integrity of the 340B program. (Page 56) Action to be Taken HRSA uses its authority, to the fullest extent, to implement a systematic approach to 340B Program integrity for both covered entities and manufacturers. Manufacturer oversight has always been a focus for HRSA; however it is a narrow focus as manufact urers only have one core statutory obligation in the 340B Program - to offer the 340B ceiling price pursuant to section 340B(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act. HRSA began conducting manufacturer audits in FY 2015. These audits are conducted randomly by selecting manufacturers from a list generated by all signed Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreements (PPAs), and conducts targeted audits in instances where there are potential compliance issues. The percentage of audits conducted annually for manufacturers is 0.7 percent (5/700) and for covered entities is 1.5 percent (200/12670). As of April 9, 2021, HRSA had finalized 26 manufacturer audits and is on track to finalize five additional manufacturer audits for FY 2021. Each fiscal year, HRSA outlines the number of audits of both covered entities and manufacturers based on budgetary constraints. Finalized manufacturer audits are posted on the HRSA website. In addition, HRSA has issued final rules on all three of the areas where HRSA has exist ing regulatory authority (ceiling price calculation, civil monetary penalties for manufacturers, and establishing an alternative dispute resolution process). In January 419 2017, HRSA issued a final rule in the Federal Register (82 F R 1210 (January 5, 2017)) on defined standards on the methodology for the calculation of 340B ceiling prices and the imposition of civil monetary penalties for manufacturers who knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2020, HRSA issued a final rule in the Federal Register finalizing the ADR process. The rule became effective on January 14, 2021. While HRSA continues to conduct audits of covered entities and manufacturers, HRSA does not have regula tory authority to enforce all of the compliance elements that it evaluates during its audits unless there is a clear tie to the statute. There is past litigation that has impacted HRSA's authority, in addition to multiple, ongoing lawsuits (by covered ent ities and manufacturers) that challenge HRSA's authority to establish and enforce program requirements. While HRSA is unable to comment on ongoing litigation, HRSA's limited authority has impacted the ability to enforce compliance to its fullest, and as a result, reported audit findings have decreased. Without comprehensive regulatory authority, HRSA is unable to develop enforceable policy that ensures clarity in program requirements across all the interdependent aspects of the 340B Program. Therefore, HRSA has requested regulatory authority each year since FY 2017. Binding and enforceable regulations for all aspects of the 340B Program would provide HRSA the ability to more clearly define and enforce policy and would significantly strengthen HRSA's oversight of the Program. These reforms would help ensure low income and uninsured patients benefit from the Program, as intended, and strengthen program integrity and oversight activities. HRSA would also address issues raised by various stakeholders to as sist covered entities and manufacturers in their ability to satisfy 340B Program expectations and where oversight needs to be enhanced. 26. GAO Study on Obstetrics (OB) Closures. \u2014According to the Rural Health Research Gateway, between 2004 and 2014, 179 rural counties lost hospital- based OB services. The Committee directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report on ways to improve access to obstetrics care in rural areas and prevent OB unit hospital closures in rural areas. (Page 57) Action to be Taken HRSA will cooperate with GAO as they draft a report on ways to improve access to obstetrics care in rural areas and prevent OB unit hospital closures in rural ar eas. 27. Community Health Workers. \u2014The Committee recognizes the importance of community health workers, particularly in rural and underserved areas, to help address persistent health issues tied to social determinants of health. The Committee is aware that many States would like to better incorporate community health workers into t heir systems, but there is currently a lack of a unified training and certification resource available to them. The Committee encourages HRSA to consider supporting a national center, based at an academic medical center with expertise in integrating commun ity health workers into health systems, to assist States and providers through workshops, consultations, certifications and continuing education credits. (Page 57) 420 Action to be Taken Community health workers (CHWs) are the cornerstone of many HRSA rural community -based programs. HRSA will consider ways to support research with a focus on CHWs working in rural and underserved areas. 28. Southwest States Rural Development Network G rant Program.\u2014The Committee encourages HRSA to consider funding a new Southwest S tates Rural Development Network Grant Program, within the Southwest Border Region as defined by 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 15732, to promote the development of integrated health care networks in order to: (1) achieve efficiencies; (2) expand access to, coordinate, and im prove the quality of essential health care services; and (3) strengthen the rural health care system as a whole. The Committee also encourages HRSA to consider a pilot program to help underserved rural communities in the region identify and better address their health care needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial and operational performance. (Page 57) Action to be Taken In FY 2021, HRSA will continue to support the needs of rural areas in the Southwest through existing competitive pr ograms funded by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy. 29. Rural Residency Planning and Development Program.\u2014The Committee commends the Office of Rural Health Policy for its efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Tracks (RTTs). The Committee encourages HRSA to expand the current program to include RTTs in obstetrics and gynecology. Women in rural communities are more likely to begin prenatal care late and are more likely to experience maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. The expansion of this program would align with the agency's goals of improving maternal health outcomes and eliminating preventable maternal mortality. (Page 59) Action to be Taken HRSA recognizes the need for Rural Training Tracks in obstetrics and gynecology. Studies show that health care providers who train in rura l areas are more likely to practice in rural areas. In FY 2019, HRSA funded the Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) program and made 27 awards to organizations across 21 states to develop newly accredited, sustainable rural residency programs i n family medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry. In FY 2020 HRSA issued a new funding opportunity soliciting applications to start residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, public health and general preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. From this competition, HRSA made 11 awards to organizations across 10 states to develop new rural residency programs. HRSA plans to make at least another 8 awards in FY 2021. 30. Chief Dental Officer. \u2014The Committee is pleased that HRSA has restored the position of Chief Dental Officer (CDO) and looks forward to learning how the agency has ensured 421 that the CDO is functioning at an executive level authority with resources and staff to oversee and lead all oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA. The Committee requests an update by February 2021 on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative with executive level authority on oral health issues to international, national, State and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. (Page 60) Actio n to be Taken The CDO position at HRSA is responsible for: coordinating oral health activities across HRSA programs and advising HRSA oral health priorities throughout the various programs in the agency. Over the past year, specific activities have include d: reviewing and advising on proposed oral health- related investments across the agency; representing the agency at professional conferences and meetings; providing presentations on the agency's oral health portfolio and key topics of interest to a variety of stakeholders; delivering a webinar for HRSA health centers to increase awareness of the risks associated with HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and Oral and Ph aryngeal Cancer; and developing and directing a cross-agency project to improve the oral health lit eracy of HRSA constituent populations. 31. Oral Health Literacy. \u2014The Committee includes $300,000 to continue the development of an oral health awareness and edu cation campaign across relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program, Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health. The Committee directs HRSA to identify oral health literacy strategies th at are evidence-based and focused on oral healthcare prevention and education, including prevention of oral disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer.

FY 2022 Authorization ............................................................................................ .......Indefinite Allocation Method ................................................................................................................... Other Program Description and Accomplishments Serving as an alternative to the traditional tort system, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Progra m (VICP ) compensates individuals, or families of individuals, who have been injured by vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration to children or pregnant women. HRSA administers the VICP, and th e Depar tment of Justice (DOJ) represents HHS in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Court), which ultimately decides to provide compensation or dismiss claims. HRSA receives claims requesting compensation for vaccine injuries or deaths, which the petitione r has served against the HHS Secretary and filed with the Court. HRSA medical officers with special expertise in pediatrics and adult medicine review these claims, which include supporting documentation. HRSA also contracts with health care professionals for cl aim reviews and with other medical specialists to provide independent claim reviews and to testify in Court. HRSA medical officers develop preliminary recommendations regarding petitioner eligibility for compensation, and DOJ incorporates these recommendations in Rule 4(b) reports submitted to the Court. Lastly, HRSA processes payments to petitioners and their attorneys based on judgments entered by the Court. HRSA also publishes notices in the Federal Register listing each claim received and prom ulgates regulations to modify the Vaccine Injury Table that lists injuries and/or conditions associated with covered vaccines. HRSA provides administrative support to the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV), which is responsible for advising the HHS Secretary on issues related to VICP operations. The ACCV is composed of nine voting members, including 430 healthcare professionals, attorneys, and parents or legal representatives of children who have suffered vaccine-related injuries or death, and non-voting HHS officials. Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund Congress annually appropriates funding from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund) for VICP administration and for compensating vaccine-related injury or death claims for covered vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988. The Trust Fund has a current balance of over $3.9 billion. The Department of Treasury maintains the Trust Fund through a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration to children or pregnant women. The excise tax applies to each disease prevented per vaccine dose. For example, influenza vaccine is taxed $0.75 because it prevents one disease while measles - mumps-rubella vaccine, which prevents three diseases, is taxed $2.25. The Department of Treasury collects the excise taxes and manages Trust Fund investments. Pe titioners include individuals, parents, or legal representatives/estates applying on behalf of others. Table 1 shows number of petitioners awarded comp ensation and vaccine injury compensation provided over the last five years. Table 1. Growth in Families and Individuals Receiving Compensation Fiscal Year No. of Petitioners Compensation ($ in millions) 2016 689 $253 VICP Administration VI CP claims have tripled from 386 claims filed in FY 2011 to 1,191 claims filed in FY 2020. In FY 2021 as of March, 1,577 claims had already been filed. If this trend continues, about 2,200 claims will be filed by the end of FY 2021 resulting in an 85 percent increase in claims filed since the end of FY 2020. During the same period, administrative funding has increased by only 72 percent from $6.5 million to $11.2 million, as shown in Table 2. In FY 2017, H RSA began a backlog of vaccine injury claims awaiting medical review since the volume of claims exceeded resources available to conduct medical reviews. The cumulative claims backlog was 966 claims at the end of FY 2020. Even though the HRSA funding to administer the VICP increased by $1 million from $10.2 in FY 2020 to $11.2 million in FY 2021, the backlog is expected to grow to nearly 2,100 by the end of FY 2021, resulting in delays in compensating petitioners since claims are on the waiting list for ab out 14 months pending review. 431 Tabl e 2. 10- Year Trend in Number of Claims Filed and Administrative Costs (dollars in millions) Fiscal Year Number of Claims Filed Administrative Funding 2011 386 $6.50 2012 401 $6.50 2013 504 $6.50 of 800 claims in January 2021 due to expected implementation of the final rule p roposed to remove Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) Funding History - VICP Claims Compensation FY VICP Claims Compensation - The FY 2022 Budget Request for the VICP Claims Compensation program of $316.8 million is $6.2 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This r equest will ensure adequate funds are available to compensate petitioners and pay their attorneys' fees and 432 costs. These funds wi ll also allow the VICP to continue to meet its zero percent target for the percentage of eligible claimants who opt to reject awards and elect to pursue civil action. Prior to the existence of the VICP, civil actions against vaccine manufacturers threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates. VICP Administration - The FY 2022 Budget Request for the VICP Administration program of $16.2 million is $5 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This request will support administrative expe nses to process approximately 1,480 claims, including costs associated with hiring four additional medical review staff, an adequate number of contractors to conduct medical reviews to reduce the backlog of claims, and medical experts for reviews and exper t testimony to the Court. The backlog will be reduced from approximately 2,066 claims at the end of FY 2021 to about 1,886 claims by the end of FY 2022. In addi tion, the VICP will continue to provide professional and administrative support to the ACCV, p rocess compensation awards, maintain necessary records securely, and inform the public of the availability of the VICP. The funding request also covers costs associated with the claims award process, follow -up performance reviews, and information technology and other program support costs.

Other Pro gram Description and Accomplishments The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) provides benefits to individuals who are seriously injured as a result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. A countermeasure is a vaccination, medication, device, or other item recommended to diagnose, prevent or treat a declared pandemic, epidemic or security threat. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) authorizes the CICP to provide medical and lost employment income benefits to certain individuals or e states of individuals who sustain a covered serious physical injury as the direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures. The CICP also provides death benefits to certain survivors of eligible deceased injured countermeasure recipients. The countermeasures covered by CICP are identified in PREP Act declaration s. Since October 2009, CICP has received funding from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF). Since October 2009, the CICP has received 804 claim from individuals who allege injuries from covered countermeasures. Of the 804 claims, 409 were ineligible for compensation, 356 cases are pending review, and 39 claims were eligible for compensation. Of the 39, 29 were compensated, totaling more than $6 million. Ten claims did not receive compensation because they did not have any compensable expenses or losses. 439 Funding History FY Amount FY 2018 --- FY 2019 --- Budget Request of $5.0 million is $5 .0 million above the FY 2021 Enacted level. This r equest will be used to compensate eligible individuals for injuries and deaths directly resulting from the use of covered countermeasures, including non- COVID -19 and COVID-19 claims. It will also support administrative costs asso ciated with reviewing medical claims and determining compensation eligibility. In addition, the CICP funds will support contract costs required to operate and maintain the CICP information system and the contracting of medical experts to review complex ca ses. "}
