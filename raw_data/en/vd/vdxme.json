An oxymel is an age-old elixir used to boost immunity and usually includes honey, [apple](/tag/apple/) cider vinegar and various herbs or spices. Ingredients 1 bulb of garlic, peeled and crushed 4 cups of filtered water or organic chicken broth (I recommend the brand Inglewood Chicken) \u00bc cup organic raw honey or Manuka honey (I recommend the brand Activist) \u00bc cup good quality apple cider vinegar (I recommend the brand Bragg's) 2-3 cm piece ginger, peeled and grated Method Boil the garlic and ginger in water or broth for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add honey and apple cider vinegar. Consume half to one third of a glass two to three times daily. Can be stored in a jar in the fridge for up to two weeks. A few other, rather simple remedies you can include throughout the day to boost immunity: Upon rising, consume a cup of boiled water with a slice of lemon and a teaspoon of Manuka honey. With lunch, consume 1 cup of organic chicken broth with a squeeze of lemon and black pepper Before bed, consume a cup of organic Chamomile or Lemon Balm tea to settle your nerves. Lemon Balm is also anti-viral! Aromatherapy for immunity [Essential oils](https://www.russh.com/get-focused/) are nature's answer to antibacterial, antiviral and antimicrobial substances. When used correctly and under guidance, they have a wide variety of applications. To help reduce mucosal inflammation and soothe the airways, try doing a face steam with one or two of the following essential oils: eucalyptus, tea tree, spruce, peppermint, lemon. To do a face steam, put about 6 glasses of boiled water in a large bowl. Place on a stable surface and add just a few drops of your choice of essential oil. Lower your head towards the bowl, keeping your face about 30cm away from the water and drape a bath towel over your head and the bowl. Steam can be very hot so make sure you find a distance from the water that is comfortable for you. Slowly inhale and exhale for up to 5 minutes. "}
