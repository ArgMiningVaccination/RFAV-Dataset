The biggest k iller is cardiovascular diseas e (heart disease, stroke, and atherosclerosis) which claims the lives of 2,800 Nova Scotians each year, and accounts for 36% of all deaths in the province. Cancer kills an estimated 2,400 Nova Scotians every year, accounting for 30% of all deaths in the province.1 Other chronic conditions disable many more N ova Scotians. Arthritis and rheumatism afflict 20% of Nova Scotians; 16% suffer from ood 6% have asthma.2 One-quarter of all Nova Scotians have a long-term limitation or handicap that in terferes with their ac tivity at home, school, or work - the highest rate of ac tivity limitation in the country.3 Not surprisingly, Nova Scotians also have the country's highest repor ted use of disability days.4 Chronic conditions are becoming increasingly common.5 Compared to other Canadians, Nova Scotians ha ve particularly high rates of chronic illness. Nova Scotia has the country's highest rate of deaths from cancer and from respiratory disease; and the highest rate of arthritis and rheumatis m in Canada. The province has the second highest rate of circulatory deaths and of diabetes in the country, and the s econd highest psychiatric hospitalization rate.6 Medical care costs for people with chronic di seases account for 60% of total medical care expenditures, or $1.2 billion a year in Nova Scotia.7 Because of the debilitating nature of these illnesses, and because cancer and heart disease kill so many at an early age, the indirect costs of chronic illness due to productiv ity losses are particularly high. Premature death due to cancer alone costs the Nova Scotia economy $427 million each year, while musculoskeletal disorders like arthritis and osteoporosis cost the econom y $307 million due to disability.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX iii Measuring Sustainable Developmentdiseases cost Nova Scotia more than half a bil lion dollars a year in pr oductivity losses (all costs in 2001$).8 Combining direct medical costs ($1.24 billion) and indirect productivity losses ($1.79 billion), the total economic burden of seven types of ch ronic illness (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory ailments, diabetes, musculoskeletal di sorders, diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, and mental illness), exceeds $3.0 billion a year. These seven chronic diseases account for 78% of productivity losses du e to premature death, 76% of productivity losses due to disability, and nearly two-thir ds of the total economic burden of illness in Nova Scotia, including both direct a nd indirect costs. They cost the province the equivalent of 13% of provincial GDP annually. A ll categories of chronic disease combined are estimated to account for 70% of the total economic burden of illness in Nova Scotia. Cardiovascular diseases alone cost Nova Scotia nearly $960 million a year in direct and indirect costs, cancer costs another $580 million, and arth ritis and osteoporosis add another $460 million in costs. It is estimated that 40% of chr onic illness can be prevented. Epid emiological studies indicate that 25% of all medical costs (or nearly half a billion dollars a year in Nova Sc otia) are attributable to a small number of excess risk factors lik e smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition.9 Socioeconomic causes of chronic illness, such as poverty, inequality, and poor education, and environmental causes such as exposure to toxi c pollutants, are also modifiable. Low-income women under the age of 40 are 62% more likely to be hospitalized than higher income women; over the age of 40, they are 92% more likely to be hospitalized. In Nova Scotia, those without a high school diploma use 49% more physician servi ces than those with a BA, while low income groups use 43% more physician services than higher income groups. Excess physician use due to educational inequality costs the NS hea lth care system $42.2 million a year; excess physician use due to income inequality costs $27.5 million a year. Low income groups have higher rates of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and cardiovascular risk. Nova Scotia could avoid an estimated 200 deaths and save $214 million per year if all Nova Scotians were as heart healthy as higher income groups This report indicates that Nova Scotia's high rates of chronic illness can be reduced through concerted health promotion initiatives that re duce risk behaviours and conditions. The evidence demonstrates that the province's escalating hea lth care costs can be significantly lowered by improving the health of the population and ther eby reducing the need and demand for medical care. 8 Productivity cost estimates are from Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness 1998, Ottawa, 2002 (scheduled for release soon.) 9 Goetzel, Ron, (ed.), \"The Financial Impact of Health Promotion,\" American Journal of Health Promotion 15 (5), May/June, 2001.

Public health improvements, social reforms, and technological advances have sharply reduced the incidence of acute disease and infant mortality in the last hundred years, and thereby substantially increased average life expectancy at birth. In 1900, the major causes of death were tuberculos is, dysentery, and diphth eria, and average life expectancy at birth was less than 50. Today Nova Scotians can expect to live to 78; deaths from the deadly infectious di seases of the early 20th century are extremely rare; smallpox has been eradicated, and measles nearly eliminated through immunization.10 At the same time, the incidence of chronic disease has increased shar ply during the same period, with coronary heart disease surpassing infectious dise ases in the 1930s as the major cau se of death in Canada and the U.S. The second half of the 20th century, in turn, saw a sharp increase in cancer incidence up to the early 1990s, while deaths from cardi ovascular disease fell by nearly half.11 Yet despite the marked changes in the nature of illness and primary cau ses of death in 1900 and 2000, there is a remarkable similarity that provide s reason for optimism, and that is the primary motivation behind this report. C ontrol of the infectious diseases that afflicted Canadians one hundred years ago had far less to do with any break-through medical cures than with interventions that tackled the precursors and so cial causes of fatal diseases. Disease outbreaks were prevented by safer and more hygienic wa ter, food, housing, and work conditions, and by immunization campaigns, even more than by medical advances. Though once epidemic innature, the acute, infectious diseases of the early 20 th century are today regarded as almost entirely preventable. Similarly, the chronic diseases th at today account for 80% of deat hs in Nova Scotia, that cause untold suffering and debilitate tens of thousands of Nova Scotians , that drain tax dollars and slow the economy, are largely preventable. By some estimates, up to 70% of premature deaths and two-thirds of the cases of chronic disabil ity are preventable and therefore unnecessary.12 An analysis in the Canadian Medi cal Association Journal more th an 30 years ago concluded that living conditions are probably far more importa nt than medical care to physical and mental health.13 Just as prevention overcame the acute, infectious diseases of the early 20th century, 10 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, September, 1999, page 324; Almer, Robert, and Donald Eddins, \"Cross-Sectional Analysis: Pr ecursors of Premature Death in the United States,\" in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, page 181. 11 Thompson, Beti, and Michael Pertschuk, \"Community Intervention and Advocacy,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 494.

Deaths and Costs Due to Chro nic Disease in Nova Scotia Four types of chronic disease now account for 74% of all deaths in Nova Scotia. Cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) and can cers together account for two-thirds of all deaths in Nova Scotia, 36% and 30% respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and chronic ai rway obstruction) accounts for another 5% of deaths in the province, and diabetes acc ounts for 3% more deaths (Table 1).15 When all illness categories are considered, estimates from the me dical literature suggest that chronic diseases account for more than 80% of all deaths and an ev en higher fraction of cases of total disability.16 Table 1 Deaths Due to Four Chronic Diseas es as Percentage of all Deaths, Nova Scotia (2000 estimates) Cause of Death Estimated # of Deaths Percent of all Deaths Cardiovascular diseases 2,800 36% Cancers 2,400 30% Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 370 5% Diabetes 230 3% Total: Four chronic diseases 5,800 74% Sources: Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians; Nova Scotia Government, Vital Statistics; Heart and Stroke Foundation, The Changing Face of Heart Disease and Stroke in Canada 2000; National CancerInstitute of Canada, Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001; CO PD and diabetes deaths extrapolated from Statistics Canada, Canada at a Glance, and Ce nters for Disease Control, Chronic Diseases and their Risk Factors. 14 Almer, Robert, and Donald Eddins, \"Cross-Sectional Analysis: Precursors of Premature Death in the United States,\" in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, page 187. 15 Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, Health Canada and Statistics Canada, Ottawa, 1999, pages 291, 318, and 287 (hereafter referenced as Health Canada, Statistical Report); Nova Scotia Department of Finance, Statistics Division, Nova Scotia Statistical Review 1999 , Halifax, December, 1999, page 10; Government of Nova Scotia, Vital Statistics, available at: http://www.gov.ns.ca/snsmr/vstat/a nnualreports/1999/table9.stm , Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, The Changing Face of Heart Disease and Stroke in Canada 2000, Ottawa, October, 1999, page 76; National Cancer Institute of Canada, Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001, Toronto, April 2001, page 24; Statistics Canada, Canada at a Glance, 2nd edition, page 7, at: http://collection.nlc-bnc. ca/100/201/301/statcan/ can_at_glance/12-581-XIE.pdf . 16 Fries, James, \"Aging, Natural Death, and the Compression of Morbidity,\" The New England Journal of Medicine 303 (3): 130-135, July 17, 1980, page 132. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 4 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentSeven categories of chronic illn ess cost the Nova Scotia health care system $750 million a year in direct costs for hospitals, physicians , and drugs alone. These illnesses are: circulatory diseases (mainly heart disease, stroke, and hypertension), cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, endocrine and related disord ers (particularly diabetes), musculoskeletal disorders (lik e arthritis and osteoporosis), diseases of the nervous system and sense organs (including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, glaucoma, catar acts, blindness and hearing loss), and mental illness (like schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders). These seven diagnostic categories account for about half of all direct health care spending on hospitals, doctors, and drugs, includ ing 46% of all hospital costs, 49% of physician services, and 59% of prescription drug expenditures.17 When other health care expenditures are added, such as costs of other institutions, home care,alternative medicine, private medi cal expenditures, and health science research, the total direct medical costs for these seven diagnostic categories are $1.23 billion annually (2001$, Table 2). Paradoxically, all these direct me dical costs are counted in the Gross Domestic Product and thus conventionally assessed as cont ributions to economic growth and prosperity. An increase in these costs is therefore mistakenly interpreted as a sign that society is \"better off.\" In the Genuine Progress Index (GPI), by contrast, the costs of illness, accidents, crime, pollution, and other liabilities are counted as costs, not gains, to th e economy. Instead, population health indicators are used in the GP I as indicators of progress, to assess whether the population is becoming healthier. Even more costly than the direct medical burde n of chronic illness is the toll that chronic illnesses take on the economy at larg e. The indirect costs of these seven categories of chronic illness alone, estimated according to the value of time lost due to disability and the discounted present value of future productivity lost due to premature death, amount to about $1.8 billion a year (2001$). This amounts to 77% of all productiv ity losses due to all illnesses combined in Nova Scotia. This high cost is due to the debilita ting nature of these par ticular chronic illnesses, and to the fact that cancer and heart disease kill so many at an early age. Combining direct medical costs ($1.23 billion) and indirect productivity losses ($1.8 billion), the total economic burden of these seven types of chronic illness exceeds $3.0 billion a year (Table 2). This amounts to nearly two-th irds of the total economic cost of illness in Nova Scotia, and 13% of the province's to tal gross domestic product. The estimates in Table 2 do not reflect the full cost s of chronic diseases to the Nova Scotia health care system. First, important categories of ch ronic illness are excluded, including all chronic digestive system disorders, including colitis, Crohn's disease, gallbladder disease, and cirrhosis of the liver. It was not possible to separate out these costs from those associated with acute and infectious digestive system illnesses such as dia rrhea and gastroenteritis (stomach flu), so all 17 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness 1998, forthcoming 2002. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 5 Measuring Sustainable Developmentdigestive system disease costs have been excluded here. All congenital and chromosomal anomalies (like Down's syndrome) are also excl uded, as are chronic skin conditions (like skin ulcers), diseases of the genitourin ary system (like chronic renal fa ilure), all blood diseases (like anemia), and conditions origin ating in the perinatal period.18 Some of the chronic conditions associated with these excluded c onditions are clearly preventable. For example, alcohol abuse causes cirrhosis of the liver. Smoking during pregnancy and poor nutrition are associated with a higher incidence of low birt h-weight babies and consequent developmental problems. Obesity is highly correlated w ith gallbladder disease: Overweight individuals are 85% more likely to have gallbladder disorders, and nearly one- quarter of all gallbladder di sease in Nova Scotia is attributable to obesity.19 Nevertheless, the costs of these and other chronic conditions are excluded from Table 2, because costs for the general diagnostic categories of wh ich they are part coul d not be broken down to separate out chronic from acute disorders. To gi ve just one illustration of the impact of these additional cost categories, the di rect and indirect costs of low birth weight babies alone would add about $36 million a year to the totals in Table 2.20 On the other hand, Table 2 somewhat overstates th e costs of chronic nervous system and sense organ disorders, because the figures in Table 2 re present the total costs for all diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, including so me acute and infectious illnesses. Although diseases like Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, glaucoma, cataracts, disorders of theconjunctiva, and conditions like blindness and hearing loss are ch ronic, the nervous system and sense organ disease category also includes some acute and infectious illnesses such as meningitis and ear infections. Nevertheless, most nervous system and sense or gan disorders are chronic, and the exclusion of other whole ca tegories of chronic illness, lik e those described above, ensures that the total estimates for chronic dise ases in Table 2 remain underestimates. Table 2 also gives the total cost s for all endocrine and related diseases, including thyroid and adrenal gland disorders, nutritional deficien cies, and metabolic and immunity disorders. According to Health Canada's Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1993 , diabetes accounts for 43.3% of the costs of all thes e endocrine and related disorders. 21 According to Katzmarzyk et al., type 2 diabetes constitutes 92.5% of all diab etes cases, and would th erefore constitute about 40% of the costs of all endo crine and rela ted disorders.22 For the purposes of this analysis, all 18 For a full classification of all diseases by ICD-9 code, an d therefore of all diagnostic categories excluded from the listings in Table 2, see: http://www.e-mds.com/services/icd9/index.html . 19 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, Table 1. 20 Cost of low birth weight extrapolated to Nova Scotia from U.S. estimates in \"Position of the American Dietetic Association: Cost-Effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 95 (1): 88-91, January, 1995, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography, Prevention and Health Promotion Branch, Ministry of Health, B.C., July, 1996, page 39. 21 Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1993, Ottawa, 1997, Table 2, page 10. 22 Katzmarzyk, Peter, Norman Gledhill, and Roy Shephard, \"The Economic Burden of Physical Inactivity in Canada,\" Canadian Medical Association Journal 163 (11), 28 November, 2000, page 1437. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 6 Measuring Sustainable Developmentendocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders, are treated as chronic diseases.23 Table 2 Cost of Chronic Illness in Nova Scotia 1998 (2001$ million) Hosp. Doctor The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming). 23 For a full listing of all endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders, see the classification of diseases according to IC D-9 codes, available at: http://www.e-mds.com/icd9/240-279/index.html . 24 Hospital, physician, drug, and research costs are curr ently available for Nova Scotia by diagnostic category. However, at the present time, other direct health care costs in Nova Scotia, including private spending for other institutions and home care, are available only for all illn ess categories combined. These additional direct costs are therefore extrapolated here for the separate diagnostic categories, on the assumption that they occupy the same proportion of total direct health care costs for each diag nostic category separately as they do for all diagnostic categories combined. A more accurate breakdown of \"other direct costs\" by diagnostic category should be available later this year, when the electronic version of The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 is released. In the meantime, the absence of direct informat ion for this column will not substantially impact the total results, since the figures given here do reflect the actual proportional breakdown for all diagnostic categories for the province. 25 \"Total\" refers to hospital, physician, and drug costs plus other medical expenses, health science research, privately funded medical expenses, home care, and costs of other institutions. 26 These cost estimates are confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma only, and do not include costs of pneumonia, influenza and other acute respiratory infections. 27 This row gives the total for all endocrine and related di seases, including thyroid and adrenal disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and other metabolic and immunity disorders. According to Health Canada's Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1993, Ottawa, 1997, Table 2, page 10, diabetes accounts for 43.3% of all these endocrine-related disorders. According to Katzmarzyk, Peter, Norman Gledhill, and Roy Shephard, \"The Economic Burden of Physical Inactivity in Canada, Canadian Medical Association Journal 163 (11), 28 November, 2000, page 1437, type 2 diabetes constitutes 92.5% of all diabetes cases, and would therefore constitute 40% of all endocrine-related disorders. For the purposes of this analysis, all endocr ine and related diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and other metabolic and immunity disorders, are treated as chronic diseases. 28 Because it is not possible to separate out costs by different categories of nerv ous system and sense organ disorders, these figures represent the total costs for all diseases of the nervous system and sense organs. Although diseases like Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, glaucoma, cataracts, and disorders of the conjunctiva are chronic, as are conditions like blindness and hearing loss, the nervous system and sense organ category also includes some acute and infectious diseases like meningitis and ea r infections. These nervous system/sense organ disease costs therefore somewhat overstate the particular costs for chronic illness. Nevertheless, the exclusion of other categories of chronic illness (including all digestive disord ers like colitis, Crohn's disease, and cirrhosis of the liver, plus chronic conditions related to the skin, blood, and gen itourinary systems, and all co ngenital anomalies) ensures that the total estimates for chronic dis eases in Table 2 remain underestimates. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 7 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentThe costs in Table 2 are likely to be underestimates for another reason, aside from exclusion of certain conditions. There are several proximate cau ses of illness and death that stem directly from chronic illnesses, but are no t attributed in the official stat istics to the diagnostic categories listed in Table 2, because death ce rtificates and hospital records frequently list immediate rather than underlying conditions. For example, uninten tional falls account for 67% of all hospital days due to injury, with seniors accoun ting for nearly half of all lowe r limb fractures. Yet these costs are generally attributed to the \"injury\" diagnostic category ra ther than to the osteoporosis that may be their underlying cause. Similarly, complications due to diabetes, such as blindness, kidney failure, disorders of the pancreas, and infections involving the soft tissues and bone of the face, skull, and brain, may not be attributed to diabetes in the cost classification. Some of these costs may therefore be excluded from the cost estimates in Table 2. Kidney fail ure for example is reported as a genitourinary disorder, and is therefore not accounted for in the cost estimates. The indirect costs and productivity losses due to premature mortality resu lting from diabetes are particularly likely to be underestimated. Because it so often leads to other complicati ons and illnesses, diabetes is generally under-reported on death cer tificates. In short, the listi ng of costs by diagnostic category may ascribe costs to the most immediate manife station of an underlying chronic condition rather than attributing them to the chronic disease itself. When these additional categories and costs of ch ronic illness are added to the seven diagnostic categories in Table 2, the full cost of chronic di seases to the Nova Scotia health care system matches the 60% estimate of the U.S. Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention. This accounts for more than $1 billion of the province's $1.9 billion health care budget. When total economic costs, direct and indirect, are included in the equation, and when these additional categories and costs of chronic disease are also included, then chronic illnesses account for more than 70% of the total economic burden of illness in Nova Scotia. It is noteworthy that different kinds of chronic disease have very differe nt cost distributions. Cardiovascular diseases and mental illnesses acc ount for the highest direct health care costs in Nova Scotia (particularly hos pital and drug costs), cancer produces the highest losses in premature death, and musculoskeletal disorders acc ount for the highest disa bility costs in the province. These seven categories of chronic dise ase account for 78% of all productiv ity losses due to premature death in Nova Scotia, and 76% of all disability costs (F igs. 1 through 3 below).

Ischemic heart disease, also calle d coronary heart disease or corona ry artery disease, results from a reduced blood supply to the heart, and account s for more than half of all deaths due to cardiovascular disease in Nova Scotia. Stroke, or cerebrovascul ar disease, accounts for 18% of CVD deaths in the province, and acute myo cardial infarction (heart attack) for 25%.29 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) death rates in Cana da have fallen by nearly half in the last 30 years, mainly due to improved medical and surgic al care, but also due to early diagnosis and treatment, reduced smoking prevalence, and other lifestyle changes.30 In the U.S., mortality due to heart disease has fallen by an average of 2-3% annually si nce the 1950s, and is now 55% of the 1950s rate.31 29 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 291; Centers for Disease Control (CDC), op. cit., pages 10 and 14; Heart and Stroke Foundation, op. cit., pages 72-73, 76-77. 30 Heart and Stroke Foundation, op. cit., page 70. 31 Goldberg, Robert, \"Temporal Trends and Declining Mort ality Rates from Coronary Heart Disease in the United States,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 41. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 10 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentBecause only 25% of the mortality decline is at tributable to better risk control and reduced disease incidence, a substantial portion of CVD mortality has been postponed to later ages rather than avoided, sometimes substituting prolonged disability for premature death. Nova Scotianslose 5,830 potential years of life e ach year as a result of prematur e death due to heart disease and stroke. 32 Smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, hi gh blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and exposure to second-hand smoke are the major risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Many of these risk factors are linked, and surveys have found that 41% of Canadian men and 33% of women aged 18-74 have two or more of these ri sk factors. The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada notes that prevention of heart disease requires \"modifying not onl y risk factors and risk behaviours but also such 'risk conditions' as poverty, powerlessness and lack of social support.\"33 Figure 4 Distribution of Costs: Ca rdiovascular Disease, Nova Scotia, 1998 Source: Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming). 32 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 321; Heart and Stroke Foundation, op. cit., page 23. US estimates cited in this publication indicate that 43% of the mortality decline is due to improved treatment; 29% to early diagnosis; and 25% to controlling risk factors and thus reducing disease inci dence. There appears to have been a substantial shift in these proportions over time. Earlier estimates found that reductions in smoking, high serum cholesterol levels, and other risk factors, accounted for slightly over one half of the observed decline in CHD mortality between 1968 and 1976, while medical interventions contributed to about 40% of the decline. See Goldberg, Robert, \"Temporal Trendsand Declining Mortality Rates from Coronary Heart Diseas e in the United States,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 63. 33 Heart and Stroke Foundation, op. cit., page 23. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 11 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentCirculatory diseases (particularl y heart disease, stroke, and hype rtension) cost the Nova Scotia health care system an estimated $252 million each year in hospital, physician, and drug costs alone. Other direct costs, includ ing private expenditures for other institutions and home care, add $137.4 million to this sum, for total health care spending of $389.4 million a year due to circulatory illnesses. Productivity losses due to prem ature death and disability as a result of heart disease, stroke, and hypertension cost the provincial economy an additional $571 million a year,for a total economic burden of $961 million that can be attributed to circulatory diseases. 34 A substantial portion of these financial costs could potentially be avoided through preventive measures that reduce risk, and through health promotion initiatives. Above all, this study indicates that the independence and quality of life of older Nova Scotians can be sustained and improved through reduction of ri sk factors and conditions. 1.2 Cancers Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Nova Scotia, and accounts for 30% of all deaths in the province. The National Cancer Institute of Canada estimates that 2,500 Nova Scotians died of cancer in 2001, the highest cancer death rate fo r both men and women in the country, and 18% above the national average.35 The number of new cases of cancer indicates the future burden and cost of cancer. An estimated 4,700 Nova Scotians were diagnosed with can cer in 2001, the second hi ghest cancer incidence rate in the country after PEI, and 9% above the national average.36 Many risk factors for heart disease, includi ng smoking, poor nutrition, phys ical inactivity, and exposure to second-hand smoke, are also key ri sk factors for cancer, and are preventable. According to the American Cancer Society, one- third of all cancer deat hs are related to poor nutrition.37 Because Nova Scotia has by far the highest ra te of malignant melanoma in the country, 77% above the national average, excessi ve sun exposure is also an impor tant modifiable risk factor in the province.38 Screening services can also help de tect cervical cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer at an early stage, and thus enable effective trea tment that can prevent premature death. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Nova Scotia for both men and women, and accounts for 29% of all ca ncer-related mortality in the province. A single behaviour - cigarette smoking - accounts for 85% of all lung cancer case s. Nova Scotian men have a 26% higher rate of death from lung cancer than the national av erage. Nova Scotian women have the highest incidence of lung cancer in the country, and a 19% higher rate of death from lung cancer than 34 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, to be published 2002. 35 National Cancer Institute of Canada, op. cit., pages 24 and 28. 36 Ibid., pages 24 and 26. 37 Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., page 18. 38 Ibid., page 26. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 12 Measuring Sustainable Developmentother Canadians. According to Statistics Canada's 2000 Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey, 30% of Nova Scotians smoke, the highe st rate in the count ry, and 25% above the national average. Smoking cessation could prevent more than 600 lung cancer deaths per year in the province.39 Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men, accounting for 13% of male cancer deaths in Nova Scotia. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer for women, accounting for 17% of female cancer deaths in the province. About 30% of these breast cancer deaths could be prevented through mammogram testing for women 50 or older. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer de aths for both men and women, accounting for 8% of all cancer deaths in the province. Physical inac tivity, obesity, and diets high in saturated fats and low in vegetables and whole grains ar e risk factors for colorectal cancer.40 Cancer costs the Nova Scotia health care system $91.3 million a year in hospital, physician, and drug costs alone. Other direct co sts, including private expenditures for other institutions and home care, add $49.4 million to this sum, for total health care spending of $140.6 million a year due to cancer. Productivity losses du e to premature death and disabil ity as a result of cancer cost the provincial economy an additional $441.3 million a year, for a total economic burden of $582 million that can be attributed to cancer.41 A substantial portion of cancer costs could be avoided through preventive measures that reduce risk. Cancer is the most costly il lness in losses due to premat ure mortality (nearly $430 million annually), because it so often claims its vict ims at young ages. Circulatory diseases and cancer alone account for more than 40% of all productivity losses due to illness in Nova Scotia, and for more than $1.5 billion total in direct and indirect costs.42 39 Ibid., pages 26-28; Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., page 22; Statistics Canada, The Daily, 29 May, 2001, available at: http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/010529/d010529c.htm ; Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Sydney and Halifax, 2000. 40 National Cancer Institute of Canada, op. cit., page 27; Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., pages 26 and 30. 41 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, to be published 2002. Hospital, physician, drug, and research costs are currently available for Nova Scotia by illness category, including cancer.

More than 38,000 Nova Scotians have non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (often calle d adult-onset diabetes, or diabetes 2). This amounts to 4% of the total Nova Scotia popula tion, and 14% of those aged 65-74. Cape Breton County has the highest regional preval ence of diabetes in the province.43 U.S. estimates indicate that diabetes mellitus affects 12 million people in that country.44 Diabetes is responsible for th e total disability of about 3,300 Nova Scotians, including 40 who become blind each year because of diabetic eye disease, more than 200 who receive treatment for kidney failure, and another 200 who undergo diab etes-related lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is estimated to be th e underlying cause of 150 deaths each year in Nova Scotia, and a contributing cause to at least 300 more, for a total of 450 deaths attributable to diabetes (5.7% of all deaths.) These premature deaths repres ent a loss of 5,000 years of life every year. 45 43 LeBlanc, John, \"The Prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus in Nova Scotia: What Can We Learn from Routinely Collected Health Data,\" in Diabetes Care in Nova Scotia 8 (4), Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia, Halifax, October, 1998. 44 Manson, Joann, and Angela Spelsberg, \"Primary Pr evention of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus,\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 10 (3), 1994. 45 These estimates for Nova Scotia are extrapolated from U.S. data on d eaths, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations attributable to di abetes. See Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., page 34. MMWR 35 (46), 21 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 14 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentBecause it leads to other serious illnesses, diabetes is probably under-reported on death certificates. Similarly, conventional estimates of mortality, disease specific disability, and health expenditures attributed to diabetes are almost certainly underestimates, because of theconvention of classifying illne sses by principal diagnosis. Tabl e 1 (above) therefore attributes just 230 deaths a year to diab etes (3% of total deaths in Nova Scotia,) whereas more comprehensive U.S. estimates attribute 6.8% of total mortality in that country to diabetesmellitus. 46 Here, both the conventional and comprehens ive estimates are given for Nova Scotia, accounting for 3% and 6% of total deaths respectively. According to Health Canada: \"There were 5,447 deaths in 1996 for wh ich diabetes was certified as the underlying cause. This ranks diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death inCanada. However, the actual number of deaths for which diabetes was a contributing factor is probab ly five times this number.\" 47 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control similarly report: \"Actually diabetes contributes to a much larger proportion of mortality, since it is reported on only about half of the death ce rtificates for persons who die with the disease and is listed as the underly ing cause on only one-quarter of the certificates on which it appears. The mo st frequent causes of death among persons with diabetes are ischemic and other forms of heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and other form s of atherosclerosis; renal disease, including nephritis/nephros is and uremia; respirator y disease; and infection.\"48 Diabetes is closely associated with obesity, with more than 50% of cases attributable to overweight.49 Given the epidemic increase in obesit y, it is not surprising that the global population with diabetes has jumped nearly five-fold from 30 million in 1985 to 143 million in 1998. The average age of diabetics is getting younger, and the globa l incidence of the disease is expected to double to 300 million by the year 2025.50 Statistics Canada re ports that Canadians with a body mass index greater than 30 are f our times as likely to have diabetes.51 November, 1986, pages 711-714, available at http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/ preview/mmwrhtml/00000824.htm . Estimates of potential years of life lost and total disability attributable to diabetes mellitus are extrapolated from Huse, Daniel M et al., \"The Economic Costs of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 262 (19): 2708-2713, November 17, 1989. Note that these sources are 13-16 years old, and that the incidence of diabetes and its concomitant mortality, morbidity, and disability are higher today. 46 Huse, Daniel M et al., \"The Economic Cost s of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 262 (19): 2708-2713, November 17, 1989. 47 Health Canada, Diabetes in Canada , available at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpb/lcdc/publicat/diabet99/d02_e.html . 48 Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., page 34.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 15 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentEndocrine and related diseases (including diabetes) cost the N ova Scotia health care system $54.7 million a year in hospital, physician, and drug costs alone. Other direct costs, including private expenditures for other institutions and home care, add $30 million to this sum, for total health care spending of $84.8 million a year due to endocrine a nd related diseases. Productivity losses due to premature death and disability as a result of endocrine-rela ted disorders cost the provincial economy an additional $71 million a year, for a total economic burden of $156 million that can be attributed to this category of diseases.52 According to Health Canada's 1993 Economic Burden of Illness in Canada, diabetes accounts for 43.3% of direct endocrine and related disease costs, and 26.8% of indirect costs. Applied to the 1998 Economic Burden of Illness in Canada estimates for Nova Scotia, this means that diabetes costs the Nova Scotia health care system $23.6 million a year in hospital, physician, and drug costs, and accounts for $36.5 million in total direct health ca re spending. Diabetes also accounts for $19.3 million in productivity losses, for a total economic burden of $79.4 million. Since type 2 diabetes constitutes 92.5% of all cases of diabetes, adult-onset diabetes accounts for $20 million a year in hospital, drug, and physician costs; $33.3 million in total direct health care spending, $18.2 million in productivity losses, and $73.5 million in total economic costs. This is, proportionally, a much more conservative estimat e than comparable U.S. estimates that have pegged the combined direct and indirect costs of diabetes in that country at $63 billion a year.53* 52 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, to be published 2002. Hospital, physician, drug, and research costs are currently available for Nova Scotia by illness category, including diabetes. However, at the present time, other direct health care costs in Nova Scotia , such as spending for other institutions and home care, have been assessed only for all illness categories combined. These additional direct costs are therefore extrapolated here for diabetes, on the assumption that they occupy th e same proportion of total direct health care costs for diabetes as they do for all diagnostic categories combined. 53 Manson, Joann, and Angela Spelsberg, \"Primary Pr evention of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus,\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 10 (3), 1994. * NOTE: Throughout this report, all monetary estimates are tr anslated to 2001 Canadian dollars, for comparative purposes. In converting from US dollars, the following method is used: US dollars for the base year are converted to Canadian dollars for the same year, and Statistics Canada's Consumer Price Index is then used to convert the base year Canadian dollars to 2001 Canadian dollars. For example, 1990 US dollars are converted to 1990 Canadian dollars; 1994 US dollars are converted to 1994 Canadian dollars. Statistics Canada's Consumer Price Index is then used to convert the 1990 or 1994 Canadian dollars to 2001 Canadian dollars. The $40 billion (1994$US) estimate in this sentence is gi ven here as an example. Exchange rates are taken from http://www.x-rates.com/cgi-bin/hlookup.cgi which gives the rate as $US1 = $Can1.3825 on June 30, 1994. To convert 1994 US dollars to 1994 Canadian dollars: Calculation (1): 1.3825 X $40 billion = $55.3 billion (1994 Can$). Then to convert 1994 Canadian dollars to 2001 Canadian dollars using Statistics Canada's Consumer Price Index (CPI): Calculation (2): 2001 CPI (116.4) divided by 1994 CPI (102) X $55.3b = $63.11 billion. This same method is used throughout the report, with the conversion calculations given in each instance, in order to allow easy conversion back to the original U.S. estimates prov ided in the cited studies. It should be noted that these conversions do not imply that the U.S. estimates would be actual co sts in the Canadian system, since U.S. health care costs have been shown to be considerably higher than Canadian health care costs. The conversion to a common metric is intended for comparative purposes only. Thus, wh enever U.S. estimates are ex trapolated to Nova Scotia, the higher costs of the U.S. health care system must be borne in mind, and th e estimates are not intended to imply actual costs to the Nova Scotia health care system. NOTE: According to \"OECD in Figures: Statistics on the Member Countries,\" OECD Observer 2002, Supplement 1, Health: Expenditure, page 8. U.S. per capita health care costs are currently 80% higher than Canadian costs. This GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 16 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentA substantial portion of diabetes costs c ould be avoided through improved nutrition, physical activity, and weight reduction. One study found that the achievable reducti on in the risk of non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by favourably altering modifiable risk factors was 50-75%for obesity and 30-50% for physical activity. 54 Figure 6 Distribution of Costs for Endo crine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases (including Diabetes), Nova Scotia, 1998 Source: Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming). 1.4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have the highest death rates for respiratory disorders in Canada. When deaths from acute respiratory infections like pneumonia and influenza are subtracted, it is estimated that about 375 Nova Scotians die each year from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), including emphysem a, asthma, and chronic airway obstruction.55 is a sharp increase from 1989, when U.S. per capita h ealth care costs were 60% hi gher than Canadian costs. Therefore, all conversions and cost extrapolations for Nova Scotia from U.S. data should really be reduced by 44.5% to assess disease costs and intervention benefits and costs in Canada. This additional step has not been taken in thisreport. It would involve reducing all conversions from US costs and benefits to 2001 Canadian dollars by 44.5% throughout the whole report. 53 Manson, and Spelsberg (1994), op. cit. 54 Manson, and Spelsberg (1994), op. cit. 55 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 318; and Smith, Bob, President and CEO, Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, \"Why Change the Way We Look at Health?\" GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 17 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentAbout 6% of Nova Scotians (more than 55,000 peop le) are estimated to have asthma, with the highest rates among children.56 Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD, and causes a decline in lung function that is irreversible. It is estimated that smokers experience an a nnual decline in lung volume two to three times as great as the normal decline in volume that oc curs with age in non-smokers. The risks of lung cancer and heart disease diminish rapidly when sm okers quit, with light smokers returning to the risk levels of non-smokers after several years. By contrast, COPD risks diminish much more gradually upon cessation, and never return to non-smoker levels.

Bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma cost the Nova Scotia health care system $42 million a year in hospital, physician, and drug co sts alone. Other direct costs, including private expenditures for other institutions and home care, add $22.5 million to this sum, for total health care spending of $64.4 million a year due to these types of chronic obstructive re spiratory diseases. Productivity losses due to premature death and disability as a result of bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma cost the provincial economy an additional $121.3 million a year, for a total economic burden of $185.7 million that can be attributed to these chronic respiratory disorders.57 A substantial portion of these costs could be avoided through smoking cessation. 56 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 270. 57 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, to be published 2002. Hospital, physician, drug, and research costs are currently available for Nova Sco tia by illness category, including respiratory diseases. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 18 Measuring Sustainable Development1.5 Musculoskeletal Disorders Twenty percent of Nova Scotians suffer from arthritis or rheumatism, the highest rate of musculoskeletal disorders in th e country, and 43% above the natio nal average. Fourteen percent of Nova Scotians have chronic back problems.58 Musculoskeltal disorders are the most prevalent of all chronic conditions in the province, and a ccount for the highest disability costs and third highest overall costs of any disease, after circulatory disorders and cancers. As people age, bones may become brittle, resulti ng in osteoporosis, which in turn can lead to serious falls and injuries. Unintentional falls acc ount for more than half of all hospital injury admissions in Canada, 67% of all hospital days due to injury, and 75% of all in-hospital injury deaths. Seniors 65 and older account for 48% of a ll fractures and dislocations of the lower limbs and 27% of all fractures and di slocations of the upper limbs.59 Physical inactivity, obesity, and poor diet are key modifiable risk factor s for chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Twenty-five percent of Nova Scotians (190,000 people) suffer from some long-term activity limitation at home, school, or work, with arthritis and back problems accounting for 35% of this number. Arthritis limits the daily activities of 30,000 Nova Scotians, and back problems limit 36,000 more.60 Musculoskeletal diseases cost the Nova Scotia health care system $98.7 million a year in hospital, physician, and drug costs alone. Other dire ct costs, including pr ivate expenditures for other institutions and home care, add $53.6 million to this sum, for total health care spending of $152.4 million a year due to musculoskeletal di seases. Productivity losses due primarily to disability caused by arthritis and osteoporosis cost the provincial economy an additional $310.3 million a year, for a total economic burden of $462.7 million that can be attributed to musculoskeletal disorders.61 Arthritis and osteoporosis account for greater productivity losses due to long-term disability in Canada than any other diagnostic category.62 One U.S. study estimated that arthritis and heart disease were each responsible for about 15 % of total disability in that country.63 A substantial However, at the present time, other direct health care co sts in Nova Scotia, such as spending for other institutions and home care, have been assessed only for all illness categories combined. These additional direct costs are therefore extrapolated here for respiratory ailments, on the assumption that they occupy the same proportion of total direct health care costs for respiratory diseases as they do for all diagnostic categories combined. 58 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 270. 59 Ibid., page 243. 60 Ibid., pages 237 and 240. 61 Health Canada, The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, to be published 2002.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 19 Measuring Sustainable Developmentportion of these costs could be avoided through increases in physical activity, improvements in diet, and weight reduction. One study found that hip fracture incidence in most western nations is about 130 cases per 100,000 population. Extrapolated to Nova Scotia by population, this indicates more than 1,200 hip fractures a year in the provi nce, at a cost of about $20 mill ion a year. Low calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, and poor nutrition are lin ked to low bone mass and bone fragility, which in turn contribute to fracture risk.64 Figure 8 Distribution of Costs - Musculoskeletal Disorders Source: Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming). 64 Heaney, Robert, \"Hip Fracture: A Nutritional Perspective,\" Proceedings of the Society for Experimental and Biological Medicine , 200: 153-156, 1992, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography , prepared by the Nutrition S ection, Prevention and Health Promotion, Ministry of Health, Province of British Co lumbia, July, 1996, page 37.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 20 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPART II CHRONIC DISEASE RISK FACTORS AND PREVENTION GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 21 Measuring Sustainable Development2. Reducing Chronic Disease Risk Factors and Health Care Costs* \"Much of the risk for chronic disease is behavioral and can be controlled.\" Thompson and Pertshcuk, 1992.65 \"We have been too much consumed with the supp ly side of the health care equation and too little concerned with the demand side. The best way to reduce costs and im prove health at the same time...is not just to control the servi ces provided but also to reduce the need and demand for care.... \"The costs of medical care are in large par t a function of the am ount of illness in a population. The amount of morbidity, in turn, is related in part to the prevalence of smoking, dietary fat intake, seat belt use, lack of exer cise, and other behavioral risk factors in the population.\" Fries, Koop, Sokolov, Beadle, and Wright, 1998.66 In other words, there are really two choices in d ealing with escalating health care costs. One can either increase the supply of medi cal services to meet the risi ng chronic disease demands of an aging population, or one can reduce demand by reduc ing the prevalence of chronic illness. The first alternative may contribu te to the economy and make the Gross Domestic Product grow through an expansion of the medical services i ndustry. The second alternative is likely to save money. Health care has conventionally been approached from the supply side, resulting in spiralling health care costs in a growth industry. The Genui ne Progress Index, since it assesses progress not by growth but by health and well-being, focuse s on reducing the demand for medical services through disease prevention and health promotion. Disease prevention has been defined by the U. S. National Research Council as \"personal, environmental, or social interventions that impe de the occurrence of dis ease, injury, disability, or death - or the progression of detectable but asymptomatic disease.\" And health promotion is 65 Thompson, Beti, and Michael Pertschuk, \"Community Intervention and Advocacy,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 494. 66 Fries, James, Everett Koop, Jacque Sokolov, Carson Beadle, and Daniel Wright, \"Beyond Health Promotion: Reducing the Need and Demand for Medical Care: Health car e reforms to improve health while reducing costs,\" Health Affairs 17 (2), March/April, 1998, pages 70-71. * It should be noted that costs and savings noted throughout this chapter and throughout the report are not cumulative, because individuals often have more than one risk factor and more than one chronic disease or disability. Reducing one risk factor may reduce risks for se veral different types of chronic illness. In addition, most estimates of savings assume that reduced incidence of an illness will produce a corresponding reduction in the costs associated with that illness. In actual fact, spending ma y not be cut proportionally, and resources already committed to certain types of treatment may not be diverted. For this reason, cost estimates given throughout this report should be regarded as illustrative of possibilities rather than as actual descriptions of reality. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 22 Measuring Sustainable Developmentdefined as \"personal, environmenta l, or social interventions that facilitate behavioral adaptations conducive to improved health, level of function, and sense of well-being.\"67 In other words, behaviour change is not only an isolated task controlled by an in dividual, but incl udes the social, economic, and cultural conditions and c ontext of personal health behaviour. Primary prevention refers to actions that prevent disease from occurring and reduce its incidence. These actions occur before the onset of disease and include health promotion and protection. They include immunization, fluorid ation of water, smoking cessation, regular physical activity, good nutrition, and a wide range of government regulations such as pollution controls, occupational safety requir ements, and food safety inspections.68 Secondary prevention involves early detecti on of disease that can minimize or interrupt its progression and thereby prevent irreversible damage. It incl udes Pap smears, blood pressure check-ups, mammograms, and other forms of screening. Primary and secondary prevention canbe closely related: For example, secondary pr evention of hypertension can be primary prevention of strokes. Tertiary prevention refers to the control of a disease that has already de veloped, slowing its progress and reducing the result ant disability. Tertiary prev ention may include both drug treatments and actions like physical activity and good nutrition that can help control heart disease and hypertension. While some aspects of tertia ry prevention are an extension of curative treatment, others may be identical to primary preventive actions. The purpose of a study that emphasizes the costs of illness is to identi fy possible measures that can reduce those costs. Part One indicates that chronic illnesses are not only the leading cause of death and disability in Nova Scotia, but ar e also enormously cost ly to the Nova Scotia health care system and to the economy, acco unting for at least 70% of deaths and 60% of medical care and disability costs. Epidemiologi cal studies indicate that a very large proportion of this illness burden is preventable. We ha ve both the knowledge and the means to reduce an enormous burden of unnecessary suffering, disabi lity, premature death, spiralling health care costs, and productivity losses, and to improve the quality of life of Nova Scotians. One U.S. study found that more than 40% of deaths can be attributed to preventable causes, led by cigarette smoking, lack of exercise, and poor diet. 69 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concluded that up to 50% of chroni c disease mortality is attributable to lifestyle factors that can be changed.70 It noted that better control of 10 modifiable risk factors could 67 Committee on Diet and Health, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council, (1989), Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., page 99.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 23 Measuring Sustainable Developmentprevent 40-70% of all prematur e deaths, and two-thirds of al l cases of chronic disability.71 And the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration es timates that behavioural risk factors contribute to 70% of the physical declin e that occurs with aging.72 In an extensive review of the li terature, Emory University's Cart er Center concl uded that 64% of all deaths, 71% of all po tential years of life lost before ag e 65, and 30% of hospital days in the U.S. were preventable. In the U.S. this means that 8.4 million years of life each year before age 65 could potentially be saved.73 Extrapolated to Nova Scot ia, that amounts to 30,000 potential years of life saved each year. The Carter Center also found that three preventable precursors of premature death accounted for 46% of all deaths, nearly three-quarters of all pr eventable causes of death, and more than half of preventable hospital days. These three were toba cco (17% of all deaths ; preventable of high-calorie, fatty foods, which can lead to obesity and high serum cholesterol, (14.5 % of all deaths; 23% of preventable deaths; 20% of prev entable hospital days.) Because these three precursors lead to chronic diseases that may last a long time and kill people at relati vely old ages, high blood pressure has been estimated to account for 4% of preventable years of life lost before age 65, and over-consumption of high calorie, fatty foods fo r 3.5%, while tobacco accounts for 12.6% of all preventable years of life lost before age 65. Ot her preventable causes of death, such as alcohol abuse and injuries, account for fewer deaths than these three, but relati vely more preventable years of life lost before age 65, because th ey frequently kill people at younger ages.74 An Australian study determined that modifiable risk factors accounted for 38% of the total burden of disease in that country, with toba cco accounting for 9.7%; physical inactivity for 6.7%; high blood pressure for 5.4%; obesity for 4.3%; lack of fruit and vegetables for 2.7%; high blood cholesterol for 2.6%; alcohol for 2.1%; and illicit drugs, occupation, and unsafe sex for smaller proportions.75 Epidemiological studies demonstrate that these ri sk factors do not act in isolation, and that they are linked to deeper, underlying social causes that are discussed in the next chapter. Coronary heart disease, for example, is \"a multifactorial di sease, and a multiplicity of interacting factors are involved in its development.\"76 Smoking, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, obesity, 71 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1990, Prevention '89/'90: Federal Programs and Progress, Public Health Service, Washington D.C. 72 U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, \"Healthy Agin g Project,\" Fact Sheet, 14 October, 1998, available at: http://www.os.dhhs.gov/news/ press/1998pres/981014.html . 73 Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, pages v and 187. 74 Almer, Robert, and Donald Eddins, \"Cross-Sectional Analysis: Precursors of Premature Death in the United States,\" in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, pages 184-185. 75 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Burden of Disease and Injury in Australia, 1999; cited in National Public Health Partnership, Preventing Chronic Disease: A Strategic Framework, Melbourne, October, 2001, page 24. 76 Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 10. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 24 Measuring Sustainable Developmentphysical inactivity, and diabetes ar e all risk factors for heart di sease, and those risks are more prevalent among lower socio-economic groups. Th e chain of causation can be long and involve many factors. For example, teenage pregna ncy has been estimated to reduce high school completion rates by 50% and income by 80%.77 These socio-economic disadvantages in turn may increase risk behaviours, susceptibility to ch ronic diseases, and use of health care services. A University of Michigan database on health risks and medical care costs for over two million individuals indicates that exces s risk factors account for about 25% of medical care costs.78 Another analysis estimates that preventable illn ess constitutes 70% of th e burden of illness and its associated costs, and pred icts confidently that \"we now have the knowledge that could improve population health and at the same tim e reduce medical claims costs by 20 percent or more.\"79 The widely differing estimates of the proportion of chronic illness and asso ciated costs that are avoidable depend on the assumptions employed. For example, the \"compression of morbidity\"hypothesis, for which there is growing empirical evidence, argues that since the human life span is relatively fixed, the postponement of chronic infirmity can compress the lifetime illnessburden into a shorter period nearer the age of death. According to this hypothesis, an aging population will not necessarily produce higher health care costs because a larger percentage of the population can expect to be healt hy and independent for longer periods. This hypothesis will clearly produce more optimis tic estimates of potential health care savings than one which assumes that health promotion and avoidance of risk factors simply transfer chronic illness costs to older age groups. Th ese assumptions, and the associated empirical evidence, will be examined below. Here it is sufficient to acknowledge that a consensus exists that a substantial portion of chronic illness is rela ted to preventable risk factors, risk behaviours, and risk conditions. The epidemiological evidence further confirms that a reduction of these risks can help avoid or delay the onset of these illnesses. A growing body of evidence further indicates that health promotion efforts can reduce medi cal costs and productivity losses, with studies typically demonstrating a $4-$5 saving for ever y one dollar invested in health promotion. 80 According to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services: \"We would be terribly remiss if we did not seize the opportunity presented by health promotion and disease prevention to dramatical ly cut health-care costs, to prevent the premature onset of disease and disability, and to help all Americans achieve healthier, more productive lives.\"81 77 Foege, William, Robert Amler, and Craig White, \"Closing the Gap,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 1985; 254: 1355-1358, reprinted in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, page 206. 78 Edington, Dee, \"Emerging Research: A View from one Rese arch Center,\" in Goetzel, Ron (ed.), \"The Financial Impact of Health Promotion,\" American Journal of Health Promotion 15 (5), May/June 2001, pages 341-349. 79 Fries, et al.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 25 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPart Two surveys a few key risk factors for chronic illness, and their prevalence and costs in Nova Scotia. Part Three examines underlying risk conditions in Nova Scotia, including socioeconomic factors associated with higher pr evalence of chronic illness. Part Four explores the mental health dimensions of chronic illness. Part Five examines evidence on the association of chronic illness with aging. And Part Six di scusses the potential for reducing Nova Scotia's high health care costs through health prom otion and disease prevention initiatives. As noted above, the following brief review of singl e risk factors obscures the fact that several of these are often clustered together in high-risk individuals, and may have synergistic effects on the potential for disease. While tw o out of three Canadians have one or more of the major risk factors for cardiovascular dis ease, a significant proportion have concomitant risk factors that sharply exacerbate th e likelihood of illness.82 GPI Atlantic has produced two major reports on th e costs of tobacco in Nova Scotia, and one on the cost of obesity in Nova Scotia, all of whic h include substantial sect ions on the potential cost effectiveness and economic benef its of various prevention strate gies aimed at smoking cessation and weight control. The following section highli ghts just a few of the key findings and results from those reports, and the reader is refe rred to the full reports for more details.83 More detail is provided in this report on the co st of physical activity in Nova Scotia, included here as an appendix, and on the cost effectiv eness of nutrition interventions, since these assessments were made specifically in the course of preparing this re port. The greater detail provided on those subjects here does not imply greater importance than tobacco reduction or weight reduction in the control of chronic disease. Rather it fill s out earlier work on risk factors, and should be taken as complementary to the earlier studies on smoking and obesity in the province. 2.1 Tobacco and Chronic Illness Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of illness and death in Nova Scotia, andsubstantially increases the risk for lung and othe r cancers, for cardiovascular diseases, and for respiratory ailments. More than one in five deat hs in the province can be attributed to cigarette smoke. Smoking kills more than 1,600 Nova Sco tians each year, and another 200 die from chronic illnesses attr ibutable to second-hand smoke exposure. One study summarized succinctly why tobacco is the single greatest public health hazard: \"[T]he human body is equipped neither immunologically nor biochemically to handle the more than 6,000 chemicals in ci garette smoke - many of which are toxic.\" 84 82 Stachenko, Sylvie, Direct or, Preventive Health Services, Health Canada, Preventive Guidelines: Their Role in Clinical Prevention and Health Promotion, Health Canada, Ottawa. 83 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, October, 2000; Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, March, 2000; Colman, Ronald, The Economic Impact of Smoke-Free Workplaces: An Assessment for Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, October, 2001.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 26 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentNearly half of tobacco-related deaths (48%) ar e due to cardiovascular diseases; 37% are due to cancers; 12.6% are due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and 1.2% are due to low birth weight infant deaths. Potential y ears of life lost before age 65 are dependent on the age at which premature death occurs; so 36% of tobacco-related years of life lost are due to cardiovascular diseases; 34% to cancer; 18% to low birth weight infant deaths; and 6% are due to chronic pulmonary disease.85 Tobacco costs the Nova Scotia health care system an estimated $180 million a year - 9% of the annual health care budget. Second-hand smoke costs an additional $21.5 million in direct health care costs. When productivity lo sses due to premature death, di sability, and absenteeism are added to medical costs, smoking costs the Nova Scotia economy more than half a billion dollars a year. In addition, it costs employers about $268 million more a year to employ a smoker than a non-smoker in lost on-the-job prod uctivity, excess absenteeism, higher life insurance premiums, and smoking area costs. Nova Scotians have one of the highest rates of smoking in Canada. Estimates for 2000 indicated that 30% of Nova Scotians smoked, the highest ra te in the country. The most recently released figures from Statistics Canada's Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (not yet incorporated into Figure 1 below) indicate a sharp drop in current smokers from 30% in 2000 to 25% in 2001. However, 27% of Nova Scotian teenagers aged 15-19 were current smokers in 2001, up from25% in 2000. By comparison, fewer than 17% of British Columbians, and fewer than 17% ofB.C. teenagers aged 15-19 smoke. 86 Figure 9 indicates the change in smoking preval ence in Nova Scotia and the other provinces between 1985 and 2000. Provinces are ordered from left to right by the extent of decline in smoking prevalence. Nova Scotia's drop from 35% to 30% was the third smallest decline in the country. This ordering will change when th e recently released 2001 figures are included. According to the 1996-1997 National Population Health Survey, Nova Scotia has the highest rate of nicotine addiction in the country, as meas ured by the number of smokers who reach for a cigarette with the first five minutes of waking.87 Twenty-eight percent of pregnant mothers smoke in Nova Scotia, thereby increasing the risk of delivering low birth-weight babies.88 If 10% of Nova Scotia smokers quit, the provi nce would save $1 billion over 30 years and save 92,000 life years, compared to the costs incurred if these quitters had kept smoking. There are currently 16,000 underage smokers in Nova Scotia spending $11.4 million annually on cigarettes. These illegal sales yield $6.8 million in federal and provincial taxes.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 27 Measuring Sustainable Developmentstudies show that every 10% in crease in the price of cigare ttes will reduce smoking among Nova Scotia teenagers by 7%.89 Figure 9 Percent of population who smoke, Canadian provinces, 1985 and 2000 (Currentsmokers as percentage of population age 15 and over) Source: This chart is adapted from Canadian Tob acco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) Fact Sheet 3, figure 3-2, and supplementary table 11. 1985 rates are directly from the fact sheet. 2000 rates are fromthe 2000 CTUMS data. 2001 CTUMS data were not available at the time of writing, but they demonstrate a sharp decrease in Nova Scotia's smoking rate from 30% in 2000 to 25% in 2001. Future updates of this chart will reflect these new data. Because of the high health care costs of smoking, tobacco control strategies have substantial potential to reduce the burden of chronic illness in Nova Scotia and its associat ed health care costs. These strategies incl ude school-based smoking preventi on curricula, counselling for pregnant mothers, anti-tobacco advertising, phys ician advice, and smoking bans at work and in public places. For example, every dollar spent in delivering N ova Scotia's exemplary \"Smoke-Free for Life\" curriculum would yield more than $15 in savings from avoided health care and productivity losses. Delivered to all 76,000 Nova Scotian 10-15 year-olds, it would save $75 million a year. Similarly, every dollar invested in counselli ng pregnant smokers will yield more than $10 in 89 Colman, op. cit., chapters 7-9. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 28 Measuring Sustainable Developmentsavings on intensive neonata l care for low birth-weight babies, long-term infant care costs, and avoided health care costs for the mothers.90 One U.S. study estimated that heavy smoking (one pack or more per day) accounted for 7.6% oftotal illness costs in that country, and that smoking cessation programs directed to heavy smokers yielded a benefit of nearly $2 for every dollar invested. 91 Needless to say, smoking is not only a risk behavi our in its own right, but can be a particularly potent danger in combination with other risk fact ors. For example, it has been observed that \"the combination of diabetes and smoking [is] a disaster that must be avoided at all costs\" for its high potential risk of heart disease. Yet studies show diabetics smoki ng as frequently as the general population.92 In other words, chronic disease is multi-factorial in nature, and effective preventive interventions must address multiple risk factor s and account for their potentially synergistic interaction. 2.2 Obesity, Poor Nutrition, and Chronic Illness Rates of overweight conferring a \"probable health risk \" (BMI = >27) have more than doubled in Nova Scotia, with 38% of the province's adults now overweight compared to just 18% in 1985. The dramatic increase is part of what the World Health Organization has called a \"global epidemic.\" Rates of overweight have also doub led throughout Canada, with twenty-nine per cent of Canadians now overweight compared to just 13% in 1985 (Figure 10).93 Obesity is linked to heart disease, diabetes, hype rtension, osteoarthritis, certain types of cancer, and a wide range of other chr onic illnesses. A Statistics Ca nada analysis found that obese Canadians are four times more likely to have diabetes, 3.3. times more likely to have high blood pressure, and 56% more likely to have hear t disease than those with healthy weights.94 Obese individuals are also 50- 100% more likely to die prematurely from all causes than those with healthy weights. Obesity is now recognized by experts as the second-leading preventable cause of death after cigarette smoking.95 It is estimated that 1,000 Nova Scotians die prematurely each year due to obesity-related illness, losing 4,000 potential years of life annually.96 90 Ibid., chapters 10 and 11. 91 Extrapolated from Brown, Allen, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 10. 92 Orchard, Trevor, \"Intervention for th e Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease in Diabetes,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 399. 93 Statistics Canada, Health Indicators CD-Rom, 1999, Table 00060211.IVT: \"Population by Body Mass Index\"; World Health Organization, Obesity: Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic, Report of a WHO Consultation on Obesity, Geneva, 1997. 94 Gilmore, Jason, \"Body Mass Index and Health,\" Health reports 11 (1), Summer, 1999, Statistics Canada catalogue no. 82-003, Ottawa, pages 31-43. 95 The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax, October 9, 1999, page C1. 96 Nova Scotia estimates are extrapol ated from U.S. data cited in Birmingham, C.

Obesity-related illnesses cost the Nova Scotia health care system an estimated $128 million dollars annually, or 6% of total direct health care costs in th e province. When productivity losses due to obesity, including premature death, absentee ism and disability, are added, the total cost of obesity to the Nova Scotia economy is estimated to be more than $268 million a year.97 This compares to the estimated $430 million in direct and indirect co sts due to tobacco in Nova Scotia. Because smoking is on the decline and overw eight is increasing rapi dly, it is predicted that obesity-related costs wi ll soon overtake the costs of tobacco-related illness. It is clear that obesity is only one possible consequence of poor nutrition, and that unhealthy eating is a risk factor in its own right for ma ny chronic illnesses. Health Canada estimates that the Canadian economy loses $6.3 billion a y ear to preventable diet-related disease.98 97 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, 20 00, chapter 6, based on methodology of Birmingham, op. cit., pages 484-488. 98 Health Canada, \"Nutrition Labelling: The Ba ckground,\" (October, 2000); available at http://www.hc- sc.gc.ca/english/archives/releases/2000/2000_103e.htm and following link to \"Nutrition Labelling: Support for Healthy Eating\"; for U.S. estimates of costs of diet-rela ted diseases, see \"Benefits of Nutrition Services - A Cost and Marketing Approach,\" Ross Laboratories Report of the Seventh Ross Roundtable on Medical Issues , August 18- 19, 1986: 2-9, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography, Prevention and Health Promotion Branch, Ministry of Health, B.C., July, 1996, page 39. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 30 Measuring Sustainable Development'Rich' diets, high in calories, cholesterol, satura ted and total fats, and salt , and low in fibre, have been identified by analysts as \"the primary and essential cause of epidemic CHD [coronary heart disease]\": \"Rich diet is the pivotal mass exposure responsible for the coronary epidemic. Where rich diet does not prevail as a population wide trait, there is no CHD epidemic. This is the case even when high blood pressure and cigarette smoking are prevalent (witness Japan).\"99 Rich diets include an excessive proportion of foods with a high ratio of calories to essential nutrients, including hi gh-fat animal products, dairy pr oducts, processed foods including processed meats, junk food, and foods with hi gh proportion of refined sugars, including many baked goods. These foods are also frequently low in essential constituents like potassium, fibre, and anti-oxidant vitamins. In addition to coronary heart di sease, unhealthy eating contributes substantially to four other of the 10 leading causes of death - cancer, st roke, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis: \"Nutritional risk factors for chronic illness include obesity, elevated serum cholesterol, and overconsumption of fats , sugar, sodium, and hi ghly refined foods. Reduction of such consumption can help in the prevention of chronic diseases.\"100 And an international review of evidence concurs that: \"In industrialized countries, excess intake of fat, salt, and simple sugar leads to obesity and increased levels of blood lipi ds and sugar, which, in turn, are risk factors for many conditions, including coronary heart disease, adult-onset diabetes, and hypertension.\"101 Interestingly, these analysts argue that, like a se dentary lifestyle, such diets and their adverse health impacts are a cultural and historic al phenomenon unique to modern times, and thus amenable to social rather than medical solutions: \"The twentieth-century American diet is...a new and unprecedented exposure for the human species. It is radically differen t from previous ea ting patterns; there has been no basis in prior human exper ience for evolutionar y adaptation to this exposure.... Given the origins of the co ronary epidemic in mass disturbances of human culture, it is clear that high-tech 'magic bullets' are not and cannot be the solution, be they drugs, surgical pro cedures, gene splicing, or whatever.\"102 99 Stamler, Jeremiah and Rose, preface to Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1992, pages xi and xii. 100 Glanz, Karen, \"Nutritional Intervention: A Behavioral and Educational Perspective,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 232. 101 Zevallos, Juan, et al., \"An International Perspective on Coronary Heart Disease and Related Risk Factors,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 165. 102 Idem. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 31 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentThe good news is that this epidemic is reversible. In the words of a 12th century Chinese medical work: \"When food is in order, the body is also in order.\"103 Modern analyses, too, have confirmed that: \"Nutrition plays an important role in reduc ing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and other chronic illnesses.... If it is true that abnormal serum lipids are the sine qua non of the atherosclerotic process, then the modification of diet to lower serum cholesterol and LDL levels is a crucial part of any program to lower CHD risk.... Control of cholesterol and li poprotein levels can reduce both the risk of coronary artery disease and the severity of its consequences.\"104 Therefore, according to the U.S. Surgeon-General, Dr. David Satcher: \"A major goal of Healthy People 2010 is reducing obesity, as well as improving the nutritional status and level of ph ysical activity among all Americans.\"105 Recommended dietary shifts include: reducing saturated fat and total fat consumpti on, as well as dietary cholesterol intake from animal products like high fat meat, dairy, and egg yolks; eating more complex carbohydrates and high fibre f oods like whole grains , cereals, fruits and vegetables; and reducing consumption of sodium, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and highly-processed foods. In fact, public health campaigns have been su ccessful in lowering per capita consumption of butter, dairy fat, lard, high-fat meats, and eggs across North America since the late 1960s, thereby reducing intake of choles terol and saturated fats. Intake of fish, poultry, and fresh fruits and vegetables has increased, while consump tion of low-fat milk has more than doubled.106 However average consumption levels still ex ceed the recommended goals of less than 300 mg/day of dietary cholesterol or less than 100 mg per 1,000 kiloca lories of energy, and less than 10% of kilocalories for saturate d fat intake, and less than 30% of kilocalories for total fat.107 Healthy school lunches, nutritiona l education and physic al fitness programs, and brief physician advice to patients can be inexpensive and highl y cost-effective ways of controlling the obesity epidemic. In the longer term, warning labels a nd taxes on unhealthy foods akin to current anti- tobacco strategies may be necessary, along with economic incentives for healthy eating: \"Price subsidies, taxes, and other econom ic incentives and di sincentives can be used to modify the production and usage of tobacco and various foodstuffs.\"108 103 Cited in Goldberg, Robert, \"Coronary Heart Disease: Epidemiology and Risk Factors,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 23. 104 Glanz, Karen, \"Nutritional Intervention: A Behavioral and Educational Perspective,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 231-232. 105 Cited in FYI from the NHLBI: Public Interest News from the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 1 (2), September 2000, page 1. 106 Goldberg, Robert, \"Temporal Trends and Declining Mort ality Rates from Coronary Heart Disease in the United States,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 50. 107 Stamler (1992), op. cit., page xiii. 108 Zevallos, Juan, et al., \"An International Perspective on Coronary Heart Disease and Related Risk Factors,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 165. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 32 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentSince there is a high correlation between stress, long work hours, poor dietary habits and gains in overweight, Nova Scotia might also achieve he alth gains by following the lead of European countries that have created jobs by reducing work hours.109 As indicated in chapter 3, lack of access to quality, healthy f ood, and functional illiteracy that impedes understanding of educational materials, ma y constitute serious barriers to healthy eating for those with low socio-economic status. 2.2.1 Secondary and Tertiary Prevention Weight control and nutritional intervention can also be effect ive in secondary and tertiary prevention, controlling and even reversing a wi de range of chronic illnesses. Well-nourished patients can also better tolerate treatment, expe rience fewer postoperative complications, shorten hospital stays, and recover more quickly from illness and injury, ther eby producing public cost savings. Conversely, poor nutrition can ad versely affect clinical outcomes.110 Nutritional intervention has been shown to be effective in contro lling heart disease, hypertension, metabolic disorders, and a rang e of other chronic conditions. Researchers have found dietary treatment to be more cost effective than drugs in treating cardiovascul ar diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and have called for the co st of dietetic treatment to be defrayed by health insurance.111 Studies demonstrate that weight loss, sodium re striction, and increased physical activity among moderate hypertensives reduce blood pressure a nd maintain it in the normal range, thereby reducing medication needs.112 In contrast to improved diet a nd weight reduction, drugs may also 109 Colman, op. cit., chapter 7. 110 Calvert Finn, Susan, \"Nutrition in Home Care,\" Caring Magazine, 4, October, 1990; Delmi, D., et al., \"Dietary Supplementation in Elderly Patients with Fractured Neck of the Femur,\" The Lancet, 335: 1013-1016, April, 1990; Heaney, Robert, \"Hip Fracture: A Nutritional Perspective,\" Proceedings of the Society for Experimental and Biological Medicine, 200: 153-156, 1992; \"Nutrition Therapy Improve s Health and Saves Money - Evidence from Iowa,\" Iowa Dietetic Association, 1995; \"Position of the American Dietetic Association: Cost-Effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 95 (1): 88-91, January, 1995; Cohen, Ian, \"Establishing and Justifying Specialized Teams in Intensive Care Units for Nutrition Ventilator Management, and Palliative Care,\" Critical Care Clinics, 9 (3): 511-520, July, 1993; all cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography, Prevention and Health Promotion Branch, Ministry of Health, B.C., July, 1996, pages 36, 37, 39, 40.

Researchers have concluded that high rates of coronary hear t disease (CHD) among Americans can be attributed to their diet , and that efforts to reduce C HD by improving lipid levels should include more emphasis on nutritional educ ation and on achieving ideal body weight.117 A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that lowering cholesterol through dietary modification may be more cost effective than drug therapy, with study results indicating oat bran co sting 25% of colestipol and just 15% of cholestyramine resin for equivalent results in years of life saved.118 Evidence indicates that nutrition treatment may avoid drug costs, labor atory tests, and even artery cleaning surgery by lowering blood choles terol and reversing heart disease. One study found that dietary counselling si gnificantly lowered plasma lip id levels in subjects with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, a nd suggested that 20% of the former could avoid drug therapy as a result. A nother study found that adding fibre to the diet is the lowest cost treatment for these conditions.119 Researchers have found that reducing saturated fat intake by one to three percentage points among persons with high cholesterol would reduce the incidence of corona ry heart disease by 1- 3% and save $6-$20 billion over 10 years in medical expenses and avoided productivity losses.120 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia by popula tion, this would produce economic savings to the province of $21-$66 million over 10 years. 116 Lasker, Roz, \"The Diabetes Control and Complicat ions Trial: Implications for Policy and Practice,\" New England Journal of Medicine, 329 (14): 1035-1036, September 30, 1993. 117 Denke, Margo, et al., \"Excess Body Weight,\" ARCH Intern Med., 153: 1093-1103, May Millen Posner, Barbara, et al., Pe ople 2000 - The Rationale and Poten tial Efficacy of Preventive Nutrition in Heart Disease: The Framingham Offspring-Spouse Study,\" Arch Intern Med. 153, July 12, 1993; both cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), page 15. 118 Kinosian, Bruce,and John Eisenberg, \"Cutting into Ch olesterol: Cost Effective Alternatives for Treating Hypercholesterolemia,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 259 (15): 2249-2254, April 15, 1988, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 16. 119 \"Does Health Insurance Cover Dietary Counselling?\" Tufts University Diet and Nutrition Letter 11 (8): 7-8, October, 1993; and Kelley, Mark, \"Hypercholestero lemia: The Cost of Treat ment in Perspective,\" Southern Medical Journal 83 (12): 1421-1425, December, 19 90; Dallongeville, Jean, et al., \"S hort-Term Response to Dietary Counseling of Hyperlipidemic Outpatients of a Lipid Clinic,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 94 (6): 616-621, June, 1994; all cited in Province of Br itish Columbia (1996), op. cit., pages 17, 51. 120 Oster, Gerry, \"Estimated Effects of Reducing Diet ary Saturated Fat Intake on the Incidence and Costs of Coronary Heart Disease in the United States,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association 95 (2): 127-131, February, 1996, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 21.

A national expert panel on high blood ch olesterol in the U.S. advocated diet therapy as the safest available treatment, and recomm ended that the tendency to employ drugs should be resisted during the often lengthy peri od required to modify dietary habits.121 British Columbia's Ministry of Health found that the use of lipid lowering drugs was expensive and ineffective in improving the survival rate of cardiac patien ts, and that nutrition counselling and increased consumption of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet saved more lives and was relatively inexpensive.122 These findings confirm the ancient wisdom of the 12th century Chinese philosopher who stated: \"Experts in the use of drugs are inferior to those who prescribe the proper diet.\"123 The good news here is that secondary preven tion aimed at lowering blood cholesterol, LDL levels, and hypertension among patients with hear t problems can actually reverse the course of coronary heart disease, even af ter the development of angina or myocardial infarction. Studies have demonstrated that the prog ression of plaque formation can be slowed or halted, and that regression of the atheroscleroti c process and coronary artery disease is possible. The usual regimen for success includes smoking cessation, weight reduction, a low-fat diet, regular exercise, stress reduction, and in some cases dr ug therapy to lower chol esterol and LDL and to raise HDL.124 Patients with hypertension and diabetes, both of wh ich are associated with obesity and poor diet, are at greater risk of chronic kidney failure. Early control of th ese conditions through nutritional therapy, including a low protein diet, can therefore reduce the substantial health care costs required to treat renal failure, by reducing periods of hospitalizati on, length of dialysis treatment, and side-effects of medication, while improving th e patient's quality of life substantially.

Phenylketonuria (PKU), for example, is a genetic metabolic error characte rized by deficiency of an enzyme that processes the essential amino acid phenyla lanine. It is detectable th rough blood testing during newborn screening.126 Nutrition services for PKU children yield a conservative benefit-cost ratio of about 3:1.127 Nutritional counselling can be particularly important in secondary prevention following discharge from hospital, and can help speed re covery and prevent readmission. Case studies at the Children's Hospital in Vancouve r indicated that every dollar spent on nutrition services for discharged patients saved $180.128 It has been estimated that nut rition services are required in fully half of all home care cases, and can produce significant cost savings.129 Nutritional services have also been shown to be cost-effective in preven ting growth retardation and further disability in persons with developm ental disabilities, improving performance at work and school, and avoiding related feeding and metabolic problems.130 Nutritional intervention has also been shown to be cost-effective in controlling allergies. Among clients of the Allergy Nutriti on Clinic of the Vancouver Genera l Hospital, 76% reported fewer symptoms, 52% reported fewer physician visits, 32% used less medicati on, 20% reported less absence from work or school, and 8% reporte d fewer hospital emergency admissions.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 37 Measuring Sustainable Development2.2.2 Primary Prevention It is clear that obesity is only one possible consequence of poor nutrition, and that unhealthy eating is a risk factor in its own right for many chronic illnesses. High fat diets, for example, are associated with five of the leading causes of d eath in Canada and the U.S. - heart disease, some cancers, stroke, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.132 Conversely, nutritional counselling and dietary interventions have proved successful in prom oting health and preventing a wide range of conditions, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascul ar disease, certain cancers, obesity, and low birth weight.133 The American Cancer Society attributes 30% of can cer deaths to dietary ri sk factors, indicating that more than 700 Nova Scotians a year ma y die prematurely from cancers that could be prevented by healthy eating. Numerous studies have also demonstrated th at nutrition education and counselling can contribute si gnificantly to the pr evention and treatment of heart disease by reducing key risk factors, including choles terol levels, blood pressure, and weight.134 For example, one extensive lite rature review confirmed the pot ential for reducing colorectal cancer risk by decreasing consumption of animal fats, red meat, alcohol, and cigarettes, and by increasing physical activity levels, and intake of fruits, vegetables , and dietary fibre. Eating more fruit and vegetables can cut colorectal cancer ri sk by 50%, as can increased dietary fibre intake, and exercising regularly, whereas eating more anim al fats doubles the ris k, and being overweight or eating large quantities of red meat or eggs triples the risk. The recommended diet is very similar to that recommended to reduce coronary heart disease mortality, while fruit and vegetable intake also appear to be pr otective against other cancers, such as lung and stomach cancers.135 In his report on Nutrition and Healt h, the U.S. Surgeon-General noted: \"For two out of three adult Americ ans who do not smoke and do not drink excessively, one personal choice seems to influence long-term health prospects more than any other: what we eat.\"136 132 Carrow, Anne, and Lorne Klippert, \"Ambulatory Health Care Services - Nutrition Counselling,\" Issue Paper, Ministry of Health, 1992/93, Province of British Columbia. 133 The Surgeon-General's Report on Nutrition and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C., 1988, DHHS (PHS) publication no 88-50210, page 1; Co mmittee on Diet and Health, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Scie nces, National Research Council, (1989), Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1990), Healthy People 2000: National Health Prom otion and Disease Prevention Objectives, Washington, D.C., DHHS (PHS) publication no. 91-50213; \"The Role of Nutrition in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs - Position of ADA,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 95: 88-91, 1995; \"Position of the American Dietetic Association: Nutrition Services in Managed Care,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 96: 391-395, 1996. 134 See above, and also \"Ambulatory Nutrition Care: Adults - Atherosclerosis, Supplement of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, April, 1989: S22-25, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 16. 135 Robertson, Iain, Rona Bound, and Leonie Segal, \"Color ectal Cancer, Diet and Life style Factors: Opportunities for Prevention,\" Health Promotion International 13 (2): 141-150.

This more comprehensive view is expressed in the American Dietetic Association's official position: \"Optimal nutrition and physica l activity can promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease....To effectively redu ce health care costs, the emphasis and delivery of health care must promote he alth as well as deliver treatment and rehabilitative services to the sick. Preventive measures, such as nutritioninterventions that also encourage physi cal activity, can help prevent or halt progression of full-blown chronic disease and thus decrease chronic diseasedisability. Health promotion and disease prevention need to be integral parts of all health care, community, public healt h, and worksite programs across the life cycle. Correspondingly, such programs much be culturally competent and address the specific needs of vuln erable or underserved populations.\" 139 Fifteen prestigious U.S. resear ch, health, and medical associa tions produced a joint position paper demonstrating that good nutrition can save lives and money. They estimated that diet- related diseases contribute to ov er $300 billion a year in direct and indirect costs in the U.S., while poor diet and lack of physical activ ity together cause 310,000 - 580,000 deaths a year.140 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia by population, these figures indi cate costs of 1,100-2,000 deaths and $700 million a year for this province.

A substantial amount of health care resources could be saved by expanding health promotion and disease prevention programs that target dietary change among Americans.\"143 European evidence supports this conclusion. A Br itish overview of published studies of cost- effectiveness in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiova scular disease found: \"[H]ealth promotion strategies which promote healthy eating are likely to be more cost-effective than stra tegies involving modern cholesterol-lowering drugs, screening and advice in primary care, and are comparable to or less expensive per year of life saved than anti-smoking strategies..... EU (European Union) wide food based dietary guidelines are potentia lly the basis of la rge health gains in Europe, and cost-effectiveness studi es tend to support their adoption.\"144 One U.S. estimate indicates that population-ba sed interventions to encourage reduction of saturated fat intake alone may prevent tens of t housands of cases of coronary heart disease, and save between $6 billion and $18.6 billion in heal th care costs and lost earnings over 10 years.145 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia by population, this indicates sa vings to the province of $20.5 million - $66 million. U.S. data also show that nutriti onal status is a predictor of leng th of hospital stay and mortality, and that the prevalence of malnutrition is asso ciated with prolonged hospital stay and higher average costs per day. It is estimated that patien ts with protein calorie malnutrition account for 40-70% of hospital days and have hospital stays 2-3 times longer than their diagnoses warrant.146 141 \"Position of the American Dietetic Association: Cost-Effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 95 (1): 88-91, January, 1995, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 39. 142 To convert 1995US$ to 2001Can$, exchange rates from http://www.x-rates.com/cg i-bin/hlookup.cgi show $US1 = $Can1.1381 on 30 June, 1995.

Improving the diet of Nova Scotians could exte nd their lives, reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases in the province, includ ing cardiovascular diseases, diab etes, and cancer, and save health care costs. Yet 1990 survey results showed that 8 out of 10 Nova Scotians ate too much fat. The overall energy Nova Scotians derived from fat decreas ed to 35% in 1990 from 37% in 1970-72, but was still well above the recommended fat intake of no more than 30% of energy. More men than women exceeded recommendations for both total a nd saturated fat. By contrast Nova Scotians reported their carbohydrate consum ption at 47% of total energy in take, considerably lower than the 55% recommended level. Nova Scotians al so consumed too much protein from animal products, well above recommended levels.147 But perhaps the most revealing evidence is the low priority this nutrition information has on our health agendas. Only two surveys of Nova Scot ian eating habits have ever been conducted - in 1970-72 and again in 1990 - with no more recent information available. The 1990 Nova Scotia Nutrition Survey revealed widespread public ignorance about the processed and prepared foods that constitute an increasing share of our diets. Survey results indicate d that food labels were widely misunderstood and misinterpreted, with little comprehension of ingredient lists and nutrition panels, and considerab le confusion about the valid ity of food claims on labels.148 Effectively, nutrition education comes from f ood industry advertising, which contributes more than $32 billion a year to the economies of the U.S. and Canada, more than any other industry. More than half this advertising promotes fast foods, candies, and sugared cereals. Kellogg's, for example, spends $43 million a year to promote Frosted Flak es alone, while Coca Cola and McDonald's are two of the top 10 advertisi ng spenders in the world among all industries.149 Nutritional education budgets pale by comparison, and register as \"costs\" to be cut in ever- tighter government budgets. Stress, overwork, and low income also contribut e to poor eating habits. A 1997 survey conducted by the Ottawa-based National Institute of Nutriti on concluded that: \"A hectic lifestyle emerges as the main obstacle to healthy eating. Increasi ngly, limited income constitutes another barrier: 20% of households with incomes under $25,000 be lieve their household does not have enough money for a healthy diet, up from 14% in 1994.\"150 Healthcare Financial Management, October, 1993; all cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., pages 33-35, 41. 147 Nova Scotia Heart Health Program, Report of the Nova Scotia Nutrition Survey, March, 1993; and National Institute of Nutrition, \"Do Canadians Eat Better Than Th ey Did 20 Years Ago?\" November, 1993, available at: http://www.nin.ca/Media/Ar chives/newsnov_93.html .; Health Level Access to Food,\" available at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/datahpsb/npu/cpc8.htm . 148 Nova Scotia Heart Health Program, op. cit., page 32. 149 Gardner, Gary, and Brian Halweil, \"Nourishing the Unde rfed and Overfed,\" chapter 4 in Worldwatch Institute, State of the World 2000, W.W.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 41 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentNumerous studies have confirmed the economic value and cost-effec tiveness of preventive nutrition services. The following examples are culle d from an extensive l iterature review on the subject prepared by British Columb ia's Ministry of Health in 1996.151 Worksite interventions can improve health and save money. One U.S. study found that employees participating in a low fat / high activit y program cut individual health care claims by more than one-half in three years, fr om an average of $2,333 in 1988 to $1,085 in 1990.152 If all high risk individuals in an 8,000-employee firm made such changes, it was estimated the firm could save $40.4 million over three years.153 Evidence also shows that public health and co mmunity-based nutrition interventions can lower morbidity and mortality, improve quality of life , and reduce costs in th e health care system.154 An extensive community-based health educa tion campaign to reduce dietary salt, increase potassium from fruits and vegetables and prot ein from seafood, and monitor blood pressure, was credited with reducing stroke mortality rates, as well as blood pressu re and hypertensive drug use, in Shimane Prefecture in Japan.155 One in-store program in Minnesota, using educational materials, shelf-labelling, and product tasting to inform consumers of lower fat and sodium products, encouraged up to 40% of consumers to change their food choices.156 Nutritional intervention for low- income pregnant women has been found to reduce the incidence of low birth weight babies by 50%. Low birth we ight infants cost the health care system an average of 8-18 days in expensive neonatal in tensive care, at an average medical cost of $18,000-$23,000 per instance. Compared to these costs, nutritional counselling yields a benefit to cost ratio of 5:1, or $5 in medical costs avoided for every $1 invested in nutritional counselling services.157 One California smoking cessation a nd nutritional c ounselling program for pregnant mothers yielded annual ne t savings of $115 per enrolled mother.158 151 Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography , prepared by the Nutrition Section, Prevention and Health Promotion, Ministry of Health, Province of British Columbia, July, 1996.

Several studies have found that each dollar spent on WIC servicessaves $3 in health costs in the same year, primarily due to avoi ded hospitalization of premature, low birth weight babies. The l ong-term savings are even greater , since premature, low birth weight infants are also more likely than full term, normal weight infants to have permanent physical disabilities or mental retardation. At a co st of just $73 per month, WIC can save $2,000 per day if the child is premature, $200,000 in medi cal costs if low birth weight is accompanied by other physical abnormalities, and $4 million in lifetime care if severe mental retardation occurs. 159 School-based nutrition programs can also be eff ective. A concerted nut rition education program in Singapore schools, the \"Trim and Fit Scheme \" reduced obesity rates among that country's school children by 33% to 50 % depending on the age group.160 Schools in Berkeley, California, have set up vegetable gardens to teach students about food and nutrition, and even to supply food to the school cafeterias. Beginning in 1999, Berk eley schools were requir ed to serve organic lunches.161 Establishing nutritional guidelines for food contracts is a simple step that can be taken by local school boards at any time, without waiting for higher levels of government to act. A U.S. experiment promoting better nutrition a nd physical activity in grade 3-5 children, the \"Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health,\" found substantially lower dietary fat intake and higher levels of physic al activity well into the adoles cent years compared to control groups, indicating that behaviour al changes at a young age can ha ve lasting effects. Another study found that proper nutritional training of f ood service workers reduced the fat content of school meals by 10-15% and the sodium conten t by 40-54%, through changes in food purchasing and preparation. School-based interv entions have also been shown to affect total daily diet, with students consuming fewer calories, less fat, less saturated fat, and less sodium. The studies have concluded that comprehensive educational pr ograms can influence health behaviours in adolescence.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 43 Measuring Sustainable Developmentreduced primary health care costs for childre n by about 12% through decreased use of medical care.162 A study of Seventh Day Adventist church memb ers in California found they had a death rate from digestive tract cancer of 65% the rate for the rest of the state. The study attributed the results to the dietary restrictions of church members, many of whom follow vegetarian diets, and who are bound by their scriptures to eat \"the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods\" as well as alcohol and tobacco. Th e study estimated that if this 65% death rate were possible nation-wide, the U.S. would save $863.7 million a year in direct costs and $771.1 million more in indirect costs.163, 164 According to one expert: \"Nutri tion education would save a lot of money for the nation in health care costs,\" has already helped cu t cardiovascular mortality by 1/ 3, and has raised the profile of good nutrition practice as pr otection against cancer.165 One literature re view concluded that nutrition intervention is a very wo rthwhile investment in preven ting and treating coronary heart disease.166 Responding to that reality, managed care hea lth plans in the U.S. have increasingly endorsed nutritional screening inte rventions, with one representativ e noting that \"nutritional care is as good as immunization for babies.\"167 A Note on Supplements While the evidence on the health-promoting role of whole food diets is very strong, trials on supplement use have yielded more mixed and c ontroversial results.

A prudent approach to these resu lts would be a bias towards whole foods rather than adding or subtract ing individual nutrient chemicals.\"168 2.3 Physical Inactivity Chronic conditions related to physical inactivity include cor onary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, osteopo rosis and osteoporotic hip fractures, obesity, and anxiety and depression. An inverse dose -response relationship has been demonstrated between physical activity and many of these chroni c diseases and conditions. Of all risk factors, sedentary living is the most prevalent, with fully 62% of Nova Scotians insufficiently active for optimal health benefits.169 Active living can not only prevent a wide range of chronic diseases, but can enable elderly people to age more successfully and independentl y, with a higher quality of life. In the short term, physical activity also provides more en ergy, promotes healthy weight, reduces stress, strengthens muscles and bones, improves posture a nd balance, and enhances the general sense of well-being.170 Evidence is accumulating on the biological pathwa ys and mechanisms by which physical activity promotes physical and mental health. For exampl e, a study on physical activity and mental health examines evidence on a number of hypotheses, in cluding endorphin, responses to activity.171 Past GPI Atlantic reports (2000) ha ve detailed the cost of tobacco in Nova Scotia, and the cost of obesity in Nova Scotia.172 Since that time, a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal provides the methodology and relative risk assessments that allow, for the first time, a determination of the economic cost of physical inactivity for the Nova Scotia health care system and economy.173 For this reason, physical inactivity is examin ed separately and in more detail in a separate appendix to this report. 2.4 Lack of Screening Screening allows early detection, and thus more e ffective treatment, of se veral chronic illnesses. Lack of screening can therefore be considered a risk factor in the progr ession of chronic diseases 168 Robertson, Iain, Rona Bound, and Leonie Segal, \"Color ectal Cancer, Diet and Life style Factors: Opportunities for Prevention,\" Health Promotion International 13 (2): 141-150. 169 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, \"Physical Activity Pays Big Dividends,\" and \"An Economic Case for Physical Activity,\" The Research File, files from 1999 and 1994, and \"Results of the 2000 Physical Activity Monitor, available at: http://www.cflri.ca/cflri/pa/surve ys/2000survey/2000survey.html 170 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Ins titute, \"Economic Costs of Physical Inactivity,\" The Research File, 2000. 171 Morgan, William (ed), Physical Activity and Mental Health, Taylor and Francis, 1997, chapters 10-13. 172 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, October, 2000; Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, March, 2000. 173 Katzmarzyk, P.T., N.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 45 Measuring Sustainable Developmentand in the likelihood of avoidable, premat ure death. Early detection and treatment of hypertension, for example, can also avoid the onset of other diseases like heart disease and stroke. 2.4.1 Pap Smear Tests Cervical cytology screening with a Pap smear reduces the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. As a result of the widespread adoption of this simple screening procedure, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have fallen dramatically across the country. Between 1969 and 1998, the age-standardized inci dence rate fell from 21.8 to 8.3 cases per 100,000, and the mortality rate from 7.4 to 2.2 deaths per 100,000.174 Figure 11 Pap Smear Testing, Women, 18+, Canada and Atlantic Provinces, 1996-97 Source: Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians Most cases of invasive cervi cal cancer today occur in wome n not previously screened or not screened recently. Ninety per cent of Nova Scotian women have had a Pap smear, above the 174 Judy Lee, Greg Parsons, Jane Gentleman, \"Falling Short of Pap Test Guidelines,\" Statistics Canada, Health Reports, pages 9-19, esp. page 11, ACPH; Toward a Healthy Future, Pages 146-147;) ACPH, Statistical Report, page 79. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 46 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentCanadian average; but women in this province ar e more likely not to have been tested recently. One in three Nova Scotian women has not been test ed in the last three years. As Pap smears are recommended on a more regular basis for women aged 18 and over, the Atlantic region results suggest that educational information focus on the importance of the time element (Figure 11).175 2.4.2 Mammogram Screening According to Health Canada, early detecti on of breast cancer through mammograms has been shown to reduce mortality in women age 50-69. Currently mammograms are recommendedevery two years for women in this age group. 176 Monthly breast self-examinations and annual clinical breast exams can also detect breast cancer at an early stage, allo wing effective treatment. Canadian women have a one in nine lifetime ri sk of breast cancer, the most common cancer to afflict women. One in 25 Canadian women will die from breast cancer, and the incidence ofbreast cancer has been rising steadily. Because of the relatively young age at which women die from breast cancer, it results in 98,000 potential years of life lost each year in Canada. Nova Scotia has the country's highes t breast cancer mortality rate. 177 The good news is that early detection of brea st cancer through mammograms has been shown to reduce mortality in women age 50-69, and the breas t cancer mortality rate is now at its lowest since 1950. Health Canada reports that: \"The dramatic increase in mammography use is a positive example of how public education combined with efficient screeni ng practices can make a dramatic difference in the use of proven preventive measures.\"178 In 1990 just 47% of Canadian women 50 and over had ever had a mammogram. By 1996-97, the figure was 75%. Currently, mammography screen ing is recommended every two years for women aged 50-69, and the likelihood that a woma n has had a mammogram increases with age, peaking at age 50-59.179 Nova Scotia has the second lowest rate of ma mmogram screening for women aged 50-69 in the country, after Newfoundland (Figure 12). The Nova Scotia Breast Screening Clinic currently reports a 3-month waiting period for mammogram screening in Halifax. Waiting times are longer at hospitals and in some ot her regions of the province. 175 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 81 176 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999, page 82. 177 National Cancer Institute of Canada, Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001, page 28. 178 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future: Second Report on the Health of Canadians, Health Canada and Statistics Canada, September, 1999, page 154; Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 82-85. 179 Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 83- 84 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 47 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentFigure 12 Women, 35+, who have ever had a mammogram; and Women, 50-69, who have had a mammogram in the last two years (%) Source: Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians. A 1999 study for the Atlantic Centre of Excelle nce for Women's Health found that the Well Women's Clinics in Prince Edward Island are able to combine mammogram and Pap smeartesting successfully with hea lth education, including instruct ion in breast examinations. 180 Among the Atlantic Provinces, in fact, women in P.E.I. have the highest rate of breast examinations by health professionals, with Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia registering the lowest rates in the country. In May, 2000, govern ment budget cuts forced the IWK Grace Hospital in Halifax to close its Well Women's Clinic, which had been operating for about 25 years. In 1999, roughly 1,300 women used th e clinic, which provided pap tests, breast exams, and other services for women.181 This successful P.E.I. model indicates a potent ial strategic investment for the other Atlantic provinces that can save expensive hospital costs, reduce mammogram waiting times, and increase screening rates in an atmosphere conducive to health promotion and public health education. 180 PEI Well Women's Clinics: A Case Study of Gender Specific Clinics to Increasing Screening Rates, Maritime Centre of Excellence for Women's Health, March, Halifax, 1999. 181 The Halifax Daily News, 24 May and 27 May, 2000. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 48 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentMammogram screening and Pap test rates across th e country are highly correlated with income. A clear policy priority is to provide greater access to health care services for marginalized, minority, and low-income women. 2.4.3 Colorectal Cancer Screening Sigmoidoscopy is an effective tool both for pr eventing cancer by detecti ng precancerous polyps, and also for detecting colorectal cancer early, wh en treatment is most effective. Sigmoidoscopy can detect 65%-75% of polyps and about 50% of colorectal cancers, and is recommended for persons aged 50 and older. Annua l fecal occult blood tests have b een shown to reduce colorectal cancers by one-third, and are also recommended fo r those 50 and older. Nevertheless, colorectal cancer screening is still underused and lags far behind screening for other cancers.182 Nova Scotia has the second highe st incidence of colorectal can cer in Canada, 18% above the national average, although mortal ity rates from the disease are now lower than the national average.183 A U.S. study estimated that colon cancer sc reening for those 55 and older yields $9 in cost savings for every one dollar invested. For the population aged 45-55, the savings are smaller, but still positive.184 2.4.4 Prostate Cancer Screening Since the early 1990s, blood tests have been used to determine levels of pr ostate specific antigen (PSA), a protein normally shed by prostate cells . Abnormally high levels can indicate a problem with the prostate, which may or may not be can cer. A biopsy of the prostate gland is the only sure way to detect cancer. While an increase in the frequency of PSA screening has improved the detection of prostate cancer, ove rall death rates from the disease have not declined, making the issue of widespread screening a contentious one. Nevertheless, many physicians recommend that men between 50 and 70 should have a PSA on at least an annual basis.185 Nova Scotia has the second highe st incidence of prostate can cer in the country after New Brunswick, as well as the third highes t mortality rate from prostate cancer.186 182 U.S. Centers for Disease Control, op. cit., pages 67 and 71. 183 National Cancer Institute of Canada, op. cit., pages 26 and 28. According to the mo st recent NCI report cited here, the rate of colorectal cancer mo rtality in Nova Scotia roughly matches the national average, 19 per 100,000 for men compared to 22 per 100,000 nationally; and 15 per 100,000 for women, compared to 14 per 100,000 nationally. However the most recent figures reported on 1 October, 2002 in the NS Health Department's document, Reporting to Nova Scotians on Comparable Health and Health System Indicators, indicate average mortality from colorectal cancer is now 16.1 per 100,000 in Nova Scotia compared to the national average of 19.1 (as reported in The Chronicle-Herald, I October, 2002, page A5.) 184 Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics 1984, page 11. 185 Mellor, Clare, \"Prostate pointers: Two local projects are aimed at providing good information about prostate cancer detection, treatment,\" The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax, 31 October, 2000. 186 National Cancer Institute of Canada, op. cit., pages 26 and 28. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 49 Measuring Sustainable Development2.4.5 Blood Pressure Checkup High blood pressure is a principal risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke, and has been estimated to account for 15% of all deaths and 24% of premature deaths.187 Fortunately it can be detected with a simple test, and successfu lly controlled when diagnosed. Blood pressure checkups are recommended at least once a year, ye t 25% of Nova Scotians 15 and older have not had their blood pressure checked within the past year. Surveys indicate that a significant number of people may have undetected high blood pressure.188 Nova Scotian men and women consistently record the highest rates of hi gh blood pressure in the country. Seventeen percent of Nova Scotians have high blood pressure, a rate 62% higher than the Canadian average. In previous surveys, too, Nova Scotians have recorded 32%, 40% and 50% higher rates of high blood pressure than the Canadian average.189 A particularly high percentage of Nova Scot ian women record high blood pressure (more than one in five), 80% above the national average, and 43% above the next highest province (Prince Edward Island). Again this high rate has been c onsistent over time. In previous surveys, in 1985, 1991, and 1994-95, the rate of high blood pressure for Nova Scotian women was 46%, 50% and 55% above the national average. While rates of high blood pressu re have declined across the country, they remain stubbornly high among Nova Scotian women (Figure 13).190 Fortunately, hypertension can be reduced thr ough weight loss, increa sed physical activity, reduced salt and alcohol intake, and relaxation.191 One U.S. study estimated that hypertension accounted for 6% of total illness costs in that country, and that every dollar invested in finding and treating all Americans with hypertension w ould yield benefits of between $2 and $4 in avoided costs.192 187 Almer, Robert, and Donald Eddins, \"Cross-Sectional Analysis: Precursors of Premature Death in the United States,\" in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, page 185. 188 Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 87 and 89. 189 Statistics Canada, Health Statistics, 1999, CD-ROM, Table 0060121.IVT 190 Idem. 191 Goldberg, Robert, \"Coronary Heart Disease: Epidemiology and Risk Factors,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 19. 192 Brown, Allen, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 9.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 51 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPART III SOCIOECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF CHRONIC DISEASE _______________________________ GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 52 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIn 1866, Florence Nightingale refused a request to open a new children's hospital on the grounds that it would not remedy high infa nt mortality. Only improving the conditions in the children's environment would do so.193 Similarly, deeper analyses of chronic disease today look beyond the conventional treatment options that occupy so mu ch public attention, to the underlying social and economic causes of illness, which provide the milieu and conditions for chronic disease to grow.194 Education, income, employment status, environm ental exposure, stress, social networks, and other social and economic conditions profoundly in fluence the lifestyle choices that are the proximate causes of much chronic disease. One analyst notes that man-made carcinogens, highly-refined and high-fat diets, and chemicals added to air, water, and food are both sources of cancer and heart disease, and integral parts of modern industrial production.195 According to one recent analysis: \"Many of the behaviours that contribut e to health conditions, whether good health or ill health, ar e clearly related to the interdependence between people's lifestyle and their social environment.... In real life, lifestyle is a product of some combination of choice, chance, and resources.... One's socio-cultural environment is a very power ful determinant of health. In fact, Shields (1992) and other sociologists have suggested that lifestyles are essentially artifacts or reflections of culture, indi vidual choice being a less im portant factor than societal determinants.... A reconstructed defini tion of lifestyle must incorporate components beyond diet, exercise and alcohol use in order to account for social conditions and processes such as socio- economic status and social relations.\"196 In 1998, the World Health Organization noted that lifestyle is determined by the interplay between an individual's personal characteristic s, social interactions , and socioeconomic and environmental living conditions. Because behaviour patterns are continually adjusted in response to changing social and environmental conditions, e fforts to improve health must be directed not only at the individual, but also at the social and living condi tions that contribute to these behaviours and lifestyles.197 Education, income, social status, work conditions , and other factors can severely limit personal health choices. For example, poverty and low e ducational attainment have been linked to high 193 Chernomas, Robert, The Social and Economic Causes of Disease, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, March, 1999, page 1. 194 For evidence on the importance of social determinants of health, see World Health Organization, Social Determinants of Health: The Solid Facts, WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, 1998; Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, Strategies for Population Health: Investing in the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, 1994; Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future: Second Report on the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, September, 1999; Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, September, 1999. 195 Idem. 196 Lyons, Renee, and Lynn Langille, Healthy Lifestyle: Strengthening the E ffectiveness of Lifestyle Approaches to Improve Health, Atlantic Health Promotion Research Centre, Dal housie University, prepar ed for Health Canada, Health Promotion and Programs Branch, April, 2000, pages 7, 9 and 10.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 53 Measuring Sustainable Developmentrates of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, al l of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.198 Statistics Canada reports escalating rates of time stre ss, and has linked longer work hours with higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption, unhealthy weight gain, and lack of physical activity.199 And lack of social support from fa mily, friends and communities is linked to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, premat ure death, depression, and chronic disability.200 A detailed review of the burden of unnecessary illness by Emory University's Carter Center in the United States found socio-economic level to be a more consistent precursor of health problems than any other cause. Specifically, soci o-economic level was iden tified as a precursor of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis a nd musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes mellitus, dental diseases, drug dependence and abus e, and infant mortality and morbidity.201 Florence Nightingale recognized th at major social interventions were required to overcome the infectious diseases that were the primary causes of death and disability in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These interventions included the provisi on of clean water, sanitation, safe food, decent housing, and better working conditions. Similarly, to overcome the afflictions of chronic disease today, concern for health care funding must be joined with concerns about livelihood security, work stress, food quality, a safe envi ronment, and other social conditions. 3. Costs of Poverty and Inequality Poverty is recognized as one of the most reliable predictors of poor hea lth, more so than a wide range of medical factors such as high choleste rol and blood pressure levels. No matter which measure of health and cause of death are use d, low income Canadians are more likely to have poor health status and to die earlier than other Canadians.202 Canadians in the lowest income households are four times more likely to report fair or poor health th an those in the highest income households, and they are twice as lik ely to have a long-term activity limitation.203 198 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia GPI Atlantic, Halif ax, October, 2000; and The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic , Halifax, March, 2000; Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future: Second Report on the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, September, 1999; Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health ofCanadians, Ottawa, September, 1999; Raphael, Dennis, In equality is Bad for our Hearts, York University, 2001: \"Inequality is bad for our hearts: why low income and soci al exclusion are major causes of heart disease in Canada\" can be downloaded from http://depts.washington.edu/eqhlth/paperA15.html ; Lyons and Langille, op. cit., page 17. 199 Statistics Canada, Overview of the Time Use of Can adians 1998, General Social Survey Cycle 12, Housing, Family and Social Statistics Division, special tabulation; and The Daily, November 9, 1998, catalogue no. 11-001E, pages 2-4; Shields, Margot, \"Long Working Hours and Health,\" Statistics Canada, Health Reports, 11 (2): 33-48, Autumn, 1999; Heart and Stroke Foundation, Annual Report Card on Canadians' Health, Toronto, 2000. 200 Lyons and Langille, op. cit., pages 17-19. 201 Almer, Robert, and Donald Eddins, \"Cross-Sectional Analysis: Precursors of Premature Death in the United States,\" in Amler, Robert, and Bruce Hull (eds.), Closing the Gap: The Burden of Unnecessary Illness, Oxford University Press, New York and Oxford, 1987, table 1, page 183. 202 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future: Second Report on the Health of Canadians, September, 1999, Ottawa, page 31; for a summary of similar data in the U.S., se e Blumenthal, Susan (US Assi stant Surgeon-General), and Jessica Kagen (US Department of Health and Human Services), \"The Effects of Socioeconomic Status on Health inRural and Urban America,\" MS JAMA (Journal of the Am erican Medical Association), 287, page 109, January 2, 2002. 203 Ibid., pages 15 and 43. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 54 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentCanadian studies have reported that low income is nearly as important a determinant of health service use as is illness, and a recent study in Ontario found that hospital admission rates were twice as high among poor people as among the non-poor . A detailed Statistics Canada profile of hospital users that controlled for a variety of other factors, found that men aged 15-39 with inadequate income were 46% more likely to be hospitalized than men with adequate income. Poor women were 62% more likely to be hospitalized than non-poor women. For men and women aged 40-64, the percentages incr eased to 57% and 92% respectively.204 As hospitals are the single largest health care e xpenditure, strategic investments that alleviate poverty are likely to be highly cost effective in the long run. Poverty and unemployment are also associated wi th adverse lifestyle factors, including higher tobacco use, higher rates of obesity, poorer nut rition, and less physical exercise. Those in the lowest income bracket are two and a half times more likely to smoke than those in the highest income bracket. Wealthier individuals have a lower incidence of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and they live longer. A study in Alameda Count y, California, found that those living in poor neighbourhoods had a 50% higher rate of hypertension than those living in affluent neighbourhoods, after controlling for age, race, ri sk factors, access to medical care, social interaction, and range of other variables.205 In all these cases, there is a clear gradient by social class.206 Not surprisingly, these statistics translate in to higher rates of illness in general, and of cardiovascular diseases in partic ular, since these are highly corre lated with the behavioural risk factors described above. A recent study at York University found poor Canadians at higher risk of heart disease. It attributed 6,366 Canadian heart disease deat hs a year to poverty, and nearly $4 billion a year in health care co sts to poverty-related heart disease.207 Extrapolating from these figures, it can be estimated that if all Nova Sc otians were as heart-h ealthy as the richest Nova Scotians, the province could avoid 200 deaths and $124 million a year in costs due to heart disease. These findings confirm studies conducted in other countri es. For example, a Norwegian study found that coronary heart disease risk was 2.5 times hi gher among those in the lowest income and education class than in the highest.208 Across North America, improvements in lifest yle behaviours (eating, drinking, smoking, and exercise patterns), and consequent declines in heart disease incidence and mortality, have 204 S.J.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 55 Measuring Sustainable Developmentoccurred at a much lower rate among the less e ducated, less affluent, strata than among higher socio-economic groups.209 A growing body of evidence indicates that the distribution of income in a given society may actually be a more important determinant of popul ation health than the total amount of income earned by society members.210 Above a certain level of w ealth, people live longer and have better health not in th e wealthiest countries, but in c ountries like Japan and Sweden, where income inequality is the smallest.211 Reviewing the evidence, the editor of the British Medical Journal concluded: What matters in determining mortality and health in a society is less the overall wealth of the society and more how evenly wealth is distributed. The more equally wealth is distributed, the better the health of that society.212 A separate literature review by a University of Waterloo professor found convincing \"statistical evidence that inequalities in health have grown in parallel with inequalities in income\" and concluded that \"relative economic disadva ntage has negative health implications.\"213 If growing inequality is bad fo r health, then the trends of the 1990s are cause for concern. In 1990, the richest 20% of Nova Scotian households had 6.2 as much disposable income as the poorest 20%. By 1998, they had 8.5 times as much. Since 1980, the poorest 20% of Nova Scotian households have lost 14% of their real disposable income. Compared to 1990, they have lost 29%.214 209 Stamler, Jeremiah and Rose, preface to Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1992, page xiv. 210 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future , page 41; Mel Bartley, David Blane and Scott Montgomery, \"Health and the Life Course: Why Safety Nets Matter,\" British Medical Journal, 314, 1997, pages 1194-96; George Kaplan, et al., \"Inequality in Income and Mortality in the United States,\" British Medical Journal, 312, 1996, pages 999- 1003; Helen Roberts, \"Childre n, Inequalities and Health,\" British Medical Journal, 314, 1997, pages 1122-1125; Richard Wilkinson, \"Health Inequalities: Rela tive or Absolute Material Standards?\", British Medical Journal 314, 1997, pages 591-595; Douglas Black, Margaret Whitehead, et al., Inequalities in Health, Penguin, 1992; Douglas Carroll.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 57 Measuring Sustainable Development3.1 Poverty among Children and Single Mothers Child poverty is related to a wide array of phys ical, psychological, emotional, and behavioural problems, including higher rates of respiratory illnesses and in fections, sudden infant death syndrome, obesity, high blood lead levels, iron deficiency anaemia, chronic ear infections, mental retardation, fetal alcohol syndrome, and dental problems.217 Low-income children are more likely to have low birth weights, poor health, less nutritious foods, higher rates of hyperactivity, delayed vocabulary developm ent, and poorer employment prospects.218 Although they engage in less organized sports, poor children have higher injury rates, and twice the risk of death due to injury than children who are not poor.219 A detailed analys is of both the National Longitudinal Survey on Children and Y outh and the National Population Health Survey found that some 31 different indicators all showed that as family income falls, children are more likely to experience problems.220 Malnutrition, under-nutrition, and \"fa ilure to thrive\" are chronic c onditions that account for 1% of pediatric hospitalizations in the U.S., and can lead to serious developmental, cognitive, and behavioural problems, as well as permanent da mage to infants' developing central nervous systems. These conditions aff lict children living in poverty.221 A 1998 U.S. Department of Agriculture study found nearly one-fifth of American children are \"food insecure,\" - either hungry, on the edge of hunger, or worried about being hungry.222 In the U.K., an 18-month inquiry in the mid-1990s blam ed mounting poverty for a rise in malnutrition on a scale unseen since the 1930s.223 The problem is clearly not a shortage of food - in Canada, estimates suggest that 20% of the food supply is wasted.224 Unfortunately, the relationship between low income and poor diet in Canada may be deepening. A 1997 survey conducted by the Ottawa-based Nationa l Institute of Nutrit ion concluded that: \"A hectic lifestyle emerges as the main obstacle to healthy eating. Increa singly, limited income constitutes another barrier: 20% of households with incomes under $25,000 believe their household does not have enough money for a healthy diet, up from 14% in 1994.\"225 217 \"Stunning Statistics Reveal Toll of Poverty on Children,\" Vancouver Sun, 28 December, 1990; cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), page 5. 218 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, page 85, and chapter 3. 219 Barbara Morrongiello, \"Preventing Un intentional Injuries Among Children,\" Determinants of Health: Children and Youth, Canada's Health Action: Building on the Legacy, Volume 1, National Forum on Health, 1998. 220 David Ross, \"Rethinking Child Poverty,\" Insight, Perception, 22:1, Canadian Council on Social Development, Ottawa, 1998, pages 9-11. 221 Bithoney, W.G., et al., \"The Effect of a Multidisciplinary Team Approach on Weight Gain in Nonorganic Failure-to-Thrive Children, Journal of Developmental an d Behavioural Pediatrics, 12 (4): 254-258, August, 1991, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), page 4. 222 Gardner, Gary, and Brian Halweil, \"Nourishing the Unde rfed and Overfed,\" chapter 4 in Worldwatch Institute, State of the World 2000, W.W.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 58 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIf child poverty has health consequences, there is cause for concern. Nearly one in five Nova Scotian children live below Stat istics Canada's low income cut off (LICO), compared to 16.5% in 1989, when the House of Commons passed its una nimous resolution to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. Nearly 70% of Nova Scotian children in single parent families live in poverty.226 High rates of poverty among single mothers are pa rtly responsible for high rates of poverty among children in the province. Children of singl e mothers are 14% of children in Canada, but 42% of children in low-income families. A child who lives with a single mother is nearly fourtimes as likely to be poor as a child living with both parents. 227 In Nova Scotia, 17% of all families with children are headed by single mothers, and 70% of these single mothers live belowthe low-income cut-off, accounting for fully half the children living in poverty in the province. 228 The high poverty rates of single moth ers translate into health costs fo r themselves as well as their children. A Statistics Canada analysis of both the 1994/95 and 1996/97 National Population Health Surveys found that \"lone mothers reported consistently worse h ealth status than did mothers in two-parent families,\" and that longer- term single mothers had particularly bad health. Single mothers scored lower on two scales of \"self-perceived health\" and \"happiness\", and substantially higher on a \"distress\" scale. They had higher rates of chronic illness, disability days and activity restrictions than married mothers, a nd were three times as lik ely to consult a health care practitioner for mental and emotional health reasons.229 3.2 Health Care Costs of Poverty in Nova Scotia The poorer health status of low income Canadians translates into increased use of health services and higher health care costs. In Nova Scotia, a clear and substantial inve rse association has been shown between socioeconomic status (measured by education and income) and use of physician services. In fact, there is a clear gradient in bo th measures: the lower the status, the more services used. Those with no high school diploma use 49% more physician services than do those with a B.A., and those with a high school diploma us e 12% more. Lower income groups use 43% more services than upper income groups, and lo wer-middle income groups use 33% more.230 Since socioeconomic status is modifiable, the ex cess use of health care services by low income groups is as avoidable as that incurred thr ough unhealthy lifestyles. Improving the status of lower socioeconomic groups and closing the inco me gap between rich and poor can therefore lead to improved health outcomes and substant ial cost savings to th e health care system. 226 Statistics Canada, Low-Income Persons, catalogue no. 13-569-XIB, cited in Dodds and Colman, op. cit., page 42. 227 Statistics Canada, Women in Canada, 3rd edition, catalogue no. 89-503E, page 86. 228 Statistics Canada, Selected Statistics on Women in Nova Scotia, August, 1995, catalogue no. 89-503. 229 Claudio Perez and Marie Beaudet, \"The H ealth of Lone Mothers,\" Statistics Canada, Health Reports, volume 11, no. 2, Autumn 1999, catalogue no. 82-003-XPB, pages 21-32. 230 Kephart, George, Vince Salazar T homas, and David MacLean, \"Socioec onomic Differences in the Use of Physician Services in Nova Scotia,\" American Journal of Public Health, 88 (5): 800-803, May, 1998. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 59 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentKephart and his colleagues at Dalhousie Univer sity calculated that excess use of physician services associated with educ ational inequality in Nova Sc otia amounts to 17.4% of total expenditures, or $42.2 million per year out of a total of $242.4 million. Excess use associatedwith income inequality is estimated at 11.3%, or $27.5 million annually. 231 These are the amounts that would be saved in avoided physician se rvices if all Nova Scotians were as healthy as those with university degrees and higher incomes. Yet these savings represent just a fraction of the total savings that would accrue to the health care system from improving the socioeconomic and health status of low income, poorly educatedNova Scotians. Physician costs amount to just 22% of hospital costs in Nova Scotia, and 9% of total direct health care expenditures in the province. 232 Although separate estimates on excess hospitalization have not been ca lculated for Nova Scotia, the Ontario and Canadian data noted above indicate that excess use of hospital services due to income inequality is likely even greater than excess use of physician servi ces. If all health care expenditu res are considered, it is clear that very substantial savings would accrue by narrowing the current socioeconomic gap and by reducing income and educational in equality in the province. In heal th care, as in justice, poverty and poor education are clearly costly. 3.3 Costs of Homelessness Even among the poor, whose health is genera lly worse than the norm, the homeless face particular health problems and challenges. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found significantly higher rates of trauma and lung problems among the homeless, along with extremely high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, skin disorders, and parasites. The last two ailments result from lack of a clean, dry place to sleep and wash.233 Following illness or emergency room treatment, th ere is little opportunity for recovery, use of medications, and follow-up treatment. The NEJM study found that the homeless stay in hospita l an average of 4.1 days longer than low- income patients with homes, and cost nearly $4,000 more per hospital stay. Those treated for psychiatric problems cost $6,200 more per stay than other low-income pati ents because doctors are less likely to release a homeless person ont o the streets in the absence of family or neighbourly support systems that can speed recovery.234 In short, homelessness is costly to society. In New York, the cost of a single hospital admission for a homeless person was found to be as much as a year's welfare rent al allowance. And a Minnesota study found that provision of housing and social services to 180 homeless people saved the state $9,600 for each person in a voided hospital and corrections costs.235 231 Ibid., page 802. 232 Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998, forthcoming, fall, 2002. 233 Cited in Perreten, Dan, \"Healing the Homeless,\" Poverty and Health 10, Chicago, July-August, 1999. 234 Idem.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 60 Measuring Sustainable Development3.4 Costs of Social Exclusion and Vulnerability The evidence clearly indicates that lower so cioeconomic groups suffer from a cluster of disadvantages that reinforce each other and preven t full participation in the larger society. The concept of exclusion goes beyond conventional measures of poverty and low income, and incorporates lack of education, poor health and nutrition, lack of decen t housing, higher rates and longer duration of unemployment, political powerle ssness, and more frequent contact with the law. It also includes psychological dimensions such as vulnerability, fear, voicelessness, and a pervasive sense that one is not a valued and respected member of the community. Certain groups are particularly vulnerab le to exclusion. These include singl e mothers and their children, youth, aboriginal people, racial and cultural minor ities, the disabled, the unemployed, and the homeless.236 The various dimensions of social exclusion ar e closely related to a dverse health outcomes. Aboriginal people have far higher rates of chr onic disease than other Canadians; unemployment is linked to stress and poor health; single mothers and youth suffer higher ra tes of mental distress and depression; and poor educati on is linked to a range of ri sk behaviours, including smoking, obesity, poor nutrition, and lack of physical activity. For example, those with less than a high school education are 64% more likely to be ove rweight than those with a university degree.237 A recent study at York University found three groups of Canadians at particularly high risk for poverty and increased heart disease - women (partic ularly the elderly and single parents), new immigrants, and members of visible minorities. Visible minorities \"experience a persistentincome gap, above average levels of living on low income, higher levels of unemployment and underemployment, and under-representation in higher paid jobs.\" 238 Twice as many elderly Canadian women (one in four) live below the low-income cut-off (LICO) line as elderly men, as do 45% of unattached elderly women, and 56% of families headed bysingle mothers. For Canadian single mothers, th e average \"depth of poverty\" (income deficiency between family income and the LICO) is more than $10,000 annually. In Nova Scotia, one in sixwomen lives below the LICO, a rate that is 50% higher than the male rate, and the widest gender gap in the country. 239 For these and other groups, clusters of vari ables contribute to social exclusion and powerlessness, with low income just the most ma terial and measurable manifestation of a wider range of disadvantages. For example, a detailed Statistics Canada study on the gender wage gap found that women earn substantially less than men even when they have identical work 236 \"Social Inclusion,\" Health Promotion Atlantic, 7 (1), Spring,. 2001, pages 10-12. 237 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, page 267. 238 Raphael, Dennis, Inequality is Bad for our Hearts, York University, 2001: \"Inequality is bad for our hearts: why low income and social exclusion are major causes of heart disease in Canada\" can now be read and downloadedfrom http://depts.washington.edu/eqhlth/paperA15.html ; and see \"Having Healthy H eart is Often a Question of Income,\" The Toronto Star, 9 November, 2001, page F02. 239 Raphael, op. cit., Statistics Canada, Low Income Persons; Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, pages 38 and 41; Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, exhibit 2.3, page 45; and \"The Gender Gap,\" appendix in Dodds, Colin, and Ronald Colman, Income Distribution in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, July, 2001, pages 40-41. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 61 Measuring Sustainable Developmentexperience, education, and job tenure, and when they perform the same job duties in the same occupations and industries for the same week ly hours. The study found that about 50% of the gender wage gap could not be explained by any of 14 different factors, and could therefore be seen as \"gender based labou r market discrimination.\"240 In short, there is element of gender- based \"social exclusion\" that under lies and goes beyond income issues. The concept of \"vulnerability\" is even broade r than that of social exclusion. One analysis includes the following examples of vulnerability: low income; food insecurity; lack of family, friends, and social support systems; illiteracy and poor education; in adequate or insecure housing; migrant status and langu age difficulties; working or li ving in dangerous, isolated, or stressful places; being born with a chronic dise ase or disability; lack of health knowledge; inability to cope with problems; difficult childhood or birth; lack of access to health services. Many of these vulnerabilities are experience d as a lack of control over one's life.241 Most aspects of vulnerability and social exclusi on are modifiable, or can at least be attenuated through social policy. According to the analysis cited above: \"Preventing and reducing vulnerability is as important as dealing with the effects of vulnerability.... Dealing with the caus es of vulnerability is less costly than dealing with the serious effects of vuln erability. Reduced vuln erability has long- term economic and social gains.\"242 In sum, there is a tendency in an analysis such as this to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of different health afflictions and preventive interventions as if they stood alone. The concept of exclusion warns against this, and recognizes th e need for a comprehensive and holistic health promotion strategy that acknowledges the full range of socioeconomic and cultural determinants of health and the synerg istic interaction between them. The good news in this approach is that reducing disadvantage and exclusion in even one area may produce positive spin-off benefitsacross a wide range of linked dimensions. 4. Cost Effectiveness of So cio-economic Interventions Unfortunately, conventional behavi oural interventions aimed at h ealthier lifestyles have proved remarkably ineffective in allevi ating the deeper influences of poverty and social disadvantage. Even more broadly, analysts have noted that \"health promotion strategies focused purely at individual health behaviours are yielding limited success.\"243 Evidence indicates that thos e who are marginalized do not attend smoking cessation and nutrition classes, do aerobics, join gymnasiums, or shop for healthy foods. A comprehensive $1.5 million 5-year cardiovascular disease prevention a nd lifestyle intervention program in St. Henri, 240 Drolet, Marie, \"The Persistent Gap: New Evidence on the Canadian Wage Gap,\" Income Statistics Division, Statistics Canada, December, 1999, catalogue no . 75F0002MIE-99008, page 13, and table 3. 241 Alberta Association of Registered Nurses, Position Paper on Vulnerability, Edmonton, September, 1998, page 1, available by contacting aarn@nurses.ab.ca . 242 Ibid., page 2. 243 Lyons and Langille, op. cit., page 7 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 62 Measuring Sustainable Developmenta Montreal neighbourhood where 45% of families liv e below the poverty line, attracted only 2% participation. The only si gnificant result, compared to a control group, was that more people had their blood cholesterol levels measured.244 The researchers concluded: \"...unless or until basic living needs are ensured, persons living in low-income circumstances will be unlikely or unable to view CVD [cardi o-vascular disease] prevention as a priority.\"245 Because lifestyle interventions have been most successful in changing the behaviour of those with higher levels of educati on and income, and least effec tive for disadvantaged populations who have fewer options and less co ntrol over their lives, they have had the unintended effect of deepening health inequalities between socioeconomic levels.246 More effective interventions to alleviate the negative impacts of poverty on health range from social programs directed towards low-income i ndividuals to wider-ranging social reforms. As an example of the former, it was noted above that every dollar spent on the WIC SpecialSupplemental Nutrition Program for low-income wo men, infants, and children in the U.S. saves $3 in health costs within the same year. 247 Supplemental feeding assistance for children fr om low-income households that are unable to provide adequate nutritious food, can improve health and social outcomes. School lunch and breakfast programs have been shown to pr oduce hunger relief, improved nutritional status, enhanced cognitive functioning, improved behaviour , and increased social support for children with inadequate dietary intake at home.248 Low income Canadians are more likely to be overw eight and to have poore r diets than those with higher incomes, which may be due, in part, to cheaper pricing of poor-nutrient fast foods compared to higher quality healthy foods. For ex ample, 40% of low-income Canadians believe that low-fat products are expensive, and 27 % believe that grain products are expensive, compared to 32% and 8% respectively of those with high incomes (Figure 6).249 However, the disparity here may be related to education, strategy, and policy as much as to income. One study found that simple substitution of healthy alternatives for equivalent foods in 244 Raphael, Dennis, Inequality is Bad for our Hearts, York University, 2001: \"Inequality is bad for our hearts: why low income and social exclusion are major causes of heart disease in Canada\" can now be read and downloadedfrom http://depts.washington.edu/eqhlth/paperA15.html ; and see \"Having Healthy H eart is Often a Question of Income,\" The Toronto Star, 9 November, 2001, page F02. 245 Cited in Lyons and Langille, op. cit., page 22. 246 Ibid., pages 23-25. 247 Buescher, Paul, et al., \"Prenatal WIC Participation Can Reduce Low Birth Weight and Newborn Medical Costs: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of WIC Participation in North Carolina,\" Supplement of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 93 (2): 163-166, February, 1993; Canadian Nutrition 11, 1991, page 2; Matsumoto, Masao, \"The WIC Program Review 15 (1): 40-42, 1992; Goldberg, Jeanne, and Jean Mayer, \"The White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health Twenty Years Later: Where Are We Now?\", Journal of Nutrition Education, Viewpoint, 1990: 47-50; all cite d in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., pages 2-4. 248 McIntyre et al., \"School-Based Feeding Programs: A Summary of the Literature,\" A Special Report of the Canadian School Boards Association, July, 1992, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996) op. cit., page 6, 249 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, Ottawa, September, 1999, page 267. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 63 Measuring Sustainable Developmentthe \"average\" diet, increased food costs by 11- 14%, which can help explain why low-income earners have poorer diets. However, restructuring the diet to include more cereals, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables (rather than simply substituting healthier equivalents such as leaner meat), reduced food costs per megajoule of energy. The researchers concluded th at healthful eating is not necessarily more expensive and that restru cturing the diet is more cost effective than substitution.250 In the longer term, health researchers have poin ted to the need for wider social reforms that increase the income of the poor, prevent material deprivation, and addre ss social exclusion and powerlessness. Recommendations include increas ing the minimum wage, ensuring pay equity, providing a guaranteed minimum income, incr easing welfare payments, improving access to education and training, protecting minority rights through legisla tion, building housing cooperatives, and funding daycare programs .

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 64 Measuring Sustainable Development5. Social Networks and Social Supports Social networks and social supports have substa ntial benefits for healt h, including strengthening immunity, increasing compliance with behaviours that promote health, and enhancing adaptation and recovery from disease. Lack of adequate soci al supports may be as great a risk to health as poor diet, lack of physi cal activity, or smoking.252 According to Health Canada: \"Families and friends provide needed emoti onal support in times of stress, and help provide the basic prerequisites of health such as food, housing and clothing. The caring and respect that occur in social networks, as well as the resulting sense of well-being, seem to act as a buffer against social problems . Indeed, some experts in the field believe that the health effect of so cial relationships may be as important as established risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure.253 It has been argued that social support an d social cohesion are stronger influences on cardiovascular disease than individual medical care.254 Social relations, and support from family, friends, and communities have been shown to cont ribute to health; to reduce the incidence of premature death, depression, mental illness, and chronic disability; to reduce adverse responses to stress; and to improve medical outcomes in high-risk populations.255 In fact, less than half of corona ry heart disease incidence in the United States has been explained by the combined effect of all traditional risk factors. Alt hough more difficult to isolate and quantify, stressors like poverty, high emotional ar ousal, and disruption of social ties have been identified as key factors affecting heart diseas e risk and premature mo rtality. According to one analyst: \"Psychosocial factors influence not only th e risk of CHD but of overall morbidity and mortality across a wide range of disorders.\"256 In attempting to explain why white American male s are five times as likely to die of coronary heart disease as Japanese men, comparative stud ies have pointed to greater social support and cohesion as a likely explanatory factor: \"The evidence from the Japane se acculturation studies certainly suggests that strong social ties and meani ngful social interconnect edness / cohesiveness might be a source of significant protective bene fits...and thus be an important factor in the prevention of CHD.\"257 252 \"The Role of Nutrition in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs - Position of ADA,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 98: 205-208, 1998; Karch, Bob, \"Social Factors in Health Promotion,\" American Journal of Health Promotion, 3 (1), March-April, 2000. 253 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, page 60. 254 Lyons and Langille, op. cit., page 17. 255 Ibid., page 18; and Health Canada.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 65 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentA study in Alameda County, California, constructed a social network index combining four types of social connections (marriage, extended families, church membership, and other group affiliations). Those who scored low on the index were twice as likely to die of heart disease andof all-cause mortality in the succeeding nine ye ars as those who scored high, after controlling for age, race, socio-economic status, self-reported he alth status, and a range of risk factors. Many other studies have produced similar findings that indicate the protective ro le of social supports and social cohesion. 258 According to one analysis: \"Social support provides...an emotional and practical resource for coping and for enhancing quality of life. Belonging to a social group makes people feel cared for, loved, and valued. It provides soci al status and a sens e of control, two elements that have powerful protective effects on health.\"259 5.1 Family and Shared Households Family and household members can not only provide vital requisites of good h ealth but also be a central pillar of support in times of illness. Divorce rates are one indicator of family instability and breakdown. Newfoundland has the highest marriage rate and the lowest divorce rate in the country, with Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick also regist ering divorce rates well below the national average.260 Newfoundland's strong family and social networks may help explain why that province register s the highest levels of self-repor ted and functional health status and psychological well-being in the country, and the lowest rate s of new cancer cases, asthma, allergies, stress, and suicide, despite higher unemployment and lower income than the rest of Canada.261 A double caveat must be added here: In some cases family is not a safe place. Family violencecan have a devastating effect on the health a nd well-being of women and children in both the short and long term, and divorce can be a healthy alternative to spousal abuse. 262 There are also alternative shared household models that provide strong social support, aside from the traditional family. The National Population Health Surv ey tested social support levels by questions such as whether respondents had someone to confide in, count on in a crisis, count on for advice, and make them feel loved and cared for. Among household types, single parents had the lo west levels of social support in answer to these questions. Newfoundl and, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick all have a smaller proportion of single-parent families than the national average, and thus fewerindividuals in this low-support group, while Nova Scotia has more. 263 258 Ibid., page 303. 259 Lyons and Langille, op. cit., page 18. 260 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 21 261 Statistics Canada, Health Statistics 1999, Tables 00060139.IVT, and 00060150.IVT; Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 51, 219, 225, 231, 270, 287, and 315. 262 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, pages 60-61. 263 Ibid., page 60; and Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 22. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 66 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentFamily structure and function today is changi ng in significant ways, due both to an aging population and to the de-institutiona lization of the health care system. The sick, elderly and disabled are depending more than ever on info rmal family caregivers, mostly women. This massive social change can save governments money, enhance healing and social support for those in need, and strengthen families. But it can also lead to serious stresses on overburdenedcaregivers, if sufficient respite a nd other supports are not provided. 264 Early research on this emerging trend indicates that informal caregivers are becoming increasingly time stressed, suffer significant job di sruptions to care for family members in need, often face difficult financial circumstances, and re quire better access to information in order to provide care effectively. Most disturbingly, a significant propor tion of caregivers is suffering adverse health consequences as a direct result of the increased burden of caregiving. One analyst warned that \"women's 'double day' of paid work and unpaid domestic labour\" has led to an emerging \"crisis of care-giving, a direct result of the 'time crunch' that now characterizes the female life course.\"265 The tremendous growth in informal family careg iving holds great promise. But if it is not accompanied by some transfer of resources, suppor t, information, respite, and assistance, the potential benefits may turn into liabilities, a nd the caregivers themselves may not only be unable to provide the needed care to their aging spouses and parents but be in need of it themselves.266 5.2 Social Health The Advisory Committee on Population Health points out that The importance of social support also exte nds to the broader comm unity. Civic vitality refers to the strength of social networks within a community , region, province or country. It is reflected in the instit utions, organizations and informal giving practices that people create to share resources and bui ld attachments with others. Evidence is strong that these networks are still mo re vibrant in Atlantic Canada than in other parts of the country, as eviden ced by the high rate of voluntary work in the region (see below).267 The social inclusion project of the Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health has specifically identified support groups in the four Atlantic provinces that are playing a major role in strengthening these community networks.268 264 Joan Campbell, Gail Bruhm, Susan Lilley, Caregivers' Support Needs: Insights from the Experiences of Women Providing Care in Rural Nova Scotia, November 1998; Colleen Flood, Unpacking the Shift to Home Care, March 1999, both papers prepared for the Atlantic Ce ntre of Excellence for Women's Health, Halifax. 265 John Myles, \"Women, the We lfare State and Care-Giving,\" Canadian Journal on Aging, volume 10, no. 2, 1991, cited in Judith Frederick, As Time Goes By...Time Use of Canadians, Statistics Canada, catalogue no. 89-544E, page 7. 266 For further information on the needs of caregivers, se e the Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health Gender and Heatlh Policy Discussion Series , Halifax, Paper no. 1, March 1998. 267 Colman, Ronald, The Economic Value of Civic and Voluntary Work in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, 1998, with updates in 1999 and 2000. 268 Susan Williams, Social Inclusion: On the Pa th to Social Development, A Foundation Paper prepared by a Working Group of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador Strategic Social Plan for Health Canada and the GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 67 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentHowever, the evidence is equally strong that these support networ ks cannot be taken for granted and may well be in decline. One indicator is the \"Index of Social Health\" developed by Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) in c onjunction with Statistics Canada. The fifteen components of the index include trends in rate s of poverty, child abuse, infant mortality, teen suicides, drug abuse, high school dropouts, crime, alcohol-related fatalities , access to affordable housing, and other factors. HRDC found that all provinces have experienced a declin e in their social health indicators since the early 1980's, with Newfoundland and New Bruns wick registering modest declines (5% and 8%), and Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia mu ch steeper declines (15% and 21%). In fact, the Nova Scotia drop is the 2nd steepest in the country.269 In a separate study, GPI Atlantic found that the Nova Scotia crime rate today is 98% of the national average, up sharply from two-thirds the Canadian rate 25 years ago.270 While the province still has a significantly lower rate of serious crimes, the nationwide d ecline in social health documented by HRDC may indicate an erosion of important social networks that can eventually undermine health. 5.3 Volunteers Many volunteers work specifically in health, caregiving and social service networks, volunteering in hospitals, pallia tive care and hospice units, nursing homes and mental health associations. Others volunteer with first aid groups, the Heart and Stroke Foundation, the Cancer Society, the Lung Association, th e Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Diabetes Association, the VON and many other groups. Volunteers assist the elderly and disa bled, staff help lines, and work in food banks, soup kitchens, sheltered workshops, and homes and shelters for abused women and children. Others volunteers contribute to population health in the broa der sense by voluntarily coaching neighbourhood sports teams, working for groups li ke the Children's Aid Society, Big Brothers and Sisters, and Easter Seals, counselling victims, helping out in schools, literacy programs and youth groups, protecting the environment, organi zing church camps, fighting fires, helping in search and rescue operations, and promoti ng occupational health and work safety.271 Yet, despite its enormous contribution to populati on health, the work of vol unteers is invisible in our standard measures of progress based on ec onomic growth statistics, because money is not exchanged. If the voluntary sector were to decline in strength, th ere is no doubt that our standard of living, quality of life, and population health would decline markedly. Aside from the direct value of the work performed, the voluntary sector also strengthens communities and creates that Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Wome n's Health; \"Social Investment: It's Time to Invest in New Brunswick's Children, Familie s and Communities, Gender and Health Policy Discussion Series, Paper No. 4, MCEWH, November, 1999; Health is Everybody's Business: Collaboration and Social Inclusion in Nova Scotia and P.E.I., unpublished paper prepared for the Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health, Halifax, January 2000. 269 Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 58-60. 270 Dodds, Colin, and Ronald Colman, The Cost of Crime in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, April, 1999. 271 Statistics Canada, Caring Canadians, Involved Canadians, catalogue no. 71-542-XPE, 1998; Colman, Ronald, The Economic Value of Civic and Voluntary Work in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, 1998 with updates in 1999 and 2000, pages 10-11; GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 68 Measuring Sustainable Developmentwider network of social support identified by experts as a vi tal buffer against the stressors responsible for ill-health and disease. If voluntary services were replaced for pay, they would contribute $1.9 billion a year of services to the Nova Scotia economy. When volunteers' out-of-pocket expenses are added, the voluntary sector contributes services equi valent to nearly 10% of the total value of the Gross Domestic Product in the province, more than any other industry.272 Atlantic Canadians have by far th e highest rates of volunteering in the country, with residents of all four provinces contributing far more volunt ary hours per capita than other Canadians, with Nova Scotians registering the highest rates in the country, exceeding the national average by 43%. Nova Scotians give 138 million hours of volunt ary service time a year, equal to three and a half hours each week for every person 15 years and older. This is more than an hour a weeklonger per person than the Canadian average, a nd is the equivalent of more than 80,000 jobs in the province (Figures 17 and 18). In Figure 17, it should be noted that people who volunteer actually give far more hours per week on average, as the per capita hours are averag ed over the entire adul t population, including non- volunteers. The enormous contribution that Atlantic Canadi ans are making to population health through their voluntary activities cannot be ta ken for granted, as funding cuts and inadequate resources put increasing strains on volunteer and non-prof it social and community service groups. Results from the 1997 National Survey on Giving, Vo lunteering and Particip ating reveal that, on an hourly per capita basis, formal volunteering through non-profit organizations has declined by 4.7% across the country since 1987, and by 7.2% in Nova Scotia. 273 This decline in formal voluntary work appears to be accompanied by a s ubstantial increase in informal voluntary work, mainly by women. That shift appears related to ch anges in the health care system, and reductions in hospital services and government social se rvice expenditures, whic h have necessitated an increase in informal caregiving. Non-profit organizations report in creasing difficulties in recruiting volunteers for leadership positions that demand substantial time commitments, and in 272 Statistics Canada , General Social Survey 1998 , Housing, Family and Social Statistics Division, Statistics Canada; Economic valuations use Statistics Canada's calculations of equivalent market values for the different types of voluntary work, as given in Statistics Canada, Households' Unpaid Work: Measurement and Valuation, Studies in National Accounting, catalogue no. 13-603E , #3, December, 1995.

Volu nteer burnout is widely reported.274 The troubling trend appears to be related to labour market developments. Restructuring and downsizing of firms and government agencies ha s led to longer hours and higher rates of unpaid overtime for highly skilled and educated staff retained and required to maintain and exceed previous production levels with fewer staff. Th e highly educated, who ar e putting in longer paid work hours, also have a far higher rate of vol unteering than groups with less education, leading to a serious time squeeze on the voluntary sector.275 Figure 16 Volunteer Participation Rate, population 15+, 1998 (%) 274 Captain William Spry Community Centre, Under Siege: A Study of Non-Profit, Community-Based Agencies in an Era of Cuts, Halifax, Nova Scotia, January 1998, and More Crises, Less Resource s: The Impact of Cuts to Community Agencies, Halifax, December, 1996, reporting on the six-year period 1990-1996. 275 Overtime participation rates by educational qualification: Statistics Canada, Perspectives on Labour and Income, catalogue no. 75-001-XPE, Winter 1997; formal volunteer participation rates by educational level: Doreen Duchesne, Giving Freely: Volunteers in 71-535 #4, August 1989; Janis Wood Catano, Volunteers in Nova Scotia: A Pro file of Volunteers based on the 1987 National Survey on Volunteer Activity, Profile No. 28, Voluntary Action Directorate, Multicu lturalism and Citizenship Canada, Department of the Secretary of State, 1989, Maryanne Webber, Volunteers in Sports and Recreation, Labour and Household Surveys Division, Statistics Canada, presentation to the 16th annual conference and general meeting of the Recreation Association of Nova Scotia, November 16-19, 1989; Statistics Canada, Caring Canadians, Involved Canadians, catalogue no. 71-542-XPE, 1998, and Colman, op. cit., July 1998, pages 33-34.

In addition, Statistics Canada ha s identified working mothers as the most time stressed demographic group, contributing an aver age of 75 hours per week in paid and unpaid work, as they juggle job a nd family responsibilities.276 It is significant that earlier volunteer surveys found married women to have the highe st rate of volunteer participation of any household type.277 In short, time pressures are seriousl y threatening and leading to a documented decline in the web of voluntary so cial networks. This trend may have serious implications for population health if it is not arrested. 276 Statistics Canada, Overview of the Time Use of Can adians 1998, General Social Survey Cycle 12, Housing, Family and Social Statistics Division, special tabulation; and The Daily, November 9, 1998, catalogue no. 11-001E, pages 2-4; Shields, Margot, \"Long Working Hours and Health,\" Statistics Canada, Health Reports, 11 (2): 33-48, Autumn, 1999; Heart and Stroke Foundation, Annual Report Card on Canadians' Health, Toronto, 2000. 277 Webber, op. cit., page 12 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 71 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPART IV COSTS OF MENTAL ILLNESS _______________________________ GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 72 Measuring Sustainable Development6.

Depressed workers had 70% higher medical costs and highly stressed worker s had 46% higher costs than those who did not suffer from depression and high stress. 278 In addition, mental health problems can lead to a range of causes of premature death, including violence, substance abuse, and suicide.279 In the U.S., an estimated $16 bil lion a year is lost due to undia gnosed and untreated depression in the workplace, through lowered productivity, abse nteeism, injury, alcoholism, and related physical illness. Yet many employees are afraid to disclose addiction or mental illness, and therefore avoid support that may be availa ble through workplace health plans, employee assistance programs, or flexible work schedules.280 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia by population, this estimate implies that the province may be losing more than $50 million a year due toundiagnosed and untreated depression. Substantial research has found that stress negativ ely affects health, weak ens the immune system, and increases susceptibility to a wide range of illnesses. 281 According to Richard Surwit of Duke University Medical Centre: \"Experiencing stress is associated with the release of hormones that lead to energy mobilizataion - known as the \"fight or flight' response. Key to this energy mobilization is the transport of glucose in to the bloodstream, resulting in elevated glucose levels, which is a health threat for people with diabetes.\"282 A study in Detroit, Michigan, found that those living in dangerous and high-stress neighbourhoods had higher hypertension levels than those living in low-stress neighbourhoods.283 In a wide-ranging review of the literature, the American Journal of Health Promotion found stress to be the most costly of all modifiable risk factors.284 278 Goetzel, Ron, David Anderson, R.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 73 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIn addition to depression and stress, certain emotional states and personality types have been identified as risk factors for hypertension, heart di sease, and other chronic illnesses. In particular, hostility, aggression, cynicism, and isolation have been related to heart disease risk; suppressed anger has been linked to cancer and high blood pressure; and repressed emotionality has been found to predict both cancer and heart disease. Conversely, studies have found that confidence, optimism, self-efficacy, and a sense of coherence and control can buffer and moderate the effects of stress, and protect against illness. Reviewi ng the evidence, Jon Kaba t-Zinn em otional expression (or suppr ession) can contribute to the development of chronic disease.... C oping effectively with the full range of emotions we feel as human beings may be of great import ance for our health.... [A] middle path in the self -regulation of emotional exp ression, at least regarding anger and hostility, may be the avenue of choice in terms of improving health.\"285 Just as mental distress is frequently the precurs or of physical illness, a healthy state of mind is also recognized as the most important element in healing and restoring health after illness or injury. There is also strong evidence that mental health is important in coping successfully with stressors in general, and the stress of illne ss in particular, and for maintaining good physical health and healthy life practices.286 The World Health Organization's definition of health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, spiritual, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease,\" clearly recognizes the centrality of mental health. Given the importance of mental well-being, it is pe rhaps surprising how little data is available on the subject, and how hidden the evidence remains compared to measures of physical health. Nevertheless, from the scattered evidence, some interesting trends are di scernible, particularly from a gender perspective.287 In 1985, across the country, women registered lower levels of stress than men, by more than 10% in the four Atlantic provinces and 6% nation- wide. By 1991, female stress levels in Atlantic Canada had increased markedly and exceeded male levels by more than 7%. In Nova Scotia, the jump in female stress levels was pa rticularly dramatic, rising from 12 % below the male level in 284 Goetzel, Ron (ed), \"The Financial Impact of Health Promotion,\" American Journal of Health Promotion 15 (5), May/June 2001. 285 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 308-312. 286 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999, Health Canada and Statistics Canada, September, 1999, catalogue no. H39-467/1999E, page 220; T. Stephens, Population Mental Health in Canada, report prepared for the Mental Health Promotion Unit, Health Canada, May 1998. 287 Population health questionnaires in 1985 and 1991 and 1994-95 tested the degree to which individuals felt their stress levels to be high, moderate or low, using up to 18 different questions. At publication time, the author had not ascertained the degree to which the 1994-95 questions ar e comparable to those in the earlier two studies, which are comparable. For that reason, no general interpreta tions of trends over time are made here and only relative inter- provincial and male/female trends over time are assessed. The 1998 General Social Survey used ten questions to assess \"time stress\" among Canadians. In addition, the 1994 -95 National Population Health Survey for the first time included about 25 questions to assess psychological well-be ing according to three criteria - \"self-esteem,\" \"mastery\" (the extent to which people feel their life circumstances are under their control), and \"sense of coherence\" (the view that events are comprehensible, challenges are manageable , and life is meaningful.) The scaling system was based on a maximum score of 78 for coherence, 24 for self-esteem, and 28 for mastery. (See Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999, September 1999, Health Canada and Statistics Canada, pages 49 and 220-221.) GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 74 Measuring Sustainable Development1985 to 29% above the male level in 1991, and with near ly a third more Nova Scotia women reporting high stress levels in 1991 than in 1985.288 By 1994-95, female levels of chronic stress had become markedly higher than male levels right across the country, by more than 20%.289 And in 1998, female levels of time stress in Canada were more than 30% higher than male levels.290 While these different questionnaires are not strictly comparable, there does seem to be a cl ear trend of steadily higher stress levels for women. On the three dimensions of mental h ealth in the 1994-95 Na tional Population Health Survey (see footnote, previous page), 20% more Atlantic Canadian women than men registered low levels of psychological well-being.291 But these averages conceal significant inter-pr ovincial differences, including among the Atlantic provinces themselves. In all five surveys exam ined, Newfoundlanders have significantly higher levels of mental health than ot her Canadians, and consistently re port the lowest stress levels and the highest level of psychologi cal well-being in the country.292 In 1985, Newfoundland stress levels were 27% below the national average; in 1991 they were 16% less; and in 1994-95 they were 35% less. Newfoundlanders were also 30% mo re likely than other Canadians to report a high level of psychol ogical well-being. This high mental health status may explain why, despite higher levels of unemployment and lower income and schooling levels, Newfoundlande rs report far fewer ch ronic illnesses than other Canadians in certain key categories. They have the lowest rate of new cancer cases, asthma, allergies, and back problems in the count ry. They also have the lowest rates of suicide and sexually transmitted diseases in Canada, outcomes that are clearly linked to mental healthstatus. They are more likely to report their own hea lth as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" than any other Canadians, and they have the highest level of functional health status in the country. Interestingly, despite the province's ch ronic economic and employment problems, Newfoundlanders even report higher levels of work satisfaction than the national average. 293 Prince Edward Islanders also have a high level of mental health - 23% less than national levels for chronic stress, and 17% highe r for psychological well-being.294 Not surprisingly, Islanders were also the second most likely in the country to rate their own health as excellent or very good, a designation widely accepted as a reliable predic tor of health problems and health-care 288 Statistics Canada, Health Statistics, 1999, CD-ROM, Table 00060139.IVT: \"Level of Stress.\" 289 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 51. 290 Statistics Canada, General Social Survey, 1998, special tabulation for Table 2W; also Statistics Canada, The Daily, November 9, 1999, catalogue no. 11-001E, page 2. 291 Statistics Canada, Health Statistics 1999, CD-ROM, Table 00060150.IVT: \"Psychological Well Being.\" 292 Statistics Canada, Health Statistics 1999 Tables 00060139.IVT, and 00060150.IVT ; ACPH, Statistical Report, p. 51 293 These outcomes are taken from the variou s statistical tables in Health Canada, Statistical Report, including pages 219, 225, 231, 270, 287, 315, and elsewhere. \"Functional health status\" is based on the Comprehensive Health Status Measurement System which combines two components: a) a description of eight functional health attributes - - vision, hearing, speech, mobility, dexterity, cognition, emotion, and pain/discomfort; and b) a McMasterUniversity survey asking individuals to rank various health conditions in orde r of the severity of their effects on health. These two components are combined to produce an overall score for each respondent (ibid., page 230). 294 Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 51; Statistics Canada, Health Statistics 1999, table 00060150.IVT GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 75 Measuring Sustainable Developmentutilization.295 For the other two Maritime provinces, th e mental health signals are more mixed, with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick now regist ering lower levels of psychological well-being than other Canadians. The World Health Organization defi nition of health cited above ra nks mental and spiritual well- being as vital components of human health, and explicitly defines well -being and positive health as more than the absence of disease. The \"N ewfoundland advantage\" in this sphere, once fully recognized and appreciated for its considerable health impact, may provide a model for a realignment of our conventional definitions fr om a \"disease treatment\" perspective to a more complete and positive view of health. At the same time the apparent loss of mental health advantage once enjoyed by women in general a nd by Nova Scotians and New Brunswickers in particular may reawaken an appreciation for non-material quality of life factors that have historically distinguished this region. Even from a purely instrumentalist and cost-con scious perspective, however, policy makers have good reason to pay attention to trends in mental hea lth. Here is a basic fact that is not well known in the public arena. When psychiatric hospitals are included, mental disorders account for more hospital days in Canada than any other illnes s - over 15 million patient days in 1993-94 - more than the combined total for all circulatory and heart dis eases, nervous system disorders, cancers, and injuries (the next four most common cau ses of hospitalization.) Even in normal (non- psychiatric) hospitals, mental di sorders account for nearly six m illion hospital days a year, and are the second leading cause of hospitalizati on after cardiovascular diseases.296 Bucking the national trend toward shorter hospital stays, there ha s been an upward trend in the average length of hospital stay for treatmen t of mental disorders, with an overall increase in patient days in both acute-care and psychiatric hospitals. While th ere was a 15% decline in total hospital patient days in the early 1990' s, there was a parallel 33% increase in patient days for mental disorders. Affective psychoses, includi ng manic-depressive di sorders accounted for 23% of psychiatric separations, more than any other single category. Interestingly, the increase in patient days has occurred despite a decline in the number of discharges. This indicates a clear trend toward longer hospita l stays for fewer patients. More se rious cases are hospitalized, while less serious ones are being treated in the community.297 A gender breakdown is useful. Women have a 14% higher rate of psychiatric hospitalization overall than men. Across all ages, female rates of separation from psychiatric institutions are markedly higher than male rates for neurotic di sorders (ratio of 1.9:1), depressive (1.7:1) and adjustme nt reaction (1.4:1), while men have higher rates for alcohol and drug dependence (2.4:1) and schi zophrenia (1.4:1). In ge neral hospitals, women have a 21% higher rate of admissi on for mental disorders than men.298 295 Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, page 14; ACPH, Statistical Report, page 219. 296 Statistics Canada, Mental Health Statistics, 1993-94, catalogue no. 83-245-XPB, 1 996; Canadian Institute for Health Information, Hospital Morbidity Database, 1994-95, and 1995-96; Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, pages 142-143; ACPH, Statistical Report, pages 296-301, Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming.) 297 Statistics Canada, Mental Health Statistics, op. cit., CIHI, Hospital Morbidity Database; Health Canada, Toward a Healthy Future, pages 142-143; Health Canada, Statistical Report, pp. 296-298 and 301; 298 Health Canada, Statistical Report, pages 296 and 301. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 76 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIf the contribution of stress to serious illnesses were included, then it is clear that psychological distress is by far the most expensive component of our health care costs. Ye t this is far and away the most neglected element of our health care pa radigm with significant data gaps even for the most basic information. For example, despite th ese dramatic hospitalization figures, most mental health care is actually delivered in the commun ity. But the absence of a national database for community mental health services makes it diffi cult to examine the efficacy of mental health service delivery and its imp lications for population health. Figure 18 Distribution of Mental Illness Costs, Nova Scotia, 1998 Source: Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (forthcoming). In sum, a determined commitment to improve ment al well-being is probably the most strategic and cost-effective intervention that health departme nts can make. This is easier said than done, as the roots of stress and psychologi cal distress run deep, and are aff ected by subtle trends like the growing materialist and consumerist orientation of western society that neglects non-material quality of life variables. Our obsession with ec onomic growth, for example, frequently overrides concern with mental and spiritual well-being. Given the seriousness and magnitude of this challe nge, it is clearly essential to identify practical and cost-effective interventions to improve popula tion mental well-being. Given the high rates of female stress, depression, and hospital admissions fo r mental disorders, this issue is also a vital plank of any women's health strategy. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 77 Measuring Sustainable Development7. Stress and Chronic Disease In 1985 and 1991, there was a clear east-west stress gr adient in the country with higher levels of stress reported in Ontario a nd the west, and all four Atlant ic provinces ranking well below national levels. But throughout the 1990's both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick gradually moved towards national levels, and register ed increasing levels of chronic stress. In 1985, 14% fewer Nova Scotians reported high stress levels than other Canadians. By 1991, just 4% fewer Nova Scotians we re highly stressed; and by 1994-95, more Nova Scotians were chronically stressed than other Canadians. In the same year, eighteen percent more Nova Scotians were likely to report low levels of psychological well- being than other Canadians. New Brunswickers have also seen thei r stress levels rise, and now re gister similar levels of both chronic stress and psychological wellbeing to other Canadians. As noted earlier, Newfoundlanders and Prince Edward Islanders still register the lowest stress levels in the country.299 Abundant evidence exists that stress is an inde pendent risk factor for several chronic illnesses. However, more recent evidence has uncovered evidence on the physiological pathways betweenpsychosocial stress, emotional arousal, and dise ase. Two stress-related neuroendocrine pathways can adversely affect the heart - the pituitary ad renal system, activated when there is depression, withdrawal, or loss of control, and the symp athetic adrenal medullary system, activated in response to the or flight\" s yndrome. According to one analysis: \"[R]epeated sympathetic hyperactivit y and chronic oversecretion of stress hormones such as epinephrine, norepine phrine, and cortisol over a long span of time might lead, via mechanisms such as endothelial injury to the coronary arteries, to increased CHD risk in ty pe A individuals compared to type B individuals.\" 300 Other pathophysiological pathways between mental and physical illness ha ve been identified in adverse effects on the heart from the excretion of higher levels of test osterone by hostile and cynical individuals, and in depressive effects on the immune system due to isolation, negativity, and lack of trust. Depressed immunity, in turn, has been linked to a redu ced ability to identify and reject tumour cells at an early stage.301 Work stress, which may derive from time pressure s, work overload, high le vels of responsibility, lack of control, and non-supportive superiors, has been particularly identi fied in many studies as an important predictor of hypert ension and coronary heart diseas e. Male U.S workers with the highest levels of job strain were found to have four times the risk of heart attack as those with the 299 Statistics, Health Statistics 1999, tables 00060139 and 00060150; and Health Canada, Statistical Report, page 51. 300 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston , 1992, pages 312-313. Type A, or coronary-prone behaviour has been described as \"keen and ambitious\" with an \"engine...always set at full speed ahead.\" It is characterized by \"a sense of time urgency, impatience, competitiveness, drive, and intense desire to achieve.\" See Goldberg, Robert, \"Corona ry Heart Disease: Epidemiology and Risk Factors,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, page 27. 301 Kabat-Zinn, op. cit., page 314. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 78 Measuring Sustainable Developmentlowest levels of strain, indicating a risk level equal to that of smoking and high blood cholesterol. And a large, prospective, six-year Swedish study similarly concluded that job strain predicted future heart disease independe ntly of other risk factors in a population sample free of symptoms.302 While there are many accepted methods of indivi dual stress reduction, the evidence indicates that underlying social causes must be addressed if this important cause of disease is to be countered effectively. The correlation betw een high stress and smoking is well documented. For example, among Canadians reporting very low stress rates, just 21% of women and 27% of men are smokers. Among those reporting hi gh stress rates, 45% of women and 46% of men are smokers, with an almost direct linear relationship between stress level and smoking prevalence for both sexes.303 Statistics Canada also reports that the pr oportion of \"severely time-stressed\" youth, age 15-24, increased by 25% between 1992 and 1998, to 22% among young women and 10% among young men.304 High youth unemployment and falling real incomes for youth in the 1990s, as well as higher levels of student debt, ha ve all likely contributed to risi ng youth stress levels. During the same period, teenage smoking rates also increased dramatically.305 Though there are certainly many other factors involved, including drastic cu ts in tobacco taxes in several provinces, teenagers report stress as a primary reason for smoking. There has been less systematic exploration of the relationship between poor dietary habits, and stress. Rising stress levels, higher rates of t eenage smoking, and increased rates of obesity in Canada are all well documented. But at this st age the connections betw een stress and obesity remain circumstantial. Certainly they are wo rthy of further exploration. One of the most important areas for research is the possibility th at the disturbing increase in stress levels and overweight may be related to an increase in unhealthy lifestyles due to changing employment patterns and overwork. 302 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 305. 303 Statistics Canada, National Population Health Survey Overview, 1994-95, catalogue no. 82-567, pages 10-11. See also Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic and Cancer Ca re Nova Scotia, Halifax, October 1990, Figure 3, page 9. 304 Respondents classified as \"severely ti me stressed\" by Statistics Canada are those that give affirmative answers to seven out of ten questions on a time stress questionnaire that includes questions like \"Do you consider yourself a workaholic?\", \"Do you worry that you don't spend enough time with your family and friends?\", and \"Do you feel that you're constantly under stress trying to accomplish more than you can handle?\" 1992 results from Statistics Canada, As Time Goes By...Time Use of Canadians, General Social Survey, by Judith Frederick, catalogue no. 89-544E, pages 15-16; 1998 results from Statistics Canada, The Daily, November 9, 1999, catalogue no. 11-001E, pages 2-4; and Statistics Canada, General Social Survey, Cycle 12 , 1998, Housing, Family and Social Statistics Division, special tabulation. 305 Ontario Tobacco Research Unit, Monitoring the Ontario Tobacco Strategy: Youth and Tobacco in Ontario, 1997, Ontario Tobacco Research Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, 1997; Province of Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia Student Drug Use, 1998; Highlights Report and Technical Report, Halifax, Nova Scotia Department of Health, Drug Dependency, Dalhousie University, Communications Nova Sco tia, 1998; both references cited in Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health (ACPH), Toward a Healthy Future: Second Report on the Health of Canadians, Health Canada and Statistics Canada, September, 1999, pages 119-123. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 79 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentSeventy percent of families are now dual-earners , and the combined burden of paid and unpaid work time is increasing across the country. Canadian women have doubled their share of participation in the paid labour fo rce in the last 40 years. Worki ng mothers now put in an average 75-hour week of paid and unpaid work, and work ing parents have an increasingly difficult time juggling the combined pressures of job and household responsibilitie s. Not surprisingly, Statistics Canada ranks 38% of working moth ers as \"severely time stressed\" based on a 10- question time stress survey.306 Work pressures may be squeezing out time that was once spent cooking and preparing food at home, and lending impetus instead to the spread of fast food restaurants. Statistics Canada's time use surveys show a dramatic decline in time spent cooking, preparing meals and washing dishes. Nova Scotians spent two hours le ss per week in their kitchens in 1998 than in 1992, a decline of 30% in just six years. At the same time, the proportion of the average household food budget spent eating out has steadily increased.307 It is likely that healthy diets ha ve suffered in the transition from home cooking to greater reliance on prepared fast food. A Harvard University study of 16,000 children rele ased this year found that the more families ate together, the more fr uits and vegetables and the less fried food were consumed. Children who had regular family meal s also had a far higher intake of important nutrients, such as calcium, fibre, folate, iron, and vitamins B and E, and had healthier diets at other times of day as well than ch ildren who rarely ate family meals.308 Commenting on the study results, Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, associate professor of clinical pediatrics and medicine at New York Presbyteria n Hospital, Columbia University, remarked: \"In terms of teaching your children good habits, the dinner table is great....There is a tremendous amount of data to show that healthy ha bits learned early pe rsist into adulthood.\"309 Conversely, the current trend away from family meals to fast food may therefore have negative health impacts into adulthood. Again, though increasing time stress is a trend ac ross the country, some European countries have demonstrated viable alternativ es to the current North Ameri can tendency to work longer hours. The Netherlands, for example, has reduced its unemployment rate from 12.2% to 2.7% byreducing and redistributing work hours, to allo w workers to balance their jobs and household responsibilities more successfully. The Dutch now have the shortest work hours of any industrial country - 1,370 hours a year, compared to 1,732 hour s in Canada. France reduced its work week to 35 hours, and international time use surveys indicate that Danish citizens have an average of 11 hours more free time each week than Canadians. 310 306 For details, see GPI Atlantic, Women's Health in Atlantic Canada: A Statistical Portrait, Halifax, February, 2000, Maritime Centre of Excellence for Women's Health. 307 Statistics Canada, Family Expenditure in Canada, 1982 and 1992, catalogue no. 82-555; Statistics Canada, Family Food Expenditure in Canada, 1996, catalogue no. 82-554. 308 Randi Hutter Epstein, \"Linking Children's Health to Fami ly Meals: Study shows families who eat together have better eating habits,\" The New York Time, reprinted in The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax, 29 March, 2000. 309 Idem. 310 For an excellent account of shorter work tim e initiatives in Europe, see Hayden, Anders, Sharing the Work, Sparing the Planet: Work Time, Consumption, and Ecology, Between the Lines, Toronto, 1999. For Danish figures and comparative free time estimates among nations, see Harvey, Andrew, \"Canadian Time Use in a Cross-National GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 80 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentA recent Statistics Canada study found that women working longer hours were 40% more likely to decrease their level of phys ical activity and 2.2 times more likely to experience major depressive episodes than women working standa rd or short hours. Women with high levels of job strain were 1.8 times more likely to expe rience an unhealthy weight gain compared to women with low job strain; while women who redu ced their work hours had only half the odds of a weight gain compared to those who continued to work standard hours.311 These findings are very significant in understa nding the relation between long work hours and the rise in rates of obesity. They are the first direct evidence in Canada linking work stress and long work hours with weight gain. While the mech anisms linking the two factors are not yet well understood, it is likely both that meal preparat ion time is getting squeezed out and replaced with unhealthier fast food, and that the stress itself may produce more nervous snacking. In addition, longer work hours are also squeezing out exercise and physical activity. In short, healthy diets and healthy weights ma y depend on an honest re-examination of our work culture, and on ways of balancing job and house hold responsibilities more effectively. Despite the massive influx of women into the paid work force, work arrangements have hardly changed from the era of single-earner families. There is a clear need for family-friendly workarrangements that accommodate the needs of two-earner households. 8. Psychosocial Interventions to Overcome Mental Illness Just as mental illness increases the susceptib ility to a range of ch ronic physical conditions, evidence indicates that psychosoc ial stresses can be modified by psychosocial interventions to reduce heart disease and other chronic disease ri sks. While earlier sections of this report have mentioned social interventions that can redu ce disease, including alleviation of poverty, inequality, and work stress, this section focu ses on individual interventions such as may be applicable in a physicia n-patient in teraction. At the individual level, effective methods of st ress reduction frequently use the mind to promote healing. Relaxation and breathing exercises, meditation, cognitive behavioural therapy, guided imagery, prayer, self-esteem techniques, hypnother apy, and similar methods have been shown to reduce blood glucose levels and asso ciated diabetic risk, asthma attacks, psychological distress (including depression and an xiety), and a wide range of medical symptoms.312 In particular, such stress management techniques have been shown to be most effective when integrated with a Perspective,\" Statistics in Transition, November, 1995, volume 2, no. 4, pages 595-610, especially Table 3, page 603. 311 Margot Shields, \"Long Working Hours and Health,\" Statistics Canada, Health Reports, volume 11, no. 2, autumn 1999, pages 33-48. 312 Studies on the efficacy of these methods, from several re spectable journals, including Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, American Journal of Psychiatry, American Journal of Health Promotion, and others, are summarized at: www.healthjourneys.com/hotresearch.asp . GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 81 Measuring Sustainable Developmentregime of regular, moderate physical activity, smoking cessation, low-fat vegetarian diets, and a strengthening of social supports.313 These methods have improved immune function and sleep, and helped smokers to quit. They have also proven effective in secondary and tert iary prevention, assisting in the rehabilitation of stroke victims and patients undergoing chemothe rapy, and in the treatm ent of irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, end stage renal disease, and ot her chronic conditions.314 Research into the efficacy of these methods is on ly in its infancy, and further large cohort and prospective studies are necessary to provide more evidence. According to Dr. Lewis Mehl-Mad rona, the healing traditions of indigenous peoples in North America can also contribute to disease pr evention and health promotion through their incorporation of the spiritual and emotional dimensions of health: \"It has been shown over and over in rese arch that, if you take care of people's emotional and spiritual needs when they are in crisis, their consumption of medical services goes down. Society benef its because less work is lost, and the patient benefits because they spe nd less time in the sick room.\"315 313 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 316. 314 Idem. 315 Interview text available at www.garynull.com . GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 82 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPART V THE IMPACT OF AGING ON MEDICAL COSTS _______________________________ GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 83 Measuring Sustainable Development9. Delaying Diseases Asso ciated with Old Age It is sometimes argued that disease prevention and health promotion efforts do not save money, because the avoidance of premature death simply postpones health care expenditures to older ages when the vast majority of medical expens es occur. One study, for example, concludes that \"smoking cessation would lead to increased health care costs,\" because the premature deaths of smokers save money in the long run by avoiding increased health care usage by the elderly.316 Ethical problems have arisen when such argumen ts have been used by the tobacco industry to counter lawsuits for recovery of health care costs due to smoking. According to the Mississippi Attorney-General: \"It is selling death as a benefit. This is offensive to human decency, an affront to justice, and uncharacteristic of civilize d society. The industry should not be rewarded for relieving the State of the bur den of caring for many of its elderly citizens. It is not doing th e State a favor by killing smokers early and saving the State money; and the amounts the State seeks in restitution should not be reduced by such grizzly 'savings.'\"317 Indeed, this issue highlights a fundamental limita tion of cost-benefit analysis. The decisions to value life itself and to care for elderly citizen s in their old age repr esent fundamental social values and goals that may be worthy of a financia l investment whether or not they save money. If saving money were the only goal, then all old peopl e should be killed before they become costly to the health care system. The ar gument that premature deaths save money would not apply only to smokers. Thus it is valid to compare a smoker's total costs to the heal th care system over his or her lifetime with the costs accrued by a non-smoker over the same period of time. But cost- benefit analysis cannot be used to compare the costs of dead smokers with those of live non- smokers, and then to claim the former as \"savings\" or \"benefits.\"318 But leaving ethical and theoretical issues aside for a moment, is it true that health promotion efforts that prevent disease and save lives ma y increase the demand for medical services by an aging population that lives longe r? For that argument to be true, longer life spans would inevitably be accompanied by longe r lifetime periods of disability and/or longer lifetime demand for medical services. A growing body of evidence now challenges this argument on financial and monetary grounds, noting that lifetime health care costs are actually lower for those with fewer modifiable risk factors. For example, those who exercise re gularly have much less overall lifetime morbidity than those who are sedentary, indicating that avoided medical costs may be saved absolutely 316 Barendregt, Jan, Luc Bonneux, and Paul van der Maas, \"The Health Care Costs of Smoking,\" The New England Journal of Medicine, 1997 (337): 1052-1057. 317 Moore, Michael JD, and Charles Mikhail MD, \"A Ne w Attack on Smoking: Using an Old-time Remedy,\" Public Health Reports 111, May-June, 1996, page 201. 318 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, November, 2000, pages 21-22. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 84 Measuring Sustainable Developmentrather than simply deferred to older ages.319 Physical activity helps prevent falls and hip fractures, and can preserve independence in ol d age, thereby avoiding costly nursing home and other institutional care.320 Thus, an issue in costing is not only primary pr evention of disease, but also the postponement of disease to older ages, the reduction of lifetime disability and dependence, and the consequent reduction in health care costs.321 A study by the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) estimated that a 5-year population-wide delay in onset of cardiovascular disease would save the U.S. $100 billion annually. A 5-year dela y in occurrence of hip fracture could cut the number of events by 140,000 annually, saving $7.3 billion a year.322 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia in proportion to population, the savings amount to $350 million a year for cardiovascular disease and $25 million a year for hip fractures, with 500 such fractures avoided annually in the province. The AFAR study concluded: \"...[A] strategic aging research effo rt would benefit the nation's economy and boost productivity.... The United States wi ll save billions of dollars by keeping older people out of hospitals, out of operating rooms and out of nursing homes.... [L]ong life can be healthy and productive to the end, with the fo rce of morbidity compressed to an irreducible minimum.\"323 This compression of morbidity hypothesis is at the root of challenges to the widely held assumption that an aging popula tion inevitably produces escalati ng health care costs, and it demonstrates that health promotion can save money as well as lives. 9.1 The Compression of Morbidity The hypothesis that lifetime sickness can be compre ssed into an ever shor ter period just prior to death was advanced by James Fries, MD , in a seminal article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1980. Fries predicts: \"...that the number of very old persons will not increase, that the average period of diminished physical vigor will decrea se, that chronic disease will occupy a smaller proportion of the ty pical life span, and that the need for medical care in later life will decrease. In forecasting health, the inte raction between two sets of observations has gone unnoticed. The first se t demonstrates that the length of the human life is fixed - that man is mortal and that natural death may occur without disease. The second set indicates that chronic disease can be postponed and that 319 Fries, James, Everett Koop, Jacque Sokolov, Carson Beadle, and Daniel Wright, \"Beyond Health Promotion: Reducing the Need and Demand for Medical Care, Health Affairs 17 (2), page 71. 320 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Physical Inactivity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, May, 2002, page 8 and references in footnote 14. 321 The Institute of Medicine, Extending Life, Enhancing Life: A National Research Agenda on Aging, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1991. 322 American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR), Putting Age on Hold, Alliance for Aging Research, 1996,page 5. (2001 $Can 100 billion = 1996 $US 69 billion; 2001 $Can 7.3 billion = 1996 $US 5 billion). 323 AFAR, op. cit., page 6 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 85 Measuring Sustainable Developmentmany of he 'markers' of aging may be modified. If these two premises are granted, it follows that the time between birth and first permanent infirmity must increase and that the average pe riod of infirmity must decrease.\"324 To verify the first premise, Fries examines a centu ry of demographic data to demonstrate that the dramatic increase in life expectancy in the 20th century is due almost entirely to the elimination of premature death, particularly neonatal mo rtality. For persons 40 years and older, life expectancy increased relatively little; for thos e 75-years-old, the change was barely perceptible, suggesting a natural limit to the life span. If all premature de ath were eliminated, \"statistics suggest that under ideal societal conditions mean age at deat h is not far from 85 years.\"325 Thus, while life expectancy at birth has incr eased dramatically (by 30 years) since 1900, life expectancy at age 65 has increased by less th an 6 years since 1900. In 1900, a 65-year-old man could expect to live another 11.5 years. At the end of the 20th century, a 65-year old man could expect to live another 16 years. For 65-year-o ld women, the corresponding figures are 12 years in 1900 and 19 years at the end of the 20th century. 326 Thus, the huge leap in average life expectancy at birth is due almost entirely to the sharp drop in infant and child mortality rather than to an increase in the length of old age. The sharp decline in premature death resulted from the prevention of infectious dis eases that took their greatest toll in the fi rst year of life.327 The second premise is verified by epidemiologi cal evidence demonstrating that behaviours like non-smoking, exercise, good diet, and healthy weight, as well as social conditions, greatly delay the onset of many chronic diseases, modify the aging process, and support vitality and independence in old age. \"The amount of disability can decrease as morbidity is compressed into the shorter span between the increasing age at onset of disability and the fixed occurrence of death. The end of the peri od of adult vigor will come later than it used to.\"328 The assumption that chronic disease is an inev itable by-product of aging has been challenged most strongly in the accumulated evidence on coronary heart disease: \"The evidence overwhelmingly demonstr ates that CHD is not an inevitable consequence of aging, but rather a disease process based on physiologic mechanisms related to abnormal con centrations of blood lipids, and is accelerated by a number of other risk factors, most of which are related to thediet and lifestyle associated with an industr ialized, urban society. It is also clear 324 Fries, James, \"Aging, Natural Death, and the Compression of Morbidity,\" The New England Journal of Medicine, 303 (3): 130-135, July 17, 1980, page 130. 325 Ibid., page 131.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 86 Measuring Sustainable Developmentthat the pace of the atherosclerotic proce ss can be modified by alteration of risk factors, even when significant arterial disease is already present.\"329 This \"compression of senescence\" suggests a prof ound shift in health policy, spending priorities, and attitudes towards aging and death: \"[T]he practical focus on health improvem ent over the next decades must be on chronic instead of acute disease, on mo rbidity not mortality, on quality of life rather than its duration, and on postponeme nt rather than cure.... The older person requires opportunity for expre ssion and experience and autonomy and accomplishment, not support and care and feeding and sympathy. High-level medical technology applied at the end of a natural life span epitomizes the absurd. The hospice becomes more at tractive than the hospital. Human interaction, rather than respirators and dialysis and other mechanical support for failing organs, is indicated at th e time of the 'terminal drop.'\"330 9.2 Reducing Illness among the Elderly According to the 2001 Census results, recently re leased, 14% of Nova Scotia's population is now 65 or older, up from 13% in 1996.331 By 2011, nearly 16% of Nova Scotians will be 65 and older, and by 2036 this will rise to more than 28%. The population over 80 wi ll triple from 3% in 1996 to 9% in 2036.332 The province now has a median age of 38.8, the highest in the country.333 Under conventional scenarios, these demographic trends are projected to stretch health care resources beyond the breaking point. Twenty-five years ago, with just 11% of the population, the elderly already occupied one-thir d of all hospital beds and consum ed one-quarter of total health care expenditures. As their proportion in the population increases, according to traditional analyses, this disproportionate consumpti on of health services could escalate.334 But if Fries is correct, as more recent eviden ce indicates, this escal ation of health care expenditures is not inevitable and can be prev ented by concerted health promotion efforts now. Because it has the country's oldest population, Nova Scotia is a highly suitable laboratory and testing ground for such efforts, particularly t hose aimed at what has been termed \"successful aging.\" We have already noted that re gular physical activity reduces lifetime morbidity and extends independence into old age. But health promotion efforts targeted specifi cally at the elderly can 329 Ockene, Ira, \"The Rationale for Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 120. 330 Ibid., pages 134-135. 331 The National Post, 17 July, 2002, page A9. 332 Lilley, Susan, and Joan Campbell, Shifting Sands: The Changing Shape of Atlantic Canada: Economic and Demographic Trends and their Impacts on Seniors, Health Canada, March, 1999, page 6, table 2. 333 The National Post, 17 July, 2002, page A9. 334 Wolinsky et al., \"Health Services Utilization among the Noninstitutionalized Elderly,\" Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24: 325-337, 1983, cited in Province of Br itish Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 29. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 87 Measuring Sustainable Developmentalso be effective in reducing health care costs. In the U.S., it has been estimated that one in four elderly outpatients, one-half of el derly hospital pa tients, and two in five nursing home residents suffer from malnutrition, particularly protein ca lorie malnutrition, resul ting in higher morbidity and mortality. Data also indicat e a 25-45% decrease in hospital ut ilization, shorte r hospital stays, and improved clinical outcomes among senior s who receive nutri tional screening and intervention.335 Given these dramatic statistics, it is not surp rising that, among the elderl y, nutritional risk has been found to be the single best predicto r of physician and emergency room visits, hospitalization, and hospita l readmission, all of which represen t the most expensive aspects of health care utilization. One U.S. study found that nearly 60% of elderly patients with hip fractures were in a protein-de pleted state during hospitalizati on, producing more complications, longer hospital stays, lower lik elihood of return to preopera tive function level, and lower possibility of survival one year after fracture, than well-nourished patient s. These data indicate that nutritional interventions among th e elderly can be highly cost-effective.336 Certainly malnutrition is less expensive to prevent than to treat. Malnourished patients stay in health care institutions 2/3 longer than well-nour ished patients. The average cost of hospital stay for well-nourished patients is $32,000 compared to $50,000 for malnourished patients. And 335 Coombs, J., and N.

These U.S. data are also supported by a Canadian assessment of nursing home residents in London, Ontario, where 45.5% of residents were undernourished, among whom 18% were severely undernouri shed: Poduch, Carol, \"The Dietitian as Canadian Nursing Home, 7 (1): 5-7, February-March, 1996, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 44. 336 \"Nutrition Screening Improves Care and Saves Money,\" Nutrition Screening Initiatives, Issue 16, page 5, fall, 1995; \"Employers and Managed Care Plans Agree: Nutrition Care Matters,\" Nutrition Screening Initiatives, Issue 16, fall, 1995; Wolinsky et al., \"Health Services Utilization among the Noninstitutionalized Elderly,\" Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24: 325-337, 1983; Sullivan, Dennis, \"Risk Factors for Early Hospital Readmission in a Select Population of Geriatric Rehabilitation Patients: The Significance of Nutritional Status,\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 1992; Patterson, Brendan et al., \"Protein Depletion and Metabolic Stress in Elderly Patients who have a Fracture of the Hip,\" The Journal of Bone and Joint Injury, 74-A February, Clinical Outcomes: The Case for Medical Nutrition Therapy,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 96 (4): 361-369, April, 1996; all c ited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., pages 28, 29, 36-38, 42-43. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 88 Measuring Sustainable Developmentoverall charges for malnourished patients are three times greater th an for well-nourished patients.337 As well, under-nutrition leads to poor wound heal ing, with nursing home residents at particular risk. It has been estimated that the average co st of treating pressure sores in Canada is $16,500. To avoid these costs, weight loss monitoring of nursing home residents has been recommended, along with provision of adequate protein and ca lories to speed recovery if sores occur.338 Summarizing 1,600 U.S. case studies, and th e substantial evidence on malnutrition among elderly hospital patients, one group of researchers concludes: Malnutrition is associated with negative hea lth outcomes and increased use of resources; Nutrition support to malnourished patients across a range of medical conditions reduces complications, morbidity, length of hospital st ay, mortality, and over all use of resources; Nutrition therapies provided by dieticia ns result in substantial cost savings.339 Nutritional intervention can also reduce drug use among seniors, and thus save money. For example, dietary fibre supplementation has been shown to reduce and virtually eliminate the need for laxative drugs, suppositories, and enemas in treating constipation in geriatric and nursing home settings, producing dramatic cost savings. In one six-month study, a daily one-ounce bran-applesauce-prune juice mixture re duced laxative use to 14% of baseline. 340 One analyst concludes that \"geriatric assessmen t is not complete unle ss it includes a nutritional assessment,\" and that nutritional assessment a nd intervention represents the cornerstone of preventive medicine for the elderly. He reco mmends that \"a full time dietitian should be available for each 100-200 patients in a nursing home.\"341 These conclusions are supported by other analysts who recommend that all elderly long-stay patients should have a comprehensive nutritional assessment to correct any dietary deficiencies.342 337 Gallagher-Allred, Charlette, and Sherry Bockus, \"Spe cialized Nutritional Support in Long-Term Care,\" Journal of Long Term Care Administrators, Summer, 1990; cited in Province of Britis h Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 43.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 89 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPART VI THE VALUE OF HEALTH PROMOTION _______________________________ GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 90 Measuring Sustainable Development10. Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Prevention Ten years ago, the Premier of Nova Scotia, th e Health Minister, and the Provincial Health Council announced their intention to \"shift our emphasis to the promotion of health and the prevention of illness, disability, and premature death.\" In a joint statement, they acknowledged that this shift included: a healthy environment, with cl ean air, water, and soil, and safe places to live and work; social justice - addressing poverty, unemploymen t, racism, illiteracy, and other issues that affect health; healthy living - supporting community, family, a nd individual efforts to control the factors that affect their health.343 Yet the major shift announced in 1992 has not yet translated into a significant reallocation of resources, despite substantial evidence that pr eventive interventions may not only improve the health of the population, but save money as well. 10.1 The Challenge of Demonstrating Cost Savings The understanding that health promotion can be co st-effective is not new. In 1974, the Lalonde report, A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, noted that modifying lifestyle and nutritional habits could reduce excessive morta lity and sickness. In 1984 the Canadian Medical Association translated this fi nding into an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of preventive medicine. That document, authored by Allan Brown of Carleton University, noted that we may already \"have reached a point of di minishing marginal returns to curative medicine; behavioural and environmental factors have become relatively more important as determinants of health.\" Brown's report cited the 1981 Task Forc e on Fiscal Federalism in Canada: \"[A]dded investment in the acute care system will yield low marginal improvements in health. Sma ll improvement at large cost is likely to remain the rule until some new breakthrough appears, for example, in the treatment of cancer and heart disease. It now seems th at the next great advances must be made through better nutrition, more healthful lifestyles, cleaning up the environment, greater safety in the workplace and meas ures to reduce automobile accidents.\"344 This understanding is not just a matter of description or analys is, but of policy. Nova Scotia currently devotes less than 2% of its health care budget to prevention.345 But if curative treatment is producing diminishing returns and if prevention is more cost-effective, then efficient use of 343 \"Nova Scotia's Health Goals,\" Provincial Health Council, signed by the Premier an d Minister of Health, Nova Scotia, August, 1992. 344 Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 1. 345 Statistics Canada, CANSIM Database, \"Provincial General Government Revenue and Expenditure, Fiscal Year Ending March 31, Annual,\" tables on \"Health\" and \"Preve ntive Care.\" Percentage confirmed to author by sources within NS Department of Health. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 91 Measuring Sustainable Developmentsociety's limited health care re sources requires a reallocation of some expenditures from acute care to preventive measures. While this may seem obvious, there are significant obstacles to such a reallocation that have hitherto prevented any major shift in public spending priorities. These obstacles might be classified as political, economic, and methodological. Politically, the cost savings to be realized through prevention are di fficult to sell, partly because preventive health care is a long-te rm investment in which costs ar e realized sooner than benefits. Current investments in nutritional education, smoking cessation, access to recreational facilities, alleviation of poverty, and othe r preventive actions will produce their highest returns 15, 20 or more years hence, and certainly be yond the tenure of a current government.346 Secondly, for policy-makers eager to demonstrate results, suc cessful curative interventions such as coronary bypass surgery produce immediate, tangible, and obvious outcomes - recovery from illness - whereas the mark of successful health promo tion is that nothing dramatic happens. As one analyst has noted, when someone exercises, ea ts healthily, and does not smoke, and then 20 years later does not develop hear t disease, diabetes, hypertensi on, or lung cancer, \"the medical community does not rejoice at this accomplishment because from their perspective nothing happened.\"347 There are also practical economic obstacles to r ealizing cost savings to the health care system from successful preventive interventions. First, it must be demonstrated that averting an illness now does not increase the need for subsequent and more costly interventions later. The evidence presented in the last chapter on compression of morbidity, and on lower lifetime morbidity for those who exercise regularly for example, is ther efore essential to demonstrate long-term net cost savings. Secondly, successful prevention and reduced chronic disease incidence will onlyproduce cost savings if health care resources are actually reallocated to other social priorities, rather than reallocated to other curative sectors within the health care system. In other words, the fact that an intervention prevents an illness at a particular point in time does not automatically translate into net savings to the health care sy stem. It may well be that such net economic savings will only be realized when we stop devoting ma ssive resources to prolonging the life of dying individuals. Yet it may be poli tically suicidal to reduce the current level of expenditure on curative methods. 348 There are also methodological obst acles to demonstrating the cost savings that may derive from prevention. First, there are differe nt types of analysis. Cost-effect iveness analysis is concerned to identify how a given goal (usually years of life or disability-free life years gained) can be attained using minimal resources. The costs asso ciated with alternativ e techniques can then be compared through economic analysis. Cost-benef it analysis goes a step further and applies economic criteria to the goal as well as to the means of achievi ng the goal, by asking whether the goal is worth the cost. While cost-effectiveness an alysis quantifies only the costs in dollar terms, cost-benefit analysis quantifies the benefits in dollar terms as well, and compares them withcosts. Thus, even if an intervention is cost-eff ective compared to acute- care intervention, it may 346 Brown (1984), op. cit., page 4. 347 Goetzel, Ron, \"The Financial Impact of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs - Why is it so Hard to Prove Value?\" Introduction to special issue of the American Journal of Health Promotion 2001; 15 (5): 277-280, May/June, 2001, page 278 348 Brown (1984), op. cit., pages 5 and 18. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 92 Measuring Sustainable Developmentbe deemed inefficient from the perspective of cost-benefit analysis if the benefits do not outweigh the costs.349 By confusing these two kinds of analyses, invest ment in prevention may be held to a different economic standard than acute ca re interventions. While preventi ve interventions are frequently expected to pay for themselves over time, or to produce net cost savings through benefits outweighing costs, expensive medical technologies are rarely justified on the grounds of cost- benefit analysis. Critics argue that preventive interventions should be justified on the same grounds as acute care interventions - that they provide he alth benefits - and that they should be compared with acute care interventions on ground s of cost-effectiveness in achieving a given health outcome. Further difficulties arise due to different time fram es, with 1-5 year evaluations typical for cost- effectiveness assessments, and much longer time fr ames (3-20 years) for cost-benefit analysis. Because of the length of time between an inte rvention - say to increase physical activity, reduce dietary fat intake, or improve literacy or inco me adequacy - and health outcomes, few proper control studies exis t that are capable of evaluating benef its and costs over a sufficiently long time frame.350 In cost-benefit analysis pa rticularly, some variables are very di fficult to quantify, such as the cost of pain and suffering, or costs to the individua l in adopting a healthy regimen. Painful illnesses such as migraines, which have minor impacts on mortality and morbidity rates, may beundervalued in cost-benefit studies. Putting a dol lar value on human life is also fraught with difficulties, with the human capital approach valuing economically productive work, but undervaluing the cost of illness or the benefits or preventi on among the elderly or retired. Though widely used, this method does not count ne t productivity gains to the economy when the beneficiaries of interventions are unemployed or elderly. There are many other methodological difficulties, due to lack of data, conceptual problems, and uncertainties (such as the difficulty ofaccounting for the costs of false-positive s and false-negatives in screening.) 351 These and other difficulties have presented major challenges to reallocati ng resources from acute care to health promotion. Where possible, this report does refer to evidence on cost savings, because such evidence is arguably the most effective tool in today's policy environment ininfluencing policy and highlighti ng the potential benefits of prevention. But we always view such evidence as a secondary rather than prim ary justification, with im pacts on health the more important criterion. Whether cost-effectiveness analys is or cost-benefit analysis is used, the first requirement is always to assess what types of preventive strategies can actually be effective in promoting and maintaining health in practice. Such prior efficacy analysis must take precedence over any economic valuation. 349 Brown (1984), op. cit., page 4. 350 Brown (1984), op. cit., page 16. 351 Brown (1984), op. cit., pages 4-9 detail some of the diffi culties in realizing and demonstrating the cost savings of prevention. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 93 Measuring Sustainable Development10.2 Key Elements of an Effective Health Promotion Strategy Evidence indicates that the most effective hea lth promotion strategy is a comprehensive one, embracing interventions over the life-cycle, including prenatal counselling, school-based programs, community-based public health init iatives, worksite programs, media campaigns, physician advice in clinical settings, and prog rams for the elderly. Community approaches, such as public smoke bans and worksite interventions, have the potential to reach large numbers ofpeople, while clinical programs can be highly efficacious in promoting behaviour change among high risk individuals. 352 Successful health promotion also sees behaviour change in the context of social, economic, and cultural conditions rather than as an isolated task controlled by an individua l. It facilitates social and environmental change, enhances social netw orks and social supports, and ensures access to healthful foods, recreational facilities, and he alth care for disadvantaged groups.353 Health promotion is not, therefore, the exclusive c oncern of government health departments, but requires the close cooperation of many sectors of government, community, business, educational institutions, and the media. As a publication of the Canadian Medical Association noted nearly 20 years ago: \"Health is the respons ibility not just of the Ministry of Health but al so of all the ministries.\"354 Another analysis has noted that health behavi ours respond to social and environmental stimuli: \"Changing the environment in which pe ople act involves changing the rules about acceptable behavior. For example , smoking prevalence is steadily decreasing as increasingly more public areas ban or restrict smoking.\"355 Thus, safe workplaces, improved mass transit, taxa tion and social assistance policies, municipal water supply inspections, and a wide range of other policies - the purview of many different government departments - can all be co nsidered aspects of \"health policy.\" An effective strategy will also be targeted both at high-risk groups that are socio-economically and medically at risk, and at the general popul ation. It will combine policy changes (taxes, budget allocations, and regulations like food and cigarette labels and sm oke-free public places) with incentives to individual action and changes in insurance coverage to include preventive services like nutrition coun selling and smoking cessation programs. Expanded insurance coverage will encourage clinic-based prev ention as a vital adj unct to population-based approaches. 352 Thompson, Beti, and Michael Pertschuk, \"Community Intervention and Advocacy,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 494-495. 353 See for example the position statement of the American Dietetic Association: \"The Role of Nutrition in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs - Position of the ADA,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 98: 205-208, 1998. 354 Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 16. 355 Thompson, Beti, and Michael Pertschuk, \"Community Intervention and Advocacy,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 496. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 94 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentFinally, a successful health promotion strate gy must have a long-term view, since current investments will realize their most substantial savings and returns 20 and 30 years hence. Sincethe proportion of Nova Scotia's population over 65 will double in the next 30 years, the time toimplement such a strategy is clearly the present if health care costs ar e not to spiral out of control. Fortunately the province does not have to re-invent the wheel, but can base its strategy on best practices and successful models implemented elsewhere. Despite the challenges of craf ting and implementing such a comprehensive health promotion strategy, the evidence i ndicates that, in addition to its health benefits, it can also be highly cost- effective in avoiding both direct medical cost s and indirect productivity losses. Many of the components of an effective health promotion stra tegy have been identifie d earlier in this report, and this concluding section therefore focuses on just a few elements not previously discussed. A Note on the Precautionary Principle The Genuine Progress Index adopts the precautionary principle as th e basis of its approach and economic assessments. The principle basically hold s that when there is substantial evidence of potentially serious or irreversible risks, the lack of conclusive scientific certainty should not justify inaction to avert those risks. The principl e is generally applied to environmental risks like climate change, but it can equally be applied to the field of health promotion and disease prevention, since failure to act can cause substantial avoidable de ath and disability, as well as spiralling public health care costs as the population ages. For example, even though there is strong and consistent observational evidence from case- control and cohort studies demonstrating an associ ation between dietary and lifestyle factors and colorectal cancer, there are fe w long-term intervention trials proving that dietary modification can reduce colorectal cancer incidence. In cas es like this, researchers have applied the precautionary principle: \"In the interim, we believe that our uncertainty about the precise relationship between diet and colorectal cancer is no excuse for failure to promote the conclusions that can be drawn from the observational studies. It seems justifiable to promote a whole food diet high in fr esh fruit and vegetables, high in wheat fibre, and low in fat, particu larly saturated fat, combin ed with regular exercise and the avoidance of obesity.\" 356 In short, a successful and effec tive health promotion strategy must be based on the best available evidence, rather than await fina l scientific certainty. It took ma ny years to establish definitively that tobacco causes cancer and he art disease. It took many more y ears to establish links between these diseases and second-hand smoke. Evidence on th e health impacts of di et, physical activity, socioeconomic conditions, and psychosocial fa ctors is gradually becoming available. An effective and evidence-based h ealth promotion strategy must be dynamic and flexible enough to assess new information as it becomes av ailable, and to respond accordingly. 356 Robertson, Iain, Rona Bound, and Leonie Segal, \"Color ectal Cancer, Diet and Life style Factors: Opportunities for Prevention,\" Health Promotion International 13 (2): 141-150, 1998, page 147. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 95 Measuring Sustainable Development11. Worksite Health Promotion Because so much of people's lives and time are spent in the work place, it has tremendous potential for health promotion and risk beha viour modification. Non-smoking policies, healthy food served in company cafeterias, screeni ng and fitness programs, and other worksite interventions can affect social norms and infl uence the behaviour of large segments of the population. One study of heart di sease prevention concluded: \"Even a small intervention ef fect in this large segmen t of the population has the potential to produce substantial changes in health behaviors associated with increased risk of CHD in the employed population.\"357 Employers have found that such interventions can save them money, especially in the United States, where the employer rather than the st ate often provide health insurance. Numerous studies of employee medical claims have demonstr ated that medical costs are directly related to health risks and health behaviour s: Workers with fewer risk factors incur lower medical costs.358 One major study of 46,000 U.S. employees found th at seven modifiable health risks were associated with significantly higher health expenditures. Compared to lower-risk workers, depressed workers had 70% higher medical co sts and highly stressed workers had 46% higher costs. Those with high blood sugar had 35% highe r costs, those with unhealthy weights had 21% higher costs, smokers had 14-20% higher cost s, workers with high blood pressure had 12% higher costs, and physical inactiv ity incurred 10% higher costs. Mu ltiple risk factors increased medical costs sharply for heart diseas e, psychosocial problems, and stroke.359 An assessment of nearly 46,000 DuPont employees in the U.S. found that those with behavioural risk factors had significantly higher absenteeism and illness costs than those without risks. Smoking cost $1,615 a year in excess illness co sts, overweight cost $675, excess alcohol $655, elevated cholesterol $623, high blood pressure $594, and lack of exercise $219, per person at risk. Projected to the total company workforce, preventable illness was estimated to cost DuPont more than $118 million a year, a conservative es timate because it excluded spouses, dependents, and retirees who receive company paid health care.360 357 Sorenson, Glorian, and Jay Himmelstein, \"Worksite Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 518. 358 Edington, Dee, Louis Tze-ching, and Pamela Witting, \"The Financial Impact of Changes in Personal Health Practices,\" Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 39 (11): 1037-1046, November, 1997, pages 1037-8, and endnotes nald Ozminkowski, Rodney Dunn, Jeffrey Wasserman, and HERO Research Committee, \"The Relationship Between Modifiable Health Risks and Health Care Expenditures: An Analysis of the Multi-Employ er HERO Health Risk and Cost Database,\" Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 40 (10): 843-854, October, 1998. 360 Bertera, Robert, \"The Effects of Behavioural Risks on Absenteeism and Health-Care Costs in the Workplace,\" Journal of Occupational Medicine, 33 (11): 1119-1124, November, 1991; both cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography, Prevention and Health Promotion Branch, Ministry of Health, B.C., July, 1996, page 26.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 96 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentThere is abundant evidence that worksite hea lth promotion programs are successful in reducing personal health risk factors and associated medical costs.361 They have also demonstrated indirect benefits in attracti ng and retaining key pe rsonnel; reducing absenteeism, training costs and accidents; enhanced productivity; improved pub lic image, morale, and allegiance to the company by employees.362 Workplace health actions that include smoking cessation and weight loss programs, provision of healthy cafeteria and vending machine choi ces, onsite blood pressure monitoring, and counselling, have been shown to save an aver age of $2 in reduced operational costs and productivity gains for every $1 invested.363 For example, the DuPont intervention, designed to reduce the health costs described above, produced a 14% decline in disability days, and a return of $2.05 at the end of two years for every $1 invested in the program. Because chronic dis ease disability produces long-term costs, these benefits and returns can be expected to accumulate and increase over time. Johnson and Johnson's \"Live for Life Program\" also produced unintended side-benefits in higher worker morale and improved attitudes about the organizat ion, supervisors, work conditions, job security and benefits, in addition to lowered health care costs for the company.364 Worksite nutrition and physical activity programs have proved inexpensive and effective in educating workers, reducing we ight and fat intake, lowering blood cholesterol levels, and reducing the risks of cardiovasc ular disease and diabetes.365 Trends are encouraging: In the U.S., the number of worksites with more than 50 employees offering nutrition or weight managementprograms more than doubled, from 15% in 1985 to 37% in 1992. 366 361 Edington et al., op. cit., page 1037 and endnotes 5-13. 362 Pelletier, Kenneth, \"A Review and Analysis of the Health and Cost-Effective Outcome Studies of Comprehensive Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Programs at the Worksite: 1991-1993 Update,\" American Journal of Health Promotion 8 (1): 50-73, September-October, 1993. 363 Hyatt, Joshua, \"Healthy Returns, INC, April, 1987; Bertera, Robert, \"The Effects of Behavioural Risks on Absenteeism and Health-Car e Costs in the Workplace,\" Journal of Occupational Medicine, 33 (11): 1119-1124, November, 1991; both cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), Cost Effectiveness/Value of Nutrition Services: An Annotated Bibliography, Prevention and Health Promotion Branch, Ministry of Health, B.C., July, 1996, p. 26. 364 Sorenson, Glorian, and Jay Himmelstein, \"Worksite Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 519. 365 Hartman, Terryl, et al., \"Use of Ea ting-Pattern Messages to Evaluate Changes in Eating Behaviours in a Worksite Cholesterol Education Program,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 93 (10): Keane, \"Cost-Benefit ysis as an Evaluation Technique in Nutrition Prorgrams,\" Journal of Nutrition Education 26: 51B, 1994; Briley, Margaret, and Deanna Montgomery, \"Worksite Nutrition Education Can Lower Total Cholesterol Levels and Promote Weight Loss among Police DepartmentEmployees,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 92 (11), November, 1992; Engotti, Catherine, and Marshal Levin, \"Review of 5 Years of a Combined Dietar y and Physical Fitness Intervention for Control of Serum Cholesterol,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 94 (6): 634-638, June, 1994; Shannon, Barbara, et al., \"A Comprehensive Evaluation of a Works ite Nutrition and Weight-Control Program,\" Journal of Nutrition Education, 19 (3): 109-116, 1987; Byers, Tim, et al., \"The Co sts and Effects of A Nutritional Educational Program following Work-Site Cholesterol Screening,\" American Journal of Public Health, 85 (5): 650-655, May, 1995; all cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., pages 27-28. 366 \"The Role of Nutrition in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention - Position of the ADA,\" Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 98: 205-208, 1998. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 97 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentThe evidence also indicates that worksite hea lth promotion programs must be geared both to high-risk and low-risk workers if they are to yield the maximum financia l benefits. Since 10% of employees account for as much as two-thirds of me dical costs, it is clearl y prudent to target high- risk workers.367 However, an important longitudinal st udy indicates that the population of high- risk workers is not static. Employees who moved from high-risk to low-risk status over a 6-year period significantly reduced their average medical costs, while employees moving from low-risk to high-risk status over the same period incurr ed a significant increase in average medical costs.368 The authors conclude: \"First, the study shows that personal health risk manage ment is associated with significant financial benefits in the empl oyees' medical claims costs. Second, the study indicates that specific attenti on must be given to both low-and high-risk populations. Facilitating the individuals' ri sk change from high- to low-risk and preventing the individuals' risk change fr om low- to high- risk are two key components for a successful strategy.... [P ]romoting worksite health and wellness should be a sound investment for the nation's well-being, vitality, and health care cost containment.\"369 It was noted in Part IV of this report that various patterns of work stress, including high demands, excessive time pressures, and low cont rol or autonomy, have been shown to increase the risk of heart disease. Yet most worksite interventions are aimed en tirely at individual risk reduction and individual behaviour change. According to one analyst: \"A major obstacle to the success of progr ams aimed exclusively at the individual is their lack of attenti on to conditions in the wo rk environment and in the structure of work that are also asso ciated with increased CHD risk.... An exclusive focus on individual lifestyle factor s runs the risk of deflecting attention away from potentially serious hea lth hazards and effects of the work environment.... A focus on individual beha vior change may also lead to blaming the victim and may take on a moralistic tone. Efforts that target individual behaviour change must [there fore] be integrated with changes in the worksite environm ent and in the structure of work to maximize the potential for CHD risk re duction in the worksi te. Environmental and organizational changes underline the fact that employer actions are an integral part of a comprehensive approach to worksite health.\" 370 An effective worksite health promotion strate gy will therefore attemp t to redesign jobs and restructure the work organization to increase job control and reduce job strain and heart disease risk. 367 Edington et al., op. cit., page 1044. 368 Edington et al., op. cit., pages 1037 and 369 Edington et \"Worksite Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Bost on, 1992, pages 518-520, 532, 535. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 98 Measuring Sustainable Development12. School-Based and Child hood Interventions It is now well accepted that th e lifestyle behaviours that eith er prevent or promote chronic diseases are established in childhood, and that they are increasingly difficu lt to change once the patterns are set. Most adult smokers begin smoking in their teenage years, poor eating habits are acquired early in life, and physical activity in adulthood often has its roots in childhood. One U.S. study has found that by age 12, at least one modi fiable heart disease risk factor exists in 36- 60% of U.S. children.371 In fact, there is evidence that the atherosclerotic process itself begins in childhood.372 One study summarized the prevailing wi sdom among health researchers that: \"[P]sychosocial conditions of childhood contribute to behaviours that are associated later with adult behavioral risk factors and may ultimately lead to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mo rtality.... The logic for intervention in the school is even clearer than that fo r the worksite, bec ause habits developed here last for a lifetime.\"373 School provides the greatest opport unity to reach large numbers of children for several hours a day, five days a week, 36 weeks a year, for many years. School health services, including effective risk factor screeni ng and opportunities for individual counselling; health instruction, including regular physical activity; and a healt hy school environment, including nutritious food services, all contribute to the development of skills, knowledge, and behaviour that can last into adulthood. In fact, these elemen ts are profoundly interrelated: \"It is unrealistic to expect school heal th education programs to achieve their objectives of smoking prevention and improved nutrition if the school environment sends out conflicting messages.\"374 The cost-effectiveness of school-based smoking pr evention curricula has been described above, with field trials demonstrating a $15 saving in a voided health care costs and economic losses for every $1 invested. School-based physical activity, nutritional educ ation programs, and healthy school lunches have also been not ed as crucial in establishing e ffective preventive behaviours in adulthood. There have been some notable successes that can be used by Nova Scotia as models of best practices. California has reduced its rate of teenage smoking to less than 7%. An earlier GPI Atlantic report on the co st of obesity described healthy l unch programs in Berkeley, California, 371 Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 543 and 545. 372 Williams, Christine, \"Intervention in Childhood,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 433-434. 373 Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 543, and page 541 (editor's introduction.) 374 Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 542-543. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 99 Measuring Sustainable Developmentand a successful school-based nu trition and physical activity pr ogram in Singapore that reduced teenage obesity rates by 30-50%.375 However population trends, including a doubling of the childhood obesity rate since the 1980s, and the fact that teenage smoking rates in Canada have not declined at the same rate as the general population, raise serious conc erns. There is, as yet, little evidence of widespread and concerted school-based and childhood health pr omotion and disease prevention interventions either in the province or in Canada as a whole. U.S. evidence indicates that most American childr en have an excessive intake of high-fat foods, consuming, on average, 36-39% of their calories as fat compared to the recommended level of less than 30%. Dairy fat is the greatest source of saturated fat in children's diets. A switch to lower-fat milk is clearly essential. Other sources of saturated fat in children's diets include icecream, fast food hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, fr ench fries, cookies, cakes, and donuts. Medical studies indicate that \"this exce ssive intake of dietary fat co ntributes to childhood obesity and hypercholesterolemia.\" 376 The mean dietary fibre intake of American children is just 12 gm. per day compared to the 20-30 gm. per day recommended by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.377 The obstacles to effective school-based di sease prevention and health promotion are considerable. There are generally insufficient f unds and resources for hi gh-quality school health education; curricula are already overcrowded; and teachers are often overwhelmed by existing responsibilities and lack proper training.378 Additional in-service trai ning is clearly needed, but may be resisted. In addition, teachers and school officials are battling against dominant social patterns that threaten to undo their best efforts. For example, current work patterns militate ag ainst effective nutritional interventions in the home. Almost 60% of U.S. children's daily energy intake 5 days a week is consumed outside the home, with that proportion rising even higher during adolescence. As noted earlier, a Harvard University study found that children who eat more meals at home have healthier outcomes into adulthood. Throughout Canada there has been a very rapid growth in the employment of women with children. 54% of mother s with infants under 3 years old are now employed, more than double the rate 40 years ago. 60% of those with ch ildren aged 3-5, and nearly 70% of those with children aged 6 and over are employed.379 As noted above, Statistics Canada time use surveys indicate that the average worki ng mother puts in 75 hours a week of paid plus unpaid work, with 38% of working mothers classified as \"severel y time stressed.\" In these circumstances, fast foods, often high in saturated fat, may well be the dinner of choice. 375 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, NS, 2000. 376 Williams, Christine, \"Intervention in Childhood,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 44 1; and Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 545. 377 Williams, op. cit., page 441. 378 Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention, \" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 547-548. 379 Statistics Canada, Women in the Workplace, 2nd edition, catalogue no. 71-543E. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 100 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentSimilar disturbing evidence abounds with regard to physical inactivity, with fewer children walking or bicycling to school, cuts in physical education cl asses in many schools, and more time spent playing video and computer games or watching TV. Statistics Canada's 1998 time use survey indicates that Nova Scotians watch an average of two and a half hours of television per day, the highest rate in the count ry, not counting the time when the TV is turned on and they are doing other activitie s such as eating.380 When the latter was included, an earlier Statistics Canada survey found that Nova Scotians watched th ree and a half hours of television per day.381 The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that \"increased television use is documented to be a significant factor leading to obesity,\"382 and may help explain why 25% of U.S. children today are overweight or obese. Another study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that childre n lost weight if they simply watched less television.383 What kind of interventions can effectivel y counter these distur bing social trends? A teacher at the former Tower Road School in Halifax made a pact with her students not to watch television for a full week, and asked them to keep a journa l of what they did in the extra time. After a couple of nervous days in which the children did not know what to do with their time, they became acutely conscious of just how much time they actually spent watching TV. In the next days, however, they began to enjoy walks with thei r families, to play in the park, and engage in higher levels of physical activity that became increasingly enjoyable to them as the week progressed. It is an experime nt worth replicating on a wide r scale throughout the province. On a more systemic level, daily school-based physical activity, provision of healthy lunches in school cafeterias, nutritional educ ation, and mandatory use of Nova Scotia's exemplary smoking cessation curriculum Smoke-Free for Life, could help reduce childhood risk factors for chronic disease. School-based prevention programs will be effective to the degree that they are appropriate to the age, culture, and circumstances. For example, field trials indicate th at no-smoking policies in schools (including for teachers and administrators ), and programs emphasizing social influences, refusal skills (to resist peer pressure), and short-term physiological effects, may be more successful in reducing teenage smoking rates th an the longer-term chronic disease warnings more appropriate to adult programs . In general, it has been dem onstrated that curricula based on skills will be more effective than curricula based on knowledge alone.384 As noted, changes in the school environment may al so be necessary. A shift is required from the current emphasis in many schools on sports competition among the best athletes to more regularphysical activity and health-relate d fitness for all students. As well, school food services can be 380 Statistics Canada, General Social Survey: Overview of the Time Use of Canadians in 1998, Table 1: Canada, regions and provinces, special tabulation, November, 1999. 381 Statistics Canada, Television Viewing 1992, catalogue no. 87-208, page 21 382 \"Media Education,\" Pediatrics, volume 104, no. 2, August 1999, pages 341-343, available at www.aap.org/policy/RE9911.html 383 Thomas N.Robinson, \"Reducing Children's Television Viewing to Prevent Obesity; A Randomized Controlled Trial,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, volume 282, no. 16, October 27, 1999, pages 1530-1538. 384 Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 543. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 101 Measuring Sustainable Developmentchanged to help train children's palates at a young age to enjoy foods low in total and saturated fats, salt, and sugar, and high in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. One experiment found that training school food service workers in food buying and preparation reduced saturated fat intake among students by 20% and sodium intake by 15- 20% even without a corresponding educational component.385 In some cases school-based health promotion programs may be in consonance with prevailing public norms and attitudes (such as the desirability of smoking cessation and physical activity.)In other cases, teacher training may be required to challenge such norms. For example, both the 1990 Nova Scotia Nutrition Survey and a 1992 Na tional Institute of Nutrition study found that food labels are widely misunderstood and misinterpr eted, with little comprehension of ingredient lists and nutrition panels, and widespread c onfusion about the valid ity of food claims on labels. 386 One analyst has commented: \"Unfortunately the vagaries of current food-labeling practices often leave consumers confused or w ith inadequate information.\"387 Few teachers have the training to take a class of school children on a supermarket tour to explain the health and nutritional benefits a nd costs of different types of foods. In the U.S., the food industry spends $30 billion a year in advertising alone, with fast food accounting for one-third of food advertising e xpenditures in industrialized countries. When candy and sweetened cereals are added, unhealthy food accounts for more than half of all food advertising, dwarfing nutritional ed ucation investments in schools.388 Like tobacco companies, which now control an increasi ng proportion of the food industr y, much of this advertising explicitly targets children to nurture addictions that will last into adulthood. Food commercials, largely promoting sugar-filled foods, make up ha lf of all advertising directed at children.389 In an environment where children receive their prim ary nutritional education from the food industry, and where widespread public confusion prevails , effective school-based programs will require targeted teacher training that challenges prevailing norms. Despite the obstacles they face, school-based programs have b een shown to be successful, essential, and cost-effective in reducing chronic disease risks that begin in childhood and are generally carried through to adu lthood. It has been suggested that health care providers and health professionals in school clinics can pl ay a pivotal role in designing, promoting, and coordinating school-based preventive activities. These health professionals also have a unique opportunity to complement school-based programs with family and home-based interventions.390 385 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Tobacco in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, October, 2000; Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, March, 2000; Eriksen, Michael, \"School Intervention,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 543-545. 386 Nova Scotia Heart Health Program, Report of the Nova Sc otia Nutrition Survey, March 1993, page 32. 387 Thompson, Beti, and Michael Pertschuk, \"Community Intervention and Advocacy,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 499. 388 Gary Gardner and Brian Halweil, \"N ourishing the Underfed and Overfed,\" chapter 4 in Worldwatch Institute, State of the World 2000, W.W.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 102 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIn order to further influence childhood behaviour in the home, it has also been recommended that physicians assess risk factors for families as a whole, since lifestyle patterns are commonly shared. For example, one study found that 90% of children with cholestero l levels of 200 mg/dl or more have at least one parent with hypercholesterolemia. Family treatment and familycounselling by physicians may therefore be an eff ective means of preventi ng illness and reducing chronic disease risk factors in children. 391 13. Clinical Preventive Services Brief advice from a physician has been shown to be highly effective in preventing disease and promoting health, because physicians are regarded as the most reliable and credible source of health information by the general public. They ha ve the opportunity to take advantage of the \"teachable\" moment when patients are concerned about their health, and they come into contactwith 80% of Canadian adults annually, each of w hom sees a doctor an average of four times a year. 392 According to one analysis: \"Physicians and other members of the health care team are uniquely and powerfully situated in thei r routine office pr actices to educate patients about the relationship of certain behaviors to CHD and to help them develop the skills required to make behavioral changes. Thus , they play a pivotal role in the prevention of CHD.... Physicians are percei ved by the general public as the most reliable and credible source of health in formation and advice. Patients generally prefer to receive as much information as possible from physicians, who often do not appreciate this desire and underest imate how much in formation patients actually want.\"393 Primary health care settings also constitute an ideal environment for the transferral of such advice and information, because they are the first level of contact of individuals, families, and communities with the national health care system, and because they bring health care as close as possible to where people actually live and work.394 Primary health care also provides a continuity of care that allows physicians to repeat and rein force messages to their patients, and to follow up on efforts to alter lifestyle patterns. Evidence indicates that even 3-4 minutes of focused 391 Williams, Christine, \"Intervention in Childhood,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 445 and 463. 392 Stachenko, Sylvie, Director, Preventiv e Health Services, Health Canada, Preventive Guidelines: Their Role in Clinical Prevention and Health Promotion, Health Canada, Ottawa, page xxi. 393 Ockene, Judith, and Ira Ockene, \"Helping Patients to Reduce Their Risk for Coronary Heart Disease: An Overview,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, page 174; see also footnotes 12-18, page 197, providing substantiating evidence for these statements. 394 Definition of primary care from World Health Organi zation (1978), \"The Alma Ata Conference on Primary Health Care,\" WHO Chronicle, 32: 409-430, page 418. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 103 Measuring Sustainable Developmentphysician counselling and advice can be effectiv e, especially if backed up by other office services and self-help materials.395 Yet surveys indicate that physicians frequently do not provide information and advice on disease prevention to their patients, either because th ey feel untrained and uninformed in this area, because of time pressures, or because they are not reimbursed for the time spent providing suchpreventive counselling. 396 A U.S. insurance company survey found that 70% of Americans considered their doctors useful and reliable sources of health info rmation, a higher proportion than for any other source of information, but less than half said they actually got much health information from their doctors.397 One 1999 U.S. survey found that 35% of smokers did not receive advice to quit when vi siting a health care professional.398 Although the public perceive s physicians as the most useful source of nutrition information, only 23% of medical schools in the U.S. require a separate nutrition cour se, and half of U.S. physicians feel ill-prepared to provide diet counselling.399 Not surprisingly, 77% of surveyed physicians felt they would need a dditional education in order to ad vise patients effectively about needed dietary modification.400 Many physicians report lack of time, knowledge, financial incentives, and confidence in their counselling skills as r easons they do not provide this advice.401 As noted in Part V, physician training in preven tive medicine is essentia l if health care costs associated with an aging population are not to es calate out of control. A U.S. assessment found that physicians have been poorly trained in making the diagnosis of protein calorie malnutrition in elderly patients, or in recognizing those at risk of developing nutritional problems. They are often unaware that malnutrition or under-nutrition may be the presenting feature of a number of treatable diseases in older pe rsons, they do not know how to manage the problem, and they are unaware of its treatable causes (including depression, eating disord ers, and inappropriate use of drugs).402 395 Ockene, Judith, and Ira Ockene, \"Helping Patients to Reduce Their Risk for Coronary Heart Disease: An Overview,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 174-175. 396 Ibid., page 175. 397 Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 15. 398 Coffield, Ashley, et al., \"Priorities Among Recommended Clinical Preventive Services,\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2001; 21 (1): 1-9, pages 1-2. 399 Gardner.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 104 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentFortunately these deficiencies are easily remedi ed. Teaching the basics of nutritional assessment and intervention to physicians and nursing staff in a general medical ward dramatically improved their ability to identify patients at nutritional risk, and increased the frequency of nutritional assessments, consultations and provision of nutri tional supplements. That study concluded that physician education could remedy the poor capacity of physicians to rec ognize and treat under- nutrition and malnutrition, and is highly cost-effective in prev enting medical complications, reducing hospital stays and medical co sts, and improving quality of care.403 In addition to lack of training, doc tors and health admini strators cite lack of reimbursement as a key reason for the absence of r outine nutrition screening and tr eatment. Yet 80% of 750 health professionals surveyed believe the money saved from fewer illnesses and faster recoveries wouldoffset the costs of nutriti on screening a nd intervention. 404 The American Diabetes Association has recommended third party payment for out patient education and nutritional counselling.405 Until health insurance covers primary prevention services, health promotion and disease prevention are likely to remain population-based ra ther than clinic base d, whereas an effective, comprehensive strategy clearl y requires both approaches. This understanding is not new, and the health care payment and incentive system has been blamed as one of the prime culprits in the failure to realize the benefits of preventive interventions. Nearly 20 years ago, a publicati on of the Canadian Medical Association noted that: \"[D]octors and hospitals cannot be expec ted to provide additional preventive services unless there are appropriate incentives.... U nder the present [fee-for- service] systems of paym ent, practitioners may be penalized for emphasizing prevention and health maintenance and for employing allied health personnel to help provide these services. Counselling is important in many of these services and there is only limited provision in physician payment schedules for this purpose. Many aspects of preventive medi cine lend themselves poorly to payment on an item-by-item basis and hourly rates ma y be necessary to provide the needed incentive.... {I]t does seem that the be nefits of preventive methods have not been realized to their optimal level due to th e lack of incentives in the present health care payment system.\"406 The same author noted the need for changes in federal - provincial cost sharing agreements on health care to include a wide r range of preventive interven tions, and financial support for 403 Roubenoff, Ronenn, et al., \"Malnutrition Among Hospitali zed Patients - A Problem of Physician Awareness,\" Arch Intern Med., 147: 1462-1465, August, 1987; Schwartz, Denise , \"Enhanced Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Practice and Outcomes in an Intensive Care Unit with a Hospital-Wide Performa nce Improvement Process, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 26 (5): 484-489, May, 1996; both cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 53. 404 \"Providers Estimate One in Four Seniors Malnourished,\" CNI 23 (16), April 30, 199; Hart, Peter, quoted in Nutrition Screening Initiatives Newsletter, July, 1993, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), pages 42, 43. 405 Kaplan, Robert, and Wayne Davis, \"Evaluating the Cost s and Benefits of Outpatient Diabetes Education and Nutrition Counselling,\" Diabetes Care, 9 (1), January-February, 1986, cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 49. 406 Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 15. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 105 Measuring Sustainable Developmentphysician training programs in preventive counselli ng. Those observations are as pertinent today as they were in 1984. When offered, clinical preventive services can be effective. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a literature review, conc ludes that 2.5% of smokers who would not have otherwise quit, did so following 3 mi nutes or less of clinician advice.407 Initial brief physician advice may be followed by more extensive counsel ling and use of nicotine replacement therapy, which in turn lead to higher quit rates.408 One analysis of 30 clinical pr eventive services found that toba cco cessation counselling was the second most effective clinical intervention that physicians coul d undertake (after vaccinating children), both in terms of co st-effectiveness and actual bu rden of illness avoided. Among services with low delivery rates, it rece ived the highest priority classification.409 The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Heal th Examination has concluded that a periodic health examination targeted at preventing, detec ting, and controlling specific conditions and risk factors for different age, sex, and high-risk groups is likely to be more e ffective than a routine annual physical examination.410 Aside from direct counselling, the clinical set ting can provide support fo r preventive behaviours through posters, displays, and educational materi als in physicians' offices and waiting rooms.411 Doctors who feel unable to provide dietary ad vice themselves can either include registered dieticians in their clinical teams, or provide appropriate referrals.412 Dieticians can also be part of hospital ward rounds to improve awareness and patient care.413 Indeed, balanced low calorie diets supervised by dieticians or non-medical personnel have been shown to be more cost effective per pound of weight lost than medically supervised low calorie diets.414 Because physicians experience increasing time pr essure to see more patients in less time, physician surveys indicate that time barriers are a major obstacle to effective patient counselling for risk factor modification. It has therefore be en recommended that integrated offices bringing together physicians, nurses, dieticians, and ot her personnel may provide the most effective environment for prevention-oriented practice. One such analysis delineates the essential processes of a systematic office cardiovascular risk-reduction program as screening; recording of 407 Cited in Maciosek, Michael, et al . \"Methods for Priority Setting Among Clinical Preventive Services,\" in American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 2001; 21 (1): 10-19, page 14. 408 Maciosek et al., op. cit., pages 14-15. 409 Coffield et al., op. cit., pages 1 and 5. 410 Cited in Stachenko, Sylvie, Director, Pr eventive Health Services, Health Canada, Preventive Guidelines: Their Role in Clinical Prevention and Health Promotion, Health Canada, page xix. 411 LaRosa, John, et al., \"Practical Strategies for the Dietary Management of Hypercholesterolemia,\" cited in Province of British Columbia (1996), op. cit., page 20; Brown, Allan, Costs and Benefits of Preventive Medicine, Canadian Medical Association, Department of Medical Economics, 1984, page 16. 412 Ellison, R.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 106 Measuring Sustainable Developmentinformation; physician intervention; assistance with education and behaviour change; follow up; and outreach. Of these six steps, five can be und ertaken primarily by office staff other than the physician.415 Physicians can also play a crucial role in helping patients overco me some of the deeper psychosocial stresses and causes of chronic disease through active and mindful listening, and through compassionate, non-judgmental communica tion with patients. Jon Kabat-Zinn argues that physicians with a psychosocial perspective on the causes of chronic disease rather than a purely medical one \"can make substantial contribut ions to the life and he alth of their patients with strategies that consume little time a nd energy but that can potentially produce powerful returns.\" Most important, he note s, is the quality of the rela tionship between the physician and patient, with the physician simply being fully present and listening w ith attentiveness and compassion rather than feeling pr essured to \"fix\" the patient's problems. He points to several studies that show a significan t relationship between patient sa tisfaction and the ability of a physician simply to express caring a nd concern in the medical encounter.416 Kabat-Zinn outlines effective methods and stages of physician intervention designed to alter psychosocial risk factors. These begin with observation and assessment and proceed to an exploration of the patient's commitment to cha nge. Brief advice and provision of information (2- 3 minutes) may be followed by an additional 3- 5 minutes of patient-centred counselling to determine existing strengths and resources, a nd to produce a plan for change. There may be referrals for more intensive counselling, assistan ce, or support, and there will always be some follow-up, maintenance, and monitoring of the patient's acti ons by the physician.417 In short, preventive clinical interventi ons can go well beyond conventional medical treatment, and address the full range of deeper determinants and root causes of chronic disease. 14. Preventive Alternative Treatments There is now considerable evidence that, while conventional western me dicine is a powerful treatment and surgery tool, alte rnative therapies may have an important role in disease prevention, particularly in the secondary and tertiary preventi on designed to control existing medical conditions. For example, small-scale studies have found that acupuncture, an ancient form of Chinese medicine, can be highly cost-effective in treating patients with osteoarthri tis, back pain, stroke, angina pectoris, and other chr onic conditions, avoiding costly su rgery and hospital visits, and facilitating a more rapid return to employmen t. Cost savings estimates range from $12,542 per patient for avoided surgeries in patients with severe osteoarthritis to $41,019 per patient in 415 Solberg, Leif, et al., \"The evention-Oriented Practice,\" in Oc kene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 469-490. 416 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 300 and 317. 417 Kabat-Zinn, Jon, \"Psychosocial Factors: Their Importance and Management,\" in Ockene, Ira, and Judith Ockene, Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1992, pages 319-327. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 107 Measuring Sustainable Developmentreduced hospital and nursing home days for stroke victims.418 For heart disease victims, cost savings averaged $19,483 per patient in avoided surgeries and hospital stays, and another $26,974 in avoided productivity losses due to an incr ease in patients able to return to work.419, 420 Chiropractic care has also been found to be cost -effective in treating mu sculoskeletal disorders, which are the most prevalent of all chronic conditions, and account for the highest disability costs and third highest overall costs of any dise ase, after circulatory disorders and cancers. A 1998 University of Ottawa study concluded that improved access to chiropr actic services would lead to very substantial net savings in direct and indire ct costs. Direct savi ngs to Ontario's health care system are estimated at more than $500 million annually, while indirect cost savings to theprovince in avoided disability ar e estimated at nearly $2 billion. 421 Extrapolated to Nova Scotia according to population, these estimates indicate po tential savings of $40 million a year to the health care system, and $150 million in productivity gains. The study also found that the poor, lower middle cl ass, and the elderly we re significantly less likely to access and use chiropractic care, due to the deterrent eff ect of high co-payment or user fees, even though these groups suffer from a gr eater prevalence of neuromusculoskeletal conditions. The authors argue that this socio- economic disparity contributes to the high use among these groups of medical services, drugs, an d hospital care, frequently with poorer health outcomes. They conclude that improved coverage of chiropractic care under public and private insurance systems can both save money and increas e equity. They further argue for a shift from the biomedical model for treating back and neck pain based on diagnostic testing, drugs and bed rest to a biopsychosocial model, including activities/exercise, pa tient education, spinal manipulation, and restoration of function.422 Other claims on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of alternative medicine abound. A regimen ofdiet, exercise, meditation, and herbal suppleme nts was found to reduce total medical costs by more than 50% over five years compared to th e norm, and to reduce hospital days among older adults by 88%. 423 418 To convert 1992US$ to 2001Can$, exchange rates from http://www.x-rates.com/cg i-bin/hlookup.cgi show $US1 = $Can1.1972 on 30 June, 1992. calculation (1): 1.1972 X $9000 = $10,775 (1992 Can$), and calculation (2): 2001 CPI (116.4) divided by 19 92 CPI (100) X $10,775 = $12,542.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 108 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIt has been claimed that tr eating asthma through allergy e limination diets and nutritional supplements could save $3 billion a year in hospital, drug, and physician costs in the U.S. Intravenous magnesium has been recommended as an alternative to clot-dispersing drugs for heart attack victims, for an estimated saving of $1 billion a year in the U.S. And chelation therapy has been claimed as an effective altern ative to bypass surgery at 10% of the cost, with considerably less pain and ri sk, and a faster convalescence.424 Large cohort and longitudinal studies are clearly needed to explore the efficacy of alternative treatments more thoroughly than ha s been the case to date. Yet this is unlikely in the absence of dedicated research funding. In th e U.S., $12 billion a year is al located for research to the National Institutes of Health, bu t only $5.4 million (or 0.05%) goes to the Office of Alternative Medicine to investigate the claims of some 50 therapies. Yet surveys show that one-third of Americans spend $12 billion a year visiting a lternative physicians at least once a year.425 The potential cost-effectiveness of these alternative tr eatments in illness prevention, avoided surgeries and hospital stays, productivity gains, and chronic disease control, argues for more intensive investigations of their efficacy. One three-year study currently under way at the Stanford Cent er for Research in Disease Prevention aims to reduce disability and diseas e among older adults through the regular practice of meditation, emphasis on a plant-based diet, eastern and western exercise, social support, community service, and appropriate use of both conventional and alternative medicine. Dependent variables being measured at periodi c intervals include basic physical assessments, psychosocial variables, and cogniti ve function. Its stated goal is to provide eviden ce to insurance companies and Medicare that may encourage the inclusion of such programs in existing health plans.426 424 Goldberg, Burton, \"You Don't Have to be Sick,\" Alternative Medicine Magazine, cited at www.garynull.com and www.alternativemedicine.com . 425 Goldberg, Burton, \"You Don't Have to be Sick,\" Alternative Medicine Magazine, cited at www.garynull.com and www.alternativemedicine.com . 426 Haskell, William et al., \"Successful A Proposed Interv ention to Elicit and Sustain Optimal Health for Individuals Age 55-75,\" Stanford Center for Re search in Disease Prevention, available at: http://prevention.stanford.edu/res earch/studies/aging_sage.html . GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 109 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentAPPENDIX A THE COST OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IN NOVA SCOTIA GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 110 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentExecutive Summary Physical activity provides proven health benefits. It protects ag ainst heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis , obesity, depression, anxiety, and stress. Epidemiological studies estimate that 36% of heart disease, 27% of osteoporosis, 20% of stroke, hypertension, diabet es 2, and colon cancer, and 11% of breast cancer are attributable to physical inactivity. Regular physical activity also pr otects against obesity and assi sts weight control; fosters development of healthy muscles, bones and joints ; increases strength and endurance; improves behavioural development in children and adoles cents; and helps maintain function and preserve independence in older adults. Studies show that regular exercisers have much less overall lifetime morbidity than those who are sedent ary, indicating that avoi ded medical costs due to physical activity are not simply deferred to older ages. According to the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, 62% of Nova Scotians and 61% of Canadians are currently too inactive to reap the health benefits of regular physical activity. It is estimated that physical inactivity costs the Nova Scotia health care system $66.5 million a year in hospital, physician and drug costs alone , equal to 4% of total government spending on these services. When all direct health care costs are added, in cluding private expenditures, a sedentary lifestyle costs Nova Scotians $107 million a year in direct medical care expenditures. This spending is currently adde d to the provincial Gross Domestic Product and economic growth statistics, and is thus mistakenly taken as a sign of prosperity a nd progress. The Genuine Progress Index counts this spending due to physical inactivity as a cost - not a gain - to the economy. Physical inactivity costs the Nova Scotia economy an additional $247 million each year in indirect productivity losses due to premature de ath and disability. Addi ng direct and indirect costs, the total economic burden of physical in activity in Nova Scotia is estimated at $354 million annually. More than 700 Nova Scotians die prematurely ea ch year due to physica l inactivity, accounting for 9% of all premature deaths. These prematur e deaths result in th e loss of more than 2,200 potential years of life every ye ar in the province before age 70. In other words, if all Nova Scotians were physically activ e, the province would gain 2,200 productive years of life each year, with corresponding gains to the economy. If just 10% fewer Nova Scotians were physical ly inactive - that is, if the rate of physical inactivity were 56% instead of 62% - the province could save an estimated $4.6 million everyyear in avoided hospital, drug, a nd physician costs, and $7.5 million in total health care spending. Added to an estimated $17 million in productivity gains, to tal economic savings to Nova Scotia from a 10% reduction in physical inactivity amount to $24.7 million. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 111 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentGiven the enormous health care burden of a se dentary lifestyle, health campaigns aimed at promoting regular physica l activity, including provi sion of adequate access to quality sport and recreation programs and facilities for all Nova Scotians, have the potential to reduce the enormous human and economic burden of physical inactivity.

Physical Activity and Health \"If you could bottle everything you get from physical activity and sell it at a pharmacy, it would go for a hefty price.\" George Sheehan, M.D.427 \"Physical activity is the crux of healthy aging. Nowhere is the gap wider between what we know and what we do than in the area of physi cal activity, and nowhere is the potential pay-off greater.\" National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, USA428 Physical activity has been glow ingly referred to as a \"magic bullet\" because of its proven benefits in preventing disease, improving health, and promoting independence and quality of life in old age.429 The United Kingdom Minister for Public Health has called phys ical exercise the best buy in public health.430 And the most substantial body of evidence for achieving healthy active aging relates to the benefici al effects of regular exercise.431 Physical activity has been called \"the most obvious of variables which mi ght reduce overall lifet ime morbidity\" and the \"cornerstone\" of any strategy aimed at pr olonging disability-free life expectancy.432 In 1992, the American Heart Association officially recognized physical in activity as one of the four major modifiable risk factors for card iovascular disease, along with smoking, high blood pressure, and elevated blood cholesterol.433 However, 24% of Canadians smoke, 11% have high blood pressure, and 18% have high blood choleste rol, while 61% of Canadians are not active enough to reap health benefits.434 An increase in physical activit y, therefore, has the greatest potential to reduce the inciden ce of heart disease in Canada. In Nova Scotia, the comparable prevalence rates for the major modifiable risk factors are: smoking - 30%; high blood pressure - 17%; high blood cholesterol - 19%; physical inactivity - 62%.435 427 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, The Research File, 2000, Reference No. 00-01. 428 National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Hea lth Promotion, \"Healthy Aging: Preventing Disease and Improving Quality of Life Among Older Americans,\" Atlanta, July, 2001, available at http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/aag-aging.htm . 429 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, The Research File, 2000, Reference No. 00-01. 430 Cooper, Y.

Given that cardiovascular diseases cost the Nova Scotia economy $960 million a year, promotion of physical activity could potentially save substa ntial sums of money. A 1999 Statistics Canada analysis of results from the National Population Health Survey, controlling for age, education, income, smoking, blood pressure, we ight, and other factors, found that sedentary Canadians have five times the risk of developing he art disease as those who exercise moderately in their free time. The sa me analysis found that those with a low level of regular physical activity had 3.7 times the odds of developing heart disease compared to those who exercised moderately.437 The Harvard meta-analysis also found that 22% of colon cancer and osteoporotic fractures, 12% of diabetes and hypertension, and about 5% of breast cancer are at tributable to lack of physical activity.438 Physical inactivity is also linked to obesity, which is its elf a risk factor for a wide range of chronic diseases. It is estimated that 19% of premature de aths in Canada are attributable to physical inactivity.439 In addition, physical activity pr ovides protection against anxi ety and depression. Statistics Canada found that sedentary Canadians are 60% mo re likely to suffer from depression than those who are active, and concluded th at \"physical activity has protect ive effects on heart health and mental health that are independe nt of many other risk factors.\" Regular physical activity has also been shown to foster development of healthy muscles, bones and joints; to improve strength, endurance, and weight control; to improve behavioural developmen t in children and adolescents; and to help maintain function and preserve independence in older adults.440 which should be available in July, 2002, are needed to confirm this trend); High blood pressure from Statistics Canada, Health Statistics 1999, CD-Rom, Table 0060121.IVT; High blood cholesterol from Heart Health Nova Scotia and Nova Scotia Department of Health, The Nova Scotia He alth Survey, 1995, Halifax, 1995, page 40; Physical inactivity from Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, 2000 Physical Activity Monitor, available at: http://www.cflri.ca/cflri/pa/surv eys/2000survey/2000survey.html . 436 Colditz, G.A.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 115 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentIn sum, a very wide range of chronic diseas es could be avoided th rough increased levels of physical activity in the population. Since the need and demand for medical services and their associated costs are directly linked to the preval ence of illness in societ y, a reduction in chronic ailments through higher levels of physical activity has th e potential to reduce health care costs. Studies have demonstrated that re gular exercisers have much less overall lifetime morbidity than those who are sedentary, indicati ng that avoided medical costs due to physical activity can be saved absolutely rather than simply deferred to older ages.441 United States health authorities have identified increasing physical activity as a key factor in controlling health care costs in that country, through the pr evention of unnecessary illness, disability and premature death, and the maintenance of an improved quality of life into oldage. 442 And the U.S. Surgeon-General has issued a \"national call to action\" to put increased physical activity on the same level as the use of seat belts and the discouragement of tobacco use, because of the strong evidence that it will pr oduce comparable \"clear and substantial health gains.\"443 1.1 Biological Pathways The beneficial effects of physical activity on he alth have been confir med by clinical studies identifying the potential biological mechanisms whereby physical activity can influence health. For example, physical activity may help prevent cardiovascular disease by improving the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. It may protect against cancer by increasing the proportion of free radical scavenging enzymes and circulating T and B lymphocytes, thus improving immune function, and by increasing ga strointestinal motility and decreasing the transit time of ingested food.444 Physical activity can protect ag ainst overweight and diabetes by reducing body fat, increasing the resting metabolic rate and the rate of glucos e disposal, and improving cell insulin sensitivity. Regular exercise in childhood can protect against osteoporosis in old age by promoting the development of bone mass, and at older ages it can help maintain bone mineral density. Physical activity can also safeguard mental health th rough reducing muscle tens ion (and thereby stress and anxiety) and through bioche mical brain alterations and re lease of endorphins, thereby protecting against depression.445 441 Fries, James, C.

Physical Activity Trends in Nova Scotia 2.1 Definitions There are a number of definitions of physical activ ity and inactivity that produce varying results when assessing trends in physical activity. Because of the wide range of definitions of physical activity and inactivity, the differe nt types of surveys, and the lack of standardization that currently exists, the following analysis pr ovides three measures of physical activity. Statistics Canada's National Population Health Surveys (NPHS) 1994/95 and 1996/97 considered Canadians physically inactive or \"sedentary\" if they reported a usual daily leisure-time energy expenditure of less than 1.5 kilocalories pe r kilogram of body weight per day (kcal/kg/day). Individuals were defined as moderately active if they expended 1.5-2.9 kcal/kg/day, and as \"active\" if they expended 3.0 or more kcal/kg/day. Calculations were made based on individuals' reporting of the fr equency and duration of different types of physical activity, using independently establ ished values for the energy demands of each activity. In this analysis, \"regul ar\" physical activity (at the leve ls indicated) is defined as at least 15 minutes of leisure time physical ac tivity 12 or more times per month. The NPHS results apply to Canadians 12 and older.446 Other surveys have assessed physical activ ity levels according to whether respondents reported exercising three or more times weekl y, once or twice weekl y, less than once weekly or never.447 Health Canada's 1998 publication, Canada's Physical Activity Guide to Healthy Active Living , calls for an hour of low-intensity activity every day, or 30-60 minutes of moderate- intensity activity, or 20-30 minutes of vi gorous-intensity activity 4-7 days a week.448 Only 34% of Canadians aged 25-55 currently meet these recommendations.449 The Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute's \"physical activity profiles\" rate Canadians according to whethe r their physical activity levels are sufficient for \"optimal health benefits.\" Physical inactivity, according to this measure, is defined as less than 12.6 kilojoules (kJ)/kg of body weight per day of physical activity, the minimum judged necessary to obtain health benefits from physical activity.450 The CFLRI results apply to Canadians 18 and older. The most recent 2000 Physical Activ ity Monitor Survey ranked 61% of Canadians and 62% of Nova Scotians as not active enough to reap the health be nefits of a physically active lifestyle.451 446 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999, Ottawa, page 189; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, The Changing Face of Heart Disease and Stroke in Canada 2000, Ottawa, 1999, page 107; Chen, Jiajian, and Wayne J.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 117 Measuring Sustainable Development Because there are so many definitions of physical activity and inactivity, an \"international consensus group\" was formed in 1998 to deve lop an internationa lly agreed upon set of measures of physical activity participation. The group has now developed and pilot-tested a set of International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ), with Canada one of 12 countries participating in the validati on and reliability ph ase of the project.452 2.2 National Population Health Surveys According to Statistics Canada's 1996/97 Nationa l Population Health Survey, only 18% of Nova Scotians can be classified as physically active, expending 3.0 or more kilocalories of energy per kilogram of body weight per day. This compares to 21% of Canadians, and 27% of British Columbians (the most active in the country). Another 22% of Nova Scotians are moderately active (1.5-2.9 kcal/kg/day), and 61% are inactive (less than 1.5). By contrast, 57% of Canadians and 50% of Albertans and British Columbians ar e inactive. Figure 1 demonstrates an east-west gradient, with western Canadians ge nerally more active than easterners.453 Figure 1: Physically Active Canadians (3.0 kcal/kg/day), Canada and Provinces, age 12+, 1996-1997 (Percent) Source: Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999 452 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, International Consensus Project on Physical Activity Measurement, Ottawa, available at: http://www.cflri.ca/cflri/research/ipaq.html . 453 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999, page 190 GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 118 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentFigure 2: Inactive Canadians (less than 1.5 kcal/kg/day), Canada and Provinces, age 12+, 1996-97 (percent) Source: Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, 1999. 2.3 Regular Exercise 1985-1996 Statistics Canada's CANSIM database provides information on trends over time for the number of Canadians who exercise regularly. The data indicate an increase in physical activity among Canadians as a whole, while the proportion of th e population exercising regularly in Nova Scotia has remained stagnant. Fifteen years ago Mari timers were more physically active than most Canadians, exercising more frequently in their leisure time. Today all four Atlantic provinces rank significantly below the Canadian average (Figure 3).454 Interestingly, the averages conceal some impor tant gender differences. Women have generally increased their rates of leisure time physical ac tivity quite dramatically since 1985, by 24% in Newfoundland, 15% in Nova Scotia, and 8% in New Brunswick. Overall this is a good prognosis 454 Statistics Canada, CANSIM Database Matrix #M1011, Tables H501100 - H501212. Percentages calculated by the author using population figures for 1985 and 1996 from Statistics Canada, CANSIM Database, Matrices #M6367 - M6371 inclusive, and selected Tables from C892268 to C8 93542. In this, as in all provincial tables, caution must be exercised in interpreting trends for Prince Edward Isla nd, as sample sizes are frequently small and produce a larger margin of error than for the other provinces. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 119 Measuring Sustainable Developmentfor women's health in this region, and should help decrease the rate of card iovascular disease and other chronic ailments among women. By contrast, while more Canadian men than ever are exercising in othe r parts of the country, more Atlantic region males are becoming sedentary. In all four Atlantic provinces, there has been a dramatic decline in physical activity by men. By this measure, fully six out of ten Atlantic region men do not exercise regularly in their free time, with decl ines in male activity rates of 36% in P.E.I., 18% in New Brunswick, 13% in Nova Scotia, and 4% in Newfoundland. Fifteen years ago, in every Atlantic province, more me n than women exercised on a regular basis, by a significant margin. Today, in every Atlantic province, more women exercise than men. In the long term, the trends indicate that while Atlantic Canadian men had a relatively lower risk of heart disease in 1985 compared to other Canadi ans, they now have a si gnificantly higher risk, the costs of which will gradually become evident over time. Figure 3: Persons Who Exercise, 1985 - 1996 (%) Source: Statistics Canada, CANSIM Database GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 120 Measuring Sustainable Development2.4 CFLRI: Physical Activity Monitor Since 1998, the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyl e Research Institute (CFLRI) has produced provincial survey data on rates of physical activity and inactivity in Canada. Unlike the Statistics Canada data on regular exercise above, the CFLRI data show rates of in activity in Nova Scotia declining from 69% in 1998 to 65% in 1999 to 62% in 2000. In Canada as a whole longer trend lines are possi ble, because nationwide data sets are available at irregular intervals since the first Canada Fitness Surv ey in 1981. They show considerable progress being made over 15 years, with physical inactivity rates falling from 79% in 1981 to 63% in 1995, and physical activity rates rising by an average of one percenta ge point each year, as awareness of the health benefits of physical activity sprea d. Since 1995, however, this progress has stalled, with little improvement since that time.455 Figure 4 below gives rates of phys ical inactivity in Canada from the CFLRI Physical Activity Monitor for 2000. These results are not comparable to those provided by the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) in Figure 2 above. Ev en using comparable years, the 1996-97 CFLRI Physical Activity Monitor found that 66% of Cana dians were not sufficiently active to reap the benefits of physical activity, while the NPHS data for those years report ed a physical inactivity rate of 57% for Canadians. The difference is due to the fact that CFLRI evaluation criteria are markedly different from those in the NPHS, as noted in the discussion on definitions in section2.1 above.

GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 121 Measuring Sustainable Development15. The Economic Cost of Physical Inactivity 3.1 Methodology To estimate the economic costs of physical inactivity (or of any other risk f actor) in Nova Scotia, the following steps are necessary: 1) The epidemiological evidence is examined to ascertain the relationship between physical inactivity and various diseases. This is expresse d as the \"relative risk \" (RR) of developing a particular disease for a physically inact ive person compared to an active person.456 The relative risk is determined by dividing the ra te of the disease among sedentary people by the rate of disease among active people. For exampl e, if sedentary people are twice as likely to develop heart disease, then the relative risk (RR) is 2. In this case, the relative risks for seven ch ronic diseases, and the methodology for assessing the economic cost of physical inactivity, are taken from an analysis by Katzmarzyk, Gledhill, and Shephard in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), 28 November, 2000.457 GPI Atlantic used the same method in early 2000, also based on a CMAJ analysis, to assess the cost of obesity in Nova Scotia.458 To the best of our knowledge the November, 2000, CMAJ article is the first Canadian study to us e previously published meta-analyses and large prospective epidemiological stud ies to estimate the relative risks attributable to physical inactivity for various chronic diseases. This now makes it possible, for the first time, to assess the economic cost of physi cal inactivity in Nova Scotia. 2) The second step is to ascertai n the prevalence of a risk fa ctor within a given population. Because the CMAJ article uses the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute'sPhysical Activity Monitoring Survey results (2.4 above), this analysis does the same in order to obtain comparable results and maintain the same methodology. However, the CMAJarticle used 1997 survey results, while this N ova Scotia analysis uses the most recent 2000 results. Coincidentally, the 2000 Nova Scotia ra te of physical inactivit y (62%) is identical to the 1997 Canadian physical inactivit y rate, so that the population attributable fraction of each disease is also identical. (see step 3 below.) 3) To assess the public health burden of sedentary living, or of any other ri sk factor, the relative risk (step 1) is combined with the absolute frequency of physical in activity (or other risk factor) in the population. The re sulting population attributable fraction (PAF) of a disease is an estimate of the effects of an individual ri sk factor on a given dise ase, and the extent to which each disease is attributable to the ri sk factor. The population attributable fraction 456 Methodological explanation from Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute (CFLRI) \"The Burden of Inactivity,\" The Research File , reference no. 98-01; \"Health Care Savings,\" The Research File, reference no. 97-02; \"An Economic Case for Physical Activity,\" The Research File, reference no. 95-03. 457 Katzmarzyk, Peter, Norman Gledhill, and Roy Shephard, \"The Economic Burden of Physical Inactivity in Canada,\" Canadian Medical Association Journal, 163 (11), November 28, 2000. 458 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Obesity in Nova Scotia, Halifax, March, 2000. That study used the methodology of C. Laird Birmingham et al., in the Canadian Medical Association Journal 160 (4), 23 February, 1999. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 122 Measuring Sustainable Development(PAF) of a disease is, therefore, the propo rtion of each chronic disease that could theoretically be prevented by eliminating physical inactivity.459 The population attributable fraction (PAF) for each di sease is calculated as [P(RR - 1] / [1 + P(RR - 1)], where P is the prevalence of phys ical inactivity in the population (in this case 62%), and RR is the relative risk for the diseas e in an inactive person. The results from steps 1-3 are presented in Table 1 below. 4) The fourth step is to multiply the population at tributable fraction (PAF) for each disease by the total cost of treating that partic ular disease, using Health Canada's Economic Burden of Illness in Canada (EBIC), which describes illness co sts by diagnostic category. In other words, we estimate the direct he alth care costs of tr eating the particular diseases that are linked to physical inactivity by using the popu lation attributable fraction (PAF) of each disease to estimate the fraction of those cost s that are attributable to physical inactivity. This analysis is based on the basic methodol ogy of Katzmarzyk et al. in assigning costs to particular diseases, but the costs are updated and adjusted for Nova Scotia specific data whenever possible. Katzmarzyk et al. used th e 1993 EBIC results, inflated to 1999 values. In this analysis Nova Scotia spec ific results from the 1998 EBIC (scheduled for release in May, 2002) are used. Also, the provincial incidence of particular diseases is used wherever such data are available. Another difference is that this study includes a category of \"other\" direct costs, following the new 1998 EBIC classification. This includes cost s for other institutions, home care, and a range of private medical expenditures, in additi on to the four direct cost categories used in the 1993 EBIC (hospitals, drugs, physicians, and re search). In assessing the costs of medical care attributable to physical in activity as a percentage of to tal Nova Scotia health care expenditures, two estimates are therefore given in this report. The first is a percentage of total direct health care costs, pub lic and private. The second refl ects a percentage of the Nova Scotia taxpayer-funded health care budget (and thus excludes private expenditures and most \"other\" costs). Katzmarzyk et al. used costs specific to co ronary heart disease a nd stroke from the 1993 EBIC. The 1998 EBIC does not yet provide Nova Scotia specific data for these illnesses separate from the broader category of cardi ovascular diseases. Ther efore, the proportion of heart disease and stroke as a percentage of total cardiovascular disease from the 1993 EBIC is applied to the provincial data from the 1998 EBIC. By this estimate coronary heart disease accounts for 28.2% of the direct h ealth care costs for all cardi ovascular diseases, and stroke accounts for 19.6% of cardiovascular disease dir ect costs. These overall percentages are used to estimate the \"other\" cost category. For hos pital, drug, physician, and research costs, the 1993 EBIC estimates the proportion of total cardiovascular medical costs that are attributable to heart disease and stroke; a nd these percentages are then ap plied to the 1998 cardiovascular disease cost estimates for Nova Scotia, as indicated in the notes to Table 2 below. 459 Methodological explanation from CFLRI, \"The Burden of Inactivity\" and \"The Economic Case for Physical Activity,\" op. cit.; and Katzmarzyk et al., op. cit., page 1437. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 123 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentThe EBIC diabetes estimates are adjusted to account for the fact that type 2 diabetes constitutes 92.5% of diabetes cases. Again, the N ova Scotia specific co st estimates from the 1998 EBIC include diabetes in the endocrine and related disorders diagnostic category. In the 1993 EBIC, diabetes constituted 43.3% of all di rect endocrine and re lated disorder health care costs, and type 2 diabetes would constitute 40.0% of cost s for this diagnostic category. Colon cancer and breast cancer costs are estimated in this re port by using the incidence of these two cancers relative to al l cancers in Nova Scotia, usi ng the National Cancer Institute of Canada's Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001. Colorectal cancers acc ount for 13.3% of all cancers in Nova Scotia. According to Katzma rzyk et al., colon cancers constitute 67.1% of total colorectal cancers, so that colon cancers would amount to about 8.9% of all cancer incidence in Nova Scotia. This is very close to the 8.6% estimate used by Katzmarzyk et al. for Canada. As Nova Scotia has the second highest rate of colorectal cancers in Canada, this slightly higher estimate makes sense. Breas t cancer accounts for 12.7% of all cancers in Nova Scotia. Hypertension costs are assessed relative to total cardiovascular disease costs according to the proportions used by Katzmarzyk et al., base d on U.S. estimates. This assigns 5.7% of hospital costs attributable to cardiovascular diseases, 50.6 % of drug costs, and 28.7% of physician costs to hypertension treatment. Because heart disease and stroke together account for less than 3% of all health science research in cardiovascul ar diseases, we have assigned 80% of cardiovascular research costs to hyperten sion. The total amount here is small, but this figure may require readjustment as new evidence becomes available. For other direct costs,including other institutions, home care and a range of private medical expenditures, we arbitrarily use the average of the hospital, drug, and physician percentages given here - namely, 28.3% of the other direct health care cost s attributable to cardiovascular diseases are assigned to hypertension treatment. Osteoporosis costs are not separated out in the EBIC from the general musculoskeletal disease diagnostic category. Katz marzyk et al. therefore use an independent assessment of the burden of illness due to os teoporosis in Canada, pegged at $1.3 billion annually. For this disease, we assign costs according to th e Nova Scotian proportion of the Canadian population, on the assumption that the pr evalence of osteoporosis is similar. 5) Indirect productivity losses due to prematur e mortality and disability for each of these diseases are estimated as follows. For coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, the ratio of indirect to direct costs from the 1993 EBIC is applied to the direct cost estimates in Table 3 below. Costs for those more specific dia gnostic categories are gi ven in the 1993 EBIC but are not yet available at the provincial level in the forthcoming 1998 EBIC results. For colon cancer and breast cancer, the ratio of indirect to direct costs fo r all cancers in Nova Scotia is used from the 1998 EBIC. Similarly, since productivity losse s due to hypertension were not separately available, the ratio of indirect to direct cost s for all cardiovascular disease in Nova Scotia is used from the 1998 EBIC. Likewise, productivity losses due to osteoporosis ar e estimated by using the ratio between indirect and direct costs for all muscul oskeletal disorders in Nova Scotia from the GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 124 Measuring Sustainable Development1998 EBIC. Katzmarzyk et al. did not attempt es timates of these wider economic losses, but they have been included in this study, just as they were in earlier GPI Atlantic estimates of the costs of obesity and tobacco in Nova Scotia. 6) An important category of illn ess related to physical inacti vity has been omitted in the Katzmarzyk et al. cost estimates - namely mental illness. As noted above, Statistics Canadahas estimated that sedentary Canadians are 60% more likely to suffer from depression than physically active Canadians. Phys ical activity also protects against stress, which has been assessed in meta-analyses of medical costs as the most expensive risk factor, accounting for about 8% of health care costs. 460 For this reason, a rough estim ate is added in this study, based on the 1998 EBIC figures for Nova Scotia, of the possible costs of mental illnessattributable to physical inactivit y in the province. Although it is not possible at this stage to derive an accurate population attributable fr action (PAF) for mental illness in relation to physical inactivity, it is considered more accura te to attempt an estimate for this category than to assign it an ar bitrary value of zero. Other cost estimates omitted by Katzmarzyk et al . relate to association of physical activity with dyslipidemia, poorer quality of life, and premature admission to an institution or geriatric care. No attempt has been made here to provide cost estimates for these conditions or situations. Some costs of physical inactiv ity related to obesity are also omitted. Since obesity is linked to diseases such as gallbladder disease and pulmonary embolism in additionto those described here, physical inactivity may indirectly contri bute to ailments that are not included in the costs estimates in Table 2 below. 7) The number of premature deaths attributable to physical inactivit y in Nova Scotia is estimated by multiplying the number of deaths at tributable to each inactivity-related disease by the population attributable fraction (PAF) for th at disease. Deaths from heart disease and stroke in Nova Scotia are taken from Health Canada's Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians. Deaths from colon cancer and breast cancer in Nova Scotia are from the National Cancer Institute of Canada's Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001, taking 67.1% of the colorectal cancer mortality figures for colon cancer deaths, as described above. Deat hs due to diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis are derived from Katzmarzyk et al., and assume the same proportion of deaths due to these three conditions in Nova Scotia, as a percentage of total physical inactivity rela ted deaths, as in Canada. A similar method is used to estimate potential years of life lost due to physical inactivity. 8) Finally, the savings that could potentially be realized from a 10% reduction in physical inactivity are derived from the estimates of Katzmarzyk et al. who recalculated the population attributable fractions (PAF) of each disease and corresponding costs by assuming a 56% prevalence of inactivity instead of a 62% prevalence. Katzmarzyk and his colleagues then estimated savings according to the differe nce between the two sets of costs. The 56% prevalence is 62% minus 6.2% (representing a 10% reduction in physical inactivity). As the current Nova Scotia physical in activity rate (62%) is identical to that used by Katzmarzyk et 460 Aldana, Steven, \"Financial Impact of Health Promotion Programs: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature,\" in Goetzel, Ron, (ed.) \"The Financ ial Impact of Health Promotion,\" American Journal of Health Promotion 15 (5), May/June, 2001. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 125 Measuring Sustainable Developmental. for Canada in 1997, the Nova Scotia savings are assumed to be proportional to the results derived by Katzmarzyk et al. 3.2 Direct Costs of Physical Inactivity, Nova Scotia Table 1 gives the relative risk (RR) estimates fo r each of seven chronic diseases that have been associated with physical inactivity, based on ep idemiological studies reviewed by Katzmarzyk et al., and the population attributable fractions fo r each disease based on Nova Scotia's physical inactivity prevalence rate of 62%. This tabl e corresponds with Table 2 in Katzmarzyk et al (CMAJ 163 (11), page 1437). A relative risk of 1.9 for coronary heart disease (or cor onary artery disease as it is also called) means that physically inactive people have a 90% greater chance of having that disease than those who are physically active. As noted above, this is a conservative estimate by comparison with the Statistics Canada anal ysis of National Population Health Survey results reported above. The bracketed numbers following the relative risk ratios represent the possi ble range of results based on a 95% confidence interval (CI). A population attributable fraction (PAF) of 35.8% for heart disease means that more than one- third of heart disease in Nova Scotia could be avoided if all Nova Scotians were physically active. This is higher than the 22% estimate for the U.S. reported above. Table 1 also indicates that about 20% of stroke, hypert ension, colon cancer, and type 2 diabetes, as well as 27% of osteoporosis and 11% of breast cancer, could be eliminated if Nova Sc otians who are presently sedentary became physically active. The most likely explanation for the differences in population attribut able fractions (PAF) between these results and those re ported earlier for the U. S., is that different methods are used to estimate prevalence of inactivity. Some of th ese differences are noted in the discussion of definitions in 2.1 above. The relative risk rati os do not differ markedly, and U.S. studies are included in the epidemiological meta-analyses c onducted both by Colditz at the Harvard Medical School and by Katzmarzyk and his colleagues. Bu t the method of assessi ng inactivity prevalence will produce markedly different population attr ibutable fractions (PAF) for each disease. It has not been possible in this study to conduct sensitivity anal yses based on alternative methods of assessing physical inactivity prevalence, bu t Katzmarzyk and his colleagues did perform sensitivity analyses that varied each population attributable fraction (P AF) and disease-specific health care cost by 20% above and below the mean estimate. That range is also presented in this study, but GPI Atlantic suggests that the lower range may be more accurate, since it does appear that the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute standard, on which the 62% inactivity rate used in this study is based, is a fairly high standard. The disparity between the Nova Scotia results in the 1996-97 National Population Health Survey, and in the 1998 Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Re search Institute Physical Activity Monitor - the two closest years available for comparison purpos es - demonstrates the variance in standards. The 1998 CFLRI results for Nova Scotia show a 69% inactivity rate, whereas the National GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 126 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentPopulation Health Survey (NPHS) results for 1996-97, the nearest comparable years, show a 61% inactivity rate. Given that rates of physical inactivity have been dec lining in the province, according to the CFLRI surveys, from 69% in 1998 to 65% in 1999 to 62% in 2000, it is unlikelythat the inactivity rate according to these st andards would be less in 1996-97 than in 1998. If anything, the trend line indicates that we would expect the inactiv ity rate to be higher in 1996-97 than in 1998. In other words, the CFLRI standard indicates a potential 13% higher rate of physical inactivity than would be derived using the National Popula tion Health Survey standard of <1.5kcal/kg/day. Using the NPHS standard would therefore produ ce lower population attribut able fractions (PAF) for each disease, more in line with the U.S. figures, and would also produce correspondingly lower medical cost estimates. Table 1: Relative risk and population attribut able fraction due to physical inactivity for major chronic diseases, Nova Scotia, 2000. Disease RR (and 95% CI) PAF (%) Coronary heart disease 1.9 (1.6 - 2.2) 35.8 Stroke 1.4 (1.2 - 1.5) 19.9 Hypertension 1.4 (1.2 - 1.6) 19.9 Colon cancer 1.4 (1.3 - 1.5) 19.9 Breast cancer 1.2 (1.0 - 1.5) 11.0 Type 2 diabetes 1.4 (1.2 - 1.6) 19.9 Osteoporosis 1.6 (1.2 - 2.2) 27.1 Note: Based on a prevalence of physical inactivity of 62% in Nova Scotia in 2000 according to the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute Source: Katzmarzyk et al., Canadian Medical Association Journal 163 (11), Nov. 28, 2000, page 1437. Even though these relative risk (RR) and popu lation attributable fr action (PAF) estimates reported by Katzmarzyk and his colleagues in the Canadian Medical A ssociation Journal differ from some of the U.S. results reported earlier, thei rs is the first Canadian effort to derive medical care costs attributable to physical inactivity. For this reason we ha ve used the relative risk and population attributable fraction (P AF) estimates reported by Katzmarzyk et al. in Table 1 above, and applied these to the Nova Scotia cost estimates in Table 2 below. Table 2 presents estimated direct health care costs attributable to physical inactivity in Nova Scotia. About $94.7 million are spent annually in direct he alth care costs due to physical inactivity. Theoretically, this is the annual amount that could be saved if all Nova Scotians were physically active. Physical inactiv ity accounts for 25% of the total costs of treating heart disease, stroke, hypertension, colon cancer, breast cancer, di abetes 2, and osteoporosis in Nova Scotia. The $94.7 million cost estimate includes private spen ding on medical care, which includes spending on institutions other than hospita ls, and on home care. Looking only at hospital, physician and drug costs, total spen ding attributable to the seven chronic illnesses in Table 2 is GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 127 Measuring Sustainable Development$235 million.461 Applying the population attributable fr actions from Table 1 for these seven illnesses, physical inactivity would account for $58.4 million in hospital, physician and drug costs. This amounts to 3.6% of total spending on hospitals, physicians, a nd drugs in Nova Scotia in 1998. If this percentage is applied to a total pr ovincial health care budget of $1.9 billion, it indicates that physical inactivity costs the taxpayer-funded Nova Sc otia health care system about $68.7 million annually.462 Table 2: Health Care Costs for Chronic Diseas es Linked to Physical Inactivity in Nova Scotia 1998 (2001$ thousands), and estimated dir ect economic cost of physical inactivity Hosp.

However, at the present time, other direct health care costs in Nova Scotia, including private spending for other institutions and home care, are available only for all illn ess categories combined. These additional direct costs are therefore extrapolated here for the se parate diagnostic categories, on the assumption that they occupy the same proportion of total direct health care costs for each di agnostic category separately as they do for all health expenditures combined. More precise information on these other costs may become available later this year, when the electronic version of The Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1998 (EBIC 1998) is released. If provincial information on other costs is not provided at that stage, other costs by diagnostic category at the provincial level can be extrapolated from national data on the ratio of other costs to total health care costs by diagnostic category. In the meantime, the absence of direct informat ion for this column should not substantially affect the total results, since the figures given here do reflect the actual proportional breakdown for all diagnostic categories for the province. 464 \"Total\" refers to hospital, physician, drug, and health science research costs plus other medical expenses, including privately funded services, home care, and costs of other institutions. 465 According to the 1993 EBIC, coronary heart disease accounts for 32.3% of hospital costs attributable to cardiovascular diseases; and 30.3% of physician costs; 15.3% of drug costs; and 2.2% of research costs attributable to cardiovascular diseases (Health Canada, Economic Burden of Illness in Canada 1993, Ottawa, 1997, table 2, page 10). These percentages are applied to the 1998 EBIC figures for Nova Scotia (forthcoming, May, 2002). 466 According to the 1993 EBIC, stroke accounts for 25.9% of hospital costs attributable to cardiovascular diseases; and 8.6% of physician costs; 7.1% of drug costs; and 0.8% of research costs attributab le to cardiovascular diseases. These percentages are applied to the 1998 EBIC figures for Nova Scotia. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 128 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentParadoxically, these direct expendi tures on hospitals, doctors, dr ugs and other medical services are conventionally counted in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and related economic growth statistics, and are therefore mistakenly taken as contributions to prosper ity and well-being. In the Genuine Progress Index, by contrast, the $94.5 million in health care costs attributable to physical inactivity is counted as a cost, not a gain to the economy. If all Nova Scotians were physically active, the $94.5 million would presumably be available to be spent on more productive activities, includi ng sport and recreation, that contribute to well-being. Katzmarzyk et al. conducted sensitivity analyses that varied each populati on attributable fraction (PAF) and disease-specific health care cost by 20% above and below the mean estimate. This exercise has not been repeated here. But if the results of Katz marzyk et al. are applied to the estimates in Table 2, then the dire ct health care costs at tributable to physical inactivity could be as low as $63 million or as high as $130.3 million. As noted above, the Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute sta ndard is higher than that used in the National Population Health Survey to define physical inactivity. Applying the NPHS standard would lead to a cost estimate of about $82.7 million attributable to physical inactivity, rather than the $94.7 million estimate given here. 3.2.1 Accounting for Mental Health Costs due to Physical Inactivity Katzmarzyk and his colleagues omit estimates of ment al illness costs attr ibutable to physical inactivity. As noted above, Statistics Cana da estimates, based on the 1996-97 National Population Health Survey results, indicate th at sedentary Canadians are 60% more likely to suffer from depression than physically active Cana dians. Physical activity also protects against stress and anxiety. Mental illness costs Nova Scotia $249.2 million in direct health care expenditures.467 If just 5% of these costs could be avoided through physic al activity that redu ces the incidence of depression, anxiety, and stress, then $12.5 million a year in mental health care costs might be ascribed to physical inactiv ity. Including mental illn ess costs therefore raises the estimate of total direct health expenditures due to phys ical inactivity in Nova Scotia from $94.7 million to $107 million annually. Similarly, if 5% of the $160 million currently expended on treati ng mental health through hospitals, drugs, and physician services can be attributed to physical inactivity, then physical inactivity would account for a total of $66.5 million in hospital, drug, and physician costs. This amounts to 4% of total provincial spending on hospita ls, drugs, and doctors that can be attributed to physical inactivity. It must be emphasized that population attributable fractions for mental ailments like depression, anxiety, and stress were not availa ble for this study, and the 5% attr ibution here is an arbitrary, if conservative, estimate. However, since mental health has been reli ably linked to physical activity, it is more accurate to include some estimate of mental illness costs due to physical 467 Colman, Ronald, The Cost of Chronic Illness in Nova Scotia, GPI Atlantic, Halifax, 2002, based on 1998 EBIC estimates for Nova Scotia. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 129 Measuring Sustainable Developmentinactivity than to assign such costs an arbitr ary value of zero, which is implied by omitting the diagnostic category entirely. 3.3 Indirect Costs of Physical Inactivity, Nova Scotia Table 3 adds estimates for indirect productivity losses due to premature mortality and disability for each of the diseases that are related to physical inac tivity. Productivity losses due to premature mortality are estimated according to the ratio of indirect to direct costs from the 1993 EBIC for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. For heart disease, produc tivity losses due to disability are also according to th e ratios provided in the 1993 EBIC. For stroke, the 1993 EBIC provides estimates of productivity losses due to premature death, but not due to disability. The latter are therefore extrapolated from the 1998 EBIC for Nova Scotia, according to the following reasoning. Productivity lo sses due to premature death as a result of coronary heart disease account for 62% of all premature death costs due to all cardiovascular diseases. By contrast, heart disease accounts for ju st 28% of direct costs for all cardiovascular diseases, and just 15% of all indirect costs due to disability resulting from all cardiovascular diseases. In other words, a disproportionately hi gh share of total heart disease costs result from premature death. Stroke would therefore o ccupy a correspondingly smaller proportion of productivity losses due to premature death resu lting from all cardiovascular diseases and a correspondingly larger propo rtion of productivity losses due to disability. The estimates in Table 3 reflect these assumptions and are extrapolated from the totals provided for all cardiovascular diseases in the EBIC. Disability costs due to diabet es are estimated using the rati o of productivity losses due to disability to productivity losses due to prematur e death for all endocrine diseases (from the 1998 EBIC for Nova Scotia). For the other illnesse s, indirect costs due to productivity losses are estimated according to the ratio of indirect to direct costs fr om the 1998 EBIC results for Nova Scotia for cardiovascular diseases (for hypertensi on), for all cancers (for colon cancer and breast cancer) and for musculoskeletal di sorders (for osteoporosis). For the latter three diseases, the ratio of productivity losses due to premature death a nd due to disability are extrapolated from the totals for all cancers and for all musculoskeleta l disorders. For hypertension, a total indirect cost estimate is given without any attempt to make th is distinction, the assumption being that indirect costs due to hypertension are lik ely due to disability losses. Table 3 indicates clearly that the greatest costs of chronic illness are du e to the premature death and disability they produce, re sulting in substantia l productivity losses to the economy. Physical inactivity is responsible for $241 million annually in productivity losses. In other words, the Nova Scotia economy would be worth $241 million more each year than it currently is if it had the productive services of the hund reds of Nova Scotians disabl ed or killed prematurely by a sedentary lifestyle. When direct medical cost s and economic productivity losses are added, Table 3 shows that the total economic burden of physi cal activity to Nova Scotia exceeds $322 million annually.

Productivity losses due to mental i llness that is attributable to physical inactivity would add an estimated $4.4 million to the indirect costs in Table 3, agai n on the assumption that 5% of mental illness could be avoided through physical activity.468 Added to the estimated $12.5 million in direct health care expenditures on mental illness th at can be attributed to physical inactivity, the total economic cost of physical inactivity in Nova Scotia can be estimated at $353 million annually. 3.4 Premature Deaths due to Physical Inactivity in Nova Scotia The indirect costs and productiv ity losses due to premature de ath in section 3.3 above are a function of two variables:1) the number of premature deaths attributable to each diagnostic category that could have been avoided if all Nova Scotians were physically active; and 2) age at death, which determines the potential ye ars of life lost due to physical inactivity. Table 4 identifies the first of these two variables explicitly by applying the population attributable fractions for physical inactivity to five key illnesses. Os teoporosis and hypertension are not included in this estimate because they are rarely direct causes of death, but are rather implicated in other causes of death. For example, an osteoporotic fracture can result from a fall, but the consequent death may be reported as due to injury rather than to osteoporosis, which is the underlying cause. Heart disease and stroke deaths in Table 4 are from Health Canada's 1999 Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians; colon and breast cancer deaths are based on the National Cancer Institute of Canada's Canadian Cancer Statistics 2001; and diabetes deaths are extrapolated to 468 Based on 1998 EBIC estimates for Nova Scotia. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 131 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentNova Scotia from U.S. data reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Table 4 is based on Table 4 in Katzmarzyk et al., Canadian Medical Asso ciation Journal 163 (11), page 1438. Table 4 shows that if all Nova Scotians were physically active, life expectancy could be increased in the province, and 711 premature deat hs could be avoided each year. This is 9.2% of all deaths among Nova Scotians.

Katzmarzyk and his colleagues attribute 10.3% of all premature deaths in Canada to physical inactivity, and state that we could theoretic ally save 21,340 Canadian lives that are lost prematurely each year if all Canadians were physi cally active. Proportionate ly, this is a slightly higher estimate than the one in Table 4 above. The di fference is due to the fa ct that different data sources were used for death statistics, and that Katzmarzyk and his colleagues based their estimate on total adult deaths, while Table 4 above is ba sed on total Nova Scotian deaths, regardless of age. Table 5 estimates the potential y ears of life lost annually due to physical inactivity. These estimates take into account both th e number of deaths and the averag e age of death attributable to various illnesses. Health Canada's Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians considers deaths before age 70 as \"early\" deaths, and it counts the difference between these early deaths and age 70 as potential years of life that have been lost.470 Potential years of life lost due to heart dis ease, stroke, and cancer are taken from Health Canada's Statistical Report on th e Health of Canadians. Potential years of life lost due to colon cancer and breast cancer are assumed here to be the same as for all cancers. 469 Based on U.S. data, there are estimated to be 150 deaths in Nova Scotia each year that are directly attributable to diabetes, but diabetes is a contributing cause to about 300 more deaths annually. Because it is a complicating factor in other serious illnesses, diabetes is frequently under-re ported as the cause of death on death certificates. The estimate in Table 4 counts only those deaths directly attri butable to diabetes 2, accoun ting for the fact that type 2 diabetes accounts for 92.5% of all diabetes cases. 470 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, page 319. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 132 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentComparable estimates for diabetes were not av ailable at time of publication. Health Canada reports that \"approximately 25,000 potential years of life lost (PYLL) were lost as a result of diabetes prior to age 75 in 1996,\"471 signifying an average of 4.6 years lost per death. However, it has not been possible to conver t this figure to the 70-year ag e baseline at this time, and an extrapolated estimate is therefore provided here. Since heart disease is the most frequent cause ofdeath among people with diabetes, th e average years of life lost pr ior to age 70 per heart disease death (3.5 years) is also used here for diabetes. 472 Table 5 shows that Nova Scotians each year lose about 2,200 potential years of life due to physical inactivity. This constitutes 6.5% of all po tential years of life lost each year in the province due to all causes. If a ll Nova Scotians were physically active, society and the economy would benefit from an additional 2,200 productiv e person-years each year. It should be noted that this is a conservative estimate, as the aver age life expectancy for N ova Scotians is 78 years. If years of life lost were assessed against this average, the loss would be very much larger.

That is, they assumed the rate of physical inactivity to be 56% of the adult population instead of the cu rrent rate of 62%. This is in line with the 1996 public health objective proclaimed by Canadian federal, provinc ial, and territorial gov ernments to achieve a 10% reduction in physical inactivity by 2003.473 471 Health Canada, \"Diabetes in Canada,\" available at http://www.hc- sc.gc.ca/hpb/lcdc/publicat/diabet99/d02_e.html . 472 Health Canada, Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians, pages 291 and 321. 473 Health Canada, Federal, Provincial and Territorial Fitness and Recreation Committee, Physical Inactivity: A Framework for Action, Ottawa, 1996. GENUINE PROGRESS INDEX 133 Measuring Sustainable DevelopmentKatzmarzyk et al. found that a 10% reduction in physic al inactivity would reduce health care costs attributable to physical inactivity by 7%, resulting in health car e savings of $161 million nationwide. Applying the same percentage savi ng to the Nova Scotia cost estimates above (including mental health) yields estimates of savings as follows474: Hospital, physician, and drug costs $4.6 million less per year Total direct health care costs $7.5 million less per year Economic productivity gains (avoided early death and disability) $17.2 million Total annual economic savings $24.7 million A 10% reduction in physical inactivity could also save 50 lives a ye ar in Nova Scotia, and avoid 156 potential years of life lost annually. Needless to say, even a 56% rate of physical inac tivity is very high. Smoking is still regarded as a major avoidable health problem even with a pr evalence rate half as high as that of physical inactivity. Therefore, the potent ial for far more substantial long-term savings through promotion of sports, exercise, and recr eation is very large indeed. Katzmarzyk and his colleagues conclude their Canadian Medical Asso ciation Journal analysis with a strong recommendation: \"Given the considerable efforts that ha ve been aimed at curb ing the prevalence of smoking in Canada, public health campaigns di rected at increasing physical activity in the population should be no less aggressive and persistent.\"475 474 These savings are not realized immediately following a reduction in inactivity, becau se the benefits of regular exercise accrue gradually. 475 Katzmarzyk et al., op.
