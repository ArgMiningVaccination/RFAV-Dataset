Men and transgender women who have sex with men can now receive the JYNNEOS vaccine if they had skin-to-skin or intimate contact with people at large venues or events in the past two weeks. The eligibility criteria also expanded to include people 18 and older who were diagnosed with HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea or early syphilis within the past year or who are on PrEP, an HIV prevention medication. The expansion comes one week after the [county health department added another group](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/08/17/dallas-county-expands-monkeypox-vaccine-requirements-following-influx-of-doses/) to the list of people who can receive the two-dose vaccine series: men and transgender women who have sex with men and met partners through a website, app or social event, like a bar or party, in the past two weeks. \"We're expanding the circle of people who can get the vaccine so we can protect the people most at risk,\" said Dr. Philip Huang, the county's top health official. \"We want to make the doses we have of the vaccine count.\" Previously the vaccine was restricted to two categories: people who had skin-to-skin contact with someone with the virus, and men who have sex with men and who have had multiple or anonymous partners in the previous two weeks. This changed after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of a new vaccination method in an effort to stretch the short-supplied vaccine treatment. Now, smaller doses \u2014 about one-fifth of a vial \u2014 can be injected between layers of skin rather than underneath the skin. Dallas County is still working through the 5,000 vials of the monkeypox vaccine it received over a week ago. The vials equate to up to 25,000 doses when administered through the new method. Monkeypox cases in Houston and Harris County have surpassed those in Dallas County, giving it the largest portion of cases in the state. Houston and Harris County reported 455 total cases as of Sunday, while Dallas County reported 444 cases as of Tuesday. Texas has 1,340 monkeypox cases, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The only states with more cases are New York, California and Florida. Huang said the county has caught up on all calls to its monkeypox hotline, which was overwhelmed with call volumes after opening in early August. The shortage of federally distributed vaccines led Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins to [ issue an emergency declaration](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/08/05/dallas-county-declares-emergency-due-to-monkeypox-outbreak/) over the outbreak. He said the county is using the declaration to get more doses of the vaccine. Monkeypox primarily spreads through skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. It causes flulike symptoms and a blistery rash that may be on or near the genitals. While the majority of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, the virus can infect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation or age. Dallas County residents who qualify for the vaccine can call the health department's monkeypox hotline at 972-692-2780. Noting the high call volumes, the health department website urges people to keep trying if the call disconnects. [Worried about monkeypox? "}
