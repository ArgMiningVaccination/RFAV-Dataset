Well-being is achieved through the balance of all functions - mind, body and spirit. If one is not functioning fully, the systems become unbalance resulting in strain on the other systems. Eventually, this can cause illness to develop including pain, fatigue, headaches, digestive issues, depression and other ailments. This is an ancient form of health care. The word Ayurveda roughly translates to mean \"knowledge of life.\" This health principle is concerned with treating all aspects of mental and physical well-being that affect health.
