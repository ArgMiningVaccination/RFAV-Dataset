LiceOut is a pure and all natural formula derived from seed bearing plants. It is fragrance-free, hypoallergenic and perfect for children with sensitive skin. Just apply LiceOut all over hair and scalp, leave on for 30-40 minutes, and rinse thoroughly. Repeat as necessary. Non-Toxic & Powerful Instead of relying on poisons to kill head lice, Enviro-One LiceOut kills head lice by affecting their shells (exoskeleton). Because head lice exoskeleton is composed of oil-based molecules, LiceOut's colloidal micelle action dissolves the oils on their shells which and cause them to die. Because mammals are not oil-based, but rather aqueous (water)-based, LiceOut is absolutely harmless to humans and animals. - 128 oz. - 8 oz.

AVOID CONVENTIONAL HEAD LICE TREATMENT: The main ingredient in many conventional head lice treatments that are considered poisonous or potentially harmful is a group of chemicals called pediculicides. The most common pediculicides used in these treatments are synthetic pyrethroids, such as permethrin and pyrethrin, and organophosphates, such as malathion. These chemicals work by targeting the nervous system of head lice to kill them. However, it is important to note that while these ingredients can be effective at eliminating head lice, they also come with potential risks and side effects. They can cause skin irritations, allergic reactions, and in some cases, more severe health issues, especially if not used according to the instructions or with repeated exposure. Due to these concerns, many people are now seeking alternative non toxic head lice treatment that are safer for both individuals and the environment. Natural and non-toxic ingredients, such as those found in products like Enviro-One LiceOut, offer a safer and more eco-friendly approach to head lice treatment without the potential risks associated with poisonous chemicals.
