HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) attaches to HVEM and blocks BTLA-HVEM inhibitory signaling and allows for co-stimulation through LIGHT, which binds to a different domain on HVEM. Here we present preclinical studies exploring CD8+ T cell responses induced by chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC) vector-based vaccines expressing tumor antigens genetically fused into gD. Methods Mice received one or two immunizations with AdC vectors expressing antigens of HPV16 or melanoma, with or without gD. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses, including their magnitude, functions, duration, specificity profile, and differentiation status were characterized by antibody stains and multicolor flow cytometry in na\u00efve and tumor-bearing mice. Vaccine efficacy was determined in different challenge models, including in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy. Results Vaccination with gD-antigen fusion proteins consistently enhanced CD8+ T cell frequencies to the disease-specific antigen, delayed or prevented tumor growth, and improved survival. Addition of gD increased stimulation of CD8+ T cells to subdominant epitopes and thereby enhanced breadth of response. In tumor bearing mice CD8+ T cells induced in presence of gD shows delayed differentiation towards exhaustion. Addition of anti-PD-1 treatment further improved the efficacy of gD-containing tumor vaccines. Conclusions Checkpoint modification targeting the HVEM pathway using a genetically encoded gD, fused to a disease-specific antigen, produced potent, prolonged, and broad CD8+ T cell responses across different preclinical studies. Clinical studies to evaluate therapeutic vaccination with gD are planned. Legal entity responsible for the study The Wistar Institute and Virion Therapeutics, LLC. Funding Virion Therapeutics, LLC.
