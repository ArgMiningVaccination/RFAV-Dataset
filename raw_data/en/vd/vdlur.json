There is a need to continue examining neuro-immune-endocrine crosstalk in the context of sexual dimorphisms in chronic pain. Several phenomena in particular need to be further explored. In patients, autoantibodies to neural antigens have been associated with sensory pathway hyper-excitability, and the role of self-antigens released by damaged nerves remains to be defined. In addition, specific immune cells release pro-nociceptive cytokines that directly influence neural firing, while T lymphocytes activated by specific antigens secrete factors that either support nerve repair or exacerbate the damage. Modulating specific immune cell populations could therefore be a means to promote nerve recovery, with sex-specific outcomes. Understanding biological sex differences that maintain, or fail to maintain, neuroimmune homeostasis may inform the selection of sex-specific treatment regimens, improving chronic pain management by rebalancing neuroimmune feedback. Given the significance of interactions between nerves and immune cells in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, this review focuses on sex differences and possible links with persistent autoimmune activity using sciatica as an example.

This is especially pertinent, given that the physiological systems that are perturbed in a state of persistent pain involve com- plex networks, including the nervous and immune systems, endocrine feedback, and the vas culature. In order to signifi- cantly improve health outcomes, not only for pain but also f o rar a n g eo fc o n d i t i o n s ,ag r o w i n gc o n s e n s u si st h a tb i o - logical sex differences must be addressed, across scientific disciplines [ 1]. A holistic view will provide an improvedunderstanding of how pain develops and becomes chronic, and how men and women respond differently to nocicep- tive signaling as well as to treatments aimed at curbing signals that become aberrant. A large-scale longitudinal study of over 45,000 participants in 16 European countries examined the prevalence of chronic pain over a lifespan. While its incidence increased in both sexes during aging, the numbers of men and women reporting chronic pain progressively diverged, with this separation commencing in early adulthood ( http://www.pai nineurope.com ;[2]). A plethora of studies support that there are higher rates of pain [ 3-7] and post-traumatic stress [ 8, 9] in women compared with men. Although spanning be- yond the emphasis of the current review, literature supports that chronic pain represents a state of stress, and may be a significant factor in determining the incidence of depression, with coexistence of pain and depression in turn exacerbating \u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-020-00339-ythe severity of each condition [ 10]. Interestingly, de- pression also occurs more frequently in women [ 11], and there may be shared biological mechanisms im- pacted by gonadal steroid hormones and the chromo- somal complement that underlie these sex differences. Females also consistently report a greater sensitivity to muscle, pressure, and temperature-associated pain than males [ 6]. In relevant animal models, increased hyper- sensitivity [ 12,13] and insufficient fear extinction [ 14, 15] have been reported in females, with experimental data supporting that thresholds and sensitivity are af- fected by the stage of the murine estrous cycle [ 16,17]. These outcomes in females may be associated with over- active immune cell infiltration in to damage-associated sites, with immune activity not retu rning to a homeostatic state post-injury. Of note, general sex differences in the human immune system of a healthy middle-aged population reflect a significantly higher number of peripheral T lymphocytes in women compared with men [ 18], with evidence support- ing heightened adaptive immune responses in women [ 19, 20]. This \"basal \"sexually dimorphic immune system prim- ing, which occurs in the absence of injury or insult, may in- fluence the outcome of pathological conditions, including autoimmune disorders and persistent pain. It should be noted that there are significant connections between unre- solved pain and neurological disorders other than stress sensitivity and depression, such as Alzheimer 's disease, Par- kinson 's disease, and autism spectrum disorders [ 21-23]. While a discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope of this review, it is important to acknowledge that these conditions may provide important parallel, biologically rele- vant insights into neuroimmune sex differences that may also be applicable to pain research and the development of tailored analgesic therapies. As clinical practices move toward addressing the dis- tinct analgesic needs of males and females, it will be im- portant to consistently account for the interconnected effects of both gonadal hormones and their associated pathways as well as the sex chromosomal status of indi- viduals. It is now well-recognized that the activity of the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS, respectively) are affected by the immune system, the state of which may dictate the efficacy of treatment out- comes. While perception and environment play import- ant roles in nociception, this review discusses examples of specific, evolutionarily preserved, biological parame- ters that may differentially contribute to the persistence of pain in males and females. An emphasis is placed on impingement of the sciatic nerve, which represents a common injury that, in many cases, leads to the develop- ment of chronic neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain, a complex condition that is often refractory to currently available treatment options, may arise from injury to the somatosensory system. Such an injury is not alwayssufficient to generate persistent pain, with age, genetic back- ground, and sex all having been shown to shape an individ- ual'sr i s k[ 24]. An emerging subcategory of pain research is focusing on the possibility that persistent neuropathic pain may have an underlying autoimmune component, especially given that, in general, both autoimmune and chronic pain disorders occur at higher rates in females [ 25-28]. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms that underlie sex differences in pain sig- naling. In females, the immune system may be continu- ously \"ready for action, \"potentially due to the presence of two X chromosomes, each bearing a plethora of genes involved in immune responsiveness. Another potential explanation as to why women exhibit heightened im- mune responses that may drive chronic pain is the pregnancy-compensation hypothesis. This line of think- ing proposes that during a woman 's reproductive years, the immune system is constantly readying itself for the \"foreign \"placenta. Declining parity rates could have repercussions in the event of nerve injury, such as an in- creased incidence in persistent pain, or less pronounced improvements in response to existing analgesics. In addition, gonadal hormones, including estradiol and testosterone, have also been implicated. Estradiol is both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative, with reproduct- ive to aberrant signals, such as neuronal damage-associated antigen presentation and immune cell activation. Several autoimmune diseases have been associated with lower-than-normal androgen levels, although the decline in testosterone during male aging and the effect of hormone replacement on chronic pain remain understudied. Each of these facets will be exam- ined in the context of a peripheral nerve injury based on the current literature. Persistent sciatic nerve pain Sciatica, a common type of neuropathic pain attributed to impingement of, or injury to, one or both of the sci- atic nerves, is experienced by up to 10% of patients with chronic lower back pain, with a reported lifetime preva- lence that ranges from 49 to 70% [ 29]. Importantly, lower back pain is among the types of pain reported to occur more frequently in women than in men [ 6]. The sciatic nerves are of mixed-function, consisting of both motor and sensory axons. They branch to peripherally innervate the legs, several muscles, and skin in the lower extremities [ 30], and their nociceptive component, rep- resented by the sensory axons that include A ,A, and C fibers, is associated with the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). A discussion of ferent axons (the ventral root), and their relationship toLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 2 of 29sciatic nerve pain is beyond the scope of the current re- view, which has instead focused on cross-talk between afferent nociceptors and immune cells. DRG neurons, which are peripheral nerve bundles that also contain the somata of nociceptors, convey pain signals from the periphery into the CNS (reviewed in [ 31]). Studies also suggest that DRG actively participate in nerve injury as- sociated with platelet-activating factor (PAF), inflamma- tion, of neuropathic pain [ 32-35] by metabolically influencing functionally relevant path- ways between the PNS and CNS. A deeper understand- ing of the role of DRG in the context of neuroimmune cross-talk may advance treatment options for persistent neuropathic pain. In support of this notion, according to a 2017 study by Deer et al., DRG stimulation was shown to relieve pain more effectively than stimulating the spinal cord in patients with complex regional pain syndrome [ 36], which presents with many of the same symptoms as sciatica and is discussed later in the current review. As the most common symptom of sciat- ica, peripheral neuropathic pain typically extends through the hip and buttock down one leg, with the leg consequently feeling numb, weak, or \"tingly. \"Preclinical studies based on sciatic nerve injury in rodents are frequently used to cost-effectively provide a model of neuropathic pain [ 37] and are therefore being used to examine sexually dimorphic outcomes. Indeed, behav- ioral and electrophysiological research by our group has shown that this type of pain persists in female rodents, while males respond well to various agents that have been tested to date [ 38-40]. Neuronal signaling, reviewed The primary focus for gaining a better mechanistic un- derstanding of how sex influences pain has been at the level of neuronal signaling. Nociceptive nerve terminals express a variety of channels, molecules, and receptors, including ion channels, neuropeptides, and cytokine re- ceptors, respectively (reviewed in [ 41]). Under normal circumstances, nociceptors detect potentially harmful stimuli, such as changes in pressure, noxious chemicals, and temperature. In response to a nerve injury that is signaled to be a homeostatic threat, nociceptors may be- come aberrantly activated, or hyper-excited, even in the continued absence of the initial stimulus that evoked pain. This provides the potential for a normally non- noxious stimulus, such as gentle stroking of the skin, to cause exquisite pain. The coordination of a regenerative response requires that information about the peripheral nerve injury be relayed to the relevant soma (cell body) of the nocicep- tor, which, in the case of the sciatic nerve, occurs at the DRG (reviewed in [ 42]). Ascending pain signaling in- volves the transmission of nerve impulses, in the form ofaction potentials produced by excitable peripheral noci- ceptive neurons, along their axons to the DRG, with relay of pro-nociceptive messages towards second-order neurons located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and further transmission to the thalamus, cortex, and ul- timately, higher centers in the brain for further process- ing and initiation of relevant descending signals (reviewed in [ 42]). Physiologically, as succinctly de- scribed by Hammond, \"an action potential is generated when the membrane potential of a specific cell location rapidly rises and falls: this depolarization then causes ad- jacent locations to similarly depolarize. The action po- tential is therefore merely a sudden and transient depolarization of the membrane. \"And, \"in neuronal somas and axons, action potentials have a large ampli- tude and a small duration: these are the Na+-dependent action potentials \"[43]. As a \"signal, \"an action potential therefore represents the coordinated movement of so- dium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the mem- brane of a nerve cell, thereby altering its resting potential. The balance of these particular ions is shifted in response to a disturbance or injury, which may be chemical, electrical, or mechanical in nature, triggering changes in the net charge of the membrane. As men- tioned above, it is important to note that the sequence of depolarization and repolarization events occurs in a localized area of the membrane. In the case of injury to the sciatic nerve, an aberrant, \"non-physiological \"action potential may be generated anywhere along the axon that is affected by the insult, which is then compounded further by the resulting immune response. These changes are then passed on to the next area of the mem- brane, along the entire length of the axon. In this man- ner, the action potential, as the nerve impulse or \"signal, \"is transmitted to the DRG. It should be pointed out here that the conduction of an action potential may be modulated by the T-junction, the bifurcation point at which the peripheral axon of a sensory neuron separates into the central branch to con- tinue on to the spinal cord, and the stem, which joins the cell body of the nerve within the DRG [ 44]. This pseudounipolar structural arrangement suggests a possi- bility for low-pass filtering in modeling studies [ 45], with impedance mismatch altering spike propagation (reviewed in [ 46]). This in turn would lead to variations in membrane potential and action potential conductance in proximity to the T-junction, potentially affecting the sensory information that is passed on into the CNS. Ex- perimental evidence from unmyelinated and myelinated sensory neurons supports that spikes do fail as they pass through the DRG, most likely at the T-junction [ 47-49]. Studies have been conducted to model how the signaling of C-fibers, which represent a major type of nociceptor, is influenced by T-junction morphology in conjunctionLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 3 of 29with local ion channel expression, as both may be im- portant in pain signaling [ 50]. Hyper-excitability of nociceptors may arise due to con- tinued aberrant action potential generation (changes in amplitude and/or frequency), disinhibition of synaptic transmission, a loss of synaptic connectivity, and the formation of new synaptic circuits [ 24], eventually manifesting itself as persistent pain. The process of central sensitization, which has been described as \"an enhancement in the function of neurons and circuits in nociceptive pathways caused by increases in membrane excitability and synaptic efficacy as well as to reduced in- hibition \"[51], is a driver in the maintenance of chronic pain. Hyper-excitability may be influenced by distinct hormonal profiles in males and females. For instance, N- methyl- D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, which has been associated with a hyper-excited state [ 52], may occur in a sexually dimorphic manner. NMDAR currents in the DRG are more dense in female than in male rats, likely through a mechanism involving 17- -estradiol [53]. In addition, certain DRG gene products responsible for ion transport, some of which may be involved in gen- erating a hyper-excitable response, have been shown to be upregulated in female rats [ 54]. Neuronal signal transduction mechanisms It has long been recognized that numerous mediators released by diverse peripheral cell types (fibroblasts, im- mune cells, and neurons) such as (IL)6; IL-6), free radicals, histamine, peptides (i.e., substance P), prostanoids (i.e., PGE2), and protons can act directly on sensory nerve terminals [ 55]. In addition to nociceptor sensitization, these factors are able to stimulate the re- lease of other substances, activate the immune system, and play a role in vasodilatation and plasma extravasa- tion. Sensitization of the nociceptive system involves the binding of these mediators to receptors present on sensory neurons, resulting in activation of second- messenger pathways and modulation of ion channels. Some of these mediators also alter gene expression profiles of the nociceptor [ 56]. To reiterate, not only are responses accompanied by transient modifications related to the excitation and sensitization of afferent peripheral sensory terminals (reviewed in [ 57,58]), they may also elicit more enduring changes in phenotype, which may be important for conditions in which persist- ent pain occurs. With regard to the latter, for example, phenotypic switching of specific nociceptive fiber types has been documented [ 59,60], and phenotypic changes are elicited by nerve growth factor (NGF) during tissue inflammation; these changes include an increase in neuropeptide levels that in turn may amplify sensory in- put signals at the level of the spinal cord, increasedperipheral neuroinflammation, and upregulation of growth-related substances that promote axonal sprouting in the area of the injury, culminating in a decrease in the overall excitability threshold [ 61]. Coupled with increased excitability of spinal neurons [ 62], specific neuronal genes, particularly microRNAs such as the miR-183 cluster [ 60], may be associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Various mechanisms underlie signal transduction from the axon to the DRG soma (reviewed in [ 63]). As already mentioned, a large depolarizing voltage is relayed to the somata in response to a peripheral insult, resulting in spiking activity and sustained membrane depolarization involving neuronal voltage-gated Na+channels, which ultimately leads to significant calcium influx in the axon and soma (reviewed in [ 63]). Changes in intracellular calcium levels are known to play an important role not only in neuronal signaling, but in gene expression [ 64], with the latter associated with a modification of the nociceptor phenotype. Another process, referred to as positive injury signal- ing, is facilitated by the transport of kinases \u2014in particu- lar, members of the interact with dynein/dynactin in order to be trans- ported to the DRG (reviewed in [ 63]). In this manner, these kinases are then able to regulate gene expression at the nuclear level within the cell bodies of the DRG. There is evidence to suggest that signaling endosomes facilitate the transport of nerve growth factor (NGF) sig- nals from nociceptive neurons to their somata [ 65]. This latter type of \"nerve signaling \"represents an interesting means by which a distal factor known to be associated with inflammation [ 66], produced and released by per- ipheral tissue (for example, fibroblasts rapidly produce upregulated levels NGF in response to pain-inducing cutaneous plantar [ 67] and deep muscle [ 68] incision in rats, and it is also expressed by central and peripheral nerves, as well as microglia and peripheral immune cells [69]), is able to regulate the structure and function of sensory neurons. It should also be pointed out that, de- pending on where it is released, NGF diffuses to either peripheral sensory nerve endings or presynaptic axon terminals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, binding to and activating its cognate receptors [ 69]. Relevantly, Eskander et al. showed that NGF treatment induced a long-lasting increase in peripheral and central transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activity in rodents, supported ceptive responses, increased calcitonin gene-related from biopsies of the cutaneous hindpaw, as well as increased capsaicin-evoked inward current and upregulated membrane expression of TRPV1 protein in DRG neurons [ 70]. In addition, support forLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 4 of 29retrograde vesicle-mediated transport has been attained by characterizing endosomes isolated from lumbar (L) 4 and L5 DRG neurons associated with the sciatic nerve [65]. Not only was NGF transmitted via axonal transport of early endosomes, the latter also contained its receptor, TrkA, as well as activated intracellular signaling proteins including ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and PI3K/Akt. Moreover, phosphorylated p38MAPK (p-p38) and the activated form of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), which is stim- ulated by p-p38 and associates with DNA, either as a ho- modimer or after heterodi merizing with c-Jun, were also present in the early endosomes [ 65], suggesting that target gene transcription was occurring in rele- vant DRG. By activating downstream target genes, ciliary neuro- trophic factor (CNTF) as well as the (gp130)-associated cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-6, allow for a greater number of growth processes to occur in the DRG (reviewed in [ 63]). Expanding briefly on the role of IL-6 in peripheral nerve injury-associated signal transduction, this particular cytokine binds its axonal membrane receptor and associ- ates with the gp130 transmembrane protein, thereby initiating a cascade involving signal transducer and acti- vator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [ 71,72]. It has been demonstrated that chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve triggers IL-6 production and a resultant increase in the activation of STAT3 signaling within the nerve [72]. Axonal STAT3, which is activated at the injury site, acts as a transcription factor in sensory neurons [ 73], with activated STAT3 dimers traveling to the neuronal nucleus within the soma to promote the transcription of a specific repertoire of target genes [ 72,74,75]. Finally, negative injury signaling hinders the retrograde transport of trophic factors and serves as a negative regulator of neuronal growth, including, for example, via the trans- forming growth factor (TGF)- /SMAD2/SMAD3 pathway (reviewed in [ 63]). The consequent outcome of peripheral axonal injury is a change in the expression of nociceptor- associated genes within the DRG, which play roles in in- flammation, cell death, and nociception (reviewed in [ 76]). A case for exploring cell types other than nociceptors In addition to action potential generation and retrograde signaling, there is significant evidence to implicate direct crosstalk between immune cell populations and the ner- vous system at the level of the DRG, as well as spinally, in response to a peripheral nerve injury. This is particu- larly relevant, given that the portion of a DRG that branches off at the T-junction to the soma, from axons of various distinct classes of nociceptive fibers, also con- tain satellite cells [ 77], as well as fibroblasts, macro- phages, T and B lymphocytes, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells that represent their vascularcomponent (reviewed in [ 78]). Each of these non- neuronal cells may have a significant influence on pain signaling. A mechanistic approach commonly used in preclin- ical pain research is the assessment of nociceptor expression profiles at the single-cell RNA level in rele- vant DRG somata. A recent study employing such a strategy examined the molecular profile of primary afferents from naive male and female mice, as well as animals of each sex that had undergone a partial sciatic nerve ligation to mimic a state of neuropathic pain [79] .L o p e se ta l .f i r s ta p p l i e df l o wc y t o m e t r y -based cell sorting to purify sensory neurons from dissociated DRG of non-injury-bearing naive rodents. This tactic provided the power to detect twofold changes in tran- script levels via RNA sequencing (RNAseq) with a high degree of certainty. However, only a small repertoire of transcripts, the majority o f which were associated with either the X or Y chromosomes, was differentially expressed between the sexes. The majority of these mRNAs have also been shown to be differentially expressed in human post-mortem [ 80] and neonatal mouse [ 81] brains. Surprisingly, using the same cell sorting approach to restrict RNAseq to sensory neu- rons, an almost identical set of transcripts was found to be differentially expres sed in male and female ipsi- lateral L3 to L5 DRG (the region associated with the sciatic nerve) collected 8 day s post-partial sciatic nerve ligation [ 79]. Importantly, a clear sex difference emerged only when peripheral immune cell infiltration into the DRG was examined. While a greater number of cell-sorted macrophages, monocytes, and neutro- phils were present in DRG of both sexes following pain-inducing nerve impingement, more B cells were detected in males, and more T lymphocytes were detected in females [ 79]. These findings highlight the importance of separately ex amining neuro ns and other cell types, particularly cells associated with adaptive and innate immune responses, to systematically categorize the source of sexual dimorphisms in gene expression that contributes to sciatic nerve -associated neuropathic pain. This notion is supported by findings from previous RNAseq studies that were carried out in relevant preclinical models. These studies were based on examining the entire DRG cell population, demon- strating individual transcript differences in males (ipsi- lateral versus contralateral DRG) [ 82,83] or in males compared with females [ 54] without providing cell- specific context. While Hu et al. did employ selective single-cell RNAseq, different types of DRG sensory neurons were manually picked based on cell diameter alone, without any further c haracterization to defini- tively isolate neurons from other resident cell types, including immune cells [ 84].Linher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 5 of 29Immune responses related to sciatic nerve injury: an overview Relevant immune cell types and cytokines As mentioned earlier in this review, immune cells se- crete factors that are able to directly influence neuronal activity, phosphorylating ligand-gated channels, modu- lating the activity of voltage-gated ion channels, and in- creasing intracellular calcium levels through activation of various receptors including neuronally expressed cytokine receptors (reviewed in [ 41,85]). The end result is an alteration of membrane properties and greater ac- tion potential generation, along with signal propagation to higher-order centers, for heightened pain sensation in response to injury or insult. In addition, various immune cells are also present within the DRG and the spinal cord, potentially contributing to sexually dimorphic sig- naling that may contribute to the chronification of pain. A general overview of immune activity associated with neuropathic pain that may be induced by a sciatic nerve injury is depicted in Fig. 1. A brief functional summary of several key immune cell types and cytokines is also provided here to establish their context in pain-evoking neuroinflammatory processes. Dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells that stimulate naive T cells (reviewed in [ 86]), with the latter, in their differentiated form, in turn promoting B cell differentiation and providing support in responses to certain antigens (reviewed in [ 87]). Macrophages engulf and destroy pathogenic substances and infected cells (reviewed in [ 88,89]), also playing a role in the activa- tion of B and T lymphocytes (reviewed in [ 88,89]). B lymphocytes are a distinct adaptive immune cell popula- tion that protects against specific antigens by secreting antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 10 (reviewed in [ 90]). Broadly, CD4+T helper (Th) lym- phocytes produce a repertoire of specific cytokines that support adaptive immune responses \u2014for example, by contributing to the activation of cytotoxic CD8+T cells and macrophages, as well as the maturation of B cells into plasma or memory B cells, B lymphocyte-driven antibody production, as well as immune tolerance, or suppression thereof (reviewed in [ 91-93]). Neutrophils are another versatile cell type that facilitate microbial de- struction through a variety of mechanisms, also mediat- ing inflammatory processes [ 94]. Many of these immune cells of peripheral origin se- crete repertoires of ILs, as well as interferon gamma (IFN- ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- )[95]. Some of these factors are able to directly activate noci- ceptive nerve terminals, leading to sensitization, aberrant action potential generation, and neuropathic pain (reviewed in [95,96]). For example, TNF- is able to directly activate TNF- receptors on peripheral nerve terminals, with this interaction shown to amplify hyperalgesia [ 97,98]. Theactivity of immune cells, however, may not be localized to a singular region, and aberrant action potential generation that occurs in response to a sciatic nerve injury, which results in a hyper-excitable state, does not have to occur at sensory nerve endings. Rather, these action potentials can occur along the damaged axon itself [ 99,100]. Certain cytokines also extensively inf luence the activity of other immune cell types. For instance, IFN- , most notably pro- duced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, promotes the development and activation of CD4+Th 1 (Th1) cells and stimulates the expression of the major histocompatibil- ity complex class II (MHC-II), thereby promoting macro- phage activity and inducing th e secretion of other cytokines (reviewed in [ 101]). In addition, IFN- receptor signaling has been shown to mediate the activation of microglia in the CNS to drive neuropathic pain [ rele- Th17 the cytokine IL-17. The primary function of IL-17 is to pro- vide protective immunity against pathogens by contrib- uting to neutrophil activation, but it also participates in pro-inflammatory and pathological autoimmune pro- cesses (reviewed in [ 103,104]). It should be noted that, in addition to these adaptive Th17 cells, IL-17 is also produced by T cells [ 105] ,w h i c hp l a yar o l ei ni n - nate immune responses (reviewed in [ 106]). At the site of the peripherally injured sciatic nerve and associated DRG As a first step in the peripheral nerve injury -induced inflammatory process, immune cells are recruited to the site of injury as well as to the associated DRG. This is facilitated through acti vation of toll-like receptors (TLR), which are expressed on several immune cell types (reviewed in [ 42]). TLRs respond to an accumu- lation of damage-associated cellular debris, triggering nuclear factor- B( N F - B) and subsequent transcrip- tionally mediated cytokine synthesis (reviewed in [ 42, 107]). For example, TLR4, whi ch is primarily known to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is expressed on B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, as well as astrocytes and microglia [ 108,109]. In mice with a partially ligated sciatic nerve that experience mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the injury- associated limb, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutro- phils, and lymphocytes infiltrate the area around the impinged nerve and the corresponding ipsilateral DRG [110]. Mast cells have also been identified as a compo- nent of the immune response associated with nocicep- tion following sciatic nerve ligation, particularly by influencing the recruitment of neutrophils and mono- cytes to the injured nerve [ 111]. Moreover, a signifi- cant increase in the expression of IFN- , IL-10, and the IFN- /IL-10 ratio has been observed in rats 1 week after inducing a sciatic nerve injury [ 112].Linher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 6 of 29Fig. 1 Neuro(auto)immune response to sciatic nerve inju ry. Using the sciatic nerve as an example, this fig ure provides a snapshot overview of the events that may underlie a neuroimmune response, which may involve aspects of aberr ant autoimmune interactions, to a per ipheral nerve injury. Following ne rve injury, depolarizing voltages as well as positive and negative injury sign aling mechanisms transduce informat ion about the injury to the DRG, allow ing for the coordination of a regenerative resp onse. From the DRG, signals are transmitted from the peri phery to the spinal cord by cytokines, nucleotides, a nd chemokines, resulting in microglial and astrocyt ic activation in the dorsal spinal horn. Ultimately , these signals are transduced to centers in the brain for further processing. Various immune populations are recruited to the site of sciatic nerve injury and the ipsilateral DRG. The factors influencing im mune cell recruitment are complex and include toll-like receptors, Schwann cells, an d other immune populations, cytokines , and chemokines. The activity of t hese immune cells is dynamic, and in many instances, may not be localized to a sin gular region. In the context of sciatic nerve injury, there is evidence of neutrophil, dendritic cell, macrophage, and T lym phocyte presence at the site of injury and ipsilate ral DRG. The latter two immune cell types produce pro- inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- , which can activate nociceptive Th1 lymphocytes produce IFN- , which regulates macrophage activity and is detected at the sciatic nerve afte r injury. IL-17, produced by Th17 lymphocytes, pla ys a role in mediating infiltration of T lymphocyt es to the site of injury as well as activation of microglia an d astrocytes. B lymphocytes are also recruited to the site of injury and can produce pathological Ig G autoantibodies, including those that form an immune complex when bound to gangliosides on neuronal and axonal cell surfaces. Autoantibody production may be promoted by IL-10, which is produced by Th2 lymphocytes and is detected at the sciatic nerve after injury. Anti-ganglioside autoantibody immune complexes interact with Fc RIII on macrophages and glial cells at the site of injur y, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and inhibition of axon regener ation, thus likely resulting in chronic pain. These immune complexes may interact with Fc RI in the DRG; this interaction generates excitable activity in nociceptive neurons and may result in the secretion of CGRP and substance P in the DRG. Both CGRP and substance P are involved in signal transduction and the latter neu ropeptide may promote long-term potentiation o f excitable currents generated via the NMDAR. Prolonged hyper-excitability of nociceptive neurons may eventually result in chronic painLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 7 of 29Schwann cells, which, in the PNS, comprise the myelin sheath by wrapping around the neuronal axon, also re- spond to cellular debris and release neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and chemokines to attract phagocytes to the to the site ( [ 114]; reviewed in [ 107]). Neurogenic inflammation, which in- volves the secretion of primary afferent neuronal signals and neuropeptides [ 115], plays an integral role in neu- trophil recruitment (reviewed in [ 107]). In particular, the neuropeptides substance P and CGRP are significantly involved in pain transduction [ 116-118]. With regard to immune cell recruitment, the cooperative activity of TNF- and IL-17 has also been shown to facilitate neu- trophil infiltration into the damaged area [ 119]. IL-17 also interacts directly with its receptor at nociceptive nerve terminals (reviewed in [ 120]. In IL-17 knockout mice with a peripheral nerve injury, decreased mechan- ical hypersensitivity has been shown to be accompanied by decreased T cell and macrophage infiltration to the injured sciatic nerves and the L3-5 DRG [ 121]. In addition, local administration of IL-17 is associated with increased numbers of activated dendritic cells and infil- trating neutrophils at the site of the injected hind paws, and increased neutrophil infiltration in the injected sci- atic nerves [ 121]. While it is known that CD8+cytotoxic T cells are recruited to peripherally injured nerves, responding to elevated antigen-presenting MHC class I molecules, the precise mechanism underlying this process remains unclear ( [ 122,123]; reviewed in [ 124]). It was recently shown that Treg cells also play a role at the site of a peripheral nerve injury, counteracting neuropathic pain by inhibiting Th1 cell-mediated re- sponses [ 125], and it has been reported that there is a disrupted Th17/Treg balance in patients with chronic low back pain [ 126]. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also known chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), produced by primary afferent neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, is released in synaptic vesicles following peripheral nerve in- jury [ 127]. This chemokine has been shown to promote the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, and dendritic cells to the injury site, resulting in significant inflammation [ 128-130]. With regard to the DRG, the factors and exact mechanisms influencing immune cell recruitment to this area of the injured nerve also remain to be defined. However, chemokine expression (such as CCL2/MCP-1 as well as CCL3/MIP-1) may play a signifi- cant role, particularly in the context of macrophage infil- tration, which appears to be mediated by the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) present in the DRG [ 131]. Once recruited to the site of neuronal injury, the im- mune cell milieu is able to contribute to nociceptorsignaling by triggering aberrant action potential gener- ation in a localized manner. Other, possibly concurrent processes, which have yet to be clearly defined, may con- tribute to nerve injury signaling to the DRG soma. The primary means by which secreted cytokines cause noci- ception is by modulating the activity of voltage-gated so- dium channels (Na v1.7, Na v1.8, and ion and TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)] (reviewed in [41]). Interestingly, it has been shown that much of the CCL2 released in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of nerve-injured rodents originates from TRPV1-positive nociceptive fibers [ 127], suggesting the presence of feed- back loops that perpetuate neuroimmune interactions. Ul- timately, activation of these channels via neuroimmune interactions causes increased action potential generation and firing of a nociceptive neuron, which has been exten- sively reviewed by others [ 41,132]. As an example, TNF- activates the TNF- receptor 1 (TNFR1) to promote Nav1.9 phosphorylation, while IL-6, by activating the gp130 channel, increases the expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 (reviewed in [ 41]). Application of IL-17A into the DRG of a rat arthritis model reduced the threshold re- quired to stimulate an action potential, also increasing the number of action potentials generated [ 133], providing additional insight into the complex nature of this cyto- kine's contribution to pain. Overall, cytokines (such as TNF- ,I L - 1 , IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokines (such as CCL2/MCP-1), along with sodium and TRP channels, in- crease the primary afferent signals that are sent via the DRG into the spinal dorsal horn (reviewed in [ 107]). Of note, while TNF and IL-1 contribute to neuropathic pain in mice with a sciatic nerve injury, these cytokines are also required for functional recovery [ 48]. Indeed, recovery was impaired in TNF, IL-1 , and TNF/IL-1 knockout mice [48]. Taken together, these findings suggest that homeo- static dysregulation of cytokine production, rather than their mere presence, contributes to neuropathic pain oc- curring in response to a sciatic nerve injury. From the DRG to the spinal cord The next step in ascending nociceptive signaling involves the transduction of the signal from the periphery into the spinal cord. Microglia, which are considered the \"resident macrophages of the CNS, \"are activated by the described sensory afferent-derived injury signals. These may include pro-inflammatory cytokines, nucleotides, and chemokines that are released through post-synaptic sur- face receptors as well by other immune cells, which is ac- companied by the activation of pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 (reviewed in [ 134]). A significant increase in microglial and astrocytic activation occurs in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of cyto- kines, reactive oxygen species, and brain-derivedLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 8 of 29neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the spinal cord to com- municate with other components of the neuronal network and other immune cells (reviewed in [ 134]). Accumulating evidence supports that spinal CD4+T cell-dependent responses contribute to the maintenance of neuropathic pain. The infiltration of lymphocytes into the dorsal spinal cord and their subsequent release of cy- tokines have been shown to play key roles in \"neuro- pathic pain -like hypersensitivity \"in an adult rodent model of peripheral nerve injury, which does not occur in neonates [ 135]. Furthermore, Sun et al. showed that not only is CD4+T cell infiltration into the spinal cord increased in a rat model of peripheral nerve injury, sig- nificant upregulation of IL-17, as well as IL-1 and IL-6 and astrocytic prolifera- tion also occur in the spinal dorsal horn of injured rats compared with sham animals [ 136]. In IL-17 knockout mice bearing a peripheral sciatic nerve injury, mechan- ical hypersensitivity was shown to be significantly de- creased, concomitant with decreased astrocytic and microglial activation in the L3 -L5 dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord [ 121]. The functional role of T cells that cross the blood-spinal cord barrier has been emphasized by work in T cell -deficient rodents, which exhibit reduced neuropathic pain -associated [ 135,137,138]. This latter pro-nociceptive re- could be reversed by adoptive transfer of splenic CD4+T cells derived from nerve-injured animals [ 137, 138]. In addition, in mice lacking IFN- receptors, periph- eral nerve injury -induced tactile allodynia and activation of spinal microglia have been shown to be attenuated [102,135]. More on microglia In a normal physiological state, microglia are \"resting \" yet dynamic, continuously scanning their environment for any changes that could alter homeostasis [ 139,140]. Upon exposure to certain signals, microglia are activated to perform innate immune functions [ 140]. In this latter state, microglia drive synaptic alterations within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, representing a key pro- nociceptive event (reviewed in [ 141]). It is thought that microglia that fail to return to a resting state contribute to persistent neuropathic pain (reviewed in [ 142]). The finding that the purinergic receptor 4 (P2X4), a highly sensitive ligand-gated ion channel, is expressed by microglia highlighted their importance in mediating per- ipherally induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in rodent models of 143]. In to nerve injury, tran- scriptional upregulation of microglial P2X4 expression was found to be linked with specific ATP-mediated signaling events associated with dysregulated chloride transport (reviewed in [ 144]). Pharmacologically inhibit- ing or genetically blocking P2X4 cord ofrodents abrogates nociceptive hypersensitivity [ 143,145], although it is important to note that this would affect both microglia as well as central neurons, as P2X4 expression is not microglially restricted [ 146]. It is also important to note that this particular pro-nociceptive signaling pathway was characterized in male rodents [143,147-150]. Similarly, innate immune response- associated TLR4, the CNS expression of which is pri- marily restricted to microglia, has been shown to only contribute to hypersensitivity in male mice [ 151,152]. It has been suggested that specific microglial activities, which may \"exhibit a spectrum of distinct functional states, \"may be restricted in the CNS, occurring in an extremely localized manner [ 153]. In support of this no- tion, it was recently reported that microglia are differen- tially activated in the anterior and posterior horn of the spinal cord after chronic constriction injury in male rats [154]. Nishihara et al. demonstrated that anterior micro- glial activation may result in synaptic stripping, while ac- tivated microglia in the posterior horn may be engaged in phagocytic myelin removal, indicating that differences in microglial activation modes may lead to distinct symptoms that arise in response to peripheral sciatic nerve constriction [ 154]. It will be of considerable inter- est to examine whether sex differences are associated with these distinct functions. Of note, Lopes et al. iso- lated a 98% pure population of murine microglia from male and female ipsilateral lumbar spinal cords 8 days post-nerve ligation. Microglial proliferation rates were comparable between the sexes, and a quantitative PCR - based evaluation of the expression of numerous tran- scripts associated with reactive microglia, nociception, and adaptive immunity at the spinal cord level showed no significant sex differences [ 79]. While it is now begin- ning to be accepted that microglia may not be the pri- mary drivers of persistent nociceptive signaling in females [ 155], evaluating the roles of microglia in males and females with a similar nerve injury at the single-cell, or clonal, level may provide specific context-dependent insights. Males and females also exhibit differences in immune system activity involving specific T cell popula- tions, both prior to and following a pain-inducing per- ipheral nerve injury, and these cells are now thought to play a key sexually dimorphic role in the onset of pain and its chronification (reviewed in [ 156]). Evidence from patients T h e r ei sag r o w i n gb o d yo fe v i d e n c et os u g g e s tt h ei n v o l v e - ment of inflammatory processes in chronic sciatic condi- tions, as well as autoimmune pathologies, in humans.

Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 9 of 29TNF- and IL-1 , in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with thoracic disc herniation, with IL-10 negatively, and TNF- positively, associated with high pain scores [ 158]. Although it promotes regenerative activities, IL-10 is also involved in antibody production and has been implicated in several painful autoimmune diseases (reviewed in [ 159]), including the production of autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythe- matosus [ 160]. In a recent systematic review focused on underlying pathogenic mechanisms in sciatica, IL-1 ,I L - 6 , TNF- IL-21 were identified as potential biomarkers, with Jungen et al. reporting a strong positive correlation in longitudinal s tudies between IL-21 and pain [157]. Of relevant interest, IL-21 is synthesized by Th17 cells, driving their production of IL-17 [ 161], and IL-17 has also been shown to contribut e to inflammatory autoimmune pathologies such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arth- ritis (reviewed in [ 103,162]). Autoimmune pathology Autoimmunity represents a p athological process whereby antibodies target self-antigen s, and in certain contexts, con- tribute to neuropathic pain. There is significant evidence to suggest that autoimmune processes are painful (reviewed in [163]). In many cases, autoimmune disorders involve B cell-produced immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies directed against specific self-antigens. Interactions between IgG and t h eF cg a m m ar e c e p t o r( F c R )p l a yar o l ei ni n f l a m m a t o r y autoimmune diseases (reviewed in [ 164,165]), with IgG acting as the major ligand that links humoral and cellular immune mechanisms. It mediates both pro- and anti- inflammatory effects following immune complex formation and engagement with different activating or inhibitory FcRs, which are divided into three main classes: Fc Rt y p e worsen the da mage by further promoting antibody production (reviewed in [ 166]). Fc gamma receptors FcRs are granulocytes (eosinophils and neutrophils), and lymphocytes (B cells and natural killer cells) [ 167, 168], facilitating the binding of these cells to the Fc region on antibodies that have become attached to the surface of pathogens, infected cells, or self-antigens. This in turn re- sults in activation of the FcR-expressing cell, and immune activity. Indeed, macrophage activation requires a balance between immune complexes that bear FcRs [ 169]. Many immunological processes are triggered by Fc Rc r o s s - linking, such as setting the threshold for B cell activation, antigen presentation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotox- icity, degranulation, leukocyte mediators [ 165,170]. A recent transcriptome analysis of the immune system demonstrated that expression of specific Fc Rs is elevatedin female rats [ 171]. The finding that B lymphocytes and IgG are present at the site of a sciatic nerve injury in a relevant animal model provides support to the notion that an underlying autoimmune component influences the outcome of a peripheral nerve injury [ 110,172]. Differ- ences in Fc R expression between the sexes may contrib- ute to the sexually dimorphic prevalence of certain autoimmune disorders, as well as the higher incidence of unresolved persistent pain, in women. FcRI It has been shown that immune complexes interact with the Fc R type I (Fc RI), leading to excitation of certain nociceptive neurons in rat DRG [ 173]. The majority of very small-diameter nociceptors that expressed co-expressed the nociceptive ion channel TRPV1 [ 173], which also regulates the activation and pro-inflammatory properties of CD4+T lymphocytes [ 174] and may be dif- ferentially expressed in males and females in response to sex hormones [ 175-178]. While neither antibody (IgG) nor antigen alone generated an increase in intracellular calcium levels, the entire immune complex was able to elicit this effect, which was abolished by the removal of the IgG Fc portion or application of an anti-Fc RI 173]. cal- cium levels or intracellular calcium stores prevented the immune complex -induced calcium response [ 173]. By eli- citing a prolonged hyper-excited state, immune complex- FcRI binding may contribute to persistent neuropathic pain by promoting nociceptor sensitization [ 96,173]. Activation of Fc RI in the DRG also leads to the secre- tion of substance P, which may act on its own receptors within DRG [ 179,180]. Furthermore, substance P can induce long-term potentiation of the excitable current generated via NMDAR in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord [ 181]. Previous studies have shown that sub- stance P and CGRP enhance vasodilation and contribute to nociception (reviewed in [ 107]). Interestingly, signifi- cant upregulated expression of both of these neuropep- tides has been reported in relevant rat DRG with a peripheral sciatic nerve injury [ 182], indicating that hypersensitivity following may involve excitation evoked by this interaction. It is important to reiterate here that neuropeptides, although often co-released with various neurotransmitters, undergo significantly different pro- cessing within a nerve. Unlike neurotransmitters, which are synthesized in nerve terminals and are then taken up into the presynaptic nerve ending following their initia release, neuropeptides are synthesized in the neural soma within DRG, transported to the synapse, and, once released, are then metabolized. This requires new synthesis as well as axonal transport for theirLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 10 of 29continued action. Of additional note, and adding to the existing complexity of neuroimmune interactions, im- mune cells themselves, including dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, and monocytes, also produce neuropeptides in response to antigens and in- flammation, which then act either on nerves in a paracrine manner, or interact with specific receptors that are expressed on immune cells in an autocrine fashion (reviewed in [ 183,184]). Upon their release, CGRP and substance P are able to directly stimulate or inhibit T cell activation and also produce indirect effects by influencing the recruitment and activation of dendritic cells [ 184]. Evi- dence suggests that chemokine expression within the DRG, which is associated with excitatory signals and pain, promotes the secretion of substance P [ 185], presenting chemokines as another possible mechanism by which in- jury signals are communicated to the DRG. FcRIII FcRIII exists as two highly homologous isoforms: Fc RIIIA (CD16A) is expressed by mast ce lls, macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils , while the expression of FcRIIIB (CD16B) is restricted to neutrophils [ 186,187]. Together, these isofo rms stimulate degranulation, [ 186]. In healthy individuals, CD16 cross-linking by complexes induces antibody-dependent cellular c ytotoxicity. Downregulation of CD16 represents a possible means to moderate natural killer cell responses and to maintain immune homeostasis in both T cell- and antibody-dependent signaling pathways Fc RIIIA allelic variant tha t enhances IgG1 affinity and natural killer cell activation is among one of the best- studied human FcR polymorphisms [ 189]. B cells play a central pathogenic role in autoimmune systemic lupus ery- thematosus, and the monoclonal antibody -based thera- peutic agent rituximab depletes B cells in patients, with its efficacy highly dependent on the Fc RIIIA genotype [ 189]. Immune complex interactions with Fc RIII may lead to persistent pain following sciatic nerve injury through a mechanism involving gangliosides, molecules with a glycosphingolipid, sialic acid, and saccharide component. against axonal cell surface gangliosides GD1a and GT1b have been studied from patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an auto- immune neurological disease [ 190] that is commonly associated with significant pain [ 191]. These same auto- antibodies interacted with gangliosides on injured axons in mice with a sciatic nerve crush injury [ 190]. The resulting immune complexes also activated Fc RIIIs on glial cells and monocyte-derived macrophages at an inhibition of axon regeneration [190]. Immune complex-Fc Rb i n d i n go nm a c r o p h a g e si s known to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,and may thereby contribute to h yper-excitability (reviewed in [165]). Furthermore, while it was shown that immune complexes involving autoantibodies against GD1a and GT1b had the highest binding affinity for Fc RI, this recep- tor, unlike Fc RIII, did not appear to play a role in the inhibition of axon regeneration [ 190]. Additional research needs to be carried out to examine whether immune com- plexes formed by these specific autoantibodies also contrib- ute to hyper-excitability via Fc RIII activation in the DRG following impingement of the sciatic nerve. Based on the composition of gangliosides, an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay was developed to glycosphingolipids in pa- tients with sciatica [ 192]. Elevated levels of antibodies against glycosphingolipids occurred in 71% of patients with acute sciatica and 61% of patients with chronic sci- atica upon 4-year follow-up [ 192]. These findings sup- port the possibility that an autoimmune mechanism involving Fc Rs may contribute to chronic pain stem- ming from an injury to the periphery, with potential underlying sex differences in pain resolution. Autoantibodies: the example of complex regional pain syndrome While separate conditions, persistent lower-limb pain stemming from post-surgical sciatica (pain that develops, for example, from low back surgery) and lower limb- associated complex regional pain syndrome share certain mechanisms, including inflammation, dysregulated neu- roimmune cross-talk, and central neuroplasticity [ 193]. Most patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome, a post-traumatic neuralgia that generally af- fects a single limb without evident tissue damage [ 194, 195], undergo spontaneous recovery. However, up to 20% develop severe persistent pain that may last a life- time [ 196,197]. Its severity is independent of the initiat- ing trauma, which in many cases takes the form of seemingly inconsequential insults [ 198,199]. Studies have demonstrated that administration of IgG, derived from patients with complex regional pain syndrome that continued longer than a year, to healthy mice reduced their spontaneous rearing behavior [ 200]. IgG transfer coupled with an experimental insult in the form of a paw incision resulted in transient post-surgical swelling and mechanical hypersensitivity in the affected limb [201]. Other immunoglobulins were inactive, based on the finding that the transfer of IgG-depleted serum did not produce any effects [ 202]. In a recent study, Cuhadar et al. identified peripheral nociceptor sensitization as a major mechanism by which autoantibodies may produce pain in complex regional pain syndrome [ 203]. Female mice were subjected to a minor experimental insult, concomitant with the admin- istration of patient-derived IgG, resulting in persistingLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 11 of 29mechanical and thermal sensory changes. Furthermore, the degree of transferred hyperalgesia was correlated with the dose of IgG and donor patient pain scores, as reduced IgG-mediated nociceptive responses were re- corded in animals receiving IgG transferred from patients reporting only moderate levels of pain [ 203]. Importantly, in ex vivo cutaneous nerve preparations, the spontaneous and evoked action potential discharge rates were in- creased, demonstrating that patient IgG autoantibodies generated nociceptor hyper-excitability [ 203]. Of note, complex regional pain syndrome has recently been shown to involve both the expansion and activation of distinct subsets of memory T cells [ 204,205]. Further- more, the profile of tissue-resident cutaneous T cells in the limb affected by complex regional pain syndrome is also altered compared with non-affected areas in a man- ner suggestive of a Th2 cell bias [ 206]. Elevated circulat- ing levels of the soluble IL-2 receptor have been detected in patients relative to healthy controls, suggest- ing that a T cell-mediated inflammatory process could be a key component [ 207]. The triggering of neoantigen production provides a possible link between the initial trauma and the resulting autoantibody-mediated patho- logical outcome. A compromised vascular-neural barrier around the affected area could lead to plasma extravasa- tion [ 208], allowing IgG to gain access to the damaged site to interact with these antigens. Immune therapies, such as B cell ablation or plasmapheresis, may represent a means to reduce autoantibody titer, which could po- tentially also be applied to patients with persistent sciatic nerve pain. The sex chromosomes Sex chromosome-associated genes exhibit disparate ex- pression profiles that arise independent of an individual 's hormonal status and therefore represent a significant driver underlying the differences between males and females under normal and pathological conditions of the nervous and immune systems (recently reviewed in [ 209-213]). This is particularly relevant, given that sex-specific actions of X and Y genes in nociception and analgesia have been shown to occur by the day of birth in mice [ 214]. To examine the importance of sex chromosomes, the \"four core genotypes \"mouse model has been developed to study the contribution of sex chromosome complement to various physiological networks, independent of gonadal sex [ 215]. Studies based on this model have demonstrated XX versus XY differences in behavior, disease susceptibil- ity, and gene expression that are not mediated by gonadal hormones, which may instead be associated with the dose of X chromosome genes or parental epigenetic imprinting events. Further identification and characterization of genes on the sex chromosomes remains an active area in thefield of pain research and could contribute to improved sex-specific therapies. The X chromosome The X chromosome represents approximately 2.5% of the total DNA within each male mammalian cell, with this dosage doubled in females. During the early stages of female embryogenesis, one of the two X chromo- somes randomly undergoes permanent somatic cell X- inactivation to ensure that females resemble males in maintaining only one functional copy of this chromo- some per somatic cell. Silencing of the X chromosome occurs via two main mechanisms: epigenetic changes that include chromatin modification [ 216] and the coat- ing of one X chromosome by the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a long non-coding RNA [ 217-219]. The latter requires the Ying Yang 1 (YY1) protein, which activates XIST [ 220] and secures it to the X chromo- some [ 221]. Of note, 10 to 15% of genes that localize to the X chromosome escape X inactivation, resulting in their bi-allelic expression and skewed transcript levels in females [ 222]. Escape from X inactivation occurs mainly to genes within the pseudoautosomal region at the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome, representing non- recombining sequences. Many of these genes have been associated with a pathological state, including major psychiatric disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus, Rett syndrome, and thyroid autoimmunity [ 223-225]. It should be noted that, in addition to genes located on the X chromosome, there may also be somatic genes associ- ated with nociceptive sensitivity that may be differen- tially expressed due to altered expression of regulatory factors that are X-linked, as reported in autism spectrum disorders (reviewed in [ 226]). Numerous sexually dimorphic differences in disease susceptibility may potentially be attributed to changes in the expression of genes associated with an escape from X inactivation. In support of this notion, sex chromo- some abnormalities contribute to brain disorders [ 227], and X chromosome inactivation is associated with neural development, function, and disease [ 228]. Murine YY1 plays a role in inflammatory pain and morphine anal- gesia, as assessed using a Cre/lox strategy to ablate its expression in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons [ 229]. In addition, human YY1 may be relevant to pain, as a microarray gene-expression profile of synovial mem- brane samples revealed that this gene was crucial in the regulatory network of rheumatoid arthritis [ 230]. Inter- estingly, the expression of YY1 appears to be important for proper XIST localization [ 231], which may be re- quired for silencing of the X chromosome. Wang et al. showed that in women with systemic lupus erythemato- sus,XIST is dispersed in naive lymphocytes, resulting in gene escape from X chromosome inactivation [ 231].Linher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 12 of 29Lower back pain and disc herniation/sciatica are com- mon features of a motor vehicle collision [ 232,233]. Interestingly, the majority of individuals who develop chronic musculoskeletal pain [ 234,235] and/or symp- toms of post-traumatic stress [ 236] following a motor vehicle collision are women, with XIST found to be sig- nificantly dysregulated [ 225]. A recent study by Yu et al. reported that, during the early stages following a colli- sion, 40 genes originating from the X chromosome were differentially expressed in women who later developed chronic musculoskeletal pain and/or signs of post- traumatic stress compared with those who recovered [237]. In contrast, the repertoire of 25 X chromosome genes found to be differentially expressed in men was distinct from the set identified in women. Unlike in men, two well-defined clusters categorized by pathway analysis were enriched for genes known to escape X chromosome inactivation. These clusters were based on upregulated expression of genes associated with the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) pathway required for by mediating the GTP-dependent binding of methionine-charged initiator tRNA to the ribosome. As a heterotrimer, it is comprised of three subunits, alpha (subunit 1, EIF2S1), beta (subunit 2, EIF2S2), and gamma (subunit 3, EIF2S3). EIF2 plays a role in cellular stress responses [ 238-240] and has also been associated with learning and neuroplasticity [ 241-243]. These latter two processes have been implicated in altering the func- tion of the PNS and CNS during pain chronification and its resolution [ 51,244]. Produced by activated CD4+and CD8+T cells, IL-2 mediates immune tolerance by directly affecting T lym- phocytes [ 245]. Its expression and secretion are tightly regulated, with IL-2 functioning as part of positive and negative feedback loops in mounting and dampening immune responses, respectively. In the thymus, IL-2 promotes the differentiation of immature T cells into T regulatory (Treg) cells. The latter suppress T cell popu- lations that are otherwise primed to \"attack \"healthy tis- sue, thereby preventing autoimmunity. cytokines, IL-2 cell differentiation into Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes as well as their expansion, and blocks Th17 differentiation while also being able to expand this latter cell type [ 246]. Furthermore, IL-2 plays a key role in sustained cell- mediated immunity during the development of immuno- logic memory, which depends on the expansion of antigen-selected T cell clones [ 245,247]. Importantly, IL-2 has been linked to the development of persistentpain [ 248,249], identified as a potential pain biomarker in patients with sciatica [ 157], and associated with post- traumatic stress [ 250,251]. SH2D1A, CD40LG, and EIF2S3 The majority of individual genes identified in non- recovering women in the collision study were associated with immune function and neuronal or cognitive activities [252,253]. The transcript most significantly associated with pain and post-traumatic stress was X-linked SH2D1A (SH2 domain -containing protein 1A), which plays a role in stimulating T and B lymphocytes [ 254,255] and medi- ating cytokine production [ 256].CD40LG , another key X- linked transcript, is expressed on the surface of T cells and serves to regulate B cell function. In T cells of women with systemic lupus erythematosus, CD40LG has been shown to be demethylated on the inactive X chromosome [257], and its allelic variants are associated rheuma- toid arthritis [ 258]. In addition, EIF2S3 mRNA levels were also associated with pain and post-traumatic stress [ 237]. EIF2S3 plays a direct role in synaptic plasticity and cogni- tive impairment [ 259,260], as in EIF2-controlled thermal nociceptive responses [ 261]. KDM6A/UTX In addition to XIST , epigenetic gene modifications also play a key role in X chromosome inactivation. A recent study examining the mRNA profile of CD4+T cells found specific demethylase subfamily, was expressed at a higher level in women than in men [ 262]. The authors postulated that sexually dimorphic expression of KDM6A in immune cells could provide insights into why more women than men generally develop autoimmune diseases. Upon knockout of Kdm6a in a classic mouse model of multiple sclerosis (CD4+Tc e l l -mediated experimental auto- immune encephalomyelitis), reduced inflammation and a reduction of spinal cord damage to neuronal axons were observed compared with wild-type counterparts transcriptome analysis in CD4+T lymphocytes iso- lated from these knockout mice revealed that specific pathways associated with Th1 and Th2 cell activation were upregulated [ 262], and it was therefore suggested that modulating the activity Kdm6a in T lymphocytes could be a potential targeted therapeutic approach to treat multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases in which these cells play a role. Interestingly, metformin was recently shown to alter the activity of KDM6A/UTX [ 263]. Structural studies revealed that metformin could potentially occupy the catalytic pocket of this particular target via the same residues that are involved in H3K27me3 binding and demethylation [ 263]. Indeed, oral administration ofLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 13 of 29pharmacological doses of metformin significantly in- creased global levels of H3K27me3 in murine liver and tumor tissues [ 263]. This study also showed that oral metformin, in combination with standard therapy, re- sulted in an increase in the level of circulating H3K27me3 in non-diabetic breast cancer patients [ 263]. Interestingly, metformin may have relevance in treating persistent pain. In male rats that underwent a complete laminectomy of the T9 vertebra followed by a spinal cord contusion injury, treatment with metformin decreased mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, improved loco- motor activity, and significantly lowered IL-1 and TNF- levels in spinal cord specimens [ 264]. However, while met- formin was recently shown to reverse nociceptive behavior in male mice using the spared nerve injury model, no effects were observed in female counterparts [ 265]. In this latter study, metformin admin istration in males decreased microglial activation in the spinal dorsal horn, and while ro- bust microglial activation occu rred in female injured mice, no parallel treatment-ind uced decrease occurred [ 265]. It will be of interest to examine the exact mechanisms by which metformin elicits its sexually dimorphic analgesic ef- fects, especially with regard to its potential role as an epi- genetic modulator. Should metformin be found to increase the levels of KDM6A/global H3K27me3 levels in females with a nerve injury, the outcome may not be favorable, g i v e nt h el i n kb e t w e e nK D M 6 Aa n da u t o i m m u n i t y . The Y chromosome Unlike genes on the X chromosome, all Y-linked genes are expressed and, apart from duplicated genes, hemizy- gous, except in cases of aneuploidy. An evolutionary reconstruction across mammalian species suggests that preservation of specific portions of the Y chromosome over time did not occur randomly [ 266]. Rather, the gene content of the Y chromosome has become select- ively specialized in order to maintain the ancestral dos- age of homologous XY gene pairs that function as key regulators of transcription, translation, and protein sta- bility in a range of tissues. Seventeen ancestral genes on the human Y chromosome have survived to the present day, with 4 ( HSFY ,RBMY ,SRY, and TSPY ) encoding iso- ( HSFX ,RBMX ,SOX3 , and reproductive development or gametogenesis [266]. In mammals, the SRY gene is the main driver of male development. However, even ubiquitously expressed human ancestral genes exhibit subtle functional differ- ences from their X-linked homologs. In particular, 8 regu- lators of transcriptional activity that are present in ,EIF1AX/Y biochemical sexual dimorphism that directly originates from genetic differences between the Xand Y chromosomes. Relevantly, several of these genes (EIF1A ,UTX ) have been implicated in chronic pain. Therefore, the Y chromosome may play as yet under- appreciated roles in broader sex differences that influence more processes than testis determination and spermato- genesis, impacting normal physiological functions as well as pathology. Research is currently underway to examine whether male-pattern neural development is a direct con- sequence of Y chromosome -related gene expression or an indirect result of Y chromosome -related androgenic hor- mone production [ 267]. It will be of future interest to investigate Y-linked genes in chronic pain conditions, which is currently understudied. One example that may shed light on the link between the Y chromosome and pain is Swyer syndrome, also referred to as 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. Affected individuals have the typical male karyotype of one X and one Y chromosome per cell, but present with female reproductive structures, experien- cing hormonal imbalances at puberty. While the Y chromosome cannot support the process of sexual dif- ferentiation and testes development, its partial function nevertheless lowers estrogen levels [ 268]. Depending on the genetic cause (primarily due to mutations in SRY, DHH (desert hedgehog), MAP3K1 ,o r NR5A1 the co-morbidities of Swyer syndrome is neuropathy. Interestingly, the protein produced from DHH plays a role not only in male sexual development but also in the formation of the perineurium, the protective membrane around each bundle of fibers within a nerve [ 269]. Al- though rare, patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis may present with chronic progressive motor and sensory polyneuropathy [ 270,271]. Sex chromosomes and immune cells An immune response is fundamentally shaped by the X chromosome, which harbors a plethora of genes in- volved in this process (reviewed in [ 252,272]). Reactiva- tion of normally inactive regions of the X chromosome can lead to the breakdown of immune tolerance in females (reviewed in [ 272]). In a recent study, the tran- scriptome of 11 immune cell types (B lymphocytes (both B1A and B2 cell types), CD4+and CD8+T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, granulocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, and Treg cells) was profiled in 92 female and 91 male mice [ 171]. Ex- pectedly, Xist and Eif2s3y were differentially expressed between the sexes in the majority of these cell types. With the exception of higher male expression of auto- somal Rps17 (40S ribosomal protein S17) other autosomal cell type-specific genes differentially expressed between the sexes were limited to macro- phages [ 171]. Twenty six of these were more highly expressed in female macrophages, including genesLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 14 of 29involved in the complement system, particularly Fcgr2b (encoding Fc RIIB; inhibitory) and Fcgr3a (encoding FcRIIIA; activating), which were discussed earlier in this review. Open chromatin in immune cells During transcription, the chromatin in particular gen- omic regions becomes more accessible, allowing the required transcriptional m achinery to assemble within a target gene regulatory region. An analysis of open chromatin regions may therefore be informative with regard to the regulatory status of particular cell types. Gal-Oz et al. analyzed open chromatin regions in murine male and female B cells, CD4+Tc e l l s ,a n d macrophages [ 171]. All female-specific open chroma- tin regions mapped to the X chromosome, including Eif2s3x (in macrophages), Kdm6a (in macrophages and CD4+T cells), and (in macrophages and CD4+T cells), with all three loci already known to escape X inactivation [ 273]. In male macrophages, three autosomal open chromatin regions emerged, Ncam2 (neural cell adhesion molecule 2). The latter belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell ad- hesion molecules that contribute to homophilic trans- interactions [ 274]. In addition, differential open chro- matin regions associated with unique genes were identified in macrophages and CD4+T lymphocytes, the majority being female-specific. The most prominent differentially accessible region was the X-linked locus harboring the functional inter- genic repeating RNA element ( Firre ). This long non- coding RNA escapes, as well as helps maintain, X inacti- vation by anchoring the inactive X chromosome to the nucleolus [ 273]. It also establishes trans-chromosomal associations, recruiting specific loci on different chromo- somes to its own transcription site [ 275]. In human CD4+T cells, Firre is sex-specifically regulated due to greater enhancer activity in females than in males [ 276]. It was also recently shown that Firre may be regulated by NF- B signaling and that it controls the expression of several macrophage-associated pro-inflammatory genes through post-transcriptional mechanisms [ 277]. Based on studies focused on identifying key sexual di- morphisms in the transcriptome of specific immune cell populations, evidence continues to emerge that supports an enhanced female potential to withstand immune challenge compared to males. This appears to stem from highly activated immune pathways that are primed even prior to pathogen exposure or in response to an injury, imparting heightened \"immune alertness. \"This priming would provide an advantage in combatting infectiousdiseases, but may come with the price of increased sus- ceptibility to autoimmune conditions, which is evidence- based. But why would females have a hyper-alert im- mune system, if it may also contribute to pathologies such as persistent pain in response to certain types of nerve injury? The hyper-alert female immune system: recent hypotheses The pregnancy compensation hypothesis One recently suggested hypothesis is that the female immune system has, for millions of years, been continu- ously prepared for the presence of a placenta, even in its absence. A recent opinion piece proposed that the requirement for females to compensate for unique im- mune system activity accompanying pregnancy was ancestrally guided [ 278]. Heritable variations in sex chromosome gene content and dosage have shaped the specialized immune function of pregnant females to en- sure survival in the presence of an immunologically chal- lenging placenta, with sex hormones directly impacting this process. This line of thinking may help to more broadly explain sex differences in immune function and the implications for associated pathologies, including pain. The main premise of the pregnancy compensation hy- pothesis is that all placental mammals, including women, evolved to support high parity across a lifespan [ 278]. In keeping with this notion, women in hunter-gatherer populations commonly bore up to 12 children. Although there are risks associated with pregnancy, female physi- ology has evolved accordingly via key immune system adaptations. Natri et al. propose that this evolutionary process was necessary to counter the influence of the placenta, which signals the maternal immune system to alter its normal activity, thereby ensuring that the devel- oping fetus is not rejected as \"foreign \"[278]. The pla- centa itself has the potential to be detected as a foreign organ, given that one of its two components, the chorion frondosum, develops from the blastocyst. The placenta and fetus are therefore treated as sites of immune privil- ege, with both engaging mechanisms that result in ma- ternal tolerance. One such mechanism is placental secretion of phosphocholinated neurokinin B [ 279], which has been speculated to provide a \"cloaking \"sys- tem to the placenta, given that phosphocholines are also used by parasitic nematodes to evade host detection (reviewed in [ 280]). In addition, fetal small lymphocytic suppressor cells are able to inhibit maternal cytotoxic T lymphocytes by blocking their response to IL-2 [ 281]. However, dampening specific immune responses could have adverse effects, rendering women sensitive to path- ogens with a potential negative impact on the developing fetus. As a compensatory mechanism, a woman 'sLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 15 of 29immune system is primed throughout adulthood to con- stantly scan for pathogens, even during immune quies- cence associated with pregnancy [ 278]. When continuous parity no longer occurs, which is currently the case in many Western countries, the placental \"pushback, \"which a woman 's immune system has evolved to anticipate, is absent. In this case, the female immune system is over-primed without purpose, and consequently, aberrant responses occur, which may be why the development of autoimmune diseases is on the rise in females. VGLL3 The pregnancy compensation hypothesis is not the first to explain why the incidence of autoimmunity is, in general, higher in women than in men. As an example, it has re- cently been found that women express higher epidermal levels of a putative transcriptional co-factor, vestigial like family member 3 (VGLL3), independent of biological age and gonadal hormone status [ 282]. VGLL3 exhibits female-specific nuclear localization, suggesting that it plays a key role in sexually dimorphic transcriptional regu- lation of its target genes. Its knockdown in vitro results in decreased expression of select female-biased immune transcripts, including B cell -activating factor ( BAFF ;a l s o known as B lymphocyte stimulator and TNFSF13B), the target of belimumab, the only biologic currently used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus [ 283]. In contrast, men who suffer from this autoimmune condition demon- strate upregulated expression and nuclear localization of epidermis [ 282]. Furthermore, skin-directed over-expression of Vgll3 in female rodents causes systemic autoimmunity that affects other organs, with symptoms resembling those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [ 284]. B cell expansion, autoantibody production, and immune complex depos- i t i o nt h a tu l t i m a t e l yc o n t r i b u t et ot i s s u ed a m a g ew e r ea l l found to be engaged. Upregulated BAFF and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13, also known as B lymphocyte chemoattractant) occurred as a consequence of over-expressed Vgll3 in females, further implicating it as a driver of sex-specific autoimmunity [ 284]. The under- lying driver of female skin cells expressing higher levels of VGLL3 is unknown, although Bili et al. speculate that, over the course of evolution, females have developed stronger immune systems at the cost of increased risk for autoimmune disease, which is along the lines of what Natri et al. propose with the pregnancy compensation hy- pothesis. It will be of considerable interest to examine VGLL3 and its immune target genes in the context of chronic pain. Interestingly, according to a research survey developed on behalf of the American Migraine Prevalence Prevention Advisory Group, among patients suffering from migraine-associated pain, cutaneous allodynia ismore common in women, those with a higher body mass index, and those who are disabled or depressed [ 285], and tactile allodynia is a common symptom in patients coping with sciatica [ 286]. Sex hormones While chromosomes may shape male and female re- sponses to pain, gonadal hormones have long been under investigation for their contribution to nociceptive signaling [ 287]. The general current consensus is that testosterone provides anti-nociceptive effects, clinically and in animal models of pain, with estrogen able to act both in an analgesic and hyperalgesic manner [ 288-290]. In mice, the sex chromosome complement, together with gonadal sex, influence the development of nociceptive signaling pathways as well as responses to analgesic drugs [ 214]. With regard to cross-talk between neurons and the immune system, the complex and seemingly paradoxical effects of estrogens have been extensively reviewed else- where [ 4,291]. In the context of the variable effects elicited by 17 -estradiol and its metabol ites on immune responses and repair systems, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis, the sensory nervous system, and the sympa- thetic nervous system, the consensus that has emerged is that the stimulus, cell type, target organ, microenviron- ment, reproductive status, co ncentration, receptor expres- sion, and intracellular metabolism may all affect mediated and pro-inflammatory functions (reviewed in [292]). Estrogens play immunosupportive roles in trauma/sepsis, also accelerating the course of autoimmune diseases [ 293], and estradiol enhances specific T cell activity in female mice [ 294]. This is also the case in women, as post-menopausal estrogen deficiency has been linked with changes in T cell activation profiles [ 295]. Compared with estrogens, less is known regarding the effects of androgens on neuroimmune modulation. In male mice, the immunosuppressive actions of testoster- one may be dampening the recruitment and activation of specific populations of T lymphocytes [ 294]. Clinical evidence supports that testosterone may protect against autoimmune disease [ 293,296]. In men, androgen defi- ciency stemming from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Klinefelter 's syndrome (XXY) is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disease. For example, in patients with Klinefelter 's, an 18-fold increase in the incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported, with clinical remission occurring in response to androgen therapy [ 297]. Testosterone deficiency also increases autoimmune disease-modeled activity in orchi- dectomized mice [ 298,299], and androgen therapy im- proves male survival in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus [ 300]. It is now generally accepted thatLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 16 of 29testosterone is immunosuppressive, with this effect influ- encing sex differences in pain (reviewed in [ 156]). Sex hormones and opioid analgesia Opioids including morphine are generally effective analgesics that are clinically applied to manage acute moderate to severe pain arising from injury, surgery, or cancer. However, tolerance associated with dose escal- ation and adverse effects (constipation, dependence, nausea, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, respiratory depres- sion, and vomiting) are significant limiting factors in their use [ 301,302]. As the \"gold standard \"opioid, morphine provides analgesia primarily activation -OR), al- act peripherally on primary afferents [ 308,309]. In preclinical studies, peripheral opioid receptors appear to potentiate anti-nociception, particularly in the context of inflammatory and neuropathic pain [ 303,310-314], and it has been suggested that these peripherally expressed receptors may induce less adverse side effects than modulating their central counterparts [ 308]. However, under inflammatory conditions, spinal and supraspinal opioid receptors are the main modulators of anti- nociceptive responses [ 315-317], and the significance of peripheral opioid analgesia remains under debate. Paradoxically, opioids such as morphine also exacer- bate nociceptive hypersensitivity for weeks to months after treatment cessation in models of inflammatory and post-operative pain [ 318-323], as well as peripheral and centrally induced neuropathic pain [ 320,321,324-328]. It has been shown that morphine intensifies allodynia in a manner dependent on inflammatory signaling in the spinal cord, given that inhibiting either microglial activ- ity or the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines during opioid administration prevents this effect [ 324-327]. Doyle et al. showed that within the periaqueductal gray of the rat, microglial activity provided a potential mech- anism underlying the sexually dimorphic effects of mor- phine [ 329]. Interestingly, a recent study in male rats has shown that morphine, either administered pre-surgically or for 7 consecutive days commencing immediately after laparotomy, significantly prolonged post-surgical noci- ceptive responses [ 319]. A large body of literature covers sex hormone -regulated differences in opioid receptor -mediated anti-nociception. -OR is required the kappa-opioid receptor ( -OR) plays a predomin- ant role [ 330-332].-OR-mediated anti- nociception involves heterodimerization with endogenous opioid dynorphin, with estrogen of these heterodimers [333]. Spinal expression of -OR varies across the estrouscycle, with its lowest receptor density correlating with low estrogen levels [ 334] and increased nociception [ 335]. In- deed, it has been clinically shown that women require higher concentrations of morphine than men to produce similar post-surgical analgesia [ 336,337]. Opioid receptors are expressed on immune cells, includ- ing B and T lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and monocytes [ 338], and endogenously modulate T cell proliferation and cytokine production [339]. In the context of nerve injury and inflammation, peripheral T lymphocytes have the capacity to release anti-nociceptive endogenous opioids, reducing inflamma- tory and neuropathic pain [ 309]. The specific population thought to be involved is CD4+T lymphocytes [ 340]. Morphine can bind to localizes primarily to microglia [ 151]. Its microglial interaction reduces the analgesic efficacy of morphine [ 342], par- ticularly in females [ 329]. Morphine also binds to T cells [343], and Rosen et al. further investigated the modula- tion of exogenous opioid analgesia by these particular cells in males and females [ 344]. Based on a T cell -defi- cient acute inflammatory pain model, this study showed that sexual dimorphic opioid analgesia was lost in nude animals, but was restored upon injection of CD4+T lymphocytes from immunocompetent donors [ 344]. In addition to displaying significantly higher baseline noci- ceptive sensitivity in the absence of nerve injury, various strains of T cell -deficient mice exhibited reduced morphine-mediated inhibition of inflammatory and ther- mal nociception. This work suggests that T cells may drive sex differences in anti-nociceptive opioid-mediated analgesia [ 344]. In particular, the T cell population rele- vant to this latter effect appears to be CD4+lympho- cytes, as their adoptive transfer into nude mice rescued baseline nociception as well as morphine analgesia, which did not occur upon transfer of CD8+T cells. Sex hormones and microglia A recent review summarizes the effect of sex hormones on microglia in the context of brain injuries, which provides relevant insights into the roles of estrogen and testosterone in the regulation of these cells in health and disease [ 345]. Microglia express estrogen receptor (ER) and ER [346,347], with estrogen significantly inhibiting their LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, also blocking the proliferation and activation of these cells in culture [ 347,348]. The estrogenic modulation of microglial function has recently been reviewed [ 349]. In a model of Parkinson 's disease, in which microglial activ- ity plays a prominent role, it has been shown that, while both the loss of murine dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and LPS-induced microglial activation increased with age in both sexes, these effects were moreLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 17 of 29pronounced in males [ 350]. In support of the notion that ovarian hormones such as estrogen play a role in these responses, bilateral ovariectomy abrogated the protective effect imparted against age- and LPS-induced microglial activation, with 17 -estradiol treatment of ovariecto- mized female mice reversing this effect [ 350]. In addition, pretreating cultured murine microglial cells with 17 -estradiol prior to LPS stimulation inhibited the expected increases in TLR4 and TNF- levels. The effect of 17 -estradiol on the inward-rectifying K+channel Kir2.1 was also examined in vitro, demonstrating a re- duced probability of the channel being in an open state [350]. Kir2.1 is constitutively expressed in microglia and macrophages, serving as a means to maintain a negative membrane potential to regulate calcium influx and sub- sequent activation-associated microglial signaling [ 351- 353]. Wu et concluded that age- and inflammation- associated activation of microglia is attenuated by ovar- ian estrogen, via its inhibitory action on Kir2.1 [ 350]. With regard to neuropathic pain, a recent study elec- trophysiologically examined the potential role of micro- glial K+channels in a spared nerve injury model [ 354]. A notable increase in the expression of the Kir2.1 ion channel as well as Kir2.1-mediated inward currents asso- ciated with hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential occurred in microglia two days post-injury, which was not observed in naive animals or at later post-injury time points. The electrophysiological changes coincided with the peak of microglial proliferation that takes place following a peripheral nerve injury, suggest- ing that microglial Kir2.1 may be an important thera- peutic target with sexually dimorphic treatment outcomes [ 354]. Microglia also respond to androgens. Dampening mechanical allodynia using minocycline or a pharmaco- logical blocker of P2X4 to inhibit the function of spinal microglia is limited to male mice, in which nerve injury has been reported to upregulate spinal P2X4 expression [155]. This sex-specific response was shown to depend on testosterone, as minocycline failed to inhibit allodynia in gonadectomized males while reducing allodynia in fe- males treated with testosterone [ 155]. Neurosteroids Importantly, central and peripheral nerves themselves have the cellular machinery to synthesize and metabolize steroid hormones that are classically associated with the gonads (reviewed in [ 355]). In addition to nerves having the enzymatic capacity to support their production (reviewed in [ 356]), the intracellular androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in the rat sciatic nerve [ 357,358] and steroid receptors for estrogen and progesterone have been detected in the rat sciatic nerve and Schwann cells [359-361]. Through their activation, androgens,estrogens, and progesterone, as well as their derivatives, may influence the development and function of the PNS and CNS, with these same molecules also modulating the activity of neurotransmitter receptors (NMDAR, GABA receptors) and non-classical neurosteroid recep- tors (for example, sigma 1 receptor) (reviewed in [ 356, 362]). In experimental models of peripheral neuropathy, neurosteroids, primarily testosterone and progesterone, largely act in a protective manner [ 363-366], playing a functional role in processes such as peripheral Schwann cell proliferation and myelination (numerous studies de- tailing the latter are reviewed in [ 356]). The concept that neuroactive steroids synthesized in the PNS exert neuro- protective actions has been reviewed in the context of their therapeutic application in treating peripheral neur- opathy stemming from diverse causes, including aging, chemotherapy, diabetes, and physical nerve injury [ 367]. Interestingly, intraperitoneally administered progester- one fully reversed the nociceptive behaviors of male rats in which the peripheral sciatic nerve was impinged, with only partial recovery obtained in females [ 39]. It would be of interest to examine whether this sexually di- morphic response could be related to progesterone- mediated repair of myelin via Schwann cells, particularly given that progesterone is a precursor of testosterone. In a study by Caruso et al., neuroactive steroid levels were measured in the sciatic nerve, various CNS regions (the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord), and in the circulation of male and female intact and short- or long- term gonadectomized rats, resulting in distinc outcomes [368]. Post-gonadectomy, changes in neuroactive steroid levels in the nervous system did not necessarily reflect changes in plasma levels. Long-term gonadectomy led to altered PNS and CNS neuroactive steroids levels which, in certain cases, were distinct from those associated with short-term gonadectomy. Furthermore, the effect of gonadectomy on neuroactive steroid levels differed be- tween the PNS and the CNS, as well as within the various CNS regions. Importantly, the effects of gonadectomy on neuroactive steroid levels in the nervous system were sexually dimorphic [ 368]. Sex hormones and other specific examples: B lymphocytes and BAFF As mentioned earlier in this review, B lymphocytes have been shown to infiltrate the impinged site of the sciatic nerve in an animal model of persistent neuropathic pain (Kim and Moalem-Taylor, 2011a), and B cells may be more prevalent in the DRG of male mice with a partial sciatic nerve ligation injury than in female counterparts [79]. B cells have also been implicated in other painful conditions. For example, in a study of classic interstitial cystitis, higher levels of B cell infiltration and clonal B cell expansion, which occurs in response to specificLinher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 18 of 29antigen exposure, were found to occur in patient-derived tissues [ 369]. B cells are also involved in TLR signaling, with TLR-mediated signals playing a role in both the re- moval and the activation of autoreactive B cells [ 370]. In addition, B cells have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization in a murine model of complex regional pain syndrome [ 371], and their role in chronic inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis is well known [ 372]. A recent review has suggested that B cells contribute to the autoimmune development and progression of mul- tiple sclerosis by regulating T cell production and the antigen-presenting complex [ 373]. However, compared with other immune cell types, B cells remain a relatively understudied population in the context of persistent per- ipherally induced pain. Testosterone and BAFF In men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Klin- felter 's syndrome, higher than normal circulating B cell counts are lowered in response to exogenous testoster- one administration [ 374,375]. Relevantly, in the bone marrow, testosterone suppresses B lymphopoiesis [ 376], and knockout of the murine AR in males increases the number of hematopoietic B cell precursors [ 377]. Fur- thermore, in men, testosterone and the AR suppress splenic B cell numbers [ 376] via an independent mech- anism, potentially through the downregulation of BAFF [378]. This notion is supported by murine splenic BAFF deficiency resulting in a lack of mature B cells [ 379]. In addition, BAFF may play a role in autoimmune activity, with high levels promoting the survival of autoreactive B cells along with autoantibody production [ 380]. In healthy individuals, serum BAFF levels are higher in men presenting with lower-than-normal levels of testos- terone, and a recent study has shown that testosterone directly regulates BAFF, as male mice lacking the AR have increased splenic Baff levels and B cell numbers, as well as higher circulating levels of this factor [ 381]. It will therefore be of considerable interest to examine the role of androgens and BAFF in the context of a per- ipheral nerve injury and nociceptive signaling. Interest- ingly, BAFF and its receptor (BAFFR) are also expressed in murine neurons, and a deficiency in BAFFR negatively affects neuronal survival [ 382]. Furthermore, impaired BAFFR-mediated signaling resulted in accelerated dis- ease progression in an animal model of amyotrophic lat- eral sclerosis, a painful inherited condition characterized by gradual motor neuron degeneration. While the sex of the animals was not specified, neither knockdown of BAFFR in bone marrow nor genetic depletion of B cells affected this outcome, suggesting that BAFF-mediated signaling was occurring at the neuronal level [ 382].Estradiol and BAFF Estradiol suppresses lymphopoiesis [ 377, 383], and serum BAFF levels are higher in female compared with male mice [ 381]. Unlike the suppressive effect of testosterone, estradiol has been shown to up- regulate BAFF at the mRNA level, as well as increasing the number of mature splenic B cells [ 383]. Similar to testosterone, estradiol acts on autonomic neuroeffector mechanisms, but it has been suggested that its effect re- duces peripheral sympathetic nerve activity [ 384]. There- fore, the differential regulation of BAFF elicited by estradiol and testosterone, potentially driven by neural mechanisms that could involve neurosteroids, may con- tribute to sex difference in disease states in which this cytokine plays a pathogenic role. Sex hormones and other specific examples: TRPV1 TRP channels detect physical and chemical stimuli and promote painful sensations via nociceptor activation [385]. TRPV1 is activated by a range of stimuli (reviewed in [386]). It may act as a nociceptive mechanoreceptor [387] and has also been shown to be expressed along the entire length of C fiber neurons [ 388]. In mice, injecting the TRPV1 antagonist SB366791 at the site of a chronic sciatic nerve constriction injury or into the injured inner- vated hind paw dose-dependently alleviated mechanical and thermal sensitivity [ 389]. Intraperitoneal administration of this agent also potentiated the analgesic effects of sys- temic morphine in a murine model of bone cancer pain [390]. TRPV1 also plays a functional role in non-neuronal cell types, and a recent review has detailed its role in in- flammation, immunity, and cancer [ 391]. It is expressed on CD4+T lymphocytes [ 174] and microglia [ 392], con- trolling the cortical activation of the latter cell type [393]. TRPV1 has been associated with T cell antigen re- ceptor -induced calcium influx and signaling as well as non-canonical (MHC-independent) T cell activation in a mouse colitis model, in which it promotes T cell re- sponses to increase intestinal inflammation [ 174]. Treat- ment of activated CD4+T cells with DPV576 (an aqueous mixture of nanodiamond and nanoplatinum) resulted in specifically decreased expression of TRPV1 [394]. Ghoneum et al. showed that this downregulation was accompanied by decreased IFN- secretion in capsaicin-activated CD4+T cells [ 394]. T cells with macrophages and neutrophils, with these innate im- mune cells releasing cytokines that in turn modulate TRPV1 and TRPA1 [ 395,396]. The expression profile of this ion channel therefore provides a possible link be- tween nociceptors, microglia, and non-canonical TRP channel-mediated T cell activation.Linher-Melville et al. Biology of Sex Differences (2020) 11:62 Page 19 of 29Testosterone and TRPV1 It was recently shown that testosterone has a negative effect on Trpv1 expression in a rat model of inflam- matory pain associated with orofacial myositis [ 175]. Both its mRNA and protein levels were significantly upregulated in the trigeminal ganglia of castrated males three days after inducing inflammatory pain, as m o d e l e db yi n j e c t i n gc o m p l e t eF r e u n d ' sa d j u v a n ti n t o the masseter muscle, with no effect on Trpv1 expres- sion in orchidectomized counterparts receiving testos- terone replacement 175]. Whereas 17 -estradiol increases currents evoked by capsaicin in DRG neurons, promoting capsaicin-induced nociception [ 397], these effects are decreased by testos- terone [ 398]. Testosterone has been shown to modulate the expression of neurotransmitter membrane receptors such as the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), with CB1-positive [ 399] and [ 175] rat neurons also co-expressing the AR [ 400]. Testosterone appears to play a key role in inhibiting TRPV1 expression in a rat chronic inflammatory pain model, providing a potential mechanistic basis for cytokine-hormone-neuron interactions [ 175]. Estradiol and TRPV1 Clinically, it has been reported that women respond to capsaicin-evoked pain more intensely than men [ 401]. Estrogen directly increases nociceptor excitability, re- duces action potential thresholds, and facilitates TRPV1 activation in primary sensory neurons [ 402]. Further- more, in ER and ER knockout mice, the number of TRPV1 receptors is significantly lower than in wild-type counterparts [ 403]. Indeed, in female rats, estrogens upregulate Trpv1 expression and exacerbate nociceptive responses in temporomandibular joints [ 177], trigeminal primary neurons [ 178], and the endometrium [ 176]. While there is evidence for increased TRPV1 channel activation in response to estrogen administration, the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear. Mechan- ical hyperalgesia induced by TRPV1 activation is be- lieved to be mediated by G protein -coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1), which is regulated by the overall level of estrogen. Estrogen-mediated GPER1 activation results in a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP and cal- cium levels in sensory neurons [ 291], with elevated intracellular calcium stimulating protein kinase C to evoke pain sensitization by phosphorylating TRPV1 within its C-terminus [ 404]. Conclusions The biological origins of sex differences that affect the outcome of pain are complex. Truly \"moving the dial \"in chronic pain research, which, from a patient perspective, will require fundamentally improving therapeuticinterventions to represent precision medicine for men and women, will require additional focused research. One approach is through direct manipulation of gonadal hormones in relevant animal models of both sexes, at different life stages. Such an undertaking will determine how hormonal influences interact to modulate not only inflammation, but sustained neuroimmune cross-talk, providing a better fundamental understanding of hormo- nal roles in the development, maturation, and dysregula- tion of nociceptive circuits. Gonadal steroids elicit distinct effects on pain responses and analgesic efficacy in adults, and perinatal dimor- phisms in testosterone levels produce enduring organizational differences in males and females. Research supports that immune-triggered conditions exhibit a sex bias in children prior to the onset of puberty [ 405,406], reinforcing that an exploration of sexually dimorphic facets that reach beyond gonadal hormones to include genetic and epigenetic processes will be required to fully understand pain chronification and to optimally treat per- sistent pain in men and women. Genes mapping to the X and Y chromosomes are emerging as important players, with the neuroendocrine system modulating neuroim- mune crosstalk stemming from the sex chromosome com- plement. Sexually dimorphic mechanisms associated with increased expression of particular transcripts in patients who develop persistent pain in response to nervous system trauma are currently not well understood. Further re- search focused on the role of transcripts that escape X chromosome inactivation is needed to examine the conse- quence of low XIST levels, which could allow certain X chromosome-associated genes to escape inactivation in conditions involving persistent pain, including unresolved sciatica. Perspective and significance There are clear similarities between chronic pain and autoimmune conditions. Given that the incidence of both pathological states is generally higher in women, it is worth considering that persistent nociceptive hyper- sensitivity itself may be the consequence of significant sexually dimorphic perturbations that are rooted in im- mune tolerance. Novel insights will only be gained by considering how these homeostatic perturbations as a whole lead to pain chronification, which may involve very different evolutionarily conserved biological pro- cesses in males and females. Examining chronic pain as an\"autoimmune disease, \"particularly in women, may broaden the scope for novel chronic pain therapeutics.
