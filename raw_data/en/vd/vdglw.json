Pictured third from left in top row is Jo-Annie Tran. Third from left in bottom row is Ryan Wang. Students from the LA department were part of the team that helped construct the 2015 Rose Float, \"Soaring Stories,\" which was the Cal Poly universities' entry in this year's Tournament of Roses Parade. The float won the Lathrop K. Leishman Trophy for the most beautiful non-commercial float. \"Soaring Stories\" depicts a fairytale castle and mythological griffin springing to life from the pages of storybooks, reflecting the parade theme, \"Inspiring Stories.\" Fifth year LA major Young Choi served as the float's production manager. He also designed, constructed and planted the float's green wall. Jo-Annie Tran (third year) and Ryan Wang (second year) were on the design committee, with Jo-Annie serving as assistant design chair. She will take over as chair of the design committee for next year's float. \"I never thought I could be part of designing a float, and then making a float by welding pounds of steel and carving blocks of foam,\" said Tran. \"It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\" Posted 11-5-14 DesignIntelligence: Cal Poly LA Program 4th in Nation / Best in West DesignIntelligence has ranked Cal Poly's LA program fourth among the top 15 undergraduate programs in the nation, based on a nationwide survey of hiring firms.

Posted 10-27-14 New Grad Receives Award of Honor from So. Cal Chapter of ASLA; Three Other Alums Receive Awards of Merit Enrique Guzman, class of 2014, received an Award of Honor from the Southern California Chapter of ASLA for his entry in the chapter's 2014 Quality of Life Design Competition. Guzman's advisor for his winning project was Associate Professor David J. Watts. The theme for this year's competition was \"Landscape Architecture, A Story of Generations.\" The intent of this biennial awards program is to celebrate professional excellence by recognizing the firms, individuals, and agencies responsible for outstanding works of landscape architecture and environmental planning that promote an enhanced quality of life in Southern California and beyond. Projects were judged by a panel of jurors using criteria including quality of design; functionalism; relationship to context; overall relevance to the profession, the public, and the environment; promotion of the enhancement of quality of life; and environmental responsibility. Guzman's project took on the complex issue of school safety and the development of safer landscapes. His inspiration was his alma mater, Santiago High School, in Garden Grove, CA. Built in the 1960's, the school was in need of retrofitting to reduce its vulnerability to external threats. Like many other schools constructed in that era, Santiago High's widespread campus buildings inhibit natural surveillance and create unsecured areas where external threats can enter. Guzman's proposed spatial arrangement at the front of Santiago High School provides layers of defensible space, including thorn-bearing plant palettes, unobstructed viewsheds to the periphery, bollardized seat walls and fire retardant plant materials to increase security. Guzman received his award during the chapter's Awards Gala and Presentation on October 23, 2014 at the Ebell Club in Long Beach, CA. Alums Jeff Ferber (1985), Brian Hannegan (1990), and Mike Sherrod (1994) received Awards of Merit for their competition entries.

Posted 11-8-12 Student Designs for Centennial Park Featured in COSAM E-Newsletter During Summer 2012, third year landscape architecture students in Prof. Omar Faruque's Design Theory and Exploration Focus Studio provided the College of Science and Math (COSAM) with design solutions for Centennial Park. When the new Warren J. Baker Center for Science and Mathematics is completed next year, Centennial Park will be one of Cal Poly's central open spaces. The students' efforts were the subject of a recent article in COSAM's E-Newsletter. The article describes some of the steps the class used in their design process. First they toured the building and grounds, then met with their client, COSAM Dean Phil Bailey, to get a sense of his vision for the space. They also met with project manager Barbara Queen, who is coordinating the construction of the center for Cal Poly, and Scott Loosley, assistant director for operations, who oversees the grounds of campus. Students then worked in teams to develop a plan addressing the client's needs. The plan incorporated input from the client, students, faculty and staff, and provided the framework for design solutions integrating the landscape and the building. Dean Bailey met with the students several times throughout the summer and, according to the article, was impressed with the creativity and continuous improvement in the level of detail and sophistication of their designs. At the end of the summer, the students presented their solutions to Bailey and staff members from Facilities Services who will participate in choosing the ultimate design for the space. President Armstrong and faculty and staff members from COSAM also attended the presentations. Although the final design will likely be done by a professional firm, Faruque is hopeful his students' ideas will be used by the firm and incorporated into the final product.

Updated: 5-23-11 LA Faculty/MCRP Student Team Up to Win International Competition A team formed by Asst. Professor [C\u00e9sar Torres-Bustamante](/content/people/torres), Lecturer Louise Schiller, and CRP graduate student Schani Siong won first place in the international competition \"Design for Post-Earthquake Resilience of Cities.\" Their proposal, \"City Map,\" used Acapulco, Mexico as the site to test a low-budget, easily implemented strategy that focused on assigning new uses to existing transport infrastructure after an earthquake hits. The city transforms into a \"map of itself\", using streets as a canvas to connect nodes through painted paths, similar to the lines on hospital floors that guide patients to particular sections in a hospital. These paths indicate evacuation routes and locations of shelters, hospitals, food supplies and more. The project assigns new uses to infrastructure: majors streets will be closed to vehicular traffic and will be used instead as landing strips for aircrafts that bring supplies; two-way streets will reduce to one-way streets to accommodate temporary housing, workshops, markets and schools; street parking will be removed on alternate blocks to provide space to grow food. The competition, organized by the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering, sought proposals to increase the resiliency of cities and communities affected by earthquakes and tsunamis, with a focus on aiding recovery and social regeneration in affected areas. The competition was open to all design disciplines, including architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and associated engineering and sociological disciplines. The first place award came with a cash prize of NZ$2,000.

The Journal is published by the University of California Press on behalf of the Society of Architectural Historians. O'Hara's article is summarized in JSAH as follows: \"During the last weeks of his practice, Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., wrote that the future of his firm depended on developing an appropriate landscape style for the arid West. [O'Hara] tells how his sons' firm, Olmsted Brothers, set out to reach that goal in their unbuilt proposal for the 1915 San Diego Panama-California Exposition, in what is now Balboa Park. [O'Hara's article] is the story of their innovative embrace of regionalist aesthetics and a respect for local ecology, topography, and weather. The ideals of their design, however, were not taken up by their clients. The Olmsted firm was fired, and the fairgrounds that welcomed visitors to San Diego in 1915 had architecture that was more appropriate to large cities and a landscape better suited to a wet climate.\" To read the full article, [click here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jsah.2011.70.1.64).

Professor Beverly Bass presented a paper about her research, Gathering Spaces: Lessons from Traditional Dutch Street Form in the Age of Peak Oil and Global Warming, on January 10, 2011, at the Hawaii International Conference on Arts and Humanities. Asst. Prof. Bass's research examines whether features of older Dutch cities that promote walkability can be transferred to communities in the United States. The viability of using traditional Dutch urban street form as a model for development is analyzed by examining characteristics of streets and street pattern within the historic core of three Dutch cities that were settled prior to the industrial age. Bass's study is expected to result in recommendations that could inform the planning of new and retrofitting of existing communities in the U.S. To read an abstract of Asst.

Posted: 10-19-10 C\u00e9sar Torres-Bustamante - Across the Pond and Down Under Assistant Professor [Dr. Cesar Torres-Bustamante](/content/people/torres) presented the poster \"Figural Regions\" at the Emerging Landscapes Conference (University of Westminster, UK) in June 2010. The project proposed alternative methods for the construction and visualization of poch\u00e8 maps based on the reconceptualization of figure-ground relationships. In this manner, figures are understood as articulated regions or fields with ambiguous edges, useful in highlighting the temporality of events in the landscape rather than an emphasis on static objects. In addition, Dr. Torres-Bustamante was invited to participate in [Peculiar Places](https://peculiarplaces.wordpress.com/), a project organized by landscape architecture firm Taylor Cullity Lethlean (Melbourne, Australia) that questions the use of public space and how it shapes people and their experiences. Dr. Torres-Bustamante decided to focus on the map as a way of recording and interpreting the experiences of spaces, and compared the layout of eight European cities through their corresponding touristic map and Google Map. The intention was to indicate how specific and important details are highlighted or hidden from the visitor, interrogating the usefulness of an institutionalized map (such as Google Map ) in revealing the peculiarity of spaces.

Posted: 9-22-10 4th Year Student's Article Published in Gardener News Donovan Hall, a fourth-year LA student and New Jersey native, wrote the cover story for the September 2010 edition of In his article, Hall writes about a project his LA 405 Project Design and Implementation Focus Studio class tackled during the Spring 2010 term. Guided by the course instructor, Louise Schiller, Hall and his classmates helped to develop a master plan for a proposed future San Luis Obispo Community Farm on a portion of the Dalidio Ranch property. As part of their research for this master plan, Hall's class learned about the Central Coast Ag Network (CCAN) and their Farm to School program. Hall compares CCAN and the Farm to School Program to New Jersey's campaign to include \"Jersey Fresh\" products in school lunches. However, CCAN goes further, encouraging the education of younger students about the importance of agriculture. Hall advocates incorporating gardening classes into K-12 academic curriculums throughout the nation and argues that preserving New Jersey's agriculture and educating residents about the Garden State's numerous farming resources will help repair the state's image. \"Local farmers work tirelessly to produce fresh food,\" he writes, \"and agricultural educations needs to start earlier in our schools.\" Updated: 9-22-10 LADAC Member Rick T.

In her review of the \" [Right to Landscape](http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/Research-Centres/LEaP/Global-Justice--Environmental-Policy/Projects/The-Right-to-Landscape/): Contesting Landscape and Human Rights\" workshop in Cambridge, UK, December 8-10, 2008, Susan Herrington writes \"Dave Watts...described how a small community in South Africa received a new school, but the government considered an outdoor play space an unattainable luxury. As such, 300 children... were denied basic rights to play and develop in the landscape. In response, Watts, with volunteer landscape architects from Wisconsin, designed and built a play space using simple, natural materials. This act not only confirmed children's right to landscape, but also empowered parents and tribal elders to maintain these rights.\" The proposition of this workshop was that \"landscape is a shared resource and all human beings deserve the right to landscape.\" The call for papers, which went out in January 2008, was aimed at landscape scholars and professionals across disciplines and \"attracted an overwhelming response.\" Watts was one of only 30 participants selected to present a case study for workshop discussion.

Thirty LA and CRP students in a Fall 2009 LA/CRP interdisciplinary studio taught by professors Margarita Hill and Kelly Main are assisting with \"Visions for Vermont,\" a project of the Figueroa Corridor Coalition Land Trust. The project's goal is to increase neighborhood representation in creating a plan to guide redevelopment efforts primarily along Vermont Avenue in South Los Angeles but also including other areas that are part of the Figueroa Corridor. The outcome will be a document that outlines community design and planning strategies for consideration by the Los Angeles Department of City Planning in its revision of the South and Southeast L.A. Community Plans. Plans for both areas are in the second year of a three-year revision process. The current community plans have been in place for ten years. Three \"Visions for Vermont\" events have been held so far, the first in mid-September, one in mid-October and the third earlier this month. During this month's event, held November 13, 2009, Cal Poly students in the interdisciplinary studio set up an interactive booth where community members could create their ideal neighborhood. The students offered a variety of paper cutouts, including trees, community centers, and street signs, for visitors to paste onto a blank map of the community. The LA and CRP students will also help with the next steps of the \"Visions for Vermont\" project, which will include putting together design plans that will reflect the needs and concerns of the community.

The students traveled from Sacramento, CA to San Luis Obispo to visit the department and learn more about the Cal Poly BLA program and the landscape architecture profession. Asst. Professor Beverly Bass serves on the Academy's Advisory Committee. After a campus tour, shopping at the El Corral bookstore, and a visit to the Dexter LA studios, the group lunched on pizza and soft drinks in the Dexter Fireplace Room and talked about their program at the Academy and the program at Cal Poly with LA majors Aaron Anderson, Katie Blair, Michael Shadle, and Tyler Rinehart and with faculty members Beverly Bass, Walt Bremer, Gary Clay, Astrid Reeves, and David Watts. The high schoolers were interested in how our students had chosen Landscape Architecture as a major, the projects they had worked on, the possibilities of transferring from community college, and how much it costs to attend Cal Poly. The GEO Academy is one of the California Partnership Academies - a three-year program (grades ten-twelve) structured as a school-within-a-school. The purpose of the program is to provide a specialized curriculum within the core high school curriculum that allows at-risk students to be exposed to career and educational options that are not typically part of the high school experience. According to the [California Department of Education](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/gs/hs/cpagen.asp) web site, Partnership Academies represent a high school reform movement focused on smaller learning communities with a career theme. Components include rigorous academics and technical education, with a career focus, a committed team of teachers, and active business and post-secondary partnerships.
