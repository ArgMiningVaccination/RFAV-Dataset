[Hide Full Content](#four-thousand-two-hundred-thirty-two) [Chiropractic's Dirty Secret: Neck Manipulation and Strokes](https://quackwatch.org/related/chirostroke/) Stroke from chiropractic neck manipulation occurs when an artery to the brain ruptures or becomes blocked by a clot as a result of being stretched. The injury often results from extreme rotation in which the practitioner's hands are placed on the patient's head in order to rotate the cervical spine by rotating the head [1]. The vertebral artery, which is shown in the picture to the right, is vulnerable because it winds around the topmost cervical vertebra (atlas) to enter the skull, so that any abrupt rotation may stretch the artery and tear its delicate lining. The anatomical problem is illustrated on page 7 of The Chiropractic Report, July 1999. A blood clot formed over the injured area may subsequently be dislodged and block a ... Stroke from chiropractic neck manipulation occurs when an artery to the brain ruptures or becomes blocked by a clot as a result of being stretched. The injury often results from extreme rotation in which the practitioner's hands are placed on the patient's head in order to rotate the cervical spine by rotating the head [1]. The vertebral artery, which is shown in the picture to the right, is vulnerable because it winds around the topmost cervical vertebra (atlas) to enter the skull, so that any abrupt rotation may stretch the artery and tear its delicate lining. The anatomical problem is illustrated on page 7 of [The Chiropractic Report, July 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20030308010050/http://www.chiropracticreport.com/samples/july99.pdf). A blood clot formed over the injured area may subsequently be dislodged and block a smaller artery that supplies the brain. Less frequently, the vessel may be blocked by blood that collects in the vessel wall at the site of the dissection [2] Chiropractors would like you to believe that the incidence of stroke following neck manipulation is extremely small. Speculations exist that the risk of a serious complication due to neck manipulation are somewhere between one in 40,000 and one in 10 million manipulations. No one really knows, however, because (a) there has been little systematic study of its frequency; (b) the largest malpractice insurers won't reveal how many cases they know about; and (c) a large majority of cases that medical doctors see are not reported in scientific journals. Published Reports In 1992, researchers at the Stanford Stroke Center asked 486 California members of the American Academy of Neurology how many patients they had seen during the previous two years who had suffered a stroke within 24 hours of neck manipulation by a chiropractor. The survey was sponsored by the American Heart Association. A total of 177 neurologists reported treating 56 such patients, all of whom were between the ages of 21 and 60. One patient had died, and 48 were left with permanent neurologic deficits such as slurred speech, inability to arrange words properly, and vertigo (dizziness). The usual cause of the strokes was thought to be a tear between the inner and outer walls of the vertebral arteries, which caused the arterial walls to balloon and block the flow of blood to the brain. Three of the strokes involved tears of the carotid arteries [3]. In 1991, according to circulation figures from Dynamic Chiropractic, California had about 19% of the chiropractors practicing in the United States, which suggests that about 147 cases of stroke each year were seen by neurologists nationwide. Of course, additional cases could have been seen by other doctors who did not respond to the survey. A 1993 review concluded that potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that children should not undergo neck manipulation [4]. Louis Sportelli, DC, NCMIC president and a former ACA board chairman contends that chiropractic neck manipulation is quite safe. In an 1994 interview reported by the Associated Press, he reacted to the American Heart Association study by saying, \"I yawned at it. It's old news.\" He also said that other studies suggest that chiropractic neck manipulation results in a stroke somewhere between one in a million and one in three million cases [5]. The one-in-a-million figure could be correct if California's chiropractors had been averaging about 60 neck manipulations per week. Later that year, during a televised interview with \"Inside Edition,\" Sportelli said the \"worst-case scenario\" was one in 500,000 but added: \"When you weigh the procedure against any other procedure in the health-care industry, it is probably the lowest risk factor of anything.\" According to the program's narrator, Sportelli said that 90% of his patients receive neck manipulation. In 1996, RAND issued a booklet that tabulated more than 100 published case reports and estimated that the number of strokes, cord compressions, fractures, and large blood clots was 1.46 per million neck manipulations. Even though this number appears small, it is significant because many of the manipulations chiropractors do should not be done. In addition, as the report itself noted, neither the number of manipulations performed nor the number of complications has been systematically studied [6]. Since some people are more susceptible than others, it has also been argued that the incidence should be expressed as rate per patient rather than rate per adjustment. In 1996, the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company (NCMIC), which is the largest American chiropractic malpractice insurer, published a report called \"Vertebrobasilar Stroke Following Manipulation,\" written by Allen G.J. Terrett, an Australian chiropractic educator/researcher. Terrett based his findings on 183 cases of vertebrobasilar strokes (VBS) reported between 1934 and 1994. He concluded that 105 of the manipulations had been administered by a chiropractor, 25 were done by a medical practitioner, 31 had been done by another type of practitioner, and that the practitioner type for the remaining 22 was not specified in the report. He concluded that VBS is \"very rare,\" that current pretesting procedures are seldom able to predict susceptibility, and that in 25 cases serious injury might have been avoided if the practitioner had recognized that symptoms occurring after a manipulation indicated that further manipulations should not be done [7]. A 1999 review of 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997 found 177 cases of neck injury associated with neck manipulation, at least 60% of which was done by chiropractors [8]. In 2001, NCMIC published a second edition of Terrett's book, titled, \"Current Concepts: Vertebrobasilar Complications following Spinal Manipulation,\" which covered 255 cases published between 1934 and 1999 [9]. [NCMIC's Web site claims that the book \"includes an analysis of every known case related to this subject](http://www.ncmic.com/NCMIC_Ins/DoctorsOfChiro/PracticeTools/educational_materials/cva_mono.asp).\" That description is not true. It does not include many strokes that resulted in lawsuits against NCMIC policyholders but were not published in scientific journals. And it does not include the thoroughly documented case of [Kristi Bedenbauer ](chiro.html#kristy)whose autopsy report I personally mailed to Terrett after speaking with him in 1995. In 2001, Canadian researchers published a report about the relationships between chiropractic care and the incidence of vertebrovascular accidents (VBAs) due to vertebral artery dissection or blockage in Ontario, Canada, between 1993 and 1998. Using hospital records, each of 582 VBA cases was age- and sex-matched to four controls with no history of stroke. Health insurance billing records were used to document use of chiropractic services. The study found that VBA patients under age 45 were five times more likely than controls to (a) have visited a chiropractor within a week of the VBA and (b) to have had three or more visits with neck manipulations. No relationship was found after age 45. The authors discuss possible shortcomings of the study and urge that further research be done [10]. An accompanying editorial states that the data correspond to an incidence of 1.3 cases of vertebral artery dissection or blockage per 100,000 individuals receiving chiropractic neck manipulation, a number higher than most chiropractic estimates [11]. In 2001, British researchers reported on a survey in which all members of the Association of British Neurologists were asked to report cases referred to them of neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of neck manipulation over a 12-month period. The 35 reported cases included 7 strokes involving the vertebrobasilar artery and 2 strokes involving a carotid artery. None of the 35 cases were reported to medical journals [12]. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter School of Sport and Health Sciences, believes that these results are very significant. In a recent commentary, he stated: One gets the impression that the risks of spinal manipulation are being played down, particularly by chiropractors. Perhaps the best indication that this is true are estimates of incidence rates based on assumptions, which are unproven at best and unrealistic at worse. One such assumption, for instance, is that 10% of actual complications will be reported. Our recent survey, however, demonstrated an underreporting rate of 100%. This extreme level of underreporting obviously renders estimates nonsensical [13]. In 2002, researchers representing the [Canadian Stroke Consortium](http://www.strokeconsortium.ca/08-spontads/08iii.sp-update.html) reported on 98 cases in which external trauma ranging from \"trivial\" to \"severe\" was identified as the trigger of strokes caused by blood clots formed in arteries supplying the brain. Chiropractic-style neck manipulation was the apparent cause of 38 of the cases, 30 involving vertebral artery dissection and 8 involving carotid artery dissection. Other Canadian statistics indicate the incidence of ischemic strokes in people under 45 is about 750 a year. The researchers believe that their data indicate that 20% are due to neck manipulation, so there may be \"gross underreporting\" of chiropractic manipulation as a cause of stroke [14]. In 2003, another research team reviewed the records of 151 patients under age 60 with cervical arterial dissection and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) from between 1995 and 2000 at two academic stroke centers. After an interview and a blinded chart review, 51 patients with dissection and 100 control patients were studied. Patients with dissection were more likely to have undergone spinal manipulation within 30 days (14% vs 3%). The authors concluded that spinal manipulation is associated with vertebral arterial dissection and that a significant increase in neck pain following neck manipulation warrants immediate medical evaluation [15]. In 2006, the Journal of Neurology published a German Vertebral Artery Dissection Study Group report about 36 patients who had experienced vertebral artery dissection associated with neck manipulation [16]. Twenty-six patients developed their symptoms within 48 hours after a manipulation, including five patients who got symptoms at the time of manipulation and four who developed them within the next hour. In 27 patients, special imaging procedures confirmed that blood supply had decreased in the areas supplied by the vertebral arteries as suggested by the neurological examinations. In all but one of the 36 patients, the symptoms had not previously occurred and were clearly distinguishable from the complaints that led them to seek manipulative care. This report is highly significant but needs careful interpretation. Although it is titled \"Vertebral dissections after chiropractic neck manipulation . . . \" only four of the patients were actually manipulated by chiropractors. Half were treated by orthopedic surgeons, five by a physiotherapist, and the rest by a neurologist, general medical practitioner, or homeopath. It is possible\u2014although unlikely\u2014that the nonchiropractors used techniques that were more dangerous than chiropractors use in North America. The authors suggested that the orthopedists' treatment was safer, but there is no way to determine this from their data. Regardless, the study supports the assertion that neck manipulation can cause strokes\u2014which many chiropractors deny. In 2006, Pediatrics Electronic Pages published the results of a comprehensive review of reports of adverse events associated with spinal manipulation of children who were eight years of age or younger. The seven cases classified as serious included a 3-month-old infant with died from subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding that compressed the brain) and two cases of atlas dislocation [17]. A retrospective study found that 12 out of 141 patients treated for vertebral or carotid artery dissection at the SF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois between 2008 and 2012 had recent chiropractic neck manipulation documented in their chart. The ages of the patients ranged from 22 to 45 [18]. In 2021, a stroke sue to vertebral artery dissection was reported in a 2-month-old infant whose neck had been manipulated by a chiropractor [19]. Two more reports illustrate chiropractic's denial. - In the first study, 377 members of the British and Scottish Chiropractic Associations and more than 19,000 of their patients were asked whether complications had occurred following neck manipulations. No strokes were reported, but symptoms that may have indicated neurologic involvement\u2014headache (reported in 3.9% of cases), numbness/tingling of the arms (1.3% of cases), and fainting/dizziness/lightheadedness (1.1% of cases) were reported. About 400 patients who discontinued treatment could not be reached for follow-up, so what happened to them is unknown [20]. - In the second study, David Cassidy and others compared insurance billing records and hospital discharge records and concluded that (a) the incidence of strokes was following primary-care (medical) visits was similar to the incidence of strokes following chiropractic visits, and (b) therefore the strokes that occurred in chiropractic offices were not caused by the treatment they received [21]. However, the study is meaningless because\u2014unlike the German Vertebral Artery Dissection Study Group\u2014the researchers did not examine clinical records and were not able to determine whether the diagnoses they tabulated were accurate or whether the strokes were related to the type of manipulation [22]. In addition, the study might have had a different outcome if it had used an observation period of a few days instead of a month because strokes related to chiropractic manipulation usually occur soon afterward. Chiropractors have also argued that case-control studies provide evidence that neck manipulation and vertebral artery stroke are unrelated. These idea has been persuasively rebutted [23]. Are Complications Predictable? Some chiropractors advocate \"screening tests\" with the hope of detecting individuals prone to stroke due to neck manipulation [24-26]. These tests, which include holding the head and neck in positions of rotation to see whether the patient gets dizzy, are not reliable, partly because manipulation can rotate the neck further than can be done with the tests. Listening over the neck arteries with a stethoscope to detect a murmur, for example, has not been proven reliable, though patients that have one should be referred to a physician. Vascular function tests in which the patient's head is briefly held in the positions used during cervical manipulation are also not reliable as a screen for high-risk patients because a thrust that further stretches the vertebral artery could still damage the vessel wall.\" In a chapter in the leading chiropractic textbook, Terrett and a colleague have stated: Even after performing the relevant case history, physical examination, and vertebrobasilar function tests, accidents may still occur. There is no conclusive, foolproof screening procedure to eliminate patients at risk. Most victims are young, without [bony] or vascular pathology, and do not present with vertebrobasilar symptoms. The screening procedures described cannot detect those patients in whom [manipulation] may cause an injury. They give a false sense of security to the practitioner [27]. Several medical reports have described chiropractic patients who, after neck manipulation, complained of dizziness and other symptoms of transient loss of blood supply to the brain but were manipulated again and had a full-blown stroke. During a workshop I attended at the 1995 Chiropractic Centennial Celebration, Terrett said such symptoms are ominous and that chiropractors should abandon rotational manipulations that overstretch the vertebral arteries. But, as far as I know, his remarks have not been published and have had no impact on his professional colleagues. The lack of predictability has been supported by data published by Scott Haldeman, DC, MD, PhD, a chiropractor who has served as an expert witness (usually for the defense) in many court cases involving chiropractic injury. In 1995, he published an abstract summarizing his review of 53 cases that had not been previously reported in medical or chiropractic journals. His report stated: These cases represent approximately a 45% increase in the number of such cases reported in the English language literature over the past 100 years. . . . No clear cut risk factors can be elicited from the data. Previously proposed risk factors such as migraine headaches, hypertension, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, oral contraceptives, recent head or neck trauma, or abnormalities on x-rays do not appear to be significantly greater in patients who have cerebrovascular complications of manipulation than that noted in the general population [28]. Haldeman's main point was he could not identify any factor that could predict that a particular patient was prone to cerebrovascular injury from neck manipulation. This report was published in the proceedings of 1995 Chiropractic Centennial Celebration and was not cited in either the RAND or NCMIC reports. In 2001, Haldeman and two colleagues published a more detailed analysis that covered 64 cases involving malpractice claims filed between 1978 and 1994 [29]. They reported that 59 (92%) came to treatment with a history of head or neck symptoms. This statistic has been used to assert that any association between manipulation and stroke is coincidental\u2014that because a dissection can produce headache or neck pain, patients who have already had a dissection may seek out care with chiropractors and others. However, it does not explain away what happened to the 8% of patients who had not sought treatment for head or neck pain. Nor can coincidence explain why the association between neck manipulation and stroke occurs more often among patients under age 45 than among older patients. Haldeman's reports provide insufficient information to judge whether manipulation could have been useful for treating their condition. Of course, malpractice claims don't present the full story, because most victims of professional negligence do not take legal action. Even when serious injury results, some are simply not inclined toward suing, some don't blame the practitioner, some have an aversion to lawyers, and some can't find an attorney willing to represent them. What Should Be Done? Chiropractors cannot agree among themselves whether the problem is significant enough to inform patients that vertebrobasilar stroke is a possible complication of manipulation [30,31]. In 1993, the Canadian Chiropractic Association published a consent form which stated, in part: Doctors of chiropractic, medical doctors, and physical therapists using manual therapy treatments for patients with neck problems such as yours are required to explain that there have been rare cases of injury to a vertebral artery as a result of treatment. Such an injury has been known to cause stroke, sometimes with serious neurological injury. The chances of this happening are extremely remote, approximately 1 per 1 million treatments. Appropriate tests will be performed on you to help identify if you may be susceptible to that kind of injury. . . . [31]. This notice is a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. A proper consent should disclose that (a) the risk is unknown; (b) alternative treatments may be available; (c) in many cases, neck symptoms will go away without treatment; (d) certain types of neck manipulation carry a higher risk than others; and (e) claims that spinal manipulation can remedy systemic diseases, boost immunity, improve general health, or prolong life have neither scientific justification nor a plausible rationale. In 2003, a coroner's jury concluded that Lana Dale Lewis of Toronto, Canada, was killed in 1996 by a chiropractic neck manipulation. Among other things, the jury recommended that all patients for whom neck manipulation is recommended be informed that risk exists and that the Ontario Ministry of Health establish a database for chiropractors and other health professionals to report on neck adjustments [32]. In 2005, the Canadian Chiropractic Association published a comprehensive clinical guideline for treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash.. Among other things, the document noted that very few studies have compared chiropractic treatment to no treatment, which means that it is difficult to determine the likely benefit of neck manipulation. The guideline also discussed risk factors and recommended that minimal rotation should be used when upper-neck manipulation is done [33,34]. In 2007, following an unnecessary neck manipulation, Sandra Nette developed \"locked-in syndrome,\" a condition that has been described as \"the closest thing to being buried alive.\" She is fully aware of her surroundings and suffers at times from extreme pain. She cannot swallow, speak, or breathe without regular mechanical ventilation and suctioning of her secretions. She cannot move her legs or left arm. Slight use of her right arm enables her to use a computer keyboard to communicate through a voice synthesizer. Her plight was readily apparent in videos posted to YouTube [35]. In 2008, she and her husband filed a class-action lawsuit intended to stop inappropriate chiropractic manipulation and force Canadian regulators to deal with this problem [35]. The court refused to certify a class action [36], but the suit against the chiropractor who treated her proceeded and but was settled with an undisclosed payment [37]. The Bottom Line As far as I know, most chiropractors do not warn their patients that neck manipulation entails risks. I believe they should and that the profession should implement a reporting system that would enable this matter to be appropriately studied. This might be achieved if (a) state licensing boards required that all such cases be reported, and (b) chiropractic malpractice insurance companies, which now keep their data secret, were required to disclose them to an independently operated database that has input from both medical doctors and chiropractors. Meanwhile, since stroke is such a devastating event, every effort should be made to stop chiropractors from manipulating necks without adequate reason. Many believe that all types of headaches might be amenable to spinal manipulation even though no scientific evidence supports such a belief. Many include neck manipulation as part of \"preventative maintenance\" that involves unnecessarily treating people who have no symptoms. Even worse, some chiropractors\u2014often referred to as \"upper cervical specialists\"\u2014claim that most human ailments are the result of misalignment of the topmost vertebrae (atlas and axis) and that every patient they see needs neck manipulation. Neck manipulation of children under age 12 should be outlawed [38]. For Additional Information |Reader Comment | From a former chiropractor: I have been doing a vascular surgery rotation for the past month, which is part of my postgraduate medical education. During my chiropractic training, when the subject of manipulation-induced stroke was brought up, we were reassured that \"millions of chiropractic adjustments are made each year and only a few incidents of stroke have been reported following neck manipulation.\" I recently found that two of the patients on my vascular service that suffered a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) had undergone neck manipulation by a chiropractor, one the day that symptoms had begun and the other four days afterward. If indeed the incidence of stroke is rare, one M.D. would see a case of manipulation-induced CVA about every 10 years. But I believe I have seen two in the past month! I therefore urge my medical colleagues to question their patients regarding recent visits to a chiropractor/neck manipulation when confronted with patients that present with the neurologic symptoms of stroke. I also urge potential chiropractic patients to not allow their necks to be manipulated in any way. The risk-to-benefit ratio is much too high to warrant such a procedure. \u2014Rob Alexander, M.D. References - Guide](http://www.chirobase.org/03Edu/C/homola.html).

However, most chiropractors do not share the view of health and disease held by health scientists worldwide. Most dispute the idea that germs are the primary cause of infectious diseases, disparage conventional medical practices-particularly drug therapy and surgery\u2014and oppose various scientifically-based public health measures. In short, chiropractic has been anti-science in its philosophy and approach to health care. NCAHF's recommendations in this paper are based upon extensive study of materials from within chiropractic itself, inquiries and investigations by government and consumer agencies, criticisms by scientists and medical practitioners, insights provided by chiropractors who share NCAHF's principles, and the Council's own investigations. NCAHF believes that the chiropractic controversy is best understood when manipulative therapy, chiropractic's unique theory, and the practices of chiropractors are considered separately. Manipulative Therapy Manipulative therapy has a history extending back at least to Hippocrates. Folk healers (i.e. \"bonesetters\") and early osteopathic physicians used manipulation as a panacea, believing that many organic disorders were caused by \"displaced\" bones. Today manipulative therapy is employed by medical specialists (e.g. physiatrists, orthopedists, sports medicine practitioners), osteopathic physicians, physical therapists and athletic trainers as well as chiropractors. There is substantial evidence that manipulative therapy has value in treating back pain. Although it may not be any more effective than other modalities in the long term, manipulation may offer short term benefits when compared to other commonly used modalities. Several studies have found that about one-third of patients will experience more rapid relief with manipulation than with other modalities.(2-4) Manipulation is probably not utilized as fully as it might be in relieving the symptoms of some chronic disorders. It has been reported to be beneficial in controlling migraine pain.(5) Because manipulation involves the laying on of hands, a procedure employed throughout history by folk and faith healers, it enhances suggestibility and the placebo effect.(6,7)Occasionally, manipulation produces dramatic results. An example involves immediate recovery from paraplegia caused by an auto accident.(8) Manipulative therapy is not without risk. Many cases of serious complications following manipulative therapy have been reported in the medical literature. (9-15) Chiropractic Manipulation Chiropractors probably are more skilled in the art of manipulation than other practitioners since it constitutes the major emphasis of their training. Chiropractors are usually the most accessible manipulative therapists in a community, and some receive referrals from medical doctors. However, many physicians are reluctant to refer patients to chiropractors. This may be due to a fear that the chiropractor may attempt to indoctrinate patients in deviant health beliefs, a disbelief in the value of manipulative therapy, or an apathy to non-medical practitioners.(5) A major criticism of chiropractors is that they over utilize manipulation, both in excessively treating conditions known to be responsive to manipulation and in applying it to conditions for which there is no known justification. According to anecdotal reports by chiropractors, and patients who may have turned to chiropractic when conventional medical treatment failed to provide relief, manipulation has sometimes produced beneficial results. Such positive outcomes appear to be unpredictable and unexplained. These reports are selective, emphasizing positive results, but are common enough to warrant further study. Chiropractors have demonstrated some degree of clinical success in workmen's compensation studies.(16-18)Unfortunately, the failure to apply rigorous scientific methodology has prevented the identification of any special value chiropractic manipulation might have. This absence of scientific evidence is due largely to the confidence placed in the validity of chiropractic's basic premise. Chiropractic's Unique Therapy Chiropractic's uniqueness is not its use of manipulative therapy but its theoretical reason for doing so. Just as early osteopathy found its justification in the \"rule of the artery\" (i.e., the belief that manipulation improved circulation), chiropractic is based upon the \"rule of the nerve\", which assumes manipulation exerts important effects upon \"nerve flow \". The term \"chiropractic\" literally means \"done by hand.\" The word was adopted by chiropractic's founder, Daniel D. Palmer, a layman with an intense personal interest in the metaphysical health philosophies of his day such as magnetic healing, phrenology, and spiritualism. In 1895, Palmer claimed to have restored the hearing of a nearly deaf janitor by manipulating his spine. Palmer believed that he had discovered the primary cause of disease and theorized that 95 percent of all disease was caused by spinal subluxation and the others by luxated bones elsewhere in the body. Palmer was not employing the term \"subluxation\" in its medical sense, but with a new metaphysical meaning. Palmer's \"subluxations\" supposedly interfered with the body's expression of the Universal Intelligence (God) which Palmer dubbed the Innate Intelligence (spark of life or spirit).(19) Thus, D.D. Palmer invented chiropractic, named it, and established a guild of practitioners to further its development. For this reason chiropractic fits the dictionary definition of a cult (i.e. a system for the cure of disease based upon dogma set forth by its promulgator) (Webster's New Seventh Collegiate Dictionary). The Practices of Chiropractors In practice, chiropractic presents a chaotic picture. Few practitioners limit themselves to pure chiropractic. Practitioners are divided into a variety of factions and political battles over which faction deserves rightful title to the designation of \"chiropractor\" are still taking place. These divisions produce such variations that almost any generalization is inapplicable to some individuals or faction. Thus, any single description of chiropractic may be challenged as \"unrepresentative.\" In the following paragraphs are descriptions of a variety of these factions. Super-Straights, Straights, and Spinologists Chiropractors who restrict their practices to analyzing the spine for \"subluxations\" and removing them exclusively by manipulation without regard to a patent's disease refer to themselves as \"straights.\" They eschew the concept of diagnosis. Instead, they believe that if they analyze the spine and eliminate the \"subluxations,\" health will follow. Those who cling to the metaphysics of Palmer's original theory constitute a persistent minority who insist that they are the true chiropractors. Such have been referred to as \"radical religious\" (20) and \"super-straights.\" Some innovative chiropractors recently created the term \"spinology\" in which \"subluxations\" are renamed \"obstrusions,\" and allege that keeping the spine free of obstrusions will enable a person to reach his/her maximum genetic potential. Reference to disease or treatment is definitely implied but specifically denied. Spinology is clearly another version of \"super straight\" chiropractic. Treating \"Cause\" Versus \"Effect\" Chiropractors who restrict their practice to manipulation may be correctly labeled \"straights\", but whether practitioners believe their manipulation to be removing \"causes\" or \"effects\" is essential when evaluating individuals. Scientifically oriented manipulative therapists usually see their treatments as relieving the muscle spasms and nerve irritation (i.e., symptoms or \"effects\") of improper body mechanics, psychological stress, trauma, or some other \"primary\" cause. Philosophically oriented chiropractors are loathe to admit that they treat only \"effects\" or merely relieve symptoms. Chiropractic students are taught a distorted view which portrays medical doctors as philosophically committed to the \"allopathic\" theory of Hippocrates by which they merely treat the symptoms (i e, \"effects\") of disease. Chiropractic is portrayed as superior to medicine because it focuses on \"subluxations\" which it regards as the primary causes of disease. In reality, medical doctors abandoned practicing on the basis of philosophy long ago as they accepted scientific methodology. Medicine's dedication to the Hippocratic Oath is due to its acceptance of its code of behavior of physicians; not Hippocrates' healing theory. Mixers Chiropractors who utilize other modalities in addition to manipulation are labeled \"mixers\" by the straights. Unfortunately, these additional techniques are unscientific. Many mixers are opportunists who readily incorporate health fads into their practices. Straight chiropractors charge that mixers are actually \"naturopaths\" practicing under the guise of chiropractic in order to circumvent the fact naturopathy is illegal in most states. NCAHF tends to agree with this assessment. Naturopathy is a form of \"eclecticism\" (i e, a school of thought professing to select from what is best from all systems of medicine) that borrows from a wide variety of healing philosophies, applying them by subjective experience. Naturopaths usually mix common sense (e.g., advice against smoking and drug abuse and the advocacy of exercise and cleanliness) with bizarre theories about health and disease. Naturopaths employ a wide variety of questionable methods borrowed from folk medicine, pseudoscience and discarded medical practices. One is iridology, based upon the notion that every disease, habit, etc. is reflected directly through the nervous system to the iris of the eye.(21) Iridology, like reflexology, scleraglyphics, graphology and a host of other suspicious diagnostic techniques, utilizes methods common to a technique known as \"cold reading\".(22) Using a chart as a guide, the clinician fishes for past and present health problems. The subject may be quizzed, \"Have you had problems with your stomach, liver, back, etc.?\" If the patient acknowledges that he/she has, or ever has had, any kind of problem in the area in question, a 'hit' is claimed, and the \"finding\" is exploited. If the chart indicates a problem that the subject does not acknowledge, it can be claimed that there is \"a weakness and a tendency for disease in the area\" (a finding which opens the door for \"preventive\" treatments to keep the alleged disease from occurring). Thus, the practitioner is never judged as wrong. Such methods are characteristic of fortune-telling, not science. Naturopathic treatments may include shining colored lights on the patient (i.e., chromotherapy) on the theory that red \"...might be used in ailments of the blood . . orange is helpful in fevers...yellow rays aid stomach troubles\", and so forth. Patients might be sold \"glandular\" products on the theory that pills made from eyes will help the eyes, pancreatic substances the pancreas, liver extracts the liver, and so forth. Naturopaths prescribe megavitamins and herbs, either of which may function as drugs, belying the claim that their therapies are \"drugless\" or benign. Naturopaths tend to emphasize colonics based upon the discredited nineteenth century \"intestinal toxicity\" theory. The different kinds of treatments employed by naturopaths and mixer chiropractors are not necessarily any more \"natural\" than those used by medical practitioners, but are simply non-scientific in nature or application. Antiscience Attitudes Chiropractors complain that they are cut out from the rest of the health sciences and have even carried this charge to the point of bringing antitrust suits against a number of professional health organizations. In reality, it is chiropractic, with its deviant views on health and disease, that has isolated itself from the health sciences. Chiropractic theory and philosophy contest with basic anatomy, physiology, neurology, microbiology, pharmacology, pathology, immunology, and many other basic sciences. Despite their claims of persecution by organized medicine, chiropractic expends far more effort attacking conventional medical practice than vice versa. Chiropractors often play upon patients' natural fears of surgery and confuse patients by linking responsible therapeutic drug use with drug abuse. In addition, chiropractors generally oppose public health programs such as fluoridation, immunization, and sometimes pasteurization of milk. Those who engage in nutrition counseling commonly attack modern food technology and promote unscientific ideas. It seems curious that although chiropractic students use many standard medical textbooks, what they learn deviates significantly from others schooled in the health sciences. The source of these problems appears to be faulty schooling where chiropractic philosophy and pseudoscience are mixed with training in manipulative therapy. Hazardous Practices Chiropractic's lack of science has led it to violate the basic Hippocratic principle of \"first of all, do no harm.\" The conviction held by chiropractic true-believers that every spine will benefit from an adjustment causes them to manipulate spines inappropriately.(23,24) Among the concerns about chiropractic manipulation is the widespread use of the explosive \"dynamic thrust\" which takes the patient by surprise, as opposed to more conservative techniques. This maneuver has a greater potential for inflicting injury. The practice of greatest concern is the rotary neck movement (sometimes called \"Vaster cervical\" or \"rotary break\"). This type of manipulation has led to trauma (25-27), paralysis (28,29), strokes (30,31), and death (32-33) among patents. Even chiropractic's legal advisors have warned against its use.(34) The overuse of x-ray by chiropractors poses potential patient harm. Of primary concern is the 24 x 36 full spine x-ray. This technique exposes patients to a substantial amount of radiation. (35,38) Exposing the body trunk to x-rays can have serious long-range consequences (36-37) and should be avoided. Further, according to NCAHF's chiropractic advisors, such radiographs have little or no diagnostic value. Hucksterism The most disturbing feature of chiropractic is the number of \"success schools\" which teach ethically questionable practices and sometimes outright fraud to be used in practice-building. The methods employed have been described elsewhere (38-39) and will not be reviewed here in detail; just three examples will suffice. First, is the practice of leading people to believe that vague symptoms common to everyday life are warning signs of serious disease in need of chiropractic care. Second, is the tactic of selling patients on a belief that weekly or monthly \"preventive\" chiropractic care is needed to insure health. Third, is the rehearsal of explanations to recite to patients who have become discouraged in order to keep them returning despite the apparent absence of benefit. The message, which is clear to NCAHF from its review of such abuses, is the critical importance of patient trust and practitioner trustworthiness in health care. Chiropractors pay strong lip service to freedom of choice in the health marketplace. However, after reviewing many of the techniques taught by the success promoters in chiropractic, such \"freedom\" could easily be construed to mean a license for unethical practitioners to use their superior position in the doctor/patient relationship for exploitation. Patients who are deceived or desperate because of sickness, fear or pain are not choosing freely. State Licensure, Regulation, and Recognition Chiropractic claims that the fact it is licensed by the state legitimizes it. Close examination reveals major flaws in this assertion. State licensure is the method used to control the scope of practice of providers. Historically, chiropractors were licensed to restrict their use of prescription drugs and invasive techniques. At first, chiropractors were regulated by boards made up primarily of medical doctors, but in time most states set up boards comprised mainly of chiropractors. NCAHF finds this situation indefensible. Representatives on chiropractic examining boards enjoy state authority to endorse nonscientific practices among chiropractors. NCAHF agrees with the 1967 Report of The Health Manpower Commission which called for a reexamination of the basic assumption that the censure of chiropractors facilitates regulation (40), and the assessment by Consumer's Union that \"current licensing laws, in our opinion, lend a aura of legitimacy to unscientific practices and serve to protect the chiropractor rather than the public.\" (41) Legislators who review chiropractic practice acts are sometimes confused by the warring factions within chiropractic. Straights wish to have chiropractic practice limited to the manipulation of the spine for the purpose of removing \"subluxations.\" Mixers favor expanding practice acts to permit them to engage in a broad scope of practice. Mixers outnumber straights by about four-to-one enabling them to exert more pressure on legislators. Consumers will benefit if scope-of-practice laws are designed in terms of proven safety and effectiveness and not the views of special interest groups. Malpractice insurers have some power to encourage and enforce rational practices by chiropractors. These companies may deny insurance coverage to or withhold payment from non-scientific practitioners. In doing so they will simultaneously protect the public health and their purse. The Reformers There is a small but growing number of chiropractors who recognize the failings of their profession, but sincerely believe that there is a place for chiropractic in the health marketplace. It is estimated that 70-80% of people will suffer back pain at some time in their lives. If, as studies seem to indicate, one third of these can find more rapid relief by having safe, conservative manipulative therapy, then there appears to be a large market for the services of scientifically oriented chiropractors. Further, a national study of health practices found that three-fourths of chiropractic patients seek relief from musculo-skeletal problems. (42) This means that a minority seek the type of treatments found in the plethora of nonsense practiced by the chiropractor/naturopaths. If chiropractic were to purge itself of its quackery and offer valid back care, it could expect a substantial increase in physician referrals. One small faction of reformist chiropractors is conducting and publishing meaningful research in the field of manipulative therapy. This group is not openly critical of chiropractic's shortcomings and has not agitated for outright repudiation of the \"subluxation\" theory. They apparently seek to change chiropractic by evolution, bypassing the theory by ignoring it or applying the term \"subluxation\" to a number of spinal aberrations in a general manner. It is NCAHF's view that these chiropractors are too greatly outnumbered and overshadowed by practitioners profiting from pseudoscience to effectively change chiropractic in this manner. A more progressive-minded group has formed the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM), a professional association with views which are in harmony with science and consumer protection. Using guidelines set forth by the NCAHF Task Force on Chiropractic, NACM has openly renounced the \"subluxation\" theory and unscientific practices. Members limit their scope of practice to neuro musculo-skeletal conditions, and its modes of treatment to those which have scientific validity. NACM does not present itself as an alternative health care system to medical science. NCAHF'S Description of a Scientific Chiropractor At the request of a chiropractor, NCAHF established a task force to describe in practical terms what, in its view, would constitute acceptable chiropractic practices. The task force is comprised mostly of chiropractors who share NCAHF's beliefs in science and consumer protection NCAHF's position is as follows: A scientific chiropractor will: - Advance only methods of diagnosis and treatment which have a scientific basis. - Openly disclaim the nonscientific 'subluxation theory'. - Restrict the scope of practice to neuromusculoskeletal problems loosely defined as Type M conditions (i.e. muscle spasms, strains, sprains, fatigue, imbalance of strength and flexibility, stretched or irritated nerve tissue, and so forth) recognizing that some Type M problems will fall outside the scope of even a scientific chiropractor. - Work closely with medical practitioners, consulting with them on cases involving possible pathology and readily referring when reasonable and prudent. - Use conservative methods of manipulative therapy. - Avoid exposing patients to unnecessary radiation. - Work to increase public awareness about abuses by non-scientific chiropractors. - Help other chiropractors become more scientific in their approaches to health care delivery. - Work to prohibit unqualified practitioners of all kinds from performing manipulation. - Aid in the prosecution of alleged malpractice. Scientific chiropractors will not: - Use the title \"doctor\" in such a way as to mislead someone to believe the practitioner is other than a chiropractor. - Induce anyone to believe that a chiropractor should be consulted first in preference to a medical practitioner in respect to any disease or disorder. - Induce anyone to believe that chiropractic adjustment will cure or alleviate infectious diseases, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies or excesses, appendicitis, blood disorders, kidney diseases, gall bladder problems, hypertension, ulcers, heart disease or other non-Type M conditions. - Fail to take reasonable steps to advise a patient to consult or continue consulting a medical practitioner when engaged by someone requiring medical care. - Publish or publicly exhibit any circular extolling non-scientific chiropractic treatment or preventive care. - Condemn without scientific justification public health measures such as fluoridation, immunization, pasteurization of milk, etc. - Use their status as a health professional to sell or profit from the sale of products to patients. - Excessively treat patients. - Present themselves as specialists in pediatrics or claim the ability to treat children's diseases. - Claim that chiropractic adjustments will help raise resistance to disease or prolong life without valid evidence. - Claim to be a \"(w)holistic\" practitioner. - Claim to be qualified as a \"family practitioner.\" - Practice obstetrics. - Claim to be qualified to administer mental health care. - Utilize unproven*, disproven, or questionable methods, devices, and products such as adjusting machines, applied kinesiology, chelation therapy, colonic irrigation, computerized nutrition deficiency tests, cranial osteopathy, cytotoxic food allergy testing, DMSO, gerovital, glandular therapy, hair analysis, herbal crystalization analyses, homeopathy, internal managements, iridology, laser beam acupuncture, laetrile, magnetic therapy, Moire contourographic analysis, Thermoscribe, Toffness device, and so forth. *Except on an approved experimental basis in which patients are fully-informed about risk-benefits, protocols are monitored by an Independent Committee, and patients are not charged a fee for services or products. Recommendations NCAHF believes that a health care delivery system as confused and poorly regulated as is chiropractic constitutes a major consumer health problem. The fact is that practitioners possess useful skills in manipulative therapy, and the apparent need for such skills provides an opportunity for a constructive solution. The chiropractic problem is so broad-based that every segment of the community involved with health care - scientifically, economically, legally, or educationally - must inject itself into the chiropractic controversy. Only a comprehensive approach to a solution has any hope of succeeding. For this reason NCAHF makes the following recommendations: To Consumers: - As consumers you are largely at your own risk when choosing a practitioner of any kind because the law offers more protection to providers than consumers. Therefore choose health-care practitioners carefully - particularly a chiropractor. - Distinguish between manipulative therapy per se and treatment based upon the specious chiropractic theory. Be alert to the fact that, although manipulatlve therapy has distinct value in the treatment of back pain and may provide subjective relief on other chronic conditions, and chiropractors are educated and trained in manipulation, they represent but one source of this service. If you do choose a chiropractor, ask him/her to work closely with your medical doctor. - Chiropractic theory is nonscientific, and most chiropractors have not been taught to practice on the basis of the same body of knowledge about health and disease recognized by health scientists around the world. - Understand that some chiropractic treatments involve considerable risk. Manipulation involving the rapid rotation of the head and neck or sudden movements have greater potential for injury than more conservative types of therapy. Do not submit to a \"full spine\" x-ray. This practice has doubtful diagnostic value, and the radiation exposure may have long range dangers. - Be aware that many chiropractors engage in nonscientific practices which can result in unnecessary expense. Also, nonscientific practitioners may delay the proper treatment of serious disorders causing excessive debility or needless death. - Beware of chiropractors who advertise about \"danger signals that indicate the need for chiropractic care,\" make claims about cures, try to get patients to sign contracts for lengthy treatment, promote regular preventive \"adjustments,\" use scare tactics, or disparage conventional health care. - Demand that your legislative representative introduce and/or support laws that provide greater consumer protection in health care. To Insurance Carriers and Third-party Payers: - Limit reimbursement to medically necessary services and to those practitioners who provide appropriate medical documentation that establishes the diagnosis and justifies treatment. - Establish an independent commission financed by an insurance industry levy to investigate and curtail fraud and abuse in health care. To Legislators: - Recognize that legislatures have the greatest power to control chiropractic practices. Regulatory agencies and the courts can only enforce the laws passed by legislative bodies. Education alone cannot protect consumers or help people who do not realize that they are being deceived. - Restrict the scope of practice of chiropractors to neuromusculoskeletal problems. Prohibit their treatment of other conditions unless under medical referral. Specify the procedures that chiropractors may NOT perform, such as: Colonies. herbology, hair analysis, cancer therapies, or any unproven methods unless working on a bonafide experimental project in cooperation with qualified medical researchers. - Restrict the use of x-ray by chiropractors-particularly prohibit techniques that involve unnecessary radiation exposure to patients such as the \"full spine\" x-ray. - Prohibit chiropractors from using the title 'doctor' in any manner that doesn't clearly reveal that they are chiropractors. - Incorporate chiropractic training into the same university systems which teach medical, dental, and other allied health professionals so that instruction in basic sciences and training in diagnosis and patient screening will be brought up to the same standards as other primary entry health care providers. Designate the chiropractic degrees issued by these institutions \"Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine\" to distinguish them from previous diplomas. Establish standards for people holding \"Doctor of Chiropractic\" diplomas to upgrade themselves to the standards of the new degree. Set a time limit (e.g. ten years) in which this upgrading must occur to maintain licensure. - Permit Doctors of Chiropractic Medicine to utilize prescription drugs suitable to the limitations of their practices. - Regulate all health care providers through a single board of quality assurance constituted by a wide variety of members adept in the methods of scientific methodology and the bases for consumer protection legislation. Include on the board representatives from the basic sciences, public health, education and legitimate consumer groups. Restrict practitioners from the various health care delivery providers to service in a consultant status. - Make violation of the medical practice act a felony. T o Basic Scientists - Recognize that the chiropractic controversy involves the basic sciences more than medicine per se. These sciences are chiropractic's intellectual competitors in a manner similar to flat-earth believers versus astrological societies; however, chiropractic must be taken more seriously because it involves health care. - Take chiropractic seriously enough to become knowledgeable about its basis and conduct basic research to test the validity of its claims. - Use your influence to bring about reform in the health marketplace. To Academicians and Educators - Recognize that the academic community has an obligation to the communities at large to help resolve controversial issues which bear upon public health and well being. - Recognize that chiropractic promotes itself as an alternative to conventional scientifically-based health care, and that it is the largest and best organized nonscientific health care system in Western society. Its impact upon public health is too great to ignore. - Become familiar with chiropractic's tenets and practices. Teach about these to your students. - Be aware that chiropractic recruiters are working through career guidance counselors to attract students to the profession. Inform students about the true nature of chiropractic so they can make wise choices. - Urge educators to work with reformist chiropractic organizations to incorporate chiropractic education into accredited universities. To Attorneys and Law Enforcement Agencies: - Recognize that litigation offers an effective means to bring reform to chiropractic. A number of scientifically oriented chiropractors now stand ready to offer assistance in malpractice lawsuits. This helps to take away the usual defense of justifying a chiropractor's clinical inadequacies of diagnosis and treatment as standard practice. - Become familiar with the fallacies and common abuses of chiropractic. Attorneys with insights in these areas can serve as specialists in the prosecution of chiropractic malpractice - Vigorously enforce current scope of practice laws. Many of the current abuses by chiropractors are illegal. To Medical Doctors, Dentists, and Other Scientific Health Care Providers: - Limit your professional association to chiropractors who reject the cultism and pseudoscience of chiropractic and meet the criteria for scientific practitioners as suggested by NCAHF. - Encourage professional associations to undertake studies of chiropractic within their regions and issue appropriate statements of their findings. - Actively lobby legislators to enact laws to curtail abuses by chiropractors and other health care deliverers. - Report chiropractors who exceed their legal scope of practice to law enforcement agencies. - Provide educational materials to patients about the nature of chiropractic. - Cooperate with efforts to control the quality of health care delivery such as the establishment of a single regulatory board with broad representation from basic science and legitimate consumer groups for all providers. To Reformist Chiropractors: - Organize yourselves into a clearly identifiable group with a code of ethics, standards of practice, and scientific guidelines. - Publicly proclaim the shortcomings of cultist and pseudoscientific chiropractors. - Lobby for laws to reform chiropractic practice. - Be available to attorneys to enable injured patients to receive just recompense for abuses by irresponsible and nonscientific chiropractors, and to bring pressure by the courts to more clearly define malpractice. - Press for reform within established chiropractic organizations. - Encourage chiropractors who have remained silent about the abuses of public relations oriented chiropractic leadership while they practiced in a reasonable conservative manner to take a stand for reform. - Establish a liaison between your reformist groups and other professional health organizations to gain their support and cooperation.

NCAHF was a private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focused upon health misinformation, fraud and quackery as public health problems. Its funding was derived primarily from membership dues, newsletter subscriptions, and consumer information services. NCAHF's officers and board members served without compensation. NCAHF united consumers with health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and others who believe that everyone has a stake in the quality of the health marketplace. NCAHF's positions on consumer health issues were based upon principles of science that underlie consumer protection law. These require: (1) adequate disclosure in labeling and other warranties to enable consumers to make proper choices; (2) premarketing proof of safety and efficacy for products and services that claim to prevent, alleviate, or cure any disease or disorder; and, (3) accountability for those who violate consumer laws.

Manipulation (i.e., \"the forceful, passive movement of a joint beyond its active limit of motion,\" according to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary) is not the exclusive domain of chiropractors. Folk practitioners sometimes called \"bonesetters\" have long used the notion of bones \"going out of place\" to explain maladies, and they employ manipulation as a panacea. Andrew Taylor Still invented \"osteopathy\" based upon the theory that luxated bones interfere with blood circulation, producing all manner of diseases. (Osteopathy officially abandoned Still's theory in 1948.) Today, physiotherapists, athletic trainers, and several types of medical doctors sometimes employ manipulation for neuromusculoskeletal conditions. There is sufficient evidence that manipulation can at least temporarily improve the range of motion of impaired joints and relieve pain \u2014 sometimes dramatically \u2014 to make it a worthwhile, although limited, medical procedure. Manipulation requires a good deal of individual skill, which many chiropractors possess. History Chiropractic's uniqueness is not in its use of manipulation but in its theoretical basis for doing so \u2014 which also explains why chiropractors overutilize spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), often applying it without justification. Chiropractic is the brainchild of Daniel D. Palmer, a late-nineteenth century dabbler in metaphysical approaches to health care. Palmer had practiced phrenology and magnetic healing, and had some osteopathic training. He reported that a spiritualist medium inspired him in his search for \"the single cause of all disease.\" He puzzled over the fact that pathogenic germs were found in both healthy and sick people and searched for an explanation. (Today, we know that the immune system makes the difference.) He claimed that in 1895 he restored the hearing of janitor Harvey Lillard and concluded that the spine was the key to health and disease. Unique Theory Palmer contrived the notion that \"subluxations\" of the spine impinge nerves, interfering with nerve flow, which he dubbed the Innate Life Force, and that all a practitioner had to do was to adjust the spine \u2014 the healing powers of nature would do the rest. Neither Palmer nor any other chiropractor has ever been able to reliably demonstrate the existence of \"subluxations,\" much less validate their importance to health and disease. Nevertheless, chiropractic has thrived and now has about 60,000 practitioners in the United States. When chiropractors are challenged to explain precisely what effect nerve impingement is supposed to have upon a nerve impulse (i.e., frequency of propagation, amplitude, etc.), they either fall back upon metaphysical notions of the Innate Life Force or evoke one of many common ploys: - Make a virtue of their ignorance by retorting that they don't know how it works but that it does. - Claim that studies to determine the mechanism are now under way or just completed but unpublished (the \"Oh, haven't you heard? You're behind the times!\" ploy) - Change the official rhetoric by adding ambiguous language: \"Pathological processes may be influenced by disturbances of the nervous system. . . . Disturbances of the nervous system may be the result of derangements of the musculoskeletal structure. Disturbances of the nervous system may cause or aggravate disease in various parts or functions of the body.\" [1] These three statements are true but do not support chiropractic's subluxation theory or the general notion that spinal problems are an underlying cause of disease. They do this while continuing to practice as if subluxations were an established reality. Lack of Validity of Chiropractic Theory A comprehensive critique of chiropractic's lack of scientific validity was published by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of Quebec in 1963 and remains relevant today. It stated: Chiropractors claim that subluxations, or partial displacements, of the vertebrae cause a perturbation of the distribution of nervous impulses to tissues and cells. Neurophysiologists have developed methods of recording the passage of impulses in nerves. Exceptionally sensitive apparatus is available to anyone wishing to use it. No scientific study has ever been published on the subject by a chiropractor. No chiropractor ever defined, either quantitatively or qualitatively, what chiropractic means by perturbation of nervous impulses. Is it their number, their amplitude, their frequency, or their wave patterns which are affected? All of these qualities can be identified, recorded, and studied. It is no longer permissible to accept empirical statements. Proof should have preceded practical application. With the first point untenable, the rest crumbles [2]. In 1973, Yale University anatomist Edmund Crelin, Ph.D., demonstrated that subluxations severe enough to impinge upon the nerves exiting through openings between the spinal bones were impossible to produce without total disablement [3]. He subsequently observed that instead of the scientific response of attempting to reproduce his research, the ACA simply declared that his work was invalid because it was done on cadavers [4]. In fact, Crelin states, the absence of a reflex response in a dead body should make subluxations easier to produce. Faced with this evidence, a true-believing chiropractor once remarked to me that the reason Crelin had failed to demonstrate the chiropractic hypothesis was that he worked with cadavers in which Innate Life Force was no longer present! An excuse chiropractors employed for years for the lack of scientific evidence for their theory was that the government wouldn't provide the necessary research funding. The falsity of this claim was exposed in 1972, when the International Chiropractic Association reported that the federal government had approved a grant for Chung Ha Suh, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado, to develop a method for measuring spinal configurations to determine the existence of chiropractic subluxations and that the grant application was the first in chiropractic's history [5]. Scott Haldeman, D.C., M.Sc., Ph.D., M.D., a third-generation chiropractor whose personal commitment to validating chiropractic led him to obtain a medical degree and advanced degrees in neurophysiology, has criticized the attempts of Suh and others \"to find more accurate ways of measuring a subluxation in the absence of any solid data that the subluxation is worth measuring.\" [6] Although providing chiropractic public relations personnel with fodder for a decade, Suh's work on the illusive subluxation never got anywhere and now seems fruitless at best. Lack of Clinical Reliability Apologists have some room for defensive debate because of the difficulty of establishing mechanisms of cause and effect in many other fields of science. An easier and more practical test of chiropractic is that of the reliability (i.e., consistency) of chiropractors' clinical ability to identify subluxations. They have not fared well in these tests. Investigative reporter Ralph Lee Smith visited the Palmer Clinic in Davenport, Iowa, and the National College Clinic at Lombard, Illinois, on two successive days. At Palmer he was told that he had subluxations at the ninth dorsal and the fifth lumbar; at National a subluxation was diagnosed at the fifth dorsal only. Neither found other subluxations alleged by another chiropractor seen earlier [7]. In 1973, Stephen Barrett, M.D., sent a healthy four-year-old girl to five chiropractors for a\"'check up.'\"The first said the child's shoulder blades were \"out of place\" and found \"pinched nerves to her stomach and gall bladder.\" The second said the child's pelvis was \"twisted.\" The third said one hip was \"elevated\" and that spinal misalignments could cause \"headaches, nervousness, equilibrium or digestive problems\" in the future. The fourth predicted \"bad periods and rough childbirth\" if her \"shorter left leg\" were not treated. The fifth not only found hip and neck problems, but also \"adjusted\" them without bothering to ask permission. Several years later, 11 chiropractors who examined two adult women had similarly inconsistent findings [8]. Mark L. Brown, a reporter for the Quad City Times, serving the Davenport, Iowa, area, conducted his own five-month investigation of the practice of chiropractic. He produced an insightful 36-page Sunday newspaper supplement revealing some bizarre as well as some useful practices. Brown also found numerous inconsistencies, including diagnoses that his left leg was shorter than his right leg and vice versa! [9] Isolation Chiropractors commonly blame others for their lack of science, claiming to have been isolated by organized medicine. In reality, chiropractic's isolation is self-imposed. Chiropractors substitute chiropractic philosophy for science and commonly boast of intellectual superiority. True-believers say that someday the world will acknowledge the greatness of chiropractic. It would be impossible for chiropractors who adhere to chiropractic theory and philosophy to work with scientific healthcare providers. Chiropractors' concepts of the causes and treatments of disease differ radically; and, although health scientists worldwide can bridge barriers of language and culture via the common ground of basic science, they cannot work with pseudoscientists. There is considerable concern about the wisdom of permitting chiropractors to serve as entry-level health-care providers. Practitioners devoted to a pseudoscientific approach to disease are apt to miss serious diseases when hearing patient complaints. Reformist chiropractor Peter Modde concluded that malpractice is an inevitable result of chiropractic training and philosophy [10] . How widely the subluxation theory is believed among chiropractors is uncertain. In a 1981 report, 88% of 268 responding chiropractors gave subluxations in musculoskeletal problems an importance of 70 % or more, and 60% of 265 respondents gave subluxations in visceral disorders a rating of 70% or more [11]. A similar survey conducted today would probably show smaller but still substantial percentages. The proportion of chiropractors who believe in the metaphysical Innate Life Force is unknown. Factionalism Chiropractic has become a conglomeration of factions in conflict, bound together only by opposition to outside critics. At least a dozen different notions about how the spine should be corrected divide practitioners. Some say only the Atlas needs adjusting; others go to the other end of the spine and say only the sacral area is important. Still others use both ends (sacrooccipital). Several adhere to specific vertebral levels for specific organs or diseases. Some measure leg lengths or test muscles \u2014 called [\"applied kinesiology\" (AK)](../../06DD/ak.html) \u2014 for weakness or strength in association with foods, colors, music, and just about anything else. (Even AK's originator expressed skepticism about the technique being used to determine one's personal star.) The most obvious rift among chiropractors is between \"straights\" and \"mixers.\" Straights adhere more to chiropractic's original theory and practice, while \"mixers\" (a term applied by the straights and unpopular among the mixers) may incorporate almost any modality into their practices. The ICA is the straights' national organization, and the ACA represents mixers. The confusion within chiropractic over subluxations, scope of practice, and other important health-care issues was described by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (OIG). [Its 1986 report](../../02Research/oig.html) stated: Heated controversy regarding chiropractic theory and practice continues to exist. . . . On-site and telephone discussions with chiropractors and their schools and associations, coupled with a review of background materials ... result in a picture of a profession in transition and containing a number of contradictions.... There continues to be some disagreement within the profession regarding which conditions are appropriate for chiropractic care and regarding appropriate parameters for treatment [12]. The OIG investigators also made note of \"the problem side of chiropractic.\" The report states: Despite the evidence which was presented during the study regarding the increased emphasis on science and professionalism ... there also exist patterns of activity and practice which at best appear as overly aggressive marketing and, in some cases, seem deliberately aimed at misleading patients and the public regarding the efficacy of chiropractic care [12]. There are also chiropractors who practice rational, conservative spinal manipulative therapy for neuromusculoskeletal disorders. They do not claim to be alternative practitioners but offer their skills as manipulation therapists when such treatment is medically justifiable. What proportion of chiropractors fit this description is unknown. The National Association of Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) was formed in 1984 as an attempt to organize reform-minded chiropractors. There may be a substantial number of rational chiropractors \"in the closet,\" in which case our view of chiropractic may be distorted by the hucksters and zealots among the guild. Evaluating Individual Chiropractors Because of the great diversity among chiropractors, it is impossible to evaluate individual practitioners according to the commonly advanced straights/mixer dichotomy. There is a common misconception that straights are old-fashioned (i.e., unscientific) and mixers are modern (i.e., scientific). Although straights may be labeled \"cultists\" for adhering to Palmer's dogma, the additional modalities mixers employ are apt to be just as nonscientific. Mixers utilize colonics, iridology, unproven devices, applied kinesiology herbology, crystals, variations of acupuncture, glandular therapy, craniopathy, and a seemingly endless array of dubious diagnostic, prescription, and therapy procedures. Of course those who use questionable methods can be rejected as untrustworthy on that basis alone, but because chiropractors are very philosophical, individuals can be challenged on the basis of why they manipulate. True-believer chiropractors would be loath to admit that their ministrations are so mundane as to deal with effects rather than basic causes. This topples them from their imagined dominance as \"the true physicians\" to merely therapists. Rational chiropractors will readily admit that SMT relieves effects not causes. The fact that they mainly provide temporary somatic relief, rather than dealing with the causal factors of disorders, is evidenced by the large amount of repeat business they generate. Too-frequent treating is a factor noted by nearly every commission that has evaluated chiropractic. Third-party payers commonly control chiropractic costs by limiting the number of treatments or the annual amount for which devotees may receive reimbursement. Individual chiropractors can also be judged according to their opposition or endorsement of scientifically established public-health practices, such as fluoridation, immunization, pasteurization, and modern food technology. Chiropractors are often in the forefront of antiscientific social movements opposing such practices. Patient Loyalty Despite its appalling lack of science, chiropractic has a loyal following of clients. I believe this can be credited to the somatic relief of SMT and the psychological aspects of chiropractic care. SMT involves the laying on of hands, which reportedly has the effect of relaxing the patient. The laying on of hands also is said to increase suggestibility, which enhances the placebo effects of SMT. Reformist Samuel Homola, D.C. has stated: The majority of the \"subluxations\" commonly found by many chiropractors are likely to be painless and imaginary. In replacing these imaginary subluxations, the practitioner places his hands upon the patient's back and applies a sudden thrust, causing the bones to come together, making a noise like the \"crushing of an old basket.\" This thrust, with \"popping\" of the vertebrae, has a tremendous psychological influence over the mind of the healthy patient as well as over the mind of the sick patient. While the popping sound itself is quite meaningless . . . (such as \"cracking\" the knuckles) . . . this influence might be used to advantage in curing psychosomatic conditions-provided the patient is informed that the bone is \"back-in-place\" and will stay there. By the same token, however, such treatment used on the mentally unstable and nervous person can cause a great deal of harm; that is, by perpetuating a psychosomatic condition or even creating a new psychological illness [13]. Thus Homola points out that the placebo effect is not without potential for harm. By experiencing relief, the patient is taught illness through operant conditioning. In addition to the direct physical effects Homola describes, chiropractors engage in a great deal of verbal conditioning. Manipulation itself can feel good (although it can also be painful) and can be addictive, according to chiropractic reformist Charles DuVall, D.C. [14]. Chiropractors have been shown to be better at satisfying patients than medical doctors are. This is because they validate patients' problems medical doctors tend to minimize, offer simplistic explanations about health and disease, and work at being friendly. Chiropractic also offers both a mechanistic and a metaphysical explanation for its effects, appealing to both needs. Chiropractic rhetoric has adapted itself to contemporary flavors of \"holistic\" health-care. In fact, chiropractic is not holistic but spine-centered, but this seems to escape notice. Selling Chiropractic Success promoters who give seminars to train chiropractors in psychological patient manipulation are a notorious problem within chiropractic. I study a wide variety of health pseudosciences, but I know of no other guild that has formalized the education of practitioners in patient deception. While many of the procedures taught are simply good office practice, many others are fraudulent [8]. Former ACA public-relations consultant Eric Baizer says the ACA conducts an aggressive public-relations program aimed at selling chiropractors as family doctors and primary-care providers. Baizer describes how as a PR expert he defended chiropractic publicly by responding to negative press reports. He says he employed stock answers and reusable clich\u00e9s \u2014 what one writer termed \"factoids\" (i.e., statements designed to resemble facts). \"For example,\" Baizer wrote, \"if someone attacked the quality of chiropractic education, we would point out that chiropractors attended colleges accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Office of Education-implying that the schools must be of high quality. How good is the chiropractic curriculum? How qualified are the instructors? Are inspections of the colleges thorough? These are the kinds of issues best left unexplored.\" [15] Survival of a Pseudoscience The illusionary \"subluxation\" not only is the theoretical basis for chiropractic but constitutes its legal basis as well. Many state laws describe chiropractic as the finding and removal of subluxations. It is enigmatic that such a system thrives late in the twentieth century, which has seen such progress in the biological sciences and health care. While biological scientists have unraveled the genetic double-helix, chiropractors have failed to scientifically define their theory or scope of practice, or to justify their very existence as primary health-care providers. Chiropractic's survival and success is undoubtedly due to the reality that healthcare delivery involves much more than science. Politics, business considerations, and the clinical art often take precedence. Although it is the scientific validity of the methods employed that justifies modern health-care, in practical terms of survival in the marketplace, chiropractic demonstrates daily that the scientific aspects of health care are of least importance and in greatest need of protection. The chiropractic guild is adept at having its way with politicians. This appears to be primarily due to its applications of business law to the health marketplace. Chiropractors pose themselves as competitors of \"allopathic medicine\" (a misnomer, since allopathic medicine, which employed bleeding, purging, and so forth, to balance the four Greek humors, was replaced long ago with the emergence of medical science). Unfortunately, standard medicine is regarded by many legislators as simply holding another opinion among differing viewpoints. Chiropractors encourage the concept that they are a separate but equal healthcare delivery system. They find allies among those who present science as merely \"Western thought\" and find the Innate Life Force notion compatible with Eastern metaphysical world-views. Politicians seem to have trouble differentiating between religious beliefs and beliefs in various forms of health care. Chiropractic's clientele is loyal, and its political clout is greater than that of its critics. Patients willingly cooperate with chiropractors when asked to send letters to lawmakers. Many subscribe to the myth of a vindictive medical profession out to crush its opposition. In the final analysis, the validity of chiropractic is not a medical controversy as much as one of the basic biological sciences. Medicare reimburses chiropractors with millions of taxpayers' dollars each year for removing \"subluxations\" allegedly demonstrated by X-rays. Basic biological scientists have a public duty to objectively test a theory as radical as chiropractic's to determine whether it is valid. The failure to require scientific validation of an entire healthcare delivery system provides a disturbing precedent for other nonscientific systems to lay claim to the public purse. Chiropractic and other nonscientific forms of health care will survive until the public demands that scientific justification become a primary qualification for legalization and reimbursement.

It is the most widely disseminated indigenous American system of healing and the most frequently used type of alternative health care in the United States (Gaucher-Peslherbe, 1995; Eisenberg, 1993). Its steadily increasing acceptance and use by the public, third- party payers, and the Federal government indicate that chiropractic is no longer the \"marginal\" or \"deviant\" profession it was once considered to be (Wardwell, 1952). In recent years, a number of outside observers have suggested that the profession has now entered the health care mainstream (Coile, 1995a, 1995b; Stano, 1992; Wardwell, 1988). At present, chiropractic is both alternative (in that it approaches health care from a distinctly different perspective than that of the dominant health care profession, medicine) and mainstream (in that it has gained popular acceptance). This chapter discusses the characteristics of the profession that contribute to its distinct perspective and approach to patient care, and how these affect its position within the U.S. health care system. A. Different Perspectives on the Role of Chiropractic in the Health Care System Precisely what roles chiropractors could or should play in the health delivery system is a complex and unresolved issue. In general, three distinct (but not mutually exclusive) roles for chiropractors have been discussed in the chiropractic literature (Hawk, 1996a; Wardwell, 1992): - limited musculoskeletal specialists on interdisciplinary primary health care teams - primary health care gatekeepers focusing on ambulatory musculoskeletal complaints - generalist primary health care providers of \"alternative/complementary\" medicine, managing or co-managing more than just musculoskeletal problems. Patients, the chiropractic profession itself, medical physicians, third-party payers, and the managed care industry all have different perspectives on what role would be most appropriate for chiropractors. Although there is some agreement among the various constituencies, substantial differences exist, highlighting the key issues that the profession and policymakers will need to address in the future. 1. The Patient /Consumer Perspective Chiropractors already play a significant role in health care delivery for many Americans. A recent study estimated that approximately 7 percent of adults in this country had received chiropractic treatment in the past year (Eisenberg, 1993). A substantial fraction (25-42 percent) of patients seeking care for back pain receives chiropractic care (Deyo, 1987; Shekelle, 1995; Hawk, 1995; Carey, 1995, 1996). An analysis of the 1974-82 RAND Health Insurance Experiment data found that chiropractors were the first health care providers seen for 38 percent of episodes of back pain and that chiropractors were the \"primary\" provider (i.e., the provider type that delivered the majority of care) for 40 percent of back pain episodes (Shekelle, 1995). Furthermore, this study determined that chiropractors were retained as primary provider for 92 percent of their patients who had a second episode of back pain, compared to 75 percent retention for general medical practitioners. Thus, many back pain patients have used chiropractors as first contact primary providers of care for at least this one common problem. Although some people may also use chiropractors as alternative/complementary care generalists like acupuncturists or homeopaths, the evidence suggests this does not frequently occur (Hurwitz, 1998; Christensen, 1993; Goertz, 1996). Several studies have examined whether chiropractic care substitutes for medical care. Yesalis (1980), in a study in rural Iowa, found that as chiropractic care increased, medical use also increased. Chiropractic services did not appear to substitute for medical services in a group of Canadian elderly (Shapiro, 1983). In fact, chiropractic users tended to use all health services with more frequency. Other studies have also noted that patients use different providers simultaneously, even for the same problem (Eisenberg, 1993; Thomas, 1991). Thus, to date, there is no evidence that chiropractic care substitutes for medical care. Much study is still needed to determine what impacts patients' decisions to utilize one provider over another. In fact, chiropractic researchers consider this issue as a priority for their health services research agenda (Mootz, 1997). 2. The Chiropractic Profession Perspective Because chiropractors have had to fight for their existence, they have jealously guarded their independent practice status granted them through State licensing. Organized medicine's refusal to permit physician referral to or from chiropractors ensured that direct access was the only route by which patients could receive chiropractic services. **It is not quite correct to blame \"organized medicine\" for the low referral rates from medical doctors to chiropractors. In the 1960s and 1970s, various organizations had policies discouraging such referral. However, as far as I know, no physician was ever disciplined for violating such a policy. The real reason for lack of referral was lack of respect, based mainly on (1) the absurd claims chiropractors made in their advertising and (2) the absurd experiences patients would report to their doctors. As a result, chiropractors often developed loyal patient bases and played what many chiropractors viewed as a primary care role for their self-referred patients. It is not surprising then, that most chiropractors see themselves as \"primary care\" practitioners (Hawk, 1996b). **Chiropractors use a very loose definition of primary-care practitioner. The standard definition requires the ability to diagnose and treat a broad range of problems. Chiropractors are very limited in what they can do. In recent years, a physician \"gatekeeper\" model of health care delivery has become prominent in managed care plans. The concept that a single physician, familiar with all of a patient's needs, could coordinate and direct care in a \"primary care\" role remains conceptually attractive. In practice, gatekeeping typically limits access to more expensive specialty care. **The relevant goal of managed care is to limit unnecessary specialty care. Perhaps because of a lack of exposure to what services chiropractors provide, primary care physician gatekeepers may consider chiropractic to be similar to medical specialty care, thereby limiting access until various medical diagnostic and care strategies have been tried, or restricting access entirely. **It isn't lack of exposure. It is lack of respect. Most doctors have a general idea of what chiropractors can do. Thus, chiropractors have been concerned that direct access by their patients might be eliminated if medical physicians became the sole arbiters of patient flow. Some managed care organizations, however, have allowed direct access to chiropractic services (Coile, 1995b; Simpson, 1996). Because of the overlay of political and economic issues, there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the meaning of the term \"primary care,\" and debate about who practices it. **Only among chiropractors. The rest of the health world has a very clear definition. In the chiropractic community, there are two major positions on this issue. One suggests that chiropractors are not primary care physicians, but musculoskeletal specialists (Nelson, 1993). Current chiropractic patient characteristics and available clinical research support this argument. This position would place chiropractic in a practice model similar to that of dentistry or podiatry. The other position argues that, although chiropractors are not primary \"medical\" care providers, they may be seen as primary \"health\" care providers (Ebrall, 1994; Bowers, 1995). **This argument is sheer baloney. It also clashes with the fact that large percentages of chiropractors and their organizations oppose or fail to support preventive measures such as immunization and fluoridation. Most also have little practical knowledge of nutrition. This is in keeping with current concepts of community-oriented primary care, a definition of primary care that emphasizes the linkage between community (public) health and individual patient diagnosis and treatment (Hawk, 1996a). Further, chiropractic training typically emphasizes differential diagnosis and conservative management of many common health care problems (Bowers, 1995). **It would be interesting to see a list of the health problems chiropractors believe they can conservatively manage. In 1994, the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) attempted to resolve these opposing positions through a comprehensive statement that refers to characteristics of primary care as described recently by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (Donaldson, 1994). The ACA statement describes the chiropractor in a primary health care delivery system as a first contact gatekeeper for neuromusculoskeletal conditions characterized by direct access, longitudinal, vertically integrated, conservative ambulatory care of patients' health care needs, emphasizing neuromusculoskeletal conditions, health promotion, and patient-centered diagnosis and management. (The ACA statement was presented as a statement from the American Chiropractic Association Task Force on Primary Care and Chiropractic, June 18-19, 1994.) **In other words, they are not primary-care physicians but should have the privilege of seeing patients directly without medical referral. 3. The Medical Profession Perspective It is only recently that medicine's opinion of chiropractic has changed from almost universal negativism (Wolinsky, 1994) to one of guarded interest among a substantial fraction of medical doctors (Cherkin, 1989; Cherkin, 1992). Until 1980, the AMA stated that it was unethical to refer a patient to a chiropractor. The loss of a landmark antitrust suit, upheld all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, finally erased such prohibitions against medical providers working with chiropractors (Getzandaner, 1987). **The AMA changed its official policy several years before the case was over. However, as I note above, the policy really functioned as a suggestion. Although many reasons can be offered to explain the original mutual distrust between the medical and chiropractic professions (Curtis, 1992), it is clear that negative attitudes have been reinforced because each profession tends to see the other's treatment failures. It is also noteworthy that, traditionally, medicine has rejected the possibility of efficacy of treatments that were based on explanatory models or theories that they perceived as invalid, such as the original chiropractic theory that spinal lesions (chiropractic subluxations) cause or contribute to an individual's inability to counter disease processes. ** [Subluxation theory](https://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosub.html) was seen as invalid because it is invalid. Today, the pragmatic emphasis on patient outcomes rather than on hypothetical biologic mechanisms of therapy facilitates a more objective look at the clinical utility of both allopathic and chiropractic treatments. **The medical profession still looks at both. The consensus is does not make sense, it will not usually turn out to be useful. I suspect that authors of this chapter would like you to overlook the fact that nonsensical beliefs are rampant among chiropractors. In at least some respects, the chiropractic procedure of spinal manipulation has met the outcomes challenge, for low back pain. Recent literature syntheses performed by researchers, both within and outside the chiropractic profession, have concluded that spinal manipulation is relatively safe (Shekelle, 1992), appears to benefit at least some subgroups of patients with low back pain (Shekelle, 1992; Anderson, 1992; Bigos, 1994; Koes, 1996), and does to a placebo (Hoehler, 1981; Hadler, 1987; Sanders, 1990; Brennan, 1991). These issues are discussed in more detail in Chapter XI. **This is correct, but these assessments were based mainly on research by medical doctors and physical therapists and do not necessarily reflect what takes place in the \"average\" chiropractic office. There may be a great deal of overlap among the types of patients seen by chiropractors, family physicians, and orthopedists particularly relating to back pain, neck pain, and headache. Because medical science has not been wholly successful in understanding these common syndromes, nor in developing highly effective management strategies, there has been increasing curiosity about what chiropractors may have to offer. As a result, chiropractors have begun to develop close collaborations with members of the medical specialties that most commonly treat such complaints (Curtis, 1992; Triano, 1994). Recent survey data suggest that a significant proportion of medical physicians perceive value in chiropractic. Berman (1995) reported that 49 percent of East Coast family practice respondents found chiropractic to be \"legitimate medical practice,\" and that 56 percent had made referrals to a chiropractor. **This was a very bizarre report. Although the survey was said to have been conducted at three conferences for family physicians. However, The 27.2% of those who respended responders said they practiced chiropractic. I thonk this means that 27.2% of the people who took the survey were chiropractors. Although I raised this question in a letter to the editor of the journal, the author failed to respond. Cherkin (1989) found similar results in a survey of family physicians in Washington State. Patel-Christopher (1990), quoted in Manga (1993), noted that in Canada, 62 percent of medical physicians refer patients with musculoskeletal pain to chiropractors and that 9.5 percent of medical practitioners are chiropractic patients themselves. **It appears from the citation that the study was not published, so that it would probably be difficult to find out how the study was done. Even though many medical doctors believe chiropractic may be of value, few feel well informed about it and many would like to learn more (Cherkin, 1989). For example, while 70 percent of general practitioners in Nova Scotia felt chiropractic to be useful, and 58 percent made referrals to chiropractors, only 10 percent admitted knowledge of chiropractic (Goldszmidt, 1995). This lack of knowledge about alternative therapies may partially explain why only 30 percent of patients who use these therapies discuss their use with their medical provider (Eisenberg, 1993). **Another rationalization. The authors imply that if medical doctors knew more about \"alternative\" therapies, they would endorse or make greater use of them. I doubt that. Also, the Eisenberg paper's definition of \"unconventional\" treatment was overbroad, and its survey included methods that were not outside of mainstream medical care (such as exercise, reported by 26%) and some (such as prayer, reported by 25%) for which there was no reason to discuss with a physician. The paper stated that 10% of patients had used chiropractic within the previous month but only 70% of these had seen a chiropractor. The authors didn't explain how patients could use chiropractic without seeing a chiropractor. Nor did they inidcate what percentage of those who did so failed to tell their doctor. Patients who are aware of organized medicine's past hostility toward chiropractors (Getzendaner, 1987) may be especially reluctant to discuss their use of chiropractic with their medical providers. **Organized medicine's campaign to inform doctors about chiropractic deficiencies stopped about 20 years ago because chiropractors filed a series of antitrust lawsuits that made it legally dangerous to continue to do so. The authors are correct that some patients are reluctant to tell their doctors that they are seeing a chiropractor. But this has nothing to do with what the AMA and other groups did in the 1960s and 1970s. The medical profession's perspective on the role of chiropractic is also complicated by the caregiver vs. gatekeeper issue. Although there is now enough scientific evidence to convince many medical physicians that spinal manipulation has a place in managing certain patients, it appears that most medical providers believe that access to chiropractors should be managed by medical gatekeepers, viewing chiropractic as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, medical care. This perspective is reinforced by concern on the part of many medical physicians about the ability of chiropractors to reliably identify and refer patients with potentially serious medical conditions (Curtis, 1992). However, professional liability experience with chiropractic does not suggest that this is a major problem (see Chapter VIII). **Chapter VIII reports that malpractice insurance is cheaper for chiropractors than for medical doctors. Malpractice data say little or nothing about the ability of chiropractors to make appropriate referrals. Most patients who need medical care don't go to chiropractors or need a chiropractor to refer them. As far as I know, no study has attempted to determine whether chiropractors appropriately manage patients who need medical care but have not seen a physician (patients, for example, who have back pain due to a tumor rather than muscle strain). In fact, some chiropractors are functioning in supplemental roles even in multidisciplinary settings, without being \"gate kept\" (Triano, 1994). **Although no survey has been published, I believe that the chiropractors in reputable medical facilities tend to be more clear-thinking and medically oriented than average. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the third potential role of chiropractors, as members of interdisciplinary primary health care teams, has so far largely been ignored by the medical profession. However, such an approach is receiving increasing attention from the government and from academia, as evidenced by education and training efforts funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which awarded chiropractic colleges contracts pertaining to rural and geriatric practice. **I am not aware of the extent to which this is being done or the politics invlved in the awarding of the grants. It would be interesting to know the numbers involved. This report seems to prefer general statements such as \"increasing attention,\" which may sound more impressive than small numbers. The potential for chiropractors to be involved in interdisciplinary primary care in rural settings (Hawk, 1996b) and in primary, secondary, and tertiary capacities within multidisciplinary spine centers have been the subject of discussion in the chiropractic literature (Triano, 1994, 1995). 4. The Third-Party Payer and Managed Care Perspective In recent years, the insurance industry has made a variety of chiropractic benefits available (see Chapter VI). This development has been influenced by market demand from subscribers, legislation regarding insurance equality, and pressure from chiropractic trade organizations. All providers whose services are covered by insurance, including chiropractors, have had to deal with the realities of managed care delivery systems that have imposed greater competition, oversight, and accountability (Hansen, 1995). These changes and their impact on chiropractors are discussed in Section C below. Because much of the evolution in managed care stemmed from staff and group model HMOs, chiropractic inclusion has not been a central part of most plans, perhaps due to the limited experience with chiropractors in such settings. **More likely due to chiriopractic's generally poor reputation among insurance executives. The model of primary care gatekeepers traditionally used in HMOs has aimed to exclude delivery of services from providers outside of the plans. Medical physician responsibility for case-management decisions, the limited data on cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care, and the low visibility of chiropractors in medical settings were additional factors that have precluded consideration of an increased role for chiropractic. Thus, the changes taking place in health delivery structures have placed chiropractors at risk of being shut out of reimbursement systems, if not by design, then through benign neglect. Some experts see a challenging opportunity for chiropractic in this environment. Commentators point to a growing understanding of the popularity of \"alternative/complementary\" medicine (e.g., Eisenberg, 1993), the money already being spent on chiropractic care (Stano, 1992, 1996), the growing legitimacy of spinal manipulation (Bigos, 1994), the high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the United States (Deyo, 1991), and a new emphasis on pragmatic patient outcomes as reasons why chiropractic may be expected to thrive in the coming years (Coile, 1995a, 1995b). In fact, many managed care organizations are beginning to use chiropractors through in-house positions or via subcontracts with chiropractic networks (Simpson, 1996). **Any arrangement that limits the total number of covered visits will dent the incomes of chiropractors who try to keep their patients coming back indefinitely for \"maintenance care.\" Chiropractors are used alone or in combination with physical therapists, for the evaluation and management of musculoskeletal problems (Coile, 1995a). B. Interprofessional Relations In contrast to professions that train and practice within the same context and often within the same institutions, chiropractic's historical development as a separate and distinct profession has required that chiropractors approach interprofessional relations from outside the context of the health care mainstream (Mootz, 1995a). Chiropractic's integration into the health care system has likely been impeded by its isolation from other professions in clinical settings, academic institutions, research, professional organizations, government, and the insurance industry. 1. Professional Isolation from the Health Care Mainstream A central premise of chiropractic, which emphasizes the therapeutic importance of the body's inherent healing abilities, is in conflict with many traditional biomedical views, which have focused on counteracting external causes of disease (Coulehan, 1985; Coulter, 1983; Cobb, weasel-worded description. Chiropractic's central premise is delusional, Medical science has focused both on internal and external causes. However, what began in 1895 as a difference in theory eventually resulted in the evolution of two distinct approaches to patient care (Coulter, 1983). The differences between the allopathic and chiropractic approaches were intensified by the antipathy of organized medicine toward chiropractic, which for many years excluded chiropractic from every aspect of the American health care system, including professional educational institutions, government policy, and funding opportunities (Willis, 1984). This isolation fostered professional independence and justified an anti-intellectual attitude among some chiropractors (Keating, 1989). **Are the authors suggesting that the medical profession is responsible for the perpetuation of chiropractic delusions? Chiropractic developed an office-based practice model due in large part to its isolation from the medical establishment and exclusion from hospital-based care (Keating, 1989). This isolation has also affected chiropractic education in that students are not afforded exposure to a broad spectrum of clinical conditions (Keating, 1989; Baer, 1984). **It would be interesting to know why the authors think chiropractic students should be exposed to a broad spectrum of clinical conditions. They certainly can't treat them. Additionally, a lack of access to a university-style research tradition and to government funding has impeded scientific development within the profession. **Of course, the biggest impediment to chiropractic research has been lack of interest in doing research. Chiropractic is best known for its primary treatment mode, manual manipulation of the spine (Shekelle, 1992; Coulehan, 1985; Cobb, 1977). Although a variety of natural and conservative interventions are used by chiropractors, the exclusion of drugs and surgery is a significant factor in separating the chiropractic profession from mainstream health professions. In fact, chiropractors are the only doctors licensed in all 50 States diagnosing and treating physical illnesses who do not use drugs or surgery. Chiropractic practice, developing outside the medical mainstream, is more \"client-dependent\" than \"colleague-dependent\" (Wardwell, 1988; Keating, 1989). Because chiropractors have traditionally received new patients through personal contacts and non-medical referral sources, they often perceive that they have a stronger sense of alliance with patients than with other health professionals. 2. Interprofessional Relations in Clinical Settings As the profession has become increasingly integrated into the health care system, interprofessional contact in clinical settings has also increased, frequently by patient request. This usually involves simple referrals, but occasionally includes multi- or interdisciplinary arrangements (Triano, 1994). Although awareness of chiropractic remains limited among other health professions, patient requests, in addition to the increasing evidence for efficacy and patient satisfaction, may prompt medical and other practitioners to view chiropractic more favorably (Cherkin, 1992). However, while nearly all chiropractors (99-100 percent) report they routinely refer patients to medical practitioners (Mootz, 1994), only about 50-60 percent of medical providers refer patients to chiropractic physicians (Cherkin; 1989, Mootz, 1994). **I doubt that 50-60% of medical providers refer to chiropractors. The Mootz report was based on a questionnaire distributed at a meeting of the American Back Society, whose attendees were presumably much more interested than the average physician in manipulative treatment. Of 41 medical doctors who responded, 48% of said they never referred to chiropractors. I have not read Cherkin's paper, but the abstract states that 57% of family physicians in the State of Washington who responded to a questionnaire said they had \"encouraged patients to see a chiropractor.\" I am uncertain whether that is the same thing as a referral. 3. Interprofessional Relations in Academic and Research Settings The historical antecedents of chiropractic relationships to other health professions and the scientific community must be acknowledged in any discussion of current interprofessional relations. Until 1980, the American Medical Association's (AMA) code of ethics expressly forbade any professional association with chiropractors (Wolinsky, 1994). In 1969, the American Public Health Association adopted a policy that urged that, \". . . state legislatures and health agencies not include chiropractors . . under state health programs\" (APHA Policy 6903). It was not until 1983 that the APHA instituted a new policy, which recognized spinal manipulation as safe, and effective for certain neuromusculoskeletal disorders (APHA Policy 8331). The effect of these initially negative pronouncements and policies from such august bodies of health professionals had the effect of further isolating chiropractors from mainstream clinical, professional, and scientific settings. Almost all chiropractic training takes place in privately supported, freestanding institutions designed expressly for that purpose. Very few chiropractors can be found in nonchiropractic academic settings, although this is gradually changing. **The phrase \"gradually changing\" is a meaningless without knowing the numbers involved. Although most individuals end their formal education with a chiropractic degree, a small group pursues additional education, in public health, medicine, or other disciplines. These chiropractors have had important beneficial effects on the relationship between chiropractors and other professions. Many chiropractors are authors or co-authors with other health providers on a variety of topics and are beginning to publish in mainstream scientific journals as well as in the peer-reviewed chiropractic literature. **How many is \"many\"? Have there been more than ten? I think that most of the articles have been generated by the handful of chiropractors associated with RAND. Greater collaboration with researchers in other fields is also occurring (Mootz, 1995a). Established scientific journal and textbook publishers have discovered that chiropractic is a significant professional market. There are now at least eight peer-reviewed journals competing for chiropractic-related readership. All have editorial boards that include other health professionals. The Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT), established in 1976, is the profession's leading research vehicle and draws submissions and readership from scientific and clinical fields beyond chiropractic. **Fewer than 10% of chiropractors subscribe to JMPT, which strongly suggests that chiropractic journals have very little influence on chiropractic practices. It is indexed in a number of databases, including Index Medicus and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Four of the profession's other scholarly journals (Topics in Clinical Chiropractic, Chiropractic Technique, Chiropractic History, and the Journal of Chiropractic Humanities) are also indexed in CINAHL. Many major textbook publishers have commissioned chiropractic-related books, frequently with chapters contributed by other health professionals. Some of these have wide distribution beyond the chiropractic market and are available in medical bookstores. **Again, how many are \"many\" and \"some.\" There are a small number of organizations that fund or otherwise contribute to chiropractic research in the United States (see Chapter IX). Each of these maintains a proposal review board consisting of scientists and providers from a variety of backgrounds. From initial research funding by the Veterans' Administration to researchers at National College of Chiropractic through recent chiropractic project grants from the National Institutes of Health, the chiropractic research enterprise has seen steady growth. Multidisciplinary panels have been convened and funded by both private (the RAND corporation) and public sources (Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) to arrive at clinical consensus on the appropriateness of spinal manipulation for low back pain (Shekelle, 1991; Bigos, 1994), manipulation of the cervical spine (Coulter, 1995), and headache (AHCPR, in progress). The credibility of the RAND studies has facilitated improved communication between chiropractors and other health professionals. Interdisciplinary research efforts have begun at several major universities, often in collaboration with chiropractic institutions. One of the most visible efforts in recent years involves a research program administered by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Health Professions. The grants and contracts recently awarded to four chiropractic colleges required medical collaboration (Bureau of Health Professions, 1995) In 1989, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) funded the Back Pain Outcome Assessment Team (BOAT), which included chiropractors on the advisory committee (Deyo, 1990). Chiropractors have also participated in a related project by BOAT investigators comparing chiropractic care with a physical therapy program emphasizing self care for low back pain. AHCPR has also awarded a large grant to UCLA to conduct a comparative study of chiropractic care in an HMO setting, with chiropractors closely involved with the design and conduct of the project. The Armed Forces of the United States recently agreed to conduct a pilot study of the utility of chiropractic care as part of health care provided to active military personnel and their families. Chiropractors have been central to the design and execution of this study. A small number of chiropractors serve as peer-reviewers and advisers for the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the U.S. Department of Defense, where they interact with other health providers and scientists in appropriate scholarly tasks. 4. Health Professional / Scientific Organizations There has been a Chiropractic Special Primary Interest Group (SPIG) in the American Public Health Association since 1983 with membership ranging between 200 and 700. In 1995, the APHA Board of Governors voted to admit the SPIG into full section status with voting privileges and agency funding. This provided official recognition for chiropractic and cleared the way for full cooperation and collaboration on an equal basis with other health professions represented at APHA. Many chiropractors also work within the Radiological Health, Gerontological Health, and Occupational Health & Safety Sections of the APHA. Eight chiropractic colleges and both national associations are APHA agency members. Since 1985, the Chiropractic SPIG has consistently sponsored multiple scientific paper sessions at the annual meeting. The sessions attract co-sponsorships with other Sections, nonchiropractic paper presentations, and a multidisciplinary audience. **I attended an SPIG session in 1994. Nearly everyone in the audience was a chiropractor. Chiropractic members of APHA have served on the Governing Council and on advisory committees and have been active in public health policymaking efforts. Chiropractors are also members and officers in a wide variety of health profession organizations and groups. For example, about 25 percent of the membership of the American Back Society are chiropractors. Chiropractors have also been active in the North American Spine Society, the American Society of Biomechanics, the International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine, the American Academy of Pain Management, the North American Primary Care Research Group, National Association of Medical Minority Educators, the American College of Sports Medicine, Society for Medical Decision Making, the American Public Health Association, and the Silicon Valley Ergonomics Institute. C. Accountable Delivery Settings and Chiropractic 1. Impact of Practice Accountability on Chiropractors Changes in Delivery and Reimbursement The health care delivery system has undergone dramatic changes during the 1980's and 90's (Coile, 1993). Many of the key changes in health care delivery and reimbursement impacting chiropractic practice are outlined in Table 16. Most chiropractic practices have traditionally been set in individual offices operating under a fee-for-service system based on customary prevailing and reasonable reimbursement practices. Political and public sector concern over access to services and the plight of the un- and underinsured has drawn attention to general health care financing and delivery reforms. Although massive federally mandated reforms are not likely in the near future, several revisions have taken place in the reimbursement and delivery of health services that directly affect how all providers function. |Traditional Practices||New Trends| | || | Determination of physician reimbursement levels has traditionally been based on actuarial review of customary billing practices. In 1992, the Health Care Financing Administration implemented a resource-based relative value scale system that quantitatively assessed physician work, practice overhead, and malpractice risk for every procedure that physicians perform (Hsiao, 1992a). Prior to 1994, however, no work on valuation of chiropractic services for the purpose of reimbursement had been done along the lines required by the Health Care Financing Administration for other clinical procedures (Kirschner, 1997; Hsiao, 1992b). A few proprietary studies and recommendations for \"best-fit\" billing practices have existed that were based on informal estimation of which existing billing code might best fit chiropractic procedures (ACA, 1993; Olsen, 1993). Recently, several qualitative and quantitative reports have begun to appear in the chiropractic literature in this area (Mootz, 1995b, 1995c, 1996; Dobson, 1995; Hess, 1997). Stimulated by concerns about large variations in how health care services are utilized, the Federal government took the lead in attempting to more formally assess what science says about clinical tests and procedures by developing evidence-based guidelines for patients and providers (Hansen, 1994a). In 1989 the U.S. Congress established and charged a new Federal agency, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), with the review and synthesis of scientific evidence on specific clinical procedures, which has resulted in the publication of evidence- and consensus-based practice guidelines. Private sector insurers, faced with increased competition from managed care organizations, have also taken greater interest in the delivery end of health care. Due in part to rapid increases in premium costs, innovative delivery and financial risk-sharing insurance products dramatically increased managed care organization's market share with employer-sponsored health benefits programs (Hirschman, 1994; Coile, 1995a). Changes in reimbursement practices, development of practice guidelines, and the rise of managed care delivery systems have had significant impact on practicing physicians' incomes and practice patterns. The result has placed greater accountability on providers, including chiropractors, and the chiropractic profession has responded to these changes with the development of their own managed care organizations, practice guidelines, and health services research initiatives (Mootz, 1995a). Practice Inventories, Parameters, Guidelines, and Technology Assessments Perhaps as a byproduct of chiropractic's long-standing \"outsider\" status, there has been a great deal of uncertainty and misunderstanding among policymakers, health purchasers, and various providers regarding what chiropractors actually do. **One reason for this is that most things chiropractors do have not been standardized. Most chiropractors have little idea what is going on in the offices of most of their colleagues. In addition, practice variation (as much of a problem in chiropractic as it is in other specialties) may have contributed to inaccurate assumptions regarding its value. **\"As much of a problem in chiropractic as it is in other specialties.\" What crap! The problem is vastly greater among chiropractors than it is among any other type of health practioner. As chiropractic sages have noted, \"For every chiropractor there is an equal and opposite chiropractor.\" These circumstances, in addition to system-wide trends toward increased practitioner accountability, have stimulated the chiropractic profession to begin to inventory practice methods, define practice parameters, and develop some general practice guidelines (Bergmann, 1990; Haldeman, 1993; Hansen, 1994a). In addition, numerous condition-specific critical care pathways have begun to be published in the chiropractic literature (Hansen, 1994a; Hansen, 1994b). Chapter VIII, Section E, \"Practice, Guidelines, Clinical Pathways, and Technology Assessments in Chiropractic,\" provides a more detailed review of key initiatives to date. As in other health care fields, published chiropractic practice guidelines have been met with mixed responses ranging from endorsement and adoption to controversy and rejection. **Chiropractic guidelines are not similar to medical guidelines, and the responses to them are very different. Although they represent a step in the right direction, they actually give very little guidance. One set has been published by the more modern-thinking chiropractors and another has been published by \"straight\" (subluxation-based) chiropractors. In response to the increasing interest on the part of health care purchasers and policymakers to better understand and rationalize clinical decisionmaking, chiropractors have developed expert and community-based physician practice guidelines (Hansen, 1994a; Henderson, 1994). **Hansen's book chapter describes how medical audit processes can be applied to chiropractors. It is unclear whether they can actually influence what chiropractors do. Further, chiropractors are increasingly involved in multidisciplinary practices and in managed care organizations. In fact, chiropractors have established their own managed care organizations, mostly in the form of independent practice associations (IPAs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and are gaining market share (Coile, 1995b). Table 17 summarizes several key managed care options that currently exist for chiropractors. |Sub-contract reduced fee for service provider: IPA receives capitated contract from purchaser and manages chiropractic care with subcontracts with individual providers. This is the most common type of chiropractic MCO arrangement.| |Capitated contract provider: Individual DC receives monthly or annual payment adjusted for number of covered lives in contract providing all needed chiropractic services to plan members who present for care.| |Salaried position in HMO/clinic: DC is hired as salaried employee of clinic providing all care needed. Very few currently in place but popularity with MCOs seems likely to increase as potential cost containment incentive.| McElheran and Sollecito (1994) have offered guidance for providers to identify and revise clinical staffing procedures, and documentation to meet the increased requirements for accountability and efficiency in chiropractic practice (Table 18). One of the aims of managed care is to facilitate appropriate care, which by nature may involve collaborative and multidisciplinary patient management. Strategies and examples of truly integrated interdisciplinary care using explicitly developed evidence and consensus-based protocols are beginning to appear (Triano, 1994). 2. Quality Management Initiatives Although a focus on quality and customer service has been a central component of business and industry since World War II, quality management initiatives are a relatively recent phenomenon within health care in general and within chiropractic in particular (Hansen, 1995). Attributes of quality in health care include \"technical\" considerations such as provider credentialling, nature of facilities, ratios of providers to patient populations, and utilization experience. Less technical attributes of health service quality such as patient satisfaction, ease of access to care, and patient involvement in care planning are also viewed as important (Hansen, 1995). In recent years, discussions of quality in chiropractic care have begun to appear in the chiropractic literature (Hansen, 1995; Vear, 1992; Ianelli, 1995; McElheran, 1994; Nelson, 1994). With increasing inclusion of chiropractic services in managed care settings, chiropractic networks (practice associations and preferred provider organizations) are being required to meet accreditation standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the National Commission on Quality Assurance (NCQA) in order to receive capitated contract dollars. These organizations require adherence to various quality standards even down to the individual clinic and doctors' office settings (JCAHO, 1994; O'Kane, 1993). As a result, individual chiropractors are beginning to be held accountable to multiple, quantifiable measures of quality in order to become or remain affiliated with preferred provider networks. **Since quantitivate measures of chiropractic quality are rare (if they exist at all), chiropractic leaders are very worried about this trend. In some states, chiropractors are using lawsuits and legislative efforts to try to force managed-care companies to admit them. |Facility: Maintain professional appearance, clean and accessible furnishings, impaired patient access, record storage and retrieval that permits access and confidentiality, documented emergency protocol, equipment certification (e.g., x-ray), etc. | Staff: Training in managed care protocols, interdisciplinary protocols, patient relations, billing procedures, reporting requirements. Care appropriateness: Emphasis on clinical effectiveness, careful use of treatment resources, timely referral of nonresponders, consideration of available clinical guidelines. Entrance forms: Legible, understandable paperwork that provides adequate insight into patient's past history, condition chronicity, baseline status, nature of complaints, informed consent, etc. Outcomes assessment instruments: Regular use of self-report instrument that can document patient progress in a meaningful fashion. Record keeping: Standardized and legible record keeping formats, which clearly document patient progress, care, and diagnostics provided. Clinical algorithms: Incorporation of algorithmically driven and evidence-based critical care pathways as a reference point to assess individual patient responses. Outcomes management: Regular assessment of patient progress compared to baseline with both clinical and self-reporting instruments. Source: Adapted from McElheran L, Sollecito P. Delivering quality chiropractic care in a managed care setting. Top Clin Chiropr 1994;1(4):30-39. D. Chiropractic Experience in Health Policy and Health Administration Positions 1. Public Sector Positions There are numerous reports in the chiropractic literature that exemplify efforts of the chiropractic profession to contribute to public health policy (Mootz, 1995d; 1995a; Haas, 1996). **Chiropractors might gain greater acceptance if they embraced and promoted immunization and fluoridation. However, opportunities for employment in State and Federal agencies within the public health sector have been limited. This in part has been due to past practices by medical and public health trade organizations (e.g., AMA, APHA), which maintained prohibitions against interactions with chiropractors and encouraged that \"state legislatures and health agencies not include chiropractors under state health programs\" (Haas, 1996; Wardwell, 1992). The past two decades have seen significant changes in chiropractic's status, including a successful anti-trust suit against the AMA (Getzendaner, 1987), along with a revision of the AMA's code of ethics related to working with chiropractors and the reversal of the APHA's stand on chiropractic (Baird, 1996). The World Health Organization also has established official relations with the chiropractic profession through the admission of the World Federation of Chiropractic as an affiliated nongovernmental organization. Most jurisdictions appoint chiropractors to serve on examining, licensing, quality assurance, and/or disciplinary boards to ensure competency and to regulate practice (Haas, 1996). Positions for chiropractors also exist on industrial insurance boards, health care commissions, and staffs of medical directors, among others (Mootz, 1995a). Additionally, chiropractors have served as reviewers and consultants for the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the Health Services Resource Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Health Care Financing Administration (Mootz, 1995a; Haas, 1996). Given the large number of physician visits for musculoskeletal conditions, particularly low back pain (Cunningham, 1984; Deyo, 1987), along with chiropractors' interest and expertise in this area, and the growing evidence for the effectiveness of their treatment, it is reasonable to anticipate greater involvement of chiropractors in the policymaking and public health positions in the future. Chiropractors have pursued postgraduate training in public health (Mootz, 1995a) and proposals have been made to increase training opportunities within chiropractic schools for career options in health services research and public health (Mootz, 1995d). Several such individuals have received appointments at major universities and \"think tanks\" around the world. 2. Private Sector Positions Positions for chiropractors as claims consultants, medical directors, and in health administration positions have existed in the private sector for many years, although no formal inventory of such positions has ever been undertaken (Haas, 1996; Mootz, 1995a). Many of the chiropractic practice parameters, guidelines, and technology assessment efforts discussed previously have been stimulated by public policy initiatives, private sector insurers, and managed care organizations' needs (Hansen, 1995; 1994a). As a result, involvement of chiropractors in this area may continue to References American Chiropractic Association. Recommendations for Describing Chiropractic Services Using CPT-93.

The Bigos report, published by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), states that spinal manipulation may be effective against acute low-back pain. That conclusion was based primarily on research done by medical doctors and physical therapists, not chiropractors. It has been estimated that chiropractors administer over 90% of the manipulative treatment in the U.S. However, the AHCPR report did not \"recognize chiropractic.\" In fact, the only places where \"chiropractic\" and \"chiropractors\" are mentioned in the body of the report are in the passages about the make-up of the AHCPR expert panel. I stress this point because I do not believe that most people who consult chiropractors get appropriate treatment. In the areas of training, practice, and research, chiropractic has emerged from the periphery of the health care system and is playing an increasingly important role in discussions of health care policy. **It might be interesting to examine the basis for this statement. This monograph documents the dramatic growth of the chiropractic profession, which now represents the third largest group of doctoral-level health professionals in the United States after medical doctors and dentists. By the year 2010, it is expected that there will be more than 100,000 practicing chiropractors, about 1 chiropractor for every 6 medical doctors (Cooper, 1996). Recent studies have found that about 7 percent of Americans had visited a chiropractor in the prior year (Eisenberg, 1993) and that chiropractic is one of the most popular sources of care for chronic back pain (Murt, 1986). Although most chiropractors practice in metropolitan areas, a substantial fraction practice in small towns and rural areas (Goertz, 1996). All 16 chiropractic colleges in the United States are now accredited and monitored by the federally recognized Council on Chiropractic Education. Chiropractic students receive about the same number of total hours of education as medical students, although the former obtain less than half as many hours of education in clinical settings (Coulter, submitted). **The authors of this report have scrupulously avoided discussing the quality of chiropractic education \u2014 whether chiropractic students receive sufficient training to practice ethically and scientifically. Chiropractors have been licensed to practice in all 50 States and the District of Columbia for more than 20 years. Licensing boards in all States require successful completion of the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners' basic science examination and almost all States also require passing scores on clinical sciences and clinical competency examinations. All but 5 States require at least minimal continuing education to maintain or renew a license. Although the scope of practice for chiropractic varies by State and most States administer their own examination, expanded and enhanced competency assessment by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners is bringing more standardization to chiropractic licensure. More than 80 percent of American workers in conventional insurance plans, preferred provider organizations, and point-of-service plans now have health insurance that covers at least part of the cost of chiropractic care (Jensen, in press). **A major reason for this is that chiropractors have obtained state laws to force many insurance plans to cover them. It is only in health maintenance organizations that a majority of enrollees still lack chiropractic coverage. **That's because they are permitted to base their decisions on their assessment of cost-effectiveness. Even though most employer plans are no longer mandated to cover chiropractic (as they had been in the early 1980s), most plans have chosen to continue to include chiropractic benefits. In addition, nearly all workers' compensation systems, personal injury protection insurance, and Medicare cover chiropractic services. Chiropractors are beginning to be integrated into mainstream activities of the health care system. There is a small, but growing number of chiropractors practicing in collaboration with medical doctors and other health professionals, and medical referrals to chiropractors are becoming more common. As chiropractic services have moved into the mainstream of health services, it has been necessary for the profession to develop measures to ensure accountability. Chiropractic has responded by developing a variety of practice guidelines, parameters, and technologies to improve practice and permit evaluation of its quality. **That's true, but the practice guidelines are not comparable to those in medical practice. The most prominent document (the \"Mercy Guidelines\") has been rejected by straight ( [\"subluxation\"](https://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosub.html)-based) chiropractors, who responded by producing subluxation-based guidelines of their own. Futhermore, both sets of guidelines are vague, give little guidance, and are ignored in day-to-dat chiropractic practice. Chiropractors have also begun to participate in policy and research roles. For many years, chiropractors have served as claims consultants and health administrators. Some now hold positions on industrial insurance boards, health care commissions, and on the staffs of medical directors. A small but growing number of chiropractors have pursued postgraduate training in public health, some entering careers in research. **It would be interesting to know the actual numbers. Recent major studies of the appropriateness and effectiveness of spinal manipulation have included chiropractors as co-investigators or advisers. Although hampered by a lack of research training and research infrastructure, some in the profession have recognized the importance of evidence-based research and are currently undertaking a major effort to identify an agenda for chiropractic research in the areas of basic science, clinical research, education, health services, and outcomes research (Hawk, 1997). There is growing evidence for the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic's primary treatment technique, spinal manipulation, at least for low back pain. The risk of a serious complication following manipulation of the lower back appears to be very low (Shekelle, 1992). Complications associated with neck manipulation are also extremely rare, but may be more common and severe than lower back complications (Hurwitz, 1996). Recent syntheses of the literature have concluded that spinal manipulation appears to be effective for at least some types of low back pain ( [Koes, 1996](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9112710&dopt=Abstract); Shekelle, 1992), although it is not known which, if any, of the numerous manipulative techniques employed by chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists, and allopathic physicians are superior. **Compare the above sentence with the actual conclusions of the Koes report: The efficacy of spinal manipulation for patients with acute or chronic low back pain has not been demonstrated with sound randomized clinical trials. There certainly are indications that manipulation might be effective in some subgroups of patients with low back pain. These impressions justify additional research efforts on this topic. Methodologic quality remains a critical aspect that should be dealt with in future studies. In addition, patients seeking care for back pain from chiropractors tend to be more satisfied than patients treated by medical doctors (Cherkin, 1989; Carey, 1995; Kane, 1974). However, studies have yet to adequately determine if chiropractic care is more cost-effective than medical care for back pain. Furthermore, the value of spinal manipulation for neck pain and headache or for other neuromusculoskeletal problems is not as clear, as fewer scientifically rigorous studies have been published on these topics. **The previous two sentences are refreshingly correct. Most chiropractors and chiropractic organizations who comment on these matters claim that chiropractic care has been proven to be more cost-effective. Recent guidelines published by the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) concluded that spinal manipulation was one of only three treatments for acute low back pain for which there was at least moderate research-based evidence of effectiveness (Bigos, 1994). Commonly used back pain treatments such as muscle relaxants and various forms of physical therapy lacked even moderate amounts of evidence, largely due to the absence of research. The AHCPR guidelines, in conjunction with appropriateness criteria for the use of spinal manipulation for low back pain (as well as neck pain and headache) developed by multidisciplinary expert panels, have legitimized the use of spinal manipulation as a relatively safe and effective treatment for back pain (Bigos, 1994; Shekelle, 1991; Coulter, 1995). **Once again, this does not necessarily mean that chiropractors are treating their patients appropriately. Through persistent efforts at self-improvement and successful legal and legislative initiatives challenging organized medicine's antichiropractic stance, the chiropractic profession has begun to resemble the more mainstream health care professions in many respects. The metamorphosis from fringe to mainstream is not quite complete but appears inevitable. The main question is no longer, \"Will chiropractors enter the mainstream of healthcare?\" but \"What role will chiropractors play in the health care system of tomorrow?\" The answer to this question will be determined by the complex interplay of decisions and actions made by policymakers and by the chiropractic profession itself. **Chiropractors love to pat themselves on the back. But many chiropractic leaders are worried that managed care plans will freeze them out unless they can get laws passed to protect them. Because the information necessary to make informed decisions about many important issues is often unavailable, there is a clear need for focused research. Priorities for policy-relevant research concerning the role of chiropractic are discussed in the following section. B. Research Priorities Before policymakers can make informed decisions about the most appropriate role for chiropractic within the system of health care, there is a need for research that more completely answers questions about effectiveness, cost, and safety. These issues are interrelated and all are likely to be affected by the way in which chiropractic is integrated into the broader health care system. Important priorities for research are listed in Table 29 and discussed below. |Utilization and delivery options | |Effectiveness | 1. Effectiveness Despite the large number of randomized trials evaluating spinal manipulation for low back pain, critical reviews have generally lamented the poor quality of most of these studies and the inability to generalize the findings to current manipulative practice (Koes, 1991 and 1996; Shekelle, 1992). Although the most thorough reviews have concluded that there is evidence that spinal manipulation is effective for some patients with low back pain, it remains unclear which subsets of patients are most or least likely to benefit or which forms of manipulative care are most useful. As with many other interventions for low back pain, there remains a need for high quality studies to evaluate the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for specific patient populations, defined in terms of their history, presenting complaints, age (e.g., children or the elderly), and neurological findings. Studies of spinal manipulation for patients with sciatica and with chronic and recurrent back problems would be especially useful. Future studies will be particularly valuable if they compare different types of spinal manipulation with physical treatments that are already in common use, such as McKenzie physical therapy and massage. Direct comparisons of chiropractic with other conservative approaches such as encouraging return to normal activity and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs would also be helpful. Research on the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for other musculoskeletal problems such as neck pain and headache is even more limited and inconclusive than that for low back pain. Because chiropractors commonly treat patients with these conditions, research in this area should be considered a high priority. Although the evidence suggests that chiropractors rarely treat nonmusculoskeletal conditions (e.g., otitis media, hypertension, dysmenorrhea) (Hurwitz, in press), these conditions fall within the scope of chiropractic practice in many States and are believed by some chiropractors to respond to spinal manipulation, other manual methods, or other drugless approaches within a chiropractor's practice scope. There is a clear need for research to determine if chiropractic methods are effective for these problems. **This assumes that if chiropractic methods were found to be ineffective against ear infections and high blood pressure, chiropractors would stop doing them. The extent to which chiropractors would pay attention to such research might be an interesting area to study. In addition to treating patients with specific problems, some chiropractors attempt to prevent recurrences of a problem (e.g., low back pain), to prevent the development of other illnesses, or to enhance general health. It is not known if such prevention-oriented activities are in common use. Because they are not covered by health insurance, preventive care, health enhancement, or \"maintenance\" visits may represent only a small fraction of most chiropractors' practices. **I believe that \"maintenance\" \u2014 in which chiropractors look for and correct \"subluxations\" \u2014 represents a very large percentage of chiropractic' income. It certainly does for some chiropractors. Many practice builders offer to teach how to have a \"cash only\" practice. However, if chiropractors are to function in primary care roles, as has been suggested by some observers inside and outside of the profession, it will be important for research to determine if chiropractic approaches can in fact prevent recurrences of musculoskeletal problems, prevent illness, or enhance health. **The notion that chiropractors can function as primary-care providers is absurd. And so are the claims that spinal adjustments can prevent illness or enhance health. 2. Cost and Cost-Effectiveness In addition to the evidence indicating that spinal manipulation is effective for some patients with low back pain, there is ample evidence that patients who choose chiropractic care find it very satisfying (Cherkin, 1989; Carey, 1995; Kane, 1974). However, these benefits come at a cost and it is not yet clear if chiropractic care is more cost-effective than the various forms of conventional medical care (e.g., medications, physical therapy, exercise programs) or alternative care (e.g., massage or acupuncture) used to treat back pain. **Another refreshingly correct observation. Most chiropractors and chiropractic organizations who comment on these matters claim that chiropractic care has been proven to be more cost-effective. It is also not known how many manipulative treatments are necessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes. For example, it may be that a regimen of 5 chiropractic treatments per episode of back pain is as effective as a regimen of 10 treatments, and therefore twice as cost-effective. Determining the relative cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care compared with other commonly used treatments for low back pain and the number of chiropractic treatments necessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes should be considered high priorities for future research. Finally, whether chiropractic care is used in addition to or in place of medical care is still not clear. The answer to this question will depend in part on if and how chiropractic services are integrated into a particular system of health care. For example, if access to chiropractic services requires an initial evaluation and referral by a medical doctor, this might increase the number of physician visits over the number that would have occurred had direct access to chiropractic been an option. If patients were granted equal access to chiropractic and physical therapy, however, one might expect that increased use of chiropractic would be accompanied by decreased use of physical therapy. 3. Safety Although available evidence suggests that the risk of a serious complication following spinal manipulation is very low, this information is based on collections of published case reports (Assendelft, 1996; Shekelle, 1992). **Take a moment to compare the above sentence to the [full abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8642364&dopt=Abstract) of the Assendelft report. Because many complications attributable to spinal manipulation might never be reported, estimates of complication rates based on case reports will inevitably underestimate the true incidence. However, the estimated risk of complications following lumbar manipulation is so low that even if there were 100 times as many serious complications as reported, the true risk would still be very small. Because the risks of cervical manipulation appear to be higher and more devastating, however, it would be helpful if future research could identify subsets of patients at risk of complications from cervical manipulation and determine if there are specific manipulative techniques that should be avoided or modified. **I agree. The Assendelft report recommends against using rotatory manipulation of the neck. It would also be useful if the chiropractic profession would make an effort to curb unnecessary manipulations. These issues are almost never discussed in chiropractic publications. Another safety issue derives from concerns that chiropractors might fail to diagnose patients who have a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. Although the incidence of this problem is unknown, it appears to be more common in the United States than in Canada (Henderson, 1994). Where chiropractors serve in portal of entry roles into the health care system, it will be important for research to determine the extent to which delayed access to urgent medical treatment occurs. C. Key Issues Affecting the Future Role of Chiropractic in the United States A fundamental question confronting both the chiropractic profession and public and private sector health care policy planners centers around how chiropractic should fit into the evolving American health care system. Over the past few decades, the profession has enhanced its image by strengthening its education programs, increasing the quality and quantity of its research, and collaborating with other disciplines in clinical settings (Mootz, 1995a). **How much the quality of patient care has increased is another matter. The profession has also effectively used political, legislative, and legal measures to secure a broader and more integrated role in the health care system (Getzendaner, 1987; Mootz, 1995b; Wardwell, 1992). However, concerns about the ability of chiropractors to play a larger role remain. Although chiropractic and medical students receive a similar number of hours of didactic education, chiropractors still lack the opportunities available to medical doctors in clinical training through clerkship, residencies, and fellowships. **In other words, their education is vastly inferior to that of medical students. Furthermore, the lack of interdisciplinary clinical experiences has impaired the abilities of both chiropractic and medical physicians to learn about what the other has to offer. The personnel, institutional, and financial resources available for chiropractic research are sparse and will need to be enhanced if chiropractic research is to gain credibility in the medical community. **It will take much more than that. I believe that the main thing that influences medical perception of chiropractors is what their patients tell them. Some patients report good results, but others report excessive numbers of visits and exposure to bizarre practices. Recent access to small but significant amounts of Federal funding has allowed several university-based clinical trials involving chiropractors to be initiated (Mootz, 1995a) and has demonstrated the feasibility of collaborative research. The recent effort by the chiropractic profession to identify research priorities and to address the inadequacies of the research infrastructure has the potential to lead to actions that significantly improve the productivity of chiropractic research (Sawyer 1997; Brennan 1997; Nyiendo 1997; Mootz 1997; Adams 1997). There are a variety of perceptions both inside and outside the chiropractic profession regarding chiropractic clinical competency, appropriate scope of practice, determination of appropriateness of care, identity regarding \"primary care\" delivery relationships, operational definitions and models of the \"chiropractic lesion,\" and how to work within and outside of typical medical delivery settings. Chiropractic's future role will be determined by decisions made within the profession, as well as by policy-planning efforts by health care administrators, public and private sector policymakers, and other health care professionals. Key policy issues are summarized in Table 30 and discussed below. |General Health Care Questions Policy Makers Must Address | |Specific Issues Internal to the Chiropractic Profession | |Specific Issues External to the Chiropractic Profession | 1. Issues Within the Chiropractic Profession Professional Clinical Identity For both philosophical and economic reasons, chiropractors have desired to maintain a direct access, \"portal of entry\" role for patients coming into the health care system. Most patients appear to seek chiropractic services for musculoskeletal problems, primarily low back pain (Hurwitz, in press). However, partly because the profession has evolved outside of mainstream medicine, chiropractic has positioned itself not only as an alternative source of health care, but also as a separate profession with a distinct health care philosophy. This has created an identity crisis within chiropractic. The profession is unclear about whether it is a comprehensive, holistic alternative to medicine or a clearly defined musculoskeletal subspecialty. This philosophical quandary is complicated by the advice of external health care observers who have emphasized the need for chiropractors to enhance and maintain an identity as primary care providers in order to remain competitive (Coile, 1995). In fact, chiropractors' practices include several characteristics considered to be consistent with a primary care role. They are directly accessed by patients, frequently coordinate care with other providers, may obtain special studies, develop continuing relationships with patients, and emphasize prevention strategies, especially related to injury prevention (Jamison, 1991; Bowers, 1995). However, because chiropractors do not offer a comprehensive array of medical treatment strategies, advocacy of primary care provider status for chiropractors has been a controversial topic (Nelson, 1993; Bowers, 1995). Some within the profession believe that many chiropractors can function in \"community-oriented\" primary care roles (Bowers, 1995) consistent with the recent Institute of Medicine's updated definition of primary care: \"the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of community\" (Donaldson, 1994). **The key point is the ability to address the majority of health-care needs, which chiropractors certainly cannot do \u2014 any more than a carpenter whose only tool is a hammer is equipped to build an entire house. There are a number of reasons why some chiropractors feel capable of filling such community-oriented \"primary care\" roles, including their training in examination and diagnosis, chiropractic's strong record in risk management and professional liability, and their history of routinely referring patients to medical doctors (Bowers, 1995; Mootz, 1994). Additionally, historic obstacles such as organized medicine's policies that prohibited medical doctors from accepting patients from a chiropractor (Getzendaner, 1987) have caused chiropractors to view themselves as the primary source of care for many of their patients. **Organized medicine's so-called \"prohibited policies\" had very little influence on the relationships between physicians and chiropractors. Flamboyant advertising was far more influential. Thirty years ago, it was very common for chiropractic ads to claim spinal adjustment was effective against the ganut of health problems. I have more than a thousand flamboyant ads in my collection. In fact, advretising of this type was one of the things that triggered my interest in chiropractic. Chiropractic was not mentioned during my medical education. My initial contact was with their advertising. Still, limitations regarding clinical training in multidisciplinary settings, scope of practice, and comprehensiveness of services provided by chiropractors will need to be overcome before those outside the profession will be comfortable with the idea of chiropractors as primary care physicians (Bowers, 1995). **\"Clinical limitations regarding clinical training in comprehensiveness of services\"? Are the authors suggesting that chiropractic's scope is \u2014 or should be \u2014 unlimited? Regardless of one's views about whether or not chiropractors should be considered primary care physicians, it is clear that they possess many of the characteristics of medical specialists. They have a clientele presenting with a narrow range of musculoskeletal health problems and most of their care focuses on mechanical musculoskeletal interventions. This musculoskeletal specialist view of chiropractors poses a hazard for the profession. Specifically, because treatment of musculoskeletal problems often is provided by physical and occupational therapists following referral by a medical doctor, there is a concern that chiropractors may be viewed by some policymakers as a duplication of existing medical management options. However, given that more than 90 percent of billable manipulation services have been provided by chiropractors (Shekelle, 1992), an argument can be made that chiropractors provide a unique service. Because of the fundamental nature of these \"clinical identity\" issues, the chiropractic profession needs to clarify its role and strive to ensure that both training and practice are consistent with that vision. **In other words, if chiropractors represent themselves as specialists in musculoskeletal disorders, they would have to demonstrate that they are more cost-effective than physical therapists, which could be tough to do. Professional Social Identity Due to their historical exclusion from participation in the mainstream of health care delivery, chiropractors have functioned outside of medical referral networks, institutional settings, and multidisciplinary group practices. As a result, they have had to rely on individual patient referrals and marketing efforts to attract patients. Although advertising and marketing are now also commonplace in medicine, medical marketing strategies tend to have an institutional focus on issues of perceived importance to patients (e.g., availability, clinical competence, location), while many chiropractic promotional efforts often seem aimed at vindicating and reinforcing professional philosophies. Some of chiropractic's promotional strategies have misrepresented the evidence, thereby alienating opinion leaders outside the profession and undermining the profession's efforts to improve its credibility and acceptance. **In other words, flamboyant chiropractic ads used to be rampant. The profession is also likely to confront a credibility challenge if its colleges and research foundations, as well as its trade associations, are perceived to be little more than \"special interests.\" In order to be perceived as a community resource rather than a special interest (Mootz, 1996), the profession needs to establish a credible and supportable clinical identity. Marketing and patient education should focus on prevention, wellness, rapid resolution of disorders, and self-reliance for common health problems, perhaps like dentistry has done with dental caries. **It might be interesting to ask what preventive measures chiropractors can focus upon. The profession also needs to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of its care. Cost of care is of primary concern to policy planners and the community at large. Efforts need to be undertaken to determine the types, amounts, and durations of chiropractic care that are most cost-efficient and appropriate for different clinical circumstances. This will require the chiropractic profession to pay increased attention to practice variation. Gaining a better understanding of the causes of variations in practice, determining which of these variations are inappropriate, and finding ways to minimize undesirable variations should become professional priorities. **I certainly agree with this. The top priority should be to stop chiropractors from telling patients to keep coming back when they don't need to do so. The Effect of Spinal Structure on Health Chiropractors have long emphasized the importance of the effect spinal structure can have on human physiology (particularly the nervous system) and the beneficial effects of spinal manipulation (Gatterman, 1995). **Yes, they have. Whether this focus has proven useful is another matter. The idea of a manipulable \"spinal lesion\" is not unique to chiropractic; lay practitioners, osteopathic physicians, and others also advanced a variety of spinal lesion models near the turn of the 20th century (Gatterman, 1995). Historically, chiropractic terminology has characterized a spinal lesion as a \"vertebral subluxation,\" although other terms have become more popular in recent years (e.g., spinal dysfunction, vertebral subluxation complex). Regardless of the syntax used to characterize it, the condition remains poorly defined and is inadequately supported by current research. **In other words, it is bunk. There has been abundant conceptualization about subluxation in the chiropractic literature, but no professional consensus on a particular model and little hard data regarding the reliability and validity of its clinical identification and pathophysiologic impact (Gatterman, 1995; Osterbauer, 1996). **Little hard data? No data. Although chiropractic has functioned successfully without more clarity about the existence and nature of the manipulable lesion, a better understanding of this issue would enhance full acceptance by other health care professionals. In particular, chiropractic researchers should focus on the following aspects of the vertebral subluxation: reliability of its identification as a clinical entity, its prevalence and incidence within healthy and unhealthy populations, its relationships to recovery and function, and refining the pathophysiologic and psychosocial models used to characterize it. the nature or \"subluxations\" \u2014 because some chiropractors view them as physical entities (upon whose nature they may not agree), others think of them in metaphysical terms, and some think somewhere inbetween. To gain acceptance by the scientific community, chiropractors must abandon the subluxation concept entirely. But if they did, they might lose their identity. As summarized by one observer: - Subluxation theory and its trappings constitute a delusional system \u2014 a set of false beliefs held despite abundant evidence that contradicts them. - The diversity afforded by subluxation theory enables chiropractors to maintain what Dr. William T. Jarvis calls \"deniability.\" No matter what aspect of their behavior is criticized, proponents can always claim that the examples given are not representative of the profession as a whole. - If chiropractors disowned their heritage and began thinking and talking the same language as the scientific medical community, chiropractic might not be maintainable as a \"separate and distinct\" form of practice. - If chiropractic discarded subluxation terminology, their Medicare coverage might be jeopardized and the state licensing laws that define the practice of chiropractic in terms of \"subluxations,\" \"nerve energy,\" and the like would have to be rewritten. - If chiropractic schools stopped teaching chiropractic philosophy, their \"true believer\" alumni might get upset and withdraw financial support. - If the more scientifically oriented chiropractors parted company with the rest, the profession would be weakened politically. As things stand now, chiropractic is clinging for dear life to its cultist and pseudoscientific roots while insisting that it has risen Development and Allocation In the past, many chiropractors developed strong collaborative alliances with patients, sympathetic legislators, and key individuals within the legal and labor communities (Mootz, 1996). More recently, chiropractic scientists have begun to collaborate with others in the greater academic and research communities. However, although interdisciplinary clinical relationships are evolving (Triano, 1994), it is still rare for chiropractors to function in medical group settings. Furthermore, unlike medicine, dentistry, and other professions, very little public funding exists for chiropractic research. **No amount of research is likely to remedy the problems discussed elsewhere on Quackwatch. For the most part, chiropractors have had limited influence with several key health care constituencies, including public- and private-sector health policymakers and planners and health care administrators. Their ability to influence actions by health care purchasers and the business community has resulted more from litigation and political pressure than from voluntary policies of these groups. In order for chiropractic to significantly improve its educational and research missions, greater educational and research funding from Government and the private sector will need to be obtained. (The chiropractic profession itself has already devoted extensive resources to training and research and does not appear capable of providing significantly more.) **Perhaps chiropractors should spend more money on research and less on lobbying and campaign contributions to legislators. This will require the profession to initiate and develop strategic alliances with organizations and institutions outside the profession. Continued and expanded collaborative research between chiropractic schools and universities will be important as will establishment of corporate and community partnerships to create endowments and expanded educational and research infrastructures. Finally, because the number of chiropractic researchers is still small (Meeker, 1996), there is an urgent need for more chiropractors to be trained in fields such as public health, epidemiology, health services research, the evaluative clinical sciences, and health administration. Opportunities for both dual degree tracks (e.g., DC-MPH) and post-DC degree training should be expanded. Gaining full acceptance and credibility within the greater academic and research communities may pose some difficulties for chiropractic researchers who have trained in a profession that has, until recently, relied on political advocacy and litigation to accomplish its goals. To maximize their credibility, and therefore their impact on future policies, chiropractic researchers will need to eliminate prior belief and conviction from influencing the results or their reporting. Although investigator bias is a problem in all professions, it presents a particular challenge to the newly emerging group of chiropractic researchers at this point in their profession's evolution. **Excellent point. Responding to \"Customer\" Needs There is a need within the chiropractic profession for a greater appreciation and routine incorporation of accepted, systematic processes for professional prioritization and decisionmaking. Systematic appraisals and syntheses of \"customer\" needs (stakeholding) could help chiropractic institutions and centers improve their internal and external relationships. Systematic incorporation of scientifically derived information into clinical practice remains a particular challenge. Many within the profession have developed strong beliefs about chiropractic's value from anecdotal personal experience alone (Keating, 1987). In some instances, this has led the profession's leadership to assume a naive attitude toward research, i.e., \"Because we already know its value, the role of research is to prove it to others.\" Although such attitudes are not unique to chiropractic physicians (Tanenbaum, 1994), initial efforts to develop evidence-based chiropractic care guidelines and clinical consensus should be expanded. Greater incorporation of quality improvement strategies in chiropractic settings would also be of value. 2. Policy Considerations External to the Chiropractic Profession Only a fraction of commonly used health care procedures (including those used by chiropractors) have clear and consistent scientific evidence to support their use. **Many medical procedures are supported by clear and consistent evidence. No chiropractic procedures have such support. Even when well-designed research studies are available for a given procedure, or a specific application of a procedure, probabilistic findings as typically reported in studies are fundamentally ambiguous as they relate to policy actions (Tanenbaum, 1996). **Yes, to be useful, scientific studies must be interpreted in a rational way. These limitations complicate the efforts of government and private-sector policymakers in making coverage decisions, prioritizing the use of scarce health care resources, and allocating research dollars among many competing demands. Examples of questions policymakers generally must answer to address these issues are listed in Table 30 [above] and discussed below. Several specific policy questions concern insurance coverage. A fundamental issue is whether or not insurers and managed care plans should cover chiropractic services. The chiropractic profession has demonstrated an ability to successfully influence legislation and use the court system to pass and enforce insurance equality laws guaranteeing coverage of a given service without regard to who performs the service. In recent years, managed care plans have restricted access to chiropractic services (as well as to some medical services) through a variety of controversial mechanisms. These approaches seem likely to be met with further legislative and litigation activity on the part of the profession. Market forces (e.g., consumer demand for chiropractic services) are also likely to continue to influence plans' coverage decisions. Individual health plans face a variety of complex decisions concerning which chiropractic services to cover and for which subsets of patients. For example, coverage decisions for some types of conditions and services (e.g., spinal manipulation for low back pain or whiplash injuries) may be more readily amenable to policy actions than coverage decisions involving other services (e.g., preventive services). **Again, what preventive services do chiropractors perform? The populations for which chiropractic care is already commonly provided will also influence demand and appropriateness concerns. For example, the use of chiropractic services for children remains controversial and will likely require better research data and practice guidelines for making future coverage decisions. **I think it is already clear that chiropractors offer little or nothing of value to children. In addition, although Medicare covers spinal manipulation as long as a physical examination and x-ray precede it, Medicare has not reimbursed chiropractors for physical examinations or x-rays. Congress recently mandated elimination of the x-ray requirement beginning in the year 2000, but issues remain concerning which chiropractic services Medicare will reimburse. How chiropractic services are documented and reported for reimbursement, utilization review, and auditing purposes will also require greater clarification. On the surface, some issues may be quite straightforward, but because scope of practice can vary by jurisdiction, individual States may need to respond differently. In dealing with policy issues relating to chiropractic, policymakers may be tempted to defer decisions until such time as definitive research becomes available. In the past, excluding chiropractic was frequently justified by citing an absence of supporting evidence. In fact, the effectiveness of the primary intervention used by chiropractors, spinal manipulation, has been well studied and found to be effective for some subsets of patients with low back pain. **This refers to the fact that manipulation may help low-back pain and that chiropractors do most of the manipulation. However, research has yet to demonstrate that the average chiropractor renders appropriate treatment. Thus, if policymakers apply the same standards of evidence to evaluate the value of medical and chiropractic services, there will be no justification for dismissing spinal manipulation as an unsubstantiated treatment for back pain. However, because physical therapists, osteopaths, and allopathic physicians also use spinal manipulation and it is not known which forms of manipulation are most effective, there is no rationale for restricting manipulative care to any single profession. (Although the best available evidence suggests that over 90 percent of spinal manipulative treatments in the United States have been performed by chiropractors (Shekelle, 1992), there has been growing interest among allopathic and osteopathic physicians and among physical therapists in learning and using these techniques. It is therefore likely that the availability of nonchiropractic sources of spinal manipulative care will increase in the future.) Access to chiropractic services is another major concern. Chiropractors receive extensive training and have demonstrated competencies in clinical assessment and management through government-accredited higher education programs. **Says who? They are licensed and regulated in all 50 States, typically maintain professional liability coverage, and have evolved as a direct-access profession, in part because they have been outside traditional medical referral loops. Given that medical practitioners have little exposure to chiropractic training or practice, a case can be made for not requiring medical referral. This problem is analogous to the issue of requiring a primary care physician to authorize referrals for specialty care within the medical profession. In any event, the referral issue has significant economic and organizational implications and will likely require more cost data and market experience before it can be intelligently addressed. **Chiropractors are terrified by the prospect of medical control of referrals. The question of how the utilization of chiropractic services is controlled also has important economic considerations. Typical insurance benefit limits include actuarial caps (e.g., a limit on the number of visits that will be covered or on the number of dollars per year for services). Risk-sharing options are also likely to evolve as the chiropractic managed care marketplace matures. A number of chiropractic managed care organizations (MCOs) currently use capitated rates, allowing more flexibility in determining which procedures are reimbursable. Finally, policymakers in Government and planners within the chiropractic community will need to consider how to best achieve infrastructure development and needed enhancement of chiropractic training, particularly as it relates to practical training through residencies and clerkships. In order to succeed, infrastructure and facility development at chiropractic colleges will need to occur through vehicles such as educational grants and indirect cost support, rather than exclusively through student tuition, as is currently the case at all chiropractic colleges. * * *Despite nearly a century of adversity that included multiple efforts by organized medicine to eliminate the profession, chiropractic has thrived and attracted a large patient following. In recent years, increasing numbers of other health professionals have become supportive of chiropractic treatment. As a health care resource, chiropractors have established a presence that appears to have filled a void left by the limited success of the more traditional approaches to musculoskeletal problems. In contrast to medical treatment of musculoskeletal problems by primary care physicians, a chiropractic encounter often includes more time listening to patients' concerns, extensive hands-on evaluation, clear and concrete explanations that make sense to patients, hands-on treatment that often feels good and is sometimes associated with an immediate improvement in symptoms, and repeated follow-up with the doctor (Mootz, 1995b). **The cited article contains no data on whether chiropractic encounters last longer than medical encounters or that chiropractic explanations make more sense than medical explanations. It is not surprising that such an approach is viewed as more satisfying than standard medical treatment (Cherkin, 1989; Carey, 1995; Coulehan, 1985). Chiropractors infrequently use high-cost diagnostics, specialist referral, and hospitalization. Further, chiropractic's principal intervention, spinal manipulation, has at least as much evidence for effectiveness as any other conservative treatment for back and neck pain. Thus, there is a clear rationale for policy planners to identify efficient strategies for incorporating chiropractic services into the health care system. Given the chiropractic profession's history of survival and growth, its consistent political and legislative successes in adversarial situations, and its dedicated effort in recent decades to upgrade its education, research, and practice activities, both the profession and policymakers should pursue greater incorporation of quality improvement strategies in care delivery, dedication of appropriate resources for research, enhanced exposure to appropriate residencies and fellowships (e.g., in radiology, rehabilitation), and greater efforts to facilitate multidisciplinary practice. These actions will help policymakers determine the most appropriate roles for chiropractors in the health care system and will ensure that chiropractors are well prepared to serve in these roles. **The first step toward greater professional acceptance should be to renounce the [quack beliefs and practices that are rampant](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirochoose.html) among chiropractors.

December 16, 1981 Susskind: Many patients swear by chiropractors. Many physicians swear at them, claiming that chiropractors are unscientific and potentially very dangerous. My guests tonight represent both sides, and they're here to discuss what chiropractors can and cannot do for you. Please meet them now. - First, from Chicago, Dr. Chester Wilk, has been a chiropractor since 1955. And he has written two books, including Everything You Should Know About Chiropractic. In 1976, he and four colleagues brought a federal antitrust suit against the American Medical Association. - Dr. Stephen Barrett is a psychiatrist, a consumer advocate and a medical writer. His books include Vitamins and Health Foods: The Great American Hustle and The Health Robbers. - Dr. Louis Sportelli has been a chiropractor for 19 years in rural Pennsylvania. He is a member of the Board of Governors of the American Chiropractic Association, and he has written Introduction to Chiropractic. - Dr. Reuben Hoppenstein is a neurosurgeon at the Orthopedic Institute of the Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York City, and he is co-chief of its Problem Back Service. His entire practice is devoted to microsurgery of the spine. Now, as I understand it, the theory of chiropractic is that all disease flows from the spine. Wilk: Well, that's what our critics would have you believe but, basically, chiropractors do not . . . Susskind: You don't believe it. Wilk: Absolutely not, and we have violently denied that; but our critics have consistently insisted that it does so that they can defame us by turning around and saying that we claim this. A ludicrous position. Susskind: Why do you defame these nice chiropractors? Barrett: Well, I've done a lot of research. I've been working on this for ten years. One of the things I did, for example, was to send volunteers into the offices of just about every chiropractor in our community to pick up literature; and this is one of the things that we picked up. [Displays \"Chart of Effects of Spinal Misalignments\"] Susskind: If you hold it steady, the camera will get a picture of it. Barrett: It's a picture of a spine, and it says that the nervous system controls all the organs and structures of the body and that misalignments of vertebrae, meaning bones out of place, cause trouble \u2014 and then it lists the areas and the trouble. For example, the idea is that spinal difficulty and nerve difficulty cause such things as hearing loss, colds, pneumonia, jaundice, shingles, ulcers, hives, nephritis (that's kidney trouble), and actually there are a hundred different conditions listed. Now this is what is in chiropractic offices. Dr. Wilk probably would say, \"No, that's not what chiropractors do,\" but I can tell you that I've been there and this is what's in their offices. Sportelli: That's what's in their offices because it is for patient consumption, not technical consumption. Susskind: Is it in your office? Sportelli: Those are not in my office. My own book's in my office because it happens to be a little more contemporary. But, the fact of the matter remains, the underlying promise of those health tracts does have as its basis some sound substance. Number one, that there is a controlling and coordinating mechanism of the nervous system to, which ultimately controls and coordinates most of the function of the body; and secondly, those conditions that are listed are for essentially for public consumption because people necessarily think of themselves as diseased organs or diseased processes. Chiropractors don't treat any of those diseases at all, but they treat the body. Susskind: Are chiropractors doctors? Do you have a medical degree? Sportelli: No, and I don't want a medical degree. If I did, I'd go to med school; but I have a Doctor of Chiropractic degree and certainly, we're doctors within the sphere and scope of our own practice. Susskind: Have you had a residency and internship? Sportelli: No. Susskind: No. Sportelli: We have not because, again, by our own election. Let me . . . Susskind: Did you do anything more than go to a university? Sportelli: I went to chiropractic college and I graduated with a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. By our own election, however. Susskind: Is there such a degree? Sportelli: Yes there is. It is a degree that's recognized by the United States Office of Education and the government and all the states . . . . Susskind: Would they have that at the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale, Wellesley, Radcliffe . . . Sportelli: No, absolutely not. They have it within the confines of our own chiropractic institutions. But let me say . . . Susskind: Isn't that a little bit suspicious, the idea that you are not medical doctors, you have a degree granted in four years which is not recognized as a real department of education at any of the great state universities or any of the private colleges . . . Sportelli: I couldn't have asked, or wished that you'd have asked, a better question because I think that from the start of this program, which is a chiropractic program, we need to develop \u2014 from a historical standpoint \u2014 why we're at the stage we're at in our evolution; and it has been because of the tremendous political pressure of the American Medical Association that has prevented chiropractic institutions from integrating into universities, from having universities participating with our profession. And let me also clarify something for the listening audience that may sometimes be used as a deterrent to chiropractic. They say, \"Well, chiropractors do not prescribe drugs or do surgery.\" That is absolutely correct. But that is by our choice. Susskind: You crack . . . Sportelli: We manipulate the spine very specifically and very delicately; and I would say, with the kind of skill that this gentleman right here, who is a neurosurgeon, utilizes in his surgical techniques. It is not by any chance a whimsical crack on the back. Barrett: What do you manipulate it for, what kind of conditions do you treat? Sportelli: We don't treat conditions, I've just said that. Barrett: You don't treat any? Sportelli: We treat the body. Barrett: Here's a pamphlet that says \"Gallstones and Chiropractic\" and it says that the best approach to permanent solution of gallstones or any other health problem is to see your chiropractor regularly. Now this pamphlet was picked up in a dozen offices in our community \u2014 the community that we live in. Sportelli: That's correct. Barrett: And I don't think that's a true statement. Sportelli: It is not a true statement. You're absolutely correct because . . . Susskind: You can't cure gallstones. anything. Susskind: It says: \"Gallstones and Chiropractic.\" Sportelli: That's correct. That particular pamphlet that is constantly utilized against chiropractors are merely because this profession has no alternative mechanism by which to educate the public as to what we do in terms of chiropractic. Susskind: Dr. Hoppenstein, what say you about chiropractic? Hoppenstein: Well, I, as a scientist, would like to believe there is some scientific basis for what chiropractic is all about. I cannot find anything that is a scientific basis that tells me that by manipulating the spine, other than treating pain coming from the spine \u2014 if that's at all possible \u2014 that it can treat any other part of the body. I do not believe that anybody can manipulate the spine \u2014 and that includes physicians who claim to be able to do it \u2014 without it jumping right back because it takes several hundred pounds of pressure to manipulate the spine. You may move it temporarily, but it's gonna go back to the same position. If there is a diseased joint, and you can move that part of the spine out of position, it's gonna go right back very rapidly unless you can stabilize it. I do not know of one scientific study where they have put radiological markers on a spine in a living patient \u2014 just a few beads of a metal in the tips of the spine \u2014 and manipulate and take another x-ray and show there's been any movement. I don't believe that's ever been done and that would be the prime research project to prove that anything is being done at all. Barrett: Actually, it's been disproven that you can influence the nerves by manipulating the spine. An anatomist at Yale took people within a few hours after death and hooked them up to a machine and found that the only way you can twist the spine to cause the nerve to be interfered with \u2014 like chiropractors say \u2014 is to rupture the ligaments, and that would kill a person. Wilk: Okay, I've got to respond to that. You're making reference to [the Crelin Report](https://www.chirobase.org/02Research/crelin.html) from Yale, which no lesser authority than Dr. Scott Haldeman who is an eminent foremost . Wilk: Excuse me, I gave you the courtesy of not interrupting you. Please extend the same courtesy and let's be gentlemen. The point I'm making out is that Dr. Crelin his report was severely criticized by Dr. Scott Haldeman who is a neurophysiologist, a Ph.D. in neurophysiology. He's a chiropractor, and he's a medical physician. The Crelin report, and I have a document, I believe it's Exhibit 127 in our lawsuit with . . . Susskind: You're getting too technical for us, I mean, we haven't read that document. Wilk: Okay, it simply states this: Dr. Crelin said, \"I am getting the material together and I am going to do a study to blow chiropractic.\" Now how, pray tell, do you do a study when you have a preconceived notion that you're going to do something to blow it. Barrett: Well, the study was published . . . Wilk: If a study is scientific, you don't go in with the idea that I am going to do a study to blow it. Barrett: Well, its . . . Susskind: We have to pause, but as I understand the argument to this point, men of medicine \u2014 doctors \u2014 think that chiropractic is a fraud and a deception. Barrett: That's too simple. Sportelli: Some of them. Some of them. Susskind: Most of them. Barrett: No. Sportelli: No. Wilk: I would say. . . Sportelli: Quite the contrary. Susskind: And the men of chiropractic believe that they're doing God's work and helping people. Barrett: Many of them do. Susskind: Relieve pain. Barrett: Uh-huh. Wilk: No. Susskind: Is that the issue? Wilk: back in August of 1980 . . . Susskind: Well, just yes or have to . . . . Barrett: No, the issue than that . . . . Wilk: It is not that. I don't think political medicine today is as hostile to chiropractic as is exhibited by the two gentlemen that are here. The reason they are \u2014 thank God they represent a dying breed \u2014 they are a minority group that is slowly fading away into the horizon but they do not represent the main thinking. . . . Susskind: They look very healthy to me. Sportelli: No lesser authority than the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association back in August of 1980 made the statement that we've got to have closer cooperation in working with the chiropractors. Now these gentlemen do not speak for the American Medical Association or any organization. Susskind: Hold it, we're coming right back. Susskind: Medical doctors and chiropractors for 85 years have been at each other's throats, and the American Medical Association states that you are quacks. Barrett: No. Wilk: They do not. Sportelli: Dr. Barrett states that we're quacks. Barrett: No, I try to avoid name-calling. Susskind: And you say that you repair the failures of medical doctors. Sportelli: To a degree we do. That's how this profession was built \u2014 on medical failures virtually in the early 1900's of this country when chiropractic was in its formative years. Had there been exaggerations of chiropractic claims? Certainly. Were there people who were evangelical in their fervor for chiropractic? Certainly. Did chiropractors themselves make overstatements? Certainly. But the fact of the matter remains that people sought out chiropractic as a viable alternative to medical care because they weren't getting results under medical care. Chiropractic became then a threat to what has to be a monopolistic form of health care in this country dominated by the American Medical Association. Therefore, they were opposed to chiropractic. Susskind: Mainly on the basis that you're not doctors, right? Sportelli: Well, you know, it reminds me of when I was home, you know, we had three brothers and two sisters and when my mom and dad used to go away we used to say, \"Who died and left you boss?\" And I think that we're saying essentially the same thing to the American Medical Association. Who appointed them or anointed them as the saviors of health care or the protectors of health care in the United States of America? We're saying that we have a right to exist as a viable health care delivery system that has been in existence for 85 years and has proven its worth on millions and millions of people. Why try to destroy us? Why try to boycott us? Why try to form a conspiracy against chiropractors? Susskind: Why are you doing all these terrible things? Hoppenstein: Well, I believe, David, that medicine is 5,000 years old. I know a little bit more than the people that taught me and my residents and students will know more than I do in the future. Chiropractic is 85 years old, was started by D. D. Palmer, a greengrocer who got the brilliant idea . . . Wilk: That is absolutely wrong. Hoppenstein: . . . of manipulating the spine and being able to cure everything from hemorrhoids to cancer. It has, obviously, evolved over the years. The medical profession has certainly accepted osteopathy into medicine because they certainly have the same medical curriculum today and they do what they do. They also manipulate the spine. What we as physicians don't really know, what is the curriculum of a chiropractor? They talk about manipulations. I operate on the spine every day. You can not move the spine without cutting ligaments. It's a very difficult thing. Also, as has been pointed out by Dr. Barrett, there's a lot of clearance where the nerves come out of the spine and you'd literally have to do a lot of disruption of ligaments and exert 2,000 pounds of pressure in order to try and damage that nerve or relieve any pressure on that nerve. The other thing, I believe that most of the work done by chiropractors has to do with the spine and spinal pain. There is no way that a disk can be reduced. Once a disk comes out, it is always out. However, 90% of people get better \u2014 they don't need surgery. . . . I believe that chiropractors actually do produce some alleviation of the spasms by their manipulation probably as a counter-puncture or acupuncture causing pain in the paraspinal muscles \u2014 which may break the pain cycle the same as physicians may use a deep intra-muscular injection into the myoneural junction . . . Susskind: What is that? Hoppenstein: Where the nerve goes into the muscle. I'm sorry. Now, I'm not saying that chiropractors never do anything. I have many patients who have been treated by chiropractors over the years. When asked why they went, it's because they were treated by physicians and after getting some pain medication, they went off and got fed up because nothing was being done. We don't manipulate patients usually, there are very few physicians who really manipulate patients. I personally do not believe that manipulation will do anything except if you produce enough pain that you can produce muscle relaxation. But as f ar as the disk going back, it never goes back. All that happens is that the nerve root looses its swelling over two to three weeks and the patient gets better. In short, whether you use acupuncture, a chiropractor, a physician, whether you use sphenopalatine ganglion injections . . . these people are going to get better. So what we are talking about is: if these are the people who've been treated, fine, that's wonderful. What about the patients who have herniated disks that are already impinging on nerves where these patients are developing urological problems where they have an increase in frequency of urination, where their sex lives are disrupted because the same nerves are being pressed on, and they are being treated by manipulation two, three, four times a week for two years at a time? That disk is slipping out. Many of these nerve roots, despite the fact that that disk is removed in two or three years time, may never recover. So that deficit may remain permanent. Susskind: Okay. Wilk: Okay now, Dr. Hoppenstein is making reference to a great deal of structural type conditions which he calls subluxations, and there is a gross lack of communication between chiropractors and . . . Well, disrelationships, subluxations \u2014 he talks about vertebral lesions or whatever, but when a chiropractor speaks of a vertebral lesion or a disrelationship, he's speaking more in terms of a physiological term. Barrett: Something you can't see. Sportelli: Correct. Wilk: Whereas when you're dealing with structural, you're dealing with anatomical disrelationship, which is a little bit different. In our subluxation, we're talking about congestion, adhesions, swelling, pain, tenderness, possibly hypomobile or hypermobile vertebra. And this Crelin study was incredibly out in left field in that I would ask this Crelin: \"If you slap a dead ham would it swell?\" Or: \"How many bottles of Ex-Lax would you feed a cadaver before it had a bowel movement?\" I mean, it's a ludicrous question and it's equally ludicrous to take a cadaver and start talking about vertebral subluxations which are physiological. Susskind: Wow! Can you give it to us Wilk: Well, yes, right? There's a vertebra right over there. Hoppenstein: You show me what a subluxation is. Susskind: What is a subluxation? This is the spine. Right? Wilk: Let me better explain it. A subluxation may be somewhere along these vertebrae, along here, maybe a disrelationship, but it could be a physiological, the amount of rotation of the vertebra maybe just millimicrons. It would be very, very slight. Barrett: You can't see it. Wilk: And for a lack of a better word . . . Susskind: Would it show up on an x-ray? Wilk: It may or may not, but for lack of a better word, we term it a subluxation. Barrett: All right, we say it doesn't exist. Sportelli: That's cause you don't know about it. Wilk: Except there is only one situation: There are millions of people who go to chiropractors, have pains in their backs, have their backs manipulated, and they walk out of the office with the pain gone. Barrett: That has nothing to do with whether your theory is correct. Sportelli: No, that is absolutely incorrect. If we were to go on Dr. Barrett's premise that we'd have to know exactly what was going on before we were able to utilize our particular therapy, that means that we shouldn't have been able to use gravity until Newton discovered it. Well, that's ridiculous. The law of gravity was there and it was there whether we discovered it or whether we didn't. We're saying the same thing in chiropractic. There is a lot of empirical evidence. This empirical evidence means that it is not scientifically validated to the point where we can demonstrate it in a laboratory. But then again, the body is a dynamic thing. It is not able to be placed in a laboratory. Barrett: Yes, but if you had, say 10 chiropractors looking at the same x-ray, would they all see the same subluxations? Sportelli: Probably not. Depending on what their emphasis was and where they were \u2014 I mean the location \u2014 they may not come up with the same thing. Absolutely not. Susskind: Well, listen . . . Wilk: And a similar position in medicine would be likewise. Medical physicians disagree. Right just today, I believe I heard during our gathering that one of the physicians made a comment relative to something about the spine and you took a strong opposition to his position and here you're both M.D.s, you're both from the area. So differences are bound to exist. When the differences exist in medicine, however, they'll say, well, that's growth, that's a natural phenomenon. But two chiropractors, if they dare to disagree, they try to make a federal case out of it and make appear as well, chiropractors can't agree; and it's an unfair analogy. And I can see from the way this entire thrust of this meeting is going there is not even a remote understanding of what a chiropractor means by a vertebral subluxation. Barrett: And I . . . Wilk: You're talking about lesions of anatomical displacement. We're talking about physiological changes that take place and there is a world of difference. Sportelli: Oddly enough, David, this gentleman is one of the few practitioners in medicine that we have no quarrel with. When a surgeon is necessary, it is necessary. There is no question in my mind that I refer every day to a member of the medical profession for cases that have gone outside the scope of chiropractic. Barrett: Yes, but you're very . . . Sportelli: Outside the basis of what conservative chiropractic can do . . . Nowhere has chiropractic in today's day and age, claimed to be a panacea, number one; claimed to have all the answers for the ills of mankind, number two; and thirdly, we refer to medical doctors. There was a recent survey of our own membership: 93% of them, I believe, if my figure is correct, referred to medical doctors on a regular basis. The figure coming back from the medical doctors to the chiropractors, however, is infinitesimal \u2014 and that shouldn't be. Barrett: I think it's incredible that 7% never refer. In the Lehigh Valley where we interviewed 35 chiropractors, we found that that at least 10% never refer. Wilk: Weren't you under cross-examination for three days by the New Zealand Commission? Barrett: No. Wilk: I bear to differ with you. According to the New Zealand Report, they found your material as to be totally unreliable, unbalanced, and they could give no credence to it whatsoever. Your name is in the New Zealand Report. Barrett: Well I was not . . . Wilk: it as gross propaganda. . . . Barrett: I presented nothing to the New Zealand Commission. The New Zealand Commission also said . . . Wilk: Okay. Then they took your material. Barrett: I don't know where they got it, but the New Zealand Commission also said that chiropractors should not be primary care providers and if that were the case chiropractic would do very badly. But you changed the topic, let's get back to what we were talking about. Wilk: Let's talk more about the New Zealand Report. Barrett: You are one slick guy Dr. Wilk. Susskind: Gentlemen, can we. . . . Wilk: The Report . . . . Susskind: The bottom line is we better get back to America and I've got to pause. Susskind: If I could interrupt your colloquy and just tell you that about ten years ago, I had a back pain, and at the time, it felt most uncomfortable. I went to a chiropractor on the advice of an athlete friend of mine. I should have known better. But he said \"You know what you need, a chiropractor. He'll get it out in just a couple of manipulations.\" I asked him for the name of a good chiropractor. He gave me one who had a rather nice office in an expensive area of New York. I went in, got undressed, and got up on a table and then he cracked my neck in a way that I thought my neck would come off. Then he did something cracking my back, and then he cracked it again and I said: \"It's making awful sounds, but am I being cured?\" He said, \"Oh, yes. Don't worry about the sound.\" And after about 25 minutes of that, I was finished and got dressed, and while walking out of there felt pretty good. But about an hour later, the pain that brought me into the place was still present. So what had chiropractic done for me except take my check and crack a neck and a back? Wilk: Well, when you go to a chiropractor, you don't necessarily expect that you're going to have one visit and get a miracle cure any more than you go to an M.D. and get one prescription of a pill and an hour later be cured. One has to consider the circumstances. Your circumstances may be such where you might have required several visits and so that wouldn't be . . . Susskind: Have you ever formulated an average number of visits to cure your average patient? Wilk: There were some excellent studies by the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Board showing that 41% of the people under medical care got back to work within a week whereas 84% got back to work within a week under chiropractic care. The California study was quite similar, showing under chiropractic care they got back to work \u2014 these are Workmen's Compensation cases \u2014 within one-half the time. And the Florida Workmen's Compensation study showed that under chiropractic care, one-third the cost and one-third the time. When we talk about chiropractic and medicine and the dispute that's going on, I think, really, by far the most important thing we can leave this television studio with is the basic bottom line: Chiropractic works. The New Zealand Report said that it works, that it's very effective, that it gets results with medical failures. In fact, the New Zealand Report went so far as to say that chiropractic must be in hospitals and if it isn't, the government should intervene and force it. It said if there is any barrier between chiropractic and medicine, it is because of ignorance and prejudice on the part of the medical physician and it took Barrett's report and referred to it as completely unreliable. . . . Barrett: That's not true. They did not take \"my report\" because I submitted nothing to them. Wilk: Would you like to see a copy of the New Zealand Report . . . . Barrett: I have a copy of the New Zealand Report. The fact of the matter is . . . Wilk: I have it in my briefcase, I have it underlined and I can bring . . . Barrett: I know, you've written about it too. You think it's a big deal. I don't. I'll tell you why . . . Wilk: Well, of course you don't think it's a big deal because they took you through the coals. Barrett: No, you say that I made a submission. I made no submission. Wilk: They made the statement that as far as they were concerned your material was not balanced, it was purely propaganda and they could place no reliability on your report. Barrett: Who are they? Who are the New Zealand reporters? Wilk: The New Zealand Report consisted of an eminent professor of chemistry from a university, a prominent attorney from New Zealand, and. . . . Susskind: Do you think this is relevant? Barrett: No, I don't. I think it was a lousy report. Wilk: Of course it's a lousy report in your mind because they took you through the coals . . . Sportelli: Let's get to the point of Dr. Barrett. See, he's a danger essentially to cooperation between the medical profession and the chiropractic profession because of his obsession essentially with the weak points in chiropractic. Now Dr. Barrett's been.. . . Susskind: Why can't we compensable under medical plans? Wilk: Yes, indeed. Sportelli: Under insurance, every Workman's Compensation insurance carrier in the United States of America pays for chiropractic. Susskind: Medicare? Sportelli: Medicare pays for it . . . Barrett: Did they decide to that voluntarily or did you ram laws through the state legislatures to get them to do it? Sportelli: Well, when we, when we get to the political power and American Medical Association, we'll talk about that . . . Barrett: You didn't answer the question, did they do it voluntarily? Sportelli: Of course not, they don't do anything voluntarily. Barrett: Is that so? Sportelli: Let me, let me just go on for just a moment and tell you . . . Susskind: I just want to be and Medicaid recognize . . . . Sportelli: Medicare and Medicaid, Workers Compensation. . . I think 38 states in this country now have insurance quality laws which simply say that if you're compensable under the care of a medical care, you're compensable under a chiropractor. . . which I think is right because I think . . . Really, David, the bottom line issue in this whole deal is: Do the consumers of this country have a freedom to choose the health care provider of their choice? Barrett: Sure they do! Sportelli: I'm glad you said that. Barrett: But the question is: Who should pay for it? Sportelli: Without medical interference. Barrett: If somebody chooses it, he should pay for it. Why should I pay for it? Hoppenstein: I happen to agree with you. Especially if it doesn't have any basis scientifically. I think you can't keep doing things because they've been done for 85 years . . . Wilk: Oh, you know you keep talking about the scientific basis as if the American Medical or the medical profession had a monopoly on science. To begin with, it is a scientific posture to put technology before science. In other words, if a particular method of healing works \u2014 even if you don't know why it works \u2014 it is used. Case in point. Aspirin. Millions and millions of pounds of aspirin are being used. They can't explain how it works, but it's all right and this is considered scientific medicine. Chiropractic works. It gets results. Barrett: Where's the evidence? Hoppenstein: What conditions Wilk has written a book, Everything You Should Know About Chiropractic. It says that a chiropractor can be very helpful in a whole host of human problems. Nervous disorders, arthritis, sciatica, migraine headaches. Now let's come to something interesting \u2014 emotional problems, hypertension, high blood pressure, cardiovascular conditions, heart trouble, trauma, the common cold, bursitis \u2014 almost everything. Wilk: Fine, let me . . . Susskind: What can you do, what can you do for cardiovascular conditions? Wilk: Okay, let me explain this. This particular study there is based on 7,000 chiropractors that were . . . Susskind: No, just tell me how your science \u2014 if it be a science \u2014 can contribute to the cardiovascular . . . Wilk: Okay, very good. Let, I have to lay a foundation because so far we haven't really laid a basic foundation. We're off into the structural aspect, we're off into the physiological aspect, we're talking apples and oranges, we're not even in communication . . . Barrett: You're not answering the question is what you're doing. Wilk: Well, I am going to. Hoppenstein: Our bodies are built differently. I don't know any physiological basis for what you're saying and that's what I want to know. Wilk: Okay, let me answer it this way. First of all, our basic concept is that good structure equals good function. If the spine has what we call a subluxation \u2014 it does indeed occur \u2014 and if by hand you can apply a certain type of manipulative technique to that spine and use a standardized technique and consistently produce predictable results and get it done over and over and over again, and if you can correlate the results to this manipulation of the spine. . . . Hoppenstein: What can you do to a heart patient? What, how are you going . . . Wilk: Well, I'm coming to that, I'm coming to that. Hoppenstein: He's got arteriosclerosis, I mean there's the clogging of his . . . Wilk: Okay, now keep in mind we are not treating the heart disease, we're not treating arteriosclerosis. We treat the patients. . . . In the book I say that . . . we don't treat conditions. And this is where a bone of great of confusion exists. Barrett: They can't express themselves. Wilk: We treat the patient. We treat the patient and then the patient of its own natural ability. Susskind: You don't treat the problem, you.. . . Wilk: We treat the whole patient. We help restore . . . Barrett: Is that why you can't measure you stop interrupting, maybe I . . . Barrett: Well, you keep talking. You just talk and talk and talk and talk; and I don't think it's fair that you take up half of the program. Susskind: I must stop in a second, but you can't tell an audience of innocents out there that you can cure or allay, in an important way, heart trouble. Sportelli: What kind of heart trouble? Wilk: It's a leading question in that it's hard to know . . . Hoppenstein: The clogging of the arteries. Sportelli: Okay. You're absolutely correct and no chiropractor. . . . Susskind: But he says he can . . . Sportelli: No. that's not what he's saying, I don't believe that's what he's saying at all. I think again we need to break down what is being said. Barrett: Here it is (showing pamphlet): \"Heart Trouble and Chiropractors.\" Sportelli: What does it say, Dr. Barrett? Barrett: \"You can reduce the risk of developing heart trouble by eating sensibly, exercising and visiting your chiropractor regularly.\" I presume to have your spine examined. Sportelli: Because we feel that a properly functioning nervous system is the underlying fundamental basis for the good health of every individual. Barrett: That's the bottom line? Sportelli: That is the bottom line. Barrett: We feel that's absolute nonsense . . . adjustment of the spine . . . Barrett: How often should you to have your spine examined? Susskind: Gentlemen, on this note of sweet unanimity, we pause very briefly. Susskind: A very important bone of contention between chiropractors and medical doctors is the use of the x-ray. Ninety percent of your patients are x-rayed and yet, the subluxations don't show up on x-rays as . . . . Wilk: They may or may not. Susskind: They may or may not. Wilk: May or may not. Susskind: Yet you give very strong x-ray dosages, right? Wilk: Wrong, wrong. Barrett: How much of a dose does a full spine x-ray give? Sportelli: I don't know offhand. Barrett: Oh come now. Sportelli: The x-ray that a chiropractor utilizes is utilized not only for his determination of whether or not there is a biomechanical \u2014 and when we're talking about biomechanical, we're talking about these vertebrae and disks in the living human organism \u2014 whether or not these are involved. That's one factor. The second factor that we're as equally as concerned about David, is whether or not there are problems within that spine that would preclude the utilization of an adjustment. You take some 70-year-old woman with osteoporosis. That's a condition that the viewers are familiar with. It's where the bones have demineralized essentially and are very capable of breaking. You've heard about the old lady who walks off the curb and fractures her hip. Well that condition is not amenable to chiropractic manipulations of the kind of thrust that chiropractors would utilize; and therefore that would be one contraindication. There may be TB of the spine, there may be cancer of the spine. Those are conditions that the chiropractors are looking for to be able to rule out. Those conditions don't belong in a chiropractic office and, therefore that's another \u2014 probably as important as looking for the biomechanical disarrangements. Hoppenstein: A man coming in your office with chest pain and some numbness of the left arm \u2014 what would you do with that man? Sportelli: Well, the first thing I'd do is probably take his blood pressure and probably shove him off to the hospital for a cardiogram and have his cardiovascular system checked. Many of these people who have cardiograms; and you know, they're kind of nebulous in their information. These people go to the hospital to have a cardiogram. They walk outside and keel over of a heart attack while the cardiogram says they're normal. The fact of the matter remains, in my office, that's the kind of a procedure I would utilize and that's the kind of a procedure, incidentally, that most chiropractors would utilize. With chest pains that are predictably that which would indicate a heart attack \u2014 chiropractors would send them off to the emergency room or to a cardiologist to have their heart checked. Barrett: That sounds terrific, and I would agree that Dr. Sportelli does it, but I don't agree that most chiropractors do. I have in my hand an ad that says, \"Chest pains can be caused by nerve disturbance at some point on the spine. \" And then it says, \"It may vary from an intense fearful constricting pain to a dull throbbing pain.\" The suggestion of the ad is to see a chiropractor. The fact of the matter is that when I arrested the chiropractor who placed this ad for false advertising, the Chairman of the State Board of Chiropractic Licensure came and testified that this ad represents chiropractic as it's taught in the schools. Sportelli: Dr. Barrett, fearful constricting chest pains are indicative of a heart attack. You know it. Chester knows it, Reuben know it, and I know it. Barrett: Yes, and . . . Sportelli: The fact of the matter remains is there are functional angina cases that go to their cardiologists, have had their cardiovascular system checked, have proven to be normal, they still retain their functional angina, which are fearful constricting chest pains. They go to a chiropractor, they have their dorsal spine manipulated and by God, you know what happens? Barrett: Nothing. Sportelli: What happens is they lose their functional angina and that's what . . say . . . Sportelli: That's what's said by thousands of people. Incidentally, this is one of the problems, David. Somebody who has had a functional angina will leave the chiropractor's office. Both the chiropractor at one time in our history would have believed he would have cured heart problems. The patient believes he's had a heart problem cured because that's where his pain was. Nothing could be further from the truth, yet that patient goes out and says to the world, \"Chiropractors cure heart pains.\" That is not what chiropractic is saying today, it is not what chiropractic has said for the last 20 years and that is not what that ad says. I disagree with that ad, but that does not negate the f act that it is, in fact, a valid ad taken in its proper context. And I don't like the fact that Dr. Barrett utilizes advertising as a means to criticize the chiropractic profession. What I want to talk about, what I'd like to talk about here today from a chiropractic standpoint, is: Let's forget about the esoteric problems of heart disease and cholesterol in your arteries and all this other business. Let's talk about the 80 million people with back pain, let's talk about the 40 million reputed people that have headaches \u2014 two conditions of which chiropractic has had astounding results in. We've got a 120 million Americans out there suffering from those conditions being kept from chiropractors. Barrett: Well, why are all these pamphlets in Sportelli: Simple because . . . Barrett: They're not advertisements. Pamphlets of this type are in most offices. Sportelli: You're absolutely correct. Barrett: This has been studied all over the country. Sportelli: You're absolutely correct. We don't like it either. That's not . . . Barrett: \"We\" is the in the majority of offices! Sportelli: You see, one of the problems in chiropractic, David . . . Barrett: . . . has been the fact that this has been a singular, isolated profession kept from telling its story, kept from getting funds. Now let me just tell you something here, which is kind of interesting. . . . Let's talk about the charge of chiropractic education. Dr. Barrett has utilized this charge before. Barrett: I didn't make it today, you want to go on? Sportelli: You didn't make it today. Barrett: I didn't make it today. You want to spend the next five minutes talking. I would like to have two minutes to speak sometime between now and the end of the program. Or maybe one minute to make two points. Susskind: Well, take a minute now. How about that? Barrett: Okay. I want to say two things. First of all, I think the audience has a right to feel confused. I think the confusion reflects the confusion within chiropractic not within the people here. Number two, Dr. Wilk's case is very interesting. He spent seven weeks presenting his case to the jury where he sued the AMA and said, \"You guys are trying to put us out of business. It's a terrible thing to do, etc. etc. etc. \" The AMA spent a week saying, \"Yes we did try, but we had a good reason.\" The jury found with the AMA. The jury said, \"Dr. Wilk, you lose.\" And I would like to make one more suggestion: If anyone would like more information, they can write to me. . . . I will answer any letter that comes and send information about chiropractors. If you're gonna go to see one, you better know what you're getting into. [Note: This comment referred to a trial in which the AMA persuaded a jury that chiropractic was so outlandish that the AMA had a right to attempt to stop what chiropractors were doing. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal and the case was retried on narrower antitrust grounds in front of a judge, who [concluded that the AMA had good reason to be concerned but had gone to far in its antichiropractic efforts](https://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/AT/at00.html).] Wilk: And if they want information on chiropractic, let them contact the International Chiropractors Association in Washington, D.C. Susskind: Don't start writing all those letters because we're coming right back. Susskind: How much does an average visit to a chiropractor cost? Wilk: It'l depend on what part of the country. In some areas it may be anywhere from 10 to 20 dollars a visit. Barrett: Some can sock you for $75 or $100. Sportelli: California's a little bit heavier than the East Coast. Barrett: But some have what they call \"unit charges\" where you go and they give you different modalities and can run up a bill of $125, $130, $150 dollars a day. Wilk: In any event, it is a lot less money than you'd pay if you were hospitalized for similar conditions. Susskind: One thing that disturbed me in the research we did was that at a Clinic Masters seminar for chiropractors in 1978, one topic on the agenda was \"How to Achieve the Optimum Gettable with Every Patient.\" That sort of suggests a kind of a how-can-you-rip-em-off . . . Sportelli: David, I want to tell you that there's no way that that can be defended, and no chiropractor in any position of authority or leadership would condone any of that nonsense in terms of the practice management people who have anything less than an ethical basis for their practice. Barrett: Like Sid Williams? this one? Sportelli: I saw that. Barrett: He's an ICA board member. Sportelli: Let me also say to you that from a historical standpoint . . . Okay, let me go, I have to go back . . . . Do you notice I utilize a historical basis for some of my answers only because you have to know where you came from before you know where you're going. One of the problems in chiropractic that had been early-on in chiropractic history was that we were virtually cut-off, we were prosecuted, we were persecuted, we were. . . . Everything was done to a chiropractor. He couldn't virtually survive. The entrepreneurs within the chiropractic framework saw a means (practice building techniques) by which to make these chiropractors survive financially; and at a time it served its useful purpose. It is no longer valid today. Barrett: It's still going on. Sportelli: It's no longer needed today. Barrett: Isn't it still going on? Sportelli: Yes, Dr. Barrett, it is still going on, and I want to tell you something. That's the only thing that you have done that I applaud. You've called attention to a weakness in chiropractic that the national associations do. As a matter of fact, I might add to you \u2014 you read all of our journals \u2014 you know there have been two recent blatant editorials denouncing the entrepreneurs in practice. . . Barrett: Yes, but one of them is on the Board of the very organization the president spoke out on. . . Sportelli: You do not change administrations overnight, you know that. Barrett: Nothing's going to change. Sportelli: But, let me tell you, David, that was a basis for survival at a time. There is nothing stronger than the instinct of survival. Chiropractors needed practice management people to tell them how to survive. Barrett: Yes, but what they're doing is conning people into coming once a month for life. Sportelli: No, and there's nothing wrong with that. You know, this is interesting. This was in The Wall Street Journal, I often get it sometimes. Doctors turn to. . . Let's talk about real doctors, medical doctors. . . Barrett: You're changing the topic. Sportelli: No, I'm not changing the topic. I want to tell you that practice-building is not a dirty word. It is a dirty word in the context of when it is unethical., when it is unscrupulous, when it involves bilking the public out of money. Yes it is, absolutely. Nobody will stand for that. But I'm going to tell you that the techniques that chiropractors have utilized in those seminars that Dr. Barrett talks about are being talked about and told to medical doctors today. It costs them $350. What are doctors doing? Just, doctors aren't handing out two-for-one bonuses but they're sending flowers to their patients, then calling to chat about it. What we have done with those practice-building courses is create an awareness that there needs to be a personal relationship between you, the patient, and me, the doctor. Susskind: Dr. Hoppenstein, you've been very quiet. Have they convinced you at all. Hoppenstein: They haven't convinced me, and I'm still waiting for one shred of scientific evidence that manipulation \u2014 no matter how you spell it. . . . There is no way that that spine can be manipulated to cure all sorts problems . . . . Wilk: Read the New Zealand you that there is . . . Hoppenstein: What is possible \u2014 and I will hand this to my colleagues here \u2014 is that in acute pain in the spine, manipulation or . . . . by producing pain in the neighborhood can break the pain cycle for x number of hours or days. It does not treat the condition. it's not making you healthy and you're making your spine crack. Sportelli: I only disagree with that because . . . Perhaps I asked you earlier in the show if you did any manipulation. You said no you did not do it. Hoppenstein: I do not. Sportelli: David, several years ago, the federal government of the United States \u2014 not New Zealand now \u2014 convened probably one of the most historic conferences of its kind in the world. It was at the National Institute of Neurological and Communicable Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland. I happened to be in attendance at that conference, not as a participant. I don't have those kinds of credentials. I was in the audience listening. I was proud to be in that audience. Why? Because what it did was convene from all over the world the authorities in manipulation from chiropractic, from medicine and from osteopathy. Now, this gentleman claims to be a scientist. I will get him a copy of the NINDS Report. It was called \"The Conference on SMV because the medics didn't want to use the word \"adjustment\" and the chiropractors didn't want to use the word \"manipulation\" so they finally came to a compromise and said let's call it \"spinal manipulative therapy. \" The world-renowned people came to the conclusion that there is much benefit, but we don't know why. Let's do some further research. And I think that any conference of its kind dealing with the specifics of manipulation is going to come to that same conclusion. Susskind: We're almost out of time. Can you conceive of any condition in yourself that would bring you to a chiropractor for relief? Barrett: Well, I have some chiropractors that I trust. I would say that if you've been diagnosed by a medical doctor, there might be certain kinds of aches and pains that a chiropractor can relieve. However, I've sent people for check-ups to 16 chiropractors and 15 of them recommended treatment for perfectly healthy people. And no two agreed as to what was the matter with any patient. Susskind: What do you say to that? Wilk: Well, I think my feeling is that in the limited time, I know we're running out in a few seconds, I, may I suggest that the people get Everything You Should Know About Chiropractic from your local chiropractor. It'll put things in a proper perspective. Susskind: I'm sorry, we are out of time. Get that book Everything You Should Know About Chiropractic Barrett: Get my book (The Health Robbers) too. Susskind (to the audience): Again, I want to thank you for inviting us into your home.

The Origin and Evolution of Chiropractic Belief Systems The chiropractic perspective on health and disease emphasizes two fundamental characteristics. (1) a testable principle suggesting that the structure and condition of the body influences how the body functions and heals and (2) an untestable metaphor that asserts that the mind-body relationship is instrumental in maintaining health and in healing processes. Even though early chiropractors characterized these perspectives on health as unique (Palmer, 1910), the conceptualization of the relationship between \"life\" and \"matter\" actually began with the early Greek philosophers (Hall, 1969, pp. 18-20). In fact, the origins of traditional \"chiropractic philosophy\" can be found within the classical philosophic disciplines (e.g., metaphysics, ontology), which attempted to explore the \"nature of reality\" (Phillips, 1992). The dichotomy between the ontological principles of vitalism (which considers living things to be governed by unknown laws different from those governing inanimate objects) and materialism (which recognizes only one set of physical laws) are represented in the two fundamental characteristics of chiropractic belief systems. The concept of vitalism stems from Plato's view that life is a nonmaterial entity imposed on matter. Materialism on the other hand recognizes that all natural processes, including life, are the result of known (or knowable) physical laws. **The American Heritage Dictionary defines \"ontological\" as \"the branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being.\" Chiropractic beliefs regarding the mind-body relationship and the body's ability to self-heal were characterized by early chiropractors (and even by some contemporary ones) using terminology and metaphors such as: \"Universal Intelligence\" controls the body's \"Innate Intelligence\" Force\" through the nervous system (Stephenson, 1927; Barge, 1988). These vitalistic concepts implied an intelligent governing entity and thereby were readily perceived as spiritual constructs by many both inside and outside the profession. Early chiropractors often used these metaphorical concepts to rationalize their way of thinking about the body's self-healing capacity. **Material things can be measured, making it possible to set up and test hypotheses about them using the scientific method. Vitalistic concepts (such as \"life force or Innate Intelligence\") are neither measurable or testable. On the other hand, chiropractic's fundamental perspective relating to a significant role for body structure in the healing process is more readily defined operationally, and hence can be evaluated with the tools of science. At times, chiropractors have attempted to merge both concepts (the testable principle relating body structure to function and the untestable metaphor asserting the role the mind-body relationship plays in healing) using one concept to rationalize the other (Mootz, 1992, 1995). For example, it is common to find references in the early chiropractic literature that incorporate vitalistic beliefs about how the body self-heals intermingled with conceptually reasonable discussions on physiology and anatomy. **It still is common, primarily among \"straight\" chiropractors. Such a blending of ideas regarding an all-pervading energy being a basis for materialism is not unique to chiropractic nor is it new in philosophy and the biologic sciences (Collingwood, 1924, pp. 167; Ledermann, 1970). In the 1920s, Collingwood asserted that it made no difference to \"the essence of materialism\" if the \"substrate behind the variety of empirical fact\" was called matter, energy, or space-time. In other words, although the syntax used to characterize the two fundamental components of chiropractic belief systems was unique, the concepts have actually been of interest in classical and contemporary philosophy, as well as medicine and biology. **This paragraph appears to be an attempt to give vitalistic concepts an aura of tradition and respectability. A more practical view would be that their espousal as a basis for health care is a sign of muddled thinking. B. Chiropractic's Testable Principle as Materialism In traditional chiropractic belief systems, a specific mechanistic (or testable) principle is that a spinal adjustment removes a subluxation and thereby affects physiologic function (Figure 1). Such a mechanistic principle is inherently quantifiable and can therefore be operationally defined and measured. This aspect of the chiropractic philosophy lends itself to the critical inquiry of the scientific process. **In other words, if the chiropractic \"subluxation\" is defined as something that can be seen and objectively measured, it would be possible to test whether chiropractic methods can modify it. Figure 1 (not reproduced here) is a table from a chiropractic textbook which indicates that it would be possible to test the ability of spinal manipulation to improve body function, but it would not be possible to test relationships between \"Universal Intelligence,\" \"Innate Intelligence,\" and body physiology. However, materialism and its mechanistic procedures do not explain what the purpose behind the life-matter or mind-body relationship is. Although of lasting philosophic intrigue, the answers to questions regarding the essence and purpose of life are not readily found with the tools needed for basic and clinical research. **In fact, they have nothing whatsoever to do with either research or science, and they have no practical relevance to health care. Therefore, chiropractic's mechanistic principle is merely a way in which the clinician and scientist can describe and investigate that which is observed in his or her patients (Keating, 1987). **The first step in investigating it would be to define it. However, chiropractors cannot agree on what they are seeing or doing or what they should be doing. (As a knowledgeable observer once noted, \"For every chiropractor, there is an equal but opposite chiropractor.\") Some attempts by early chiropractors to rationalize away the need to measure and quantify the effects of chiropractic care by incorporating vitalistic beliefs about life itself had the unintended consequence of confounding otherwise rational model building. **This is a convoluted way to characterized the delusional thinking of early chiropractors, which still influences chiropractic beliefs and practices today. In actuality, the recognition that living things undrgo processes beyond what is measurable and understandable at a given point in time is not an \"outlier\" concept at all. The early physiologic concepts of homeostasis and contemporary models regarding complex behaviors of simple systems form the basis of \"holistic\" approaches to health care (Mootz, 1995; Schwartz, 1997). **Dr. Mootz and Phillips would like us to believe that chiropractic's philosophical muddle is just another way to look at homeostasis (the tendency of organisms to maintain internal equilibrium by adjusting their physiological processes). I inspected [Dr. Schwartz's article,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9141291&dopt=Abstract) but could not understand it. Here's a representative paragraph: A dynamical energy systems approach encourages us to be open to entertaining and evaluating such novel ideas as the notion that biological cells can rectify and signal average weak energy fields or that nonlinear stochastic resonance may allow very tiny electromagnetic signals to be registered selectively and interactively. Moreover, new ideas bridging classical and quantum physics, currently evolving in quantum brain dynamics and consciousness, can be extended to quantum cardiac dynamics and consciousness. . . . The \"stairway to the mind\" itself is an emergent, interactive stairway that extends from the quantum to the cultural, involving nonlinear dynamics . . and emergent properties at all levels. Some of the above buzzwords apply to real scientific effects, but the paragraph itself is nonsense. A Quackwatch physics advisor, after noting the alleged link between quantum mechanics and culture, wondered whether the author believes that atoms and molecules can prefer Wagner to Bach. If anyone reading this understands what Schwartz's article has to do with chiropractic, please [let me know](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3b0a1aaada5ac83b2b6a2a0a8b4a2b7a0abeda0acae). C. Chiropractic's Untestable Metaphor as Holism Holism represents a philosophic perspective on the integration of body, mind, and spirit that posits that health depends on obedience to natural laws and that deviation can result in illness. Holism is based on the doctrine of teleology, which implies that there is a design or purpose in nature. An idealistic or vitalistic component can be seen in teleology. Based on the vitalism and metaphysics of his time, D.D. Palmer provided chiropractic a teleological metaphor when he expounded the concept that there is a \"universal intelligence\" that is manifest in living things as an \"innate intelligence,\" which provides purpose, balance, and direction to all biologic function (Palmer, 1910). The classic medical concept of homeostasis also has its roots in the teleology of holism. **Chiropractors like to describe Palmer's theory as a metaphor. I think it is more meaningful to describe it as a delusion. Although many great advances in 20th-century medicine have resulted from the mechanistic application of the scientific method (e.g., antibiotics for bacterial infections), science has also seen advances from theories based on global, contextual overviews of the environment (e.g., Darwinian concepts on evolution) (Mootz, 1995). Mechanistic philosophy in medical practice has made significant contributions in many clinical situations, particularly for emergent conditions. However, mechanistic or reductionistic approaches have not been as successful with chronic degenerative disease. The concept of holism is difficult to approach with scientific methodology; it cannot be measured, tested, or operationally defined. **In other words, holistic notions cannot be disproved. Holism defines current methods of mechanistic determinism and reductionism because it is not finite (Mootz, 1995). Yet in practice, physicians implicitly rely on a patient's innate ability to heal. Ledermann (1970) articulated physicians' relationship with a patient's ability to self-heal) this way: Physicians \"cannot measure this power in units, but they attempt to gauge its strength. A surgeon for instance who envisages a major operation on a patient must assess this person's capacity to stand up to the strain of the operation, and he must therefore estimate his vitality, his holistic power. Any doctor is concerned with the holistic recuperative power of his patients\" (Ledermann, 1970, pp. 34-35). **In making such judgments, surgeons would consider the patient's general health, cardiac status, and a large number of other measurable factors that enable reasonable prediction. Of course, some people do much better or much worse than expected. The above paragraph attributes this to \"holistic power,\" which cannot be measured. Holism can be taken to a dogmatic extreme and if trusted implicitly, the holistic application of any method of natural healing may fail to prevent illness or restore health. When viable nonholistic alternatives to healing exist, contemporary Western society typically dictates their use if natural methods are insufficient or seem unreasonable. For example, although a bone or joint infection may eventually be able to fully heal with natural means, albeit with deformity and risk of systemic infection, a more reasonable (and socially acceptable) course is to treat the patient with a timely application of antibiotic therapy. As Ledermann (1970,pp. 32-33) states, \"the unspecific approach is thus limited, and it is the duty of the therapist to assess each patient's condition and to apply specific measures, based on the mechanistic-materialistic approach, if necessary.\" **In other words, treatment is a good idea if it will help a sick person to get better. I wonder how many of our tax dollars were spent to support this brilliantly written report. A complete reliance on a holistic universal intelligence entails dogma and is not acceptable in current chiropractic philosophy or practice (Phillips, 1992). Although untestable scientifically, the concepts proposed by chiropractic's metaphor (and holistic models in general) can still be subject to critical review and refinement (Milus, 1995). **Attempting to do this would be about as useful as attempting to measure the number of angels that would fit on the head of a pin. If you don't believe me, read Dr. Milus's article. His address at the time it was published was Thomas B. Milus, DC, 90 E. Tasman Drive, San Jose, CA 95134. Popper (1960) suggested that the formulation of proper lines of questioning about new knowledge and ideas can be useful. For example, rather than defending assertions (or questioning the source of knowledge) about the body's self-healing capacity, one might try to identify and revise conceptions regarding self-healing that are inconsistent with available evidence. D. Chiropractic's Unique Perspective Although chiropractic shares much with other health professions, its emphasis and application of philosophy distinguishes it from modern medicine. Chiropractic philosophy gravitates toward a contextual, naturopathic approach to health care (Black, 1990). Aspects of the chiropractic perspective that reflect its holistic orientation are listed in Table 1. | | Table 1. Chiropractic Perspectives That Reflect a Holistic Approach to Patient Care | | By comparison, the traditional, allopathic model suggests that disease is the result of an environmental agent's virulence overwhelming the host organism (Mootz, 1995). **No they don't. The scientific health-care model gives appropriate weight to both types of factors. Since the perceived cause is environmental in nature, the solution is to counter the perceived environmental factor (e.g., using an antibiotic for a bacterial infection). The naturopathic approach provides a different perception as to the nature of disease causation. As Palmer originally queried, why would one individual working in the identical environment become sick when the other remained healthy (Palmer, 1910)? The traditional naturopathic answer is that one exhibited a decreased host resistance, hence, the appropriate solution would be to direct treatment at the host in order to strengthen it, regardless of the nature of any environmental agents. **They claim to do this, but there is little evidence to substantiate that they actually do it. In contemporary clinical practice, one can find elements of both naturopathic and allopathic philosophy among all types of providers.\u00b7 The difference between chiropractic and traditional naturopathy and osteopathy may be less obvious. Osteopathy originally emphasized the relationship body structure was thought to have with the circulation of \"vital body fluids.\" However, the osteopathic profession in the United States essentially evolved parallel with traditional medicine. The result has been that many, if not most, contemporary osteopathic physicians practice nearly identically to medical providers. Osteopathy has long incorporated surgical and pharmaceutical approaches in training and practice, in great measure to the exclusion of manual procedures. **Yes, the belief that osteopathic manipulation can boost general health is gradually fading away. Much like chiropractic, contemporary osteopathic approaches to manual treatment methods have also emphasized neurological aspects of the body's structure/function relationships over their original circulatory models. Today, the similarities between some contemporary chiropractic and osteopathic approaches are substantial; however, the chiropractic profession as a whole centers itself exclusively on manual (e.g., spinal adjusting, manipulation, muscle work, exercise) and physiologic (e.g., nutrition, lifestyle modification) approaches to healing. **In other words, some osteopaths and chiropractors still cling to their [cultist roots](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html). As with traditional naturopaths, there is vigilance among chiropractors to the adage do no harm, which continues to position mainstream chiropractic as a drugless (as well as nonsurgical) healing art. Naturopaths tend to emphasize physiologic approaches to healing more than many chiropractic traditionalists. Interestingly, the early evolution of chiropractic and naturopathy had much in common. Many of the early naturopathic and chiropractic schools offered dual degree tracts and there was much incorporation of each other's clinical approaches in practice. Another characteristic of chiropractors' training is an emphasis on the importance of clear communication with patients. Chiropractors have traditionally allowed time to provide detailed reports of clinical findings and discussion of treatment plans to patients in clear, understandable terms. **Yes, but not necessarily accurate terms. Chiropractors are notorious for their \"reports of findings,\" during which they relate the patient's symptoms to [\"subluxations\"](../../../01General/chirosub.html) and recommend multiple spinal adjustments to correct them. However, like all health care providers, contemporary chiropractic physicians are confronting the challenges of increased demands for clinical efficiency and cost-containment. E. Distinctions Between Traditional and Contemporary Chiropractic Belief Systems Traditional and contemporary chiropractic philosophies both display the dualism of testable principle (materialism) and untestable metaphor (holism). However, contemporary chiropractic incorporates a new perspective that escaped the early traditionalists (Milus, 1995; Phillips, 1992). There is recognition that the untestable constructs of holism cannot be used to rationalize explanations for clinically observed phenomenon. There is also appreciation for and understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry. Contemporary chiropractic philosophers have communicated a greater understanding of scientific methods and critical inquiry (Mootz, 1995; Milus, 1995). Theory development, even in qualitative domains and with scientifically untestable models, can be subject to critical review and refinement. **Chiropractic philosophy\u2014old and new\u2014may give comfort to its adherents, but it has no practical value for treating patients. The better chiropractic schools, including the one headed by Dr. Phillips, no longer emphasize Palmer's metaphysical notions. However, they are still taught at most of the others. Modern-day chiropractic also recognizes that confidence in chiropractic methods is not a substitute for substantive description, observation, evaluation, and communication of chiropractic concepts to society at large. A clear elucidation of its philosophy and avoidance of the dogma and rhetoric that has characterized uncritical doctrines in both medicine and chiropractic in the past will enhance the future success of chiropractic. Some self-proclaimed \"chiropractic philosophers\" of today continue to confuse medical bashing, rhetoric, and enthusiasm for chiropractic with philosophy. Even chiropractic's most prominent early \"philosopher,\" B.J. Palmer, made the distinction between having pride and enthusiasm about what chiropractors do, and philosophy (Mootz, 1992). **In other words, if chiropractors want to make claims, they should use scientific methodology and test their claims with well-designed studies. The percentage of chiropractors who would agree with this is unknown. Genuine embrace of this idea would require abandoning quack methods of diagnosis and treatment that are still widely used. It would be interesting to know what the authors mean by \"modern-day chiropractors\" and what percentage of the profession would meet their criteria. My guess is that the majority would not. The \"uncritical doctrines\" of medicine's past occurred before the development of scientific methodology an, as far as I can tell, no longer exist today. Chiropractic's \"uncritical doctrines,\" though less prominent, are still very much in evidence. F. Variation in Chiropractic Perspectives The terms \"straight\" and \"mixer\" were used by early chiropractors to distinguish between chiropractors whose therapeutic armamentaria included only manual adjusting and those who also used other therapies such as nutritional and lifestyle counseling or physiotherapeutic modalities. Historically, chiropractic schools would affiliate with a particular national professional association that gravitated toward a \"straight\" or \"mixer\" perspective. Although there are still remnants of this dichotomy, the situation has changed with the advent of federally recognized accreditation, research consortia, and more collaborative political agendas. Distinctions among current chiropractic perspectives are complex and can no longer be viewed as a simple dichotomy. **That's true, but the terms \"straight\" and \"mixer are still widely used. In fact, one school (Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic) even uses the term \"straight\" in its name. Table 2 lists some of the attributes of chiropractic belief systems and indicates the range of perspectives along each philosophical dimension. |Perspective A comprehensive survey of chiropractic practitioners' philosophic beliefs could not be found, although a recent study offers some insight into treatment scope preferences (Christensen, 1993). In a nationwide survey of more than 6,000 practicing chiropractors, over two-thirds reported using nonadjustive techniques such as exercise, nutritional counseling, and various physiotherapeutic modalities. More than 93 percent of chiropractors report using a full-spine adjustive approach (i.e., general adjustive procedures that may involve any region of the spine) as their primary chiropractic treatment procedure. The remainder characterized themselves as emphasizing upper cervical methods (2 percent) or other techniques (5 percent). **The survey, done in 1991, garnered responses from 4,835 full-time practitioners. The nonadjustive techniques included: exercises of respondents); ice packs/cryotherapy (92.6%); bracing (90.8%); nutritional counseling, therapy or supplements (83.5%); bed rest (82%); foot orthotics or heel lifts pack/moist entails quack diagnostic tests and the sale of irrationally prescribed supplements. Meridian therapy and homeopathy are not valid approaches. In addition to standard methods, the adjustive techniques included activator cranial therapy (27.2%), and several others that are extremely dubious. Taken together, these data suggest to me that more than 80% of chiropractors are involved in unscientific and/or quack practices. Even if this estimate is a bit high, what do you think it means that Drs. Mootz and Phillips failed to reveal these findings? There are two significant, well-established national chiropractic trade associations. The largest is the American Chiropractic Association (ACA), which is believed to include about 25 percent of chiropractors in the United States as members. The ACA (and its precursor organization the National Chiropractic Association) has historically been associated with a broad-scope approach to chiropractic practice and appears to be most representative of the mainstream of the profession. The International Chiropractors Association (ICA) is primarily a U.S.-based alternative to the ACA and has a much smaller membership (believed to count between 5-10 percent of chiropractors among its dues-paying members). The ICA tends to position itself as representative of members with more traditional chiropractic perspectives. **Yes, and it is opposed to immunization and fluoridation. A few other national groups identify with more extreme perspectives. The National Association of Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) supports limiting chiropractors to only the treatment of certain musculoskeletal conditions, while the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA) promotes addressing only a single chiropractic spinal lesion, the vertebral subluxation. However, both organizations are proprietary (as opposed to being representative of their memberships) and have a very small number of members (believed to be in the low hundreds). **The National Association for Chiropractic Medicine> was a reformist group that renounced Palmer's theories as delusions and was the only chiropractic organization to speak out against the gamut of quack chiropractic practices. What do you think it means that Drs. Mootz and Phillips would describe it as \"extreme\"? G. Summary Traditional chiropractic belief systems focused on the body's ability to self-heal, the nervous system's role in overall health, and the role body structure was thought to play in function of the nervous system. Early articulation of these concepts by chiropractors was often cloaked in terminology that conveyed spiritual connotations. In addition, vitalistic explanations of self-healing confounded many outside the profession when used by early chiropractors to deny the value of quantitative evidence on clinical effectiveness. Contemporary chiropractic belief systems embrace a blend of experience, conviction, critical thinking, open-mindedness, and appreciation of the natural order of things. Emphasis is on the tangible, testable principle that structure affects function, and, the untestable, metaphorical recognition that life is self-sustaining and the doctor's aim is to foster the establishment and maintenance of an organism-environment dynamic that is the most conducive to functional well-being. **Chiropractors hope to substantiate their usefulness without having to abandon Palmer's notions. Whether this is possible remains to be seen. Contemporary chiropractic philosophy recognizes its partnership with the greater body of philosophy and science in general. Most contemporary chiropractors and their organizations distinguish between what is known and what is believed. **I am not sure whether this can be measured. I don't think it has been. Chiropractic belief systems embrace the holistic paradigm of wellness while incorporating deterministic materialism for the establishment of valid chiropractic principles. Chiropractic's philosophic foundation serves as the basis for theoretical development, not a substitution for it (Phillips, 1992). **A better view would be that Palmer's theories are a millstone around chiropractic's neck.

Cherkin, PhD; William C. Meeker, DC, MPH **Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, M.D. This chapter summarizes what has been learned from clinical trials about the benefits of spinal manipulation for specific problems and from case reports about the risks of spinal manipulation. In addition, findings of studies examining the ability of spinal manipulation to increase patient satisfaction, decrease cost, or increase cost-effectiveness of care are summarized. A. Evidence for Benefits of Spinal Manipulation from Clinical Trials For any health care intervention, it is hoped that the expected benefits exceed the expected risks. The most rigorous method for establishing efficacy of a treatment is the randomized controlled trial (RCT). There have been many RCTs of spinal manipulation for a variety of different patient presentations, as well as many reviews of these RCTs (Assendelft, 1995). This section summarizes both primary data and reviews of studies of the impact of spinal manipulation on patient outcomes, particularly symptoms and function. 1. Musculoskeletal Conditions Low Back Pain There have been at least 36 randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation for patients with low back pain (Koes, 1996). These studies have been of variable quality, as assessed both explicitly and implicitly by several independent investigators. The two highest quality reviews of spinal manipulation for low back pain reached somewhat different conclusions (Koes, 1991, 1996; Shekelle, 1992). The first review, conducted in 1991 and updated in 1996, noted the heterogeneity in study quality and treatments, and did not attempt statistical combinations of individual studies (Koes, 1991,1996). These reviews concluded that it is not conclusively proven that spinal manipulation is beneficial for any low back pain clinical syndrome. A 1992 meta-analysis concluded that in some patient presentations spinal manipulation is more efficacious than both sham manipulation and the medical therapies to which it has been compared (Shekelle, 1992). This meta-analysis included nine studies of manipulation for patients with acute or subacute (less than a few weeks' duration) low-back pain uncomplicated by sciatica. The two best quality studies found a clinically and statistically significant benefit of manipulation in terms of functional status in patients whose pain had persisted between 2 and 4 weeks prior to treatment (Hadler, 1987; MacDonald, 1990). These studies used sophisticated composite measures of functional status, and the authors of the meta-analysis did not feel it valid to combine these two studies with the other studies, which used different outcome measures. The results of the remaining seven studies, along with the meta-analytic statistical combination of their results, are shown in Figure 5. The combined results of these studies indicated that spinal manipulation is more efficacious than the comparison treatments (Shekelle, 1992). Specifically, the probability of recovery 3 weeks after initiation of treatment was an average of 0.17 higher in the groups receiving manipulation, representing a 34 percent improvement in recovery. **I have not posted Figure 5 because it is copyrighted, difficult to understand, and adds nothing significant to the text of this report. I don't doubt that appropriate manipulation can relieve certain cases of low-back pain. However, the research findings don't necessarily reflect what happens to people who go to the \"average\" chiropractor. The Shekelle study (1992) also reported that there are insufficient data to reach a conclusion for patients with chronic low back pain or sciatica. The three trials of manipulation for sciatica were all of mediocre quality and their statistical combination favored manipulation but did not quite reach conventional levels of statistical significance. The controlled trials of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain included in the 1992 review reached conflicting conclusions and their heterogeneity precluded statistical combination. Since the Shekelle and Koes reviews were completed, at least eight additional clinical trials have been published that compare treatments including spinal manipulation with various other treatments for patients with low back pain The results of these trials are mixed. Of the four studies including patients with acute low back pain, one study of patients felt to have sacroiliac joint dysfunction did not show a benefit for spinal manipulation in relief of pain (Herzog, 1991), another study demonstrated that the addition of spinal manipulation to exercise therapy improved functional and pain outcomes measured at one month (Erhard, 1994), and two \"pragmatic\" studies found manipulation combined with other treatments to be superior to conventional nonmanipulative therapy (Koes, 1992; Blomberg, 1994). Another study of patients with subacute low back pain showed a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in pain in the group receiving manipulation (Pope, 1994). For patients with chronic back pain, the one new study that specifically compared spinal manipulation to an artfully conducted sham showed, as other studies have, a benefit in terms of pain relief (but not improved function) after 2 weeks of manipulation (Triano, 1995). Two other studies recently reported long-term followup of patients treated with manipulation by either physiotherapists or chiropractors compared to other forms of care. Both studies reported somewhat better outcomes after one or more years for the patients who received manipulation (Koes, 1992; Meade, 1995). The addition of these new trials would not seem to alter the conclusions of the prior review and meta-analysis. Based on the available evidence, convincing conclusions cannot be made regarding net benefits of spinal manipulation for patients with chronic low back pain or sciatica. Depending upon whether one accepts or rejects the validity of statistical combinations of studies, there either is or is not conclusive evidence that spinal manipulation is of benefit to patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain. These evidence-based conclusions are in general accordance with those of a multidisciplinary expert panel convened to rate the appropriateness of spinal manipulation for low back pain syndromes (Shekelle, 1991). A recent systematic review of the literature assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for patients with low back pain (Assendelft, 1996a). **This is an important distinction. Most of the studies reviewed by Koes (1991, 1996) and Shekelle (1992) were performed by medical doctors and physical therapists. It would be improper to apply their findings to chiropractors. An exhaustive search of the literature identified eight randomized clinical trials. Four of these studies were restricted to patients with chronic pain while the remainder included both acute and chronic pain. All of the studies had serious design flaws and because they used a wide variety of outcome measures and followup intervals the results were not statistically combined. The findings of the eight studies were mixed. The authors concluded that their review failed to find convincing evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic for acute or chronic low back pain and that higher quality studies would be needed before firm conclusions for or against the effectiveness of chiropractic could be reached (Assendelft, 1996a). It should be noted that, in the back pain literature, seriously flawed studies that reach inconsistent conclusions are not unique to studies of spinal manipulation. In fact, a recent evidence-based review of conservative and surgical interventions for acute back pain failed to identify any interventions supported by multiple high-quality scientific studies (Bigos, 1994). Thus, despite the poor quality of many of the studies evaluating its effectiveness, there is as much or more evidence for the effectiveness of spinal manipulation as for other non-surgical treatments for back pain. Neck Pain After low back pain, neck pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek chiropractic care. Only five randomized clinical trials have examined the efficacy of spinal manipulation for neck pain (Koes, 1992; Cassidy, 1992; Howe, 1983; Sloop, 1982; Vernon, 1990). Like those for low back pain, the clinical trials of manipulation for neck pain varied widely in terms of quality. Most study results favored the group treated with manipulation, although conventional levels of statistical significance were reached for only some of the outcomes. The best quality study compared physical therapist-provided manipulation to nonmanipulative physical therapy (Koes, 1992), detuned diathermy, and usual general practitioner care for patients with nonspecific low back pain and neck pain syndromes. Overall, this study concluded that both of the physical therapist-treated groups had better outcomes than the other two groups, and that the group receiving manipulation did slightly but statistically significantly better at one year than the group receiving nonmanipulative physical therapy. Results of analysis restricted to the 64 persons with neck pain alone favored the manipulated group but did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the small sample size (less than 20 persons per group). A recent meta-analysis reviewed studies of patients with several neck pain clinical syndromes who had received a variety of \"manual therapies\" including manipulation and mobilization (Aker, 1996). This analysis found a benefit for the manual therapy-treated group. However, because of the heterogeneity among patient types and treatments, one cannot directly attribute this benefit to manipulation or to any particular patient presentation. Headache For patients with muscle tension type headache, the best quality clinical trial showed statistically significant improvements for the manipulated group, compared to a group treated with amitriptyline, in terms of headache intensity assessed 4 weeks after concluding 6 weeks of therapy (Boline, 1995). Two studies of lesser quality also reported short-term benefits for the group treated with manipulation (Hoyt, 1979; Jentsen, 1987). The only clinical trial of manipulation for patients with migraine headache compared it to mobilization and reported decreases in pain intensity in the patients treated with manipulation but no differences with respect to mean frequency or duration of attacks, or mean disability (Parker, 1978). Other Musculoskeletal Conditions The potential benefits of manipulative therapy for other musculoskeletal conditions are largely unknown and limited to case series reports. There is a clear need for research in this area. 2. Nonmusculoskeletal Conditions Based on personal experience, some chiropractors believe that manipulation can beneficially influence the body's overall healing capacity. However, there is little evidence to support this and it is possible that some of the more dramatic reports of recovery from nonmusculoskeletal conditions resulted from original misdiagnoses, the effect of concurrent treatments, or from remissions that would have occurred regardless of treatment. **It is \"possible\" that some of the more dramatic reports of recovery are due to coincidental factors such as the natural course of the ailment? It is more than possible. It is probable. Many of the nonmusculoskeletal conditions believed by some to respond to manipulative therapy may be conditions of a functional nature that lack a well-defined medical treatment regimen (e.g., somatization). These conditions are often caused or exacerbated by psychological stress and therefore may be responsive to attention from a caring healer who conveys to the patient a sense that he or she can help. While it is also possible that manual (hands-on) therapy causes a neurological response that leads to reductions in stress-related symptoms and improvements in the functional disorder, this remains speculative. The interrelationship among functional disorders, stress, and the status of the neuromusculoskeletal system is in need of additional research. There is now a small body of published studies examining the effect of chiropractic manipulative care on nonmusculoskeletal health conditions. The conditions studied include, but are not limited to hypertension (Vernon, 1986; McNight, chronic pelvic pain (Browning, 1989; Hawk, 1997). A recent systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for nonmusculoskeletal conditions concluded that \"SMT seems to be nonefficacious in the treatment of hypertension and chronic moderately severe asthma in adults\" but that the evidence was not strong enough to proscribe the use of SMT for these conditions (Bronfort, 1996). The review further concluded that, because of the small number and poor quality of the available studies, \"there is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of SMT in the treatment of vertigo, nocturnal childhood enuresis, dysmenorrhea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, duodenal ulcer, and infantile colic.\" **Since medical treatment for duodenal ulcer is extremely effective, it would be ridiclous to recommend manipulation as a treatment. Since there is no good reason to think that manipulaion would be effective for any of the other conditions, I believe that is sufficient evidence to advise against it. Put in real-life terms, if chiropractors feel they have to manipulate patients for nonmusculokeletal conditions, they should inform them that there are no proven benefits and should not charge them. Chiropractic researchers are currently planning or undertaking (as of 1997) randomized trials or cohort studies of the effectiveness of manual treatment procedures for childhood asthma, chronic pelvic pain, otitis media, vascular lability in migraine headache patients, dysmenorrhea, mild hypertension, and migraine headache. **It will be interesting to see whether any such studies will be sufficiently well-designed to determine manipulative treatment is useful for any of these conditions. If no benefit is found, it will be even more interesting to see whether any chiropractors stop doing anything found ineffective. The idea of chiropractors treating ear problems is particularly worrisome to be because I do not believe that the average chiropractor knows how to examine an ear or to recognize when antibiotic therapy is appropriate. B. Risks of Spinal Manipulation Until recently, there have been no systematic reports of the complications or risks of spinal manipulation, and all that was known came from case reports and clinical trials (Assendelft, 1996b). Recently, however, data from a prospective study of side effects of spinal manipulation performed by 102 Norwegian chiropractors on 1,058 new patients have become available (Senstad, 1997). After an average of about 4.5 visits, 55 percent of the patients reported at least one reaction to the manipulation. The most commonly reported reactions were: local discomfort (53 percent), headache (12 percent), tiredness, (11 percent) and radiating discomfort (10 percent). Only 15 percent of reactions were considered \"severe\" and no serious complications were reported. Most reactions appeared within 4 hours of treatment and had disappeared within 24 hours. Reactions were more likely to be reported by women, following the first treatment, when multiple spinal regions were treated and when only the thoracic spine was treated (Senstad, 1996). A cause-and-effect relationship between the manipulation and the reactions has not been established and it is likely that some of the reactions attributed to manipulation were, in fact, coincidental. **The 102 Norweigian chiropractors (70% of the chiropractors in Norway) collected data on 12 new patients each for up to six treatments. The 1,058 patients for whom adequate data were collected underwent a total of 4712 treatments. Patients who reported adverse reactions were asked to grade their discomfort on a 4-point scale, with 1 being \"minor\" and 4 being \"unbearable.\" Although no \"serious complications\" were reported, 12 patients considered their discomfort unbearable. It would have been interesting to know what prcentage of patients had a condition for which manipulation makes sense. No systematic reports of the rate of serious complications of spinal manipulation have been conducted in the United States. Case reports may underestimate the true number of adverse events, including serious ones, or be so poorly documented that a true cause-and-effect relationship is not established. Furthermore, the total number of persons who have received spinal manipulation, and their clinical presentation, is unknown. Nevertheless, using data from case reports on the number of complications and epidemiologic estimates of the number of lumbar spinal manipulations received during the time period covered by the case reports, it was possible to roughly estimate the rate of occurrence of the most serious complication of lumbar manipulation, the cauda equina syndrome, as about 1 case per 100 million manipulations (Shekelle, 1992). It is probably higher in patients with a herniated nucleus pulposus, and lower in patients without this anatomic abnormality. As there are no systematic data about the rate of serious complications due to spinal manipulation, it is not known if the rate varies by provider type. In the best documented study published to date, Haldeman (1992) describes the outcomes of 10 patients with cauda equina syndrome believed to have been caused by spinal manipulation (without anesthesia). Most of these patients subsequently underwent surgical decompression and were left with residual neurologic deficits that ranged from paresis to mild constipation. Serious complications of cervical spine manipulation are also rare (none having been reported in any of the clinical trials), but appear to be more common and severe than complications of lumbar manipulation. The most serious complication of cervical spine manipulation is related to compromise of the vertebrobasilar artery, leading to stroke or death. As with lumbar manipulations, limited data preclude an exact estimate of the frequency of this complication, or identification of risk factors for its occurrence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk is higher for manipulation involving rotation plus extension of the cervical spine than for other types of manipulation, and that persons who have suffered manipulation-related vertebrobasilar artery compromise do not have the same clinical characteristics as patients who suffer vertebrobasilar artery compromise due to atherosclerotic disease. The best estimate of the incidence of vertebrobasilar artery compromise related to cervical spine manipulation is that it occurs once in 1 million manipulations (Hurwitz, 1996; McGregor, 1995). **It would be more meaningful to report the rate of complications per patient rather than per manipulation, since patients who experience complications are likely to have fewer treatments. Estimates of serious complication rates are not reliable because there is no systematic data collection. I know of at least a dozen cases of stroke and other serious complications that were not reported in scientific journals. It should be kept in mind that, while spinal manipulation has its risks and benefits, so do other treatments for back and neck pain. For example, medications commonly used for back pain can cause significant complications (Anker, 1994; Bjarnason, 1993) as can lumbar surgery (Hoffman, 1993; McGregor, 1995). However, most randomized clinical trials directly comparing spinal manipulation with other types of nonoperative treatment have reported no complications in either group, suggesting that the risks of these nonoperative treatments are low. The risks and benefits of spinal manipulation have not been compared to those for surgery. Optimal care of back pain patients will require balancing the risks and benefits of alternative treatments. At present, however, comparative data for these largely low-risk therapies are not available. C. Patient Satisfaction with Chiropractic Care Observational studies have consistently found that low back pain patients receiving chiropractic care, which typically includes (but is not restricted to) spinal manipulation, are more satisfied than those receiving medical care (Cherkin, 1989; Carey, 1995; Kane, 1974). How much of this enhanced satisfaction is a specific result of the spinal manipulation per se is not known. There are other reasons why one might expect chiropractic care to be more satisfying than medical care. For example, chiropractors have more frequent and closer contact with their patients, they are more comfortable and confident dealing with back pain, they provide patients with a clearer explanation of the cause of their problem (often documented on an x-ray), and they do not need to refer the patient for physical treatment (Cherkin, 1988; Coulehan, 1985). In addition, persons who choose to see chiropractors may differ in some way from those who see medical doctors. **For one thing, their problem may not be as severe. D. Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Chiropractic Care The annual cost of chiropractic care in the United States is not known with certainty, but has been estimated at $3.5 billion in 1987 (Nichols, 1996). In the United States. In 1990, an estimated $13.7 billion was spent on all types of unconventional medicine and chiropractors were by far the unconventional practitioner most often seen (Eisenberg, 1993). **The $13.7 billion estimate in Eisenberg's article was nonsensical and was not supported by the data in the article. In addition, the authors of this chapter have misinterprted both the data and what Eisenberg reported. Ten percent of 1539 people polled said they had undergone chiropractic treatment, but only 70% of these said they had seen a provider. (Eisenberg didn't explain how the other 30% could have had chiropractic tretament without seeing a chiropractor.) Census data published in 1995 indicate that income for chiropractic offices and clinics totaled $6.6 billion in 1992. I am surprised that the authors were unaware of this. The relative cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and medical care has not been convincingly established (Assendelft, 1993; Manga, 1994). Most studies have failed to compare equivalent patients, measure clinically useful outcomes, and include both direct and indirect costs in the comparison. To date, no randomized clinical trials including explicit measures of direct and indirect costs have been published. What is available are many case-control studies of costs (but not patient outcomes) using Worker's Compensation data (Assendelft, 1993), a few studies of only cost based on claims data analyses (Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 1986; Stano, 1993; Mushinski, 1995; controlled trial of effectiveness that imputed (but did not explicitly measure) total costs (Meade, 1995), and a recent prospective observational study of patients with acute low back pain which reported outcomes as well as calculated direct costs (Carey, 1995). Although the majority of these studies have found that chiropractic care was less expensive than medical care (Assendelft, 1993), some have found the opposite to be true (Nyiendo, 1991; Greenwood, 1985). The main limitation of all these studies is their inability to adequately control for differences in the types of patients served by chiropractors and medical doctors. It is possible that persons choosing treatment from a chiropractor differ substantially from those seeking medical care in ways that cannot be adequately controlled for using the limited data that are usually available from databases designed for billing purposes. In the one observational study that prospectively measured both clinically relevant outcomes and calculated direct medical costs, clinical outcomes were no different between medically (primary care or orthopedist) and chiropractically treated patients, but chiropractic care and orthopedic care cost more (Carey, 1995). Chiropractic patients, however, were more satisfied with their care. This study involved only a single State (North Carolina) that had had virtually no managed care experience with chiropractic services. Ultimately, randomized clinical trials that include cost measures will be needed to satisfactorily answer this question. **Meanwhile, of course, many chiropractors and their organizations continue to represent that chiropractic treatment is better, more cost-effective, and rated higher in satisfaction than medical treatment.

Vernon, DC **Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, M.D. Manipulation is a form of treatment that dates to antiquity and has been practiced in some form in most cultures since that time (Lomax, 1997; Anderson, 1992). One of the first theories related to manipulation might be the statement attributed to Hippocrates: \"Look to the spine as the cause of disease.\" The theories of the early pioneers of chiropractic were firmly grounded in notions that had been widely held in the 1800s, particularly the idea of \"spinal irritability\" and its correlation with disease (Lomax, 1997; Terrett, 1987). Theories on the nature of the primary spinal disorder amenable to manipulation and on the mechanisms of action of spinal manipulation abound within chiropractic, osteopathy, physiotherapy, and manual medicine. The original chiropractic theory suggested that misaligned spinal vertebrae interfered with nerve function, ultimately resulting in altered physiology that could contribute to pain and disease. In recent decades, chiropractic theories about how mechanical spinal joint dysfunction might influence neurophysiology have undergone significant modification and reflect more contemporary views of physiology (Gatterman, 1995). **The above paragraph is intended to suggest that modern chiropractic theory has deep historical roots and has evolved along with other health sciences. That certainly is not true. Palmer originally declared that such misalignments cause abnormal tension (\"tone\") in the nearby nerves and that disturbed nerve tone causes 95% of all diseases. Later he elaborated a biotheology holding that: (1) \"Innate Intelligence,\" or \"nerve energy,\" flows throughout the nervous system and controls every bodily activity not under voluntary control, (2) even slight spinal misalignments hinder this flow, causing people to become ill, and (3) manual manipulation (\"adjustment\") of the spine is the remedy. It is true that \"chiropractic theories . . . have undergone significant modification and reflect more contemporary physiology.\" However, the old dogma still plays a significant role in the thinking of most chiropractors. Spinal manipulative procedures produce a short-lasting (100-300 milliseconds), high velocity impulse into the body (Herzog, 1996; Triano, 1992). Herzog (1996, p.271) has summarized the work done on manipulative forces in his laboratory (Conway, 1993; Gal, 1995; peak and preload forces achieved in CSMT (chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy) were lowest for (manipulations) in the cervical spine\" while being similar in the thoracic and lumbo-pelvic regions. 2. \"The peak forces achieved using a (mechanical assistive adjusting device) were considerably smaller than any of the peak forces resulting from CSMT.\" Triano and colleagues (Triano, 1992; Brennan, 1992) have quantified the applied forces of a manipulation and correlated them with physiologic responses (changes in leukocyte function) such that a threshold of approximately 500 N distinguishes potentially effective from \"noneffective\" procedures. When joint structures are rapidly stretched in this manner, cavitation occurs internally and an audible \"pop\" may be heard. Brodeur (1995) reviewed the historical literature on joint cavitation, particularly the work of Sandoz (1976) in defining the \"paraphysiologic space\" and Mierau, (1988) in identifying the vacuum phenomenon created by rapid joint distraction with cavitation. The work of Mierau (1988) also provided the first experimental evidence of increased range of motion after cavitation. Herzog's group has addressed the issue of whether vertebrae actually move. Gal, (1995) provide evidence of absolute and relative intervertebral movements resulting from CSMT (see review by Herzog, 1996). The hypothesized effects of manipulation common to most modern schools of thought can be categorized as either mechanical or neurological. In fact, manipulation has been described \"as mechanical treatment with reflex effects\" (Arkuszewski, 1988). In terms of mechanical issues, the manipulable spinal disorder (traditionally termed \"subluxation\" in chiropractic, \"somatic dysfunction\" in osteopathy, and \"fixation\" or \"functional blockage\" in manual medicine) is characterized as a spinal joint strain/sprain with associated local and referred pain and muscle spasm. The function of the spinal joint is deranged by virtue of static misalignment and/or reduction of motion (i.e., \"fixation,\" \"blockage,\" or the more generic term \"hypomobility\"). Mechanisms that have been proposed for this dysfunction, particularly the hypomobility, include: 1. Entrapment of a zygapophyseal joint inclusion or meniscoid (which have been shown to be heavily innervated by nociceptors (Giles, 1987; Bogduk, 1985). 2. Entrapment of a fragment of posterior annular material from the intervertebral disc (again, innervated by nociceptors) (Bogduk, 1981, 1985). 3. Stiffness induced by adhesions and scar tissue from previous injury and/or degenerative changes and adaptive shortening of myofascial tissues (Arkuszewski, 1988; Lantz, 1995). 4. Excessive activity (spasm, hypertonicity) of the deep intrinsic spinal musculature, particularly in unilateral, asymmetric patterns (Blunt, 1995; Buerger, 1983). Mechanisms of action of manipulation, which have been proposed to affect these mechanical issues, include: (1) release of entrapped synovial or disc tissues, thus reducing pain and restoring mobility; (2) stretching and breaking of adhesions; (3) the dynamic stretching of musculature and myofascial tissues. Korr (1975), Grice (1974), and Buerger (1983) proposed that manipulation might exert its effect by dynamic stretching of the muscle spindles and Golgi Tendon Organs (copiously located in the deep spinal muscles) thereby resetting the length/tension ratio in these muscles. Herzog, (1995), Suter, (1994), and Triano (1992) have studied reflex muscular responses to CSMT and have reported brief but substantial reflex contractions which appear to be contingent on the speed of impulse (high-velocity) rather than the presence or absence of cavitation. Whether these brief bursts of spinal EMG activity represent a prerequisite to subsequent relaxation or \"resetting of muscle spindle gain\" remains to be demonstrated conclusively, although preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated attenuation of spinal EMG activity post-manipulation (Thabe, 1982; Shambaugh, 1987). The second category of hypothesized mechanisms involves \"neurological\" issues. The classical theory of \"pinched nerve\" has given way to a model that includes both direct and indirect effects on the function of the peripheral and central nervous system resulting from spinal dysfunction. Direct effects (or what Korr (1975) calls \"non-impulse\"-based mechanisms) involve compression/irritation of the neural structures in and around the intervertebral foramen. This area is a fertile zone for entrapment of neural structures responsible for pain, sensation, motor, and autonomic function. Effects of partial occlusion of the nerve bed, such as those that might occur with disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, or spinal instability, have been investigated (Triano, 1982). Dynamic perturbations of the nerve rubbing across a partial obstruction give rise to inflammatory responses. The putative effects of such neural compressions are currently better understood in \"orthopedic\" terms as neurogenic pain, and reduced sensation and motor power (i.e., as a radiculopathy). The effects of compression on autonomic structures (nerves, rami, and ganglia), however, are only just beginning to be understood, although chiropractors have theorized that these effects may extend to visceral function (Lantz, 1995). **It could be asked whether these theories have the slightest practical value. Lantz's chapter claims that \"the vertebral subluxation complex . . . allows for every aspect of chiropractic management to be integrated into a single conceptual model, a sort of 'unified field theory' of chiropractic\" and \"allows each practioner to identify where he or she fits into the grand scheme of things . . . regardless of their particular approach management.\" In other words, anything chiropractors do is OK because they can somehow relate it to treating [\"subluxations\"](../../../01General/chirosub.html) which somehow are related to the gamut of health problems. The indirect effect of spinal dysfunction (what Korr (1975) called \"impulse-based\" mechanisms) involves the effects of persistent spinal pain and hypomobility on the reflex activities of the associated spinal cord levels (or \"neuromere\"). Korr (1975) proposed a model of \"central facilitation.\" Many mechanisms have been elucidated suggesting that spinal cord sensorimotor processing leads to \"activity-dependent changes\" or \"neuroplasticity,\" which results in long-lasting firing patterns that reinforce pain perception (Woolf, 1989; Mense, 1993; Gillette, 1995). The current term for such changes at the spinal cord level is \"central sensitization\" (Coderre, 1993). This model is now used to explain the clinical features of chronic pain, persistent motor changes, and autonomic dysfunction resulting from neuropathic and somatic pain. There is evidence that axial or spinal structures have particularly strong capacities to induce central sensitization (Gillette, 1995; Patterson, 1986; Hu, 1993) and thereby produce the clinical features described above, most predominantly back and neck pain. Proposed mechanisms of action of manipulation on these \"neurological\" phenomena can be divided into two categories: reduction of compressive insult to neural tissues, and the creation of stimulus-induced reflex changes. The former mechanism is relatively straightforward in that manipulation is hypothesized to relieve the compressive insult on nerve roots and autonomic fibers within the intervertebral foraminae, or affect disc/facet athropathy (and inflammatory or noninflammatory mechanisms). In the latter mechanism it is proposed that the dynamic stretching produced by manipulation (particularly when the \"crack\" of cavitation occurs) induces a barrage of activity in joint and muscular mechanoreceptors that is transmitted along \"large-fibre\" afferents and which produces inhibitory effects within the nervous system. These effects are proposed to be both local (i.e., at the spinal level) and \"central,\" in that they may involve so-called descending inhibitory pathways (Gillette, 1995; Le Bars, 1992; Vernon, 1986). These same mechanisms have been proposed to explain the therapeutic effects of acupuncture and TENS, and are generically known as \"stimulus-produced analgesia\" (Pressman, 1984). In other words, it is hypothesized that the deleterious effects of excitation in the pain and sensorimotor pathways are \"turned down\" (clinically = \"relieved\") by precise, therapeutic somatic stimulation. The spinal tissues appear to be particularly amenable to this process, probably because of their unique patterns of afferent input into the central nervous system, with a high level of convergence existing with other somatic and visceral inputs onto the same spinal tract projection cells (Gillette, 1995; Patterson, 1986; Hu, 1993). Although of great interest to many neuropathologists and chiropractors, these theories described remain largely speculative. A recent review of the limited basic science research in chiropractic noted that nearly all of the theories of the effects and mechanisms of action of spinal manipulation still lack adequate research and that no definitive anatomic or biomechanical studies have yet identified the lesion manipulated (Brennan, 1997). **In other words, despite 100 years of theorizing, chiropractors have not been able to figure out what they are doing. The few animal studies performed to date have failed to provide conclusive support for or against the existence of a spinal lesion. Human studies have also been inconclusive. **In other words, despite 100 years of babbling about spinal misaligments and subluxations, they still can't agree on what they are talking about or demonstrate that the pathophysiologic entity they focus on treating actually exists. For example, of three studies of the effect of spinal manipulation on plasma beta-endorphin levels (which could be involved in relief of pain), one found a slight but statistically significant increase (Vernon, 1986) while the other two failed to confirm this (Christian, 1988; Sanders, 1990). Other studies of the effect of spinal manipulation on the immune system has shown strong consistency of the mechanistic action on chemiluminescence, but its clinical importance is not known (Brennan, 1997). **In other words, although spinal manipulation can cause measurable changes in certain components of the immune system, there is no clinical evidence that this improves immune function, as many chiropractors claim. The review by Brennan, concluded with recommendations for specific lines of investigation that are likely to produce more definitive conclusions regarding the potential physiological and anatomic mechanisms underlying the effects of spinal manipulation. The effect of spinal manipulation on patients with co-morbid metabolic and neurogenic complications, structural anomalies, injury, and aging continues to be fertile ground for further investigation. Models of biomechanical and physiological effects of these complications and natural events and discussions of manipulation effects are now emerging in the literature (Triano, in press). **Somethng is really missing from this chapter. [\"Subluxation\" theory](../../../01General/chirosub.html) is a hodgepodge of gobbledygook and delusion. Some chiropractors realize that it is absurd, some, others swallow it completely, and the rest believe (or pretend to believe) they can become science-based without giving it up.

However, the genesis of a new profession, chiropractic, is attributed to the date of 18 September 1895 and the place, Davenport, Iowa. Daniel David Palmer placed his hands upon an irregular protrusion of the spine of Harvey Lillard and with a forceful thrust reduced the irregularity. As a result, Mr. Lillard claimed to hear the wagons on the street, something he could not do prior to receiving the treatment (Palmer, 1910). **So the story goes. The fact that the nerves that enable hearing are confined to the skull does not seem to discourage chiropractors from telling this story. At the turn of the 19th century in rural America, health care was a craft more than an art. The integration of science into treatment methods and the training process was severely lacking as evidenced by the condemnation of medical colleges in the famed Flexner Report (Flexner, 1910). The consolidation of cultural authority (Starr, 1982) by the allopathic physicians had not yet been achieved and there were numerous competing practitioners such as magnetic healers, herbal healers, hydro healers, bone setters, and homeopaths. The growth of health care alternatives paralleled revivalism in religious practices and was thought to provide the physiological counterpart to the theological perfectionism of the time (Fuller, 1989). This crucible of confusion, filled with vitalism and magnetism, leeches and lances and tincture and plaster, provided a seed bed for creative thinking and new ideas. D.D. Palmer and chiropractic were, to a certain degree, a product of their environment. **In other words, don't hold Palmer's far-fetched ideas against him (or chiropractic), because they were largely products of the times and medical training was not much better. Actually, the better medical schools were vastly better than the early chiropractic schools. In early 20th-century America, allopathic providers obtained greater cultural authority and the respect of those who influenced decisionmaking. Opposition to unorthodox practitioners increased. The allopathic physician charged the doctor of chiropractic with practicing medicine without a license. The doctor of chiropractic retorted that practicing chiropractic and practicing medicine were different. To emphasize this difference, the chiropractic community developed a different lexicon and rationale for its approach (Keating, 1989). Medicine's search for a disease process, assigning appropriate labels, and providing the remedy of the day were different from chiropractic's search for an interference in the nervous system that was stated to ultimately, if not immediately, lead to dysfunction and disease. The doctor of chiropractic rejected the use of medicines and drugs and never incorporated the practice of surgery. Chiropractic was conceived as a more natural approach to healing, drawing upon the body's own recuperative powers. **In most cases, \"drawing on the body's recuperative powers\" was all that chiropractors could do, because \"interference in the nervous system\" does not \"ultimately, if not immediately lead to disease,\" and spinal \"adjustments\" have no demonstrable effect against the vast majority of human ailments. Nor do they have any proven effect on general health, resistance to disease, or the body's general recuperative ability. For most ailments, chiropractic treatment was the equivalent of doing nothing. Although adversity characterized much of organized medicine's relationship with chiropractic, this polarity was more frequently related to economic, political, and legal considerations than to clinical ones. **Palmer taught that spinal misalignments were the primary cause of disease. Even in the early days of chiropractic, the medical profession knew this idea was unfounded. The idea that medical opposition to chiropractic was economically based is absurd. In fact, D.D. Palmer credits a medical physician, Jim Atkinson, with teaching him about the use of bone setting in other cultures (Palmer, 1910, p. 789). G.H. Patchin, MD, has been credited with helping Palmer edit his book, The Chiropractic Adjuster, and one-third of the first graduating class of chiropractors were medical physicians (Palmer, 1910; Gibbons, 1981). Following the Flexner Report (1910), medical education consolidated and strengthened its position in society and both medical education and research have received external financial support through grants from the Federal government and private foundations. Federal funds initially supported medical care for veterans and, eventually, for the elderly and disabled. By contrast, chiropractic education remained a tuition-driven, inadequately financed enterprise that received no external support for research. In an attempt to eliminate chiropractic, organized medicine promoted licensing regulations, believing that the inferior education of chiropractic schools would prevent their graduates from passing State Board Licensing Exams (Gevitz, 1988; Wardwell, 1992). This is discussed in more detail in Chapter V. The introduction of Basic Science Boards by the medical profession in 1925 created an additional obstacle to the graduate doctor of chiropractic due to the lack of basic science training in the chiropractic curriculum. In response, chiropractic schools upgraded their educational process by expanding the curriculum and employing Ph.D.-level instructors to teach the basic sciences. As a result, chiropractors started to pass the Basic Science Boards. **Statsitics reported by historian J. Stuart Moore indicate that between 1927 and 1953, about 86% of about 47,000 medical students passes the basic science exams, while only 23% of about 2,500 chiropractors succeeded [Moore JS, Chiropractic in America. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993]. **In the mid-1960s, the AMA Department of Investigation released a study of the educational background of faculty members listed in the catalogs of 13 \"approved\" chiropractic schools. Only 126 (47%) of 267 were listed with recognized academic degrees, and 23 of these were not confirmed by the institutions alleged to have granted them. Only two individuals had confirmable PhD degrees, one in anthropology and and the other in chemistry. And many who taught basic science courses had no degree whatsoever in the subjects they taught [AMA Dept. of Investigation. Educational Background of Chiropractic School Faculties. JAMA 197(12):169-175, 1966]. This situation did not improve substantially until the Council on Chiropractic Education implemented new standards. Further efforts to improve the quality of the educational process eventually led to the creation of chiropractic's own national accreditation agency, the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE), which achieved Federal recognition from the Department of Education in 1974. This agency implemented educational standards for the curriculum and the admission processes. Those schools failing to meet the CCE standards closed their doors. By 1995, all chiropractic colleges achieved accreditation by the CCE. Much like the Flexner Report's impact on medical colleges, the CCE elevated the educational standards of many chiropractic schools. **The process of improvement took place about 60 years earlier in medical schools than in chiropractic schools, and the quality of education in chiropractic schools still leaves much to be desired. Until fairly recently, chiropractic had been attacked by allopathic medicine as an unscientific cult with no research to support its claims of efficacy (Keating, 1993; Wardwell, 1992) (see Chapter VII). **The \"cult\" label was appropriately applied when the majority of chiropractors openly espoused spinal problems as the primary cause of health problems. Most did so until at least the early 1970s. Research was neglected in the early years of the profession. Without funding for research and facilities in the tuition-driven, for-profit educational institutions, the limited resources of the early colleges were focused on teaching skills needed for success in practice rather than on developing the knowledge base of the profession. **Lack of funds was not the main reason for lack of research. The main reason was that the vast majority of chiropractors were not research-minded and already \"knew\" that \"chiropractic emerged: Watkins, Weiant, Higley, Illi, and Janse, among others, sought answers for unexplained treatment outcomes and recognized that a research base could be used to refute the claims of adversaries. The evolutionary development of the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) has helped to foster a research mentality (see Chapter IX). Beyond sponsoring research studies, FCER embarked in 1977 on a program to support the training and development of the chiropractic researcher. There is now a growing cadre of critical thinkers within the profession and an expanding number of research-oriented individuals outside the profession who are studying chiropractic. By 1996, Federal research grants had been awarded to four chiropractic colleges. **Unfortunately, research by chiropractors has produced very little of value. In recent years there has also been much greater collaboration between chiropractors and the greater scientific and clinical communities in training, research, and practice (Mootz, 1995). Multidisciplinary practice is more common as are editorial and technical collaborations, joint research initiatives, and medical physician support of chiropractors in litigation (Mootz, 1995). **I'm not sure whether the collaboration should be described as \"much greater.\" The cited reference gives a few examples but no raw numbers. With the profession's increasing involvement in critical investigation and professional improvement, the label of chiropractic as an unscientific cult has difficulty sticking. **I haven't seen the phrase used since the mid-1970s. [Chiropractic quackery is still rampant](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirochoose.html), but attempting to tar the profession with a single brush is no longer appropriate. Research has demonstrated that manipulation, a primary mode of care for the doctor of chiropractic, is effective in the treatment of acute low back pain (Shekelle, 1992). The inclusion of manipulation as a recommended treatment in the Federal guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain is the result of the findings of researchers both within and outside of chiropractic (Bigos, 1994). **Most of the research was not done by chiropractors, and the findings do not necessarily correspond with what the average person will encounter in a randomly chosen chiropractic office. As research evaluates the value of chiropractic for other clinical problems, the capabilities and limitations of chiropractic care will become more apparent, appropriate interdisciplinary relationships will be established and patient care will be improved. **If such a process takes place, it will do so very gradually. As far as I can tell, chiropractic research has very little influence on chiropractic practice. For example, as far as I can tell, studies showing that various chiropractic diagnostic tests don't work have not stopped any of them from continuing to do them. It has taken 100 years of self-directed, bootstrap efforts utilizing internal funds to bring chiropractic into the mainstream of health care. **I am not sure what criteria Dr. Phillips uses to conclude that chiropractors are part of mainstream health care. Most of their marketing gains have been achieved through political means (legislation and lawsuits) rather than scientific development. I believe that the average physician still has a low general opinion of chiropractors. As a mainstream provider, the issues of role and scope of practice are now receiving serious attention. Is chiropractic an alternative to medicine? Is there a complementary role that includes collaborative care? Should chiropractic remain a separate and distinct profession or seek inclusion into medicine as a subspecialty in musculoskeletal conditions? Should chiropractic education seek affiliation with major universities housing medical education? Answers to these questions will have a significant effect on the future of chiropractic education and practice. References Bigos S, Bowyer O, Braen G, et al. Acute Low Back Problems in Adults.

Both studies collected data in the early 1990s. These studies allow for a comparison between what chiropractors indicate they do in response to a survey and what they actually record for specific patients in their office records. The patient conditions that chiropractors indicated they routinely, often, or sometimes see in their practice are listed in Table 19 (Christensen, 1993). Symptoms for which 1,916 patients sought chiropractic care in the United States and Canada, as recorded in the office record of the initial visit, are listed in Figure 2. About two-thirds of patients were seeking care for low back pain. **Figure 2 (not reproduced here to avoid an unnecessary graphic, is a pie chart stating that 68% of the patients sought care for low back pain and 32% came for other reasons (13% for neck face pain or injury, 5% for mid-back pain or injury, 3% for arm pain or injury, 3% for arm or leg sprain or strain, 2% for headaches, and 5% for all other reasons). One percent of the charts did not indicate the reason. The diagnoses made by chiropractors (either in the office record or on the claim form) for 477 U.S. patients who sought care for non-low back pain complaints are listed in Table 20. While musculoskeletal conditions dominate all three lists, some obvious discrepancies exist. When asked, chiropractors say they routinely see patients with headaches, often see patients with blood pressure problems, allergies, or obesity, and sometimes see patients with nutritional disorders, menstrual disorders, asthma or emphysema, various infections, diabetes, and a variety of other non-musculoskeletal disorders. Examination of office records for patients' symptoms and diagnoses, however, reveals a near-absence of non-musculoskeletal conditions. No nonmusculoskeletal symptom accounted for more than 1 percent of patients' symptoms, and the three most frequently diagnosed nonmusculoskeletal conditions, asthma, otitis media, and migraine headaches, were noted for only about 1 in 200 patients (Hurwitz, 1998). |ROUTINELY SEEN||Spinal subluxation/joint dysfunction | Headaches |OFTEN Vertebral facet syndrome or dislocation of any joint Extremity subluxation/joint dysfunction Hyperlordosis of cervical or lumbar spine Scoliosis Bursitis or synovitis High or low blood pressure Allergies Obesity |SOMETIMES SEEN||Kyphosis of thoracic spine | syndrome Thoracic outlet syndrome Systemic rheumatoid arthritis or gout Occupational or environmental disorder Muscular atrophy Nutritional disorders Menstrual disorders Asthma, emphysema, or COPD Upper respiratory or ear infection Pregnancy Respiratory viral or bacterial infection Acne, dermatitis, or psoriasis Loss of equilibrium Diabetes Psychological disorders Eating disorders Ear or hearing disorders Eye or vision disorders Hiatus or inguinal hernia Gastrointestinal bacterial or viral infection Infection of kidney or urinary tract Colitis or diverticulitis Thyroid or parathyroid disorder Hemorrhoids Source: Christensen M, Morgan D (eds).

Utilization of chiropractic services in the United States and Canada: 1985-1991. Am J Publ Hlth 1998;88:771-776. The different messages conveyed by the two sources of data might be accounted for in a variety of ways, including how the information was collected. The conditions patients presented with, or had concurrently reported, in the Christensen survey (1993) may not be the same as the presenting symptoms the chiropractor recorded in the chart or as the diagnoses the chiropractors recorded for insurance purposes. Given reimbursement policies, coding restrictions, and utilization reviews that may occur, some chiropractors may feel an incentive to only report those symptoms and diagnoses that facilitate reimbursement. Reimbursement incentives may strongly influence the records chiropractors keep and the diagnoses that are reported. In many plans, e.g., Medicare, chiropractors are required to report a musculoskeletal diagnosis (and sometimes the diagnosis of \"vertebral subluxation\" is mandatory) in order to be paid for services. **Chiropractic coverage under Medicare, which began in 1973, was limited to manual manipulation of the spine for the treatment of \"subluxations demonstrated by x-rays to exist.\" To enable payment, federal officials accepted an elaborate chiropractic \"definition\" of subluxations for which payment could be made. During the mid-1980s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG) surveyed 145 chiropractors by telephone about their billing practices. Eighty-four percent said that some subluxations do not show on x-rays. Nearly half responded that when billing Medicare, they \"could always find something\" (by x-ray or physical examination) to justify the diagnosis, or they actually tailored the diagnosis to obtain reimbursement. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 eliminates the x-ray the requirement as of January 1, 2000, and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and implement utilization guidelines for chiropractic coverage when a subluxation has not been demonstrated by X-ray. Secondly, almost a quarter of the non-low back complaint patients had no diagnosis, and this group might contain some of the \"missing\" nonmusculoskeletal diagnoses. However, given that few patients presented with nonmusculoskeletal complaints, this is probably not an important factor. Finally, this may reflect vagaries of memory and that the large number of \"routine\" musculoskeletal pain patients the chiropractor sees recedes somewhat compared to the unusual cases, which seem to stand out. **The Christensen survey, done in 1991, contain a design flaw that makes some of its data uninterpretable. To survey the types of conditions seen, participants were asked to check off how frequently they saw more than 100 \"presenting or concurrent problems.\" The highest score was for \"spinal subluxation/joint dysfunction,\" which the vast majority reported seeing daily. Chiropractors disagree about the meaning of the word [\"subluxations\"](https://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosub.html) Some find subluxations in all of their patients. Many advise patients who have no symptoms to undergo periodic \"maintenance care\" in which their alleged subluxations are located and corrected, typically on a monthly or weekly basis. The Christensen data do not indicate what percentage of patients with \"spinal subluxation/joint dysfunction\" had nothing physically wrong with them. B. Diagnostic Methods Chiropractic training and literature approach clinical diagnosis in a similar fashion to that of all health care disciplines in that history, physical and regional examination, special studies, and specialty-specific evaluation procedures are routinely incorporated into patient work-ups (Gatterman, 1990; Haldeman, 1993). All accredited chiropractic teaching institutions incorporate history and physical examination into their curricula. Standard history and physical examination methods are basic chiropractic clinical competencies (Council on Chiropractic Education, 1991). Using standard historical, diagnostic, and assessment procedures, chiropractors attempt to differentiate problems of mechanical versus visceral origin (Souza, 1994a). **The above statements are true but incomplete. Large percentages of chiropractors use one or more quack diagnostic procedures in addition to (or even instead of) standard tests. The chiropractic literature is also paying increased attention to the role pain behavior and psychosocial issues play in conditions such as back pain and to evaluation and management strategies in these areas (Milus, 1994; Skogsbergh, 1994). While chiropractors claim to document case progress in standard SOAP (i.e., Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notation format (Christensen, 1993), several chart abstraction studies have noted that chiropractors often maintain inadequate patient records (Nyiendo, 1991; Hurwitz,1998). Although quality record keeping may be a problem in all health professions, it appears to be a greater problem for chiropractors, who typically practice outside of group clinic and practice settings. It is expected that the increased emphasis on record keeping in the chiropractic literature and, more importantly, the quality assurance processes associated with participation in accredited managed care organizations will lead to improvements in record keeping over time (Mootz, 1994; McElheran, 1994). **Table 20 shows that 23.7% of the patients seeking chiropractic care for reasons other than low back pain had no diagnosis recorded in their chart. I wonder what percentage had nothing physically wrong with them. |ICD CODE||DESCRIPTION||% of all non-LBP Diagnoses from Hurwitz EL, et al. Utilization of chiropractic services in the U.S. and Canada: 1985-91 Am J Publ Hlth 1998;88:771-776. 1. History and Physical Examination Two North American chiropractic practice parameter commissions recently rated history taking as a \"necessary\" component of a chiropractic patient evaluation (Haldeman, 1993; Henderson, 1994). Exploration of presenting complaint, family history, past health history, psychosocial history, and review of systems were considered necessary components of an adequate history (Haldeman, 1993). Standard procedures have been recommended for history taking that emphasize active listening and directed questioning related to the mechanisms of a problem's onset (Bowers, 1995a). The extent to which practicing chiropractors actually follow these guidelines is unknown. However, a recent survey of more than 6,500 chiropractors by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Christensen, 1993) suggested that case histories are \"routinely\" performed and that chiropractors place \"substantial\" importance on the information gleaned from this process. **The quality of history-taking is far more important than the frequency. I know of no study showing how well chiropractors can do this. Performance of a physical examination is considered essential for establishing a diagnosis and determining a treatment plan (Haldeman, 1993; Henderson, 1994; Gatterman, 1990). Chiropractors receive extensive training and appear well prepared to perform orthopedic and neurological assessments (McCarthy, 1994; Evans, 1994) and the Christensen survey (1993) found that chiropractors report that they \"routinely\" perform these assessments. Assessment of general health status and performance of regional examinations were also considered important by chiropractors but are performed less frequently than physical examinations (Christensen, 1993). **It is not clear how much the information chiropractors collect is used to make rational diagnoses and/or treatment plans. My 1993 [visit to a \"straight\" chiropractor](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirovisit.html) illustrates what can happen. Periodic updating of the physical examination is emphasized in chiropractic education and clinical internships (Gatterman, 1990; Mootz, 1988), and its use is reported by chiropractors to be \"frequent\" (Christensen, 1993). Reassessment and monitoring of patient progress received special attention by chiropractic practice parameters commissions (Haldeman, 1993; Henderson, 1994). Table 21 lists attributes of chiropractic reassessment considered \"necessary\" by one of the commissions (Haldeman, 1993). Functional outcomes assessment is increasingly being incorporated into overall clinical strategies for monitoring patient progress (Yeomans, 1996). | | Adapted from Haldeman S, et al. (eds). Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters. Gaithersburg, MD: Aspen Publishers, 1993; pp 135-6. 2. Mechanical Assessment Procedures In addition to the routine clinical evaluation procedures standard to any patient workup (i.e., history, physical and regional examination, and special studies) chiropractors have developed assessment methods for determination of the mechanical status of a patient. Some mechanical assessment strategies are common to physical medicine procedures (Henninger, 1993, 1994; Hammer, 1991) and others are unique to chiropractic (Haas, 1995; Faye, 1992; Youngquist, 1989). Table 22 provides a listing of mechanical assessment procedures that may be used by chiropractors to identify joint dysfunction. | || | Chiropractors typically approach mechanical assessment in a comprehensive fashion, routinely incorporating a number of hands-on evaluation methods (McMillin, 1995; Henninger, 1994). Osterbauer (1996) reviewed the evidence for reliability and utility of several chiropractic approaches to mechanical assessment procedures for detection of joint dysfunction or subluxation. Procedures with reasonable (\"fair to good\") reliability included assessments of osseous and soft tissue pain or tenderness (Mootz, 1989; Boline, 1993). Procedures for determining mobility, cutaneous temperature differences, and joint position have not fared well in reliability studies. **The significance of this paragraph may not be obvious. The Osterbauer paper looked at the methods chiropractors use to assess [\"subluxations.\"](https://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosub.html) It notes that chiropractors do not agree among themselves about what subluxations are or how they should be identified. It contains a table reporting on the reliability of six \"chiropractic methods\" of \"subluxation assessment.\" The table states that bone pain has \"fair to excellent\" reliability, soft tissue pain has \"fair to good\" reliability, but that leg-length testing, use of heat-sensing devices, and two methods in which the chiropractor detects subluxations by hand are either \"poor to moderate\" or \"poor.\" Other data (Christensen, 1993) show that the majority of chiropractors use at least one method that is \"poor to moderately\" reliable. Would you like your medical doctor to use poorly reliable diagnostic tests? 3. Special studies Chiropractic training includes the use of clinical laboratory studies. Details on the application of these tests have long been described in the chiropractic diagnostic literature and in practice parameters (Jaquet, 1971; Adams, 1990; Vear, 1992; Triano, 1992; Haldeman, laboratory testing appears to be only \"rarely\" or \"infrequently\" used in chiropractic practice (Hurwitz, 1998; Christensen, 1993). For example, blood tests are ordered for fewer than 1 percent of patients (Hurwitz, 1998). The infrequent ordering of lab tests may be due to legal restrictions on chiropractors performing phlebotomy in some jurisdictions as well as to the types of patients typically seen by chiropractors. **It may also be related to inadequacies in chiropractic education. Radiology and imaging is used with far greater frequency than laboratory studies. In the NBCE survey (Christensen, 1993), chiropractors indicated that radiographs were \"frequently\" ordered and special imaging studies such as CT or MR were \"sometimes\" ordered. In the analysis of office records of patients who sought care for low back pain, 54 percent of patients had lumbosacral radiography, about 2 percent of patients had CT, and 2 percent had MR imaging during their \"episode of care\" (Hurwitz, 1998). Thus, except for plain film radiography, special imaging and other special diagnostic tests are rarely used by chiropractors. Radiology is a significant component of chiropractic education. A specialty society devoted to radiology, The American Chiropractic College of Radiology, serves in an advisory role for radiology residency programs at chiropractic colleges and certifies specialty-level competency in radiology. Yochum and Rowe (1996), chiropractic radiologists, authored a skeletal radiology text that is used in both chiropractic and medical radiology training. In a study comparing the abilities of chiropractic and medical radiologists, orthopedists, general practitioners, and chiropractic students to interpret radiographs, chiropractic and medical skeletal radiologists scored highest followed by chiropractic students, orthopedists, and general medical and chiropractic practitioners (Taylor, 1995). **Perhaps it should be mentioned that the study pertained to the ability to interpret abnormal films of the lumbosacral spine and not to overall ability to read xrays. Other special studies sometimes used or ordered by chiropractors include nerve conduction studies, bone scans, and electromyography. Appropriate use of these procedures is incorporated into the curriculum of chiropractic colleges and is addressed in chiropractic practice parameters (Haldeman, 1993). Chiropractic utilization of advanced diagnostics is quite low. In the past, chiropractors have been excluded from medical referral loops and have been forced either to care for patients without such studies or to obtain their own equipment and perform the tests themselves. Hence, either by design or circumstance, chiropractors often rely on low tech patient assessment procedures of historytaking, physical, regional, mechanical examinations, and plain film radiography while monitoring progress using a \"therapeutic trial\" approach to patient management. C. Treatment Methods Chiropractic treatments, as well as diagnostic practices, vary by geographic region due to differences in State laws governing scope of practice and due to differences in practitioner philosophy. The therapeutic procedure most closely associated with chiropractic is spinal manipulation. However, chiropractic patient management often includes lifestyle counseling, nutritional management, rehabilitation, various physiotherapeutic modalities, and a variety of other interventions (Gatterman, 1990; Haldeman, 1992, 1993). Physiologic therapeutics, taught in all chiropractic schools, are included in the chiropractic scopes of practice in most jurisdictions. Detailed protocols for the use of physiologic therapeutics have been published in the chiropractic literature (Hooper, 1996; Jascoviak, 1986) and are emphasized in the leading chiropractic research publication, the Journal of Manipulative and Physiologic Therapeutics. The NBCE survey (Christensen, 1993) reported that chiropractors \"routinely\" performed chiropractic adjustive techniques. Overall, 96 percent of chiropractors reported having recommended corrective or therapeutic exercise at least once in the 2 years prior to the survey, and 84 percent of doctors recommended nutritional counseling, supportive techniques, or supplements during the same time period. No data are available in the Christensen survey (1993) about the proportion of individual patients who receive specific types of care. The office record data indicated that of 920 patients who presented with low back pain, 84 percent received spinal manipulation (or adjustment), 79 percent received nonthrust manual therapies such as mobilization, massage, and heat packs, 31 percent received education, and 5 percent received other forms of therapy such as acupuncture (Hurwitz, 1998). **There are good reasons to believe that the majority of chiropractors involved in nutrition-related activities\" are doing them improperly, and that most chiropractors who \"practice nutrition\" are prescribing unnecessary of irrationally formulated supplement products. See Quackwatch's article [Steer Clear of \"Chiropractic Nutrition.\"](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chironutr.html) One of the most important nutrition-related areas is the management of abnormal blood cholesterol levels. As far as I know, the percentage of chiropractors who counsel patients about this (whether properly or not) has never been determined. The Christensen survey's finding that chiropractors order blood tests on fewer than 1% of their patients suggests that very few chiropractors are doing appropriate cholesterol counseling. 1. Manual Methods The syntax surrounding the mechanical intervention of spinal manipulation is the source of some controversy within the chiropractic profession. Most chiropractors prefer the term chiropractic \"adjustment\" to manipulation because it is believed to imply a more specific or precise maneuver and distinguishes it from other forms of manipulation. There are at least 100 distinct chiropractic, osteopathic, and physical therapy manipulation techniques, a large array of highly specialized adjusting tables and equipment, and a great deal of variation in the specific techniques used by individual practitioners (Haldeman, 1993; Greenman, 1996; Bergmann, 1993). There are four terms with distinct definitions that are frequently used to characterize manual manipulative methods (Haldeman, 1993). The general umbrella term of spinal manipulative therapy is often used to encompass all types of manual techniques regardless of their precise anatomic and physiologic focus or their discipline of origin. Mobilization is defined as passive movement of a joint within its physiologic range of motion. This roughly equates to the range of motion a joint can typically be taken through by its intrinsic musculature. Manipulation is passive joint movement, which takes the joint beyond its physiologic range into the paraphysiologic space. Intrinsic muscle contraction alone does not usually move joints this far. When a joint is moved into this \"para-physiologic\" range, cavitation can occur, which, in a synovial joint, is typified by an audible release or \"pop.\" A gaseous bubble may appear within the synovial fluid for several minutes after manipulation (Greenman, 1996). Both mobilization and manipulation are used to facilitate joint motion. When applied in manual medicine and physical therapy, assessment and manipulative treatment tend to focus exclusively on joint pain and restriction. However, even though the execution of high velocity manipulative thrusts by chiropractors and nonchiropractors may appear similar, chiropractic techniques focus on a more global clinical picture to characterize and apply adjustments. Chiropractors typically consider the nature and mode of condition onset, muscle spasm, pain radiation patterns, static and dynamic postures, and/or gaits as well as joint pain in determining whether or not a mechanical intervention should be applied (Mootz, 1995a). For example, the spinal areas manipulated using typical manual medicine and physical therapy assessment approaches are often based on which joints or regions have restricted motion. In contrast, the decision as to which area to manipulate using various chiropractic techniques may be based upon pain radiation patterns, which paraspinal muscle regions are taut and how they are enervated, the biomechanical function of affected joints compared to that of adjacent areas, and the mechanics involved in initial onset (Grice, 1992; Gitelman, 1992). Thus the regions manipulated by chiropractors may not directly correspond to the symptomatic region or to the area that a nonchiropractor may feel is the site of the manipulable lesion. In addition, there are many unique features associated with chiropractic techniques including patient positioning, equipment, characteristics of prestressing joints, and thrust. Decisions about the frequency and duration of chiropractic manipulative treatment may not be much influenced by its effect on range of motion. Rather, progress indicators such as function, coordination, and endurance often influence when and how chiropractic manipulation is provided. Some of the syntax in chiropractic reflects this with many drawing a distinction between the terms manipulation and adjusting. Table 23 provides definitions for manipulation, mobilization, and adjusting that illustrate these conceptual differences (Haldeman, 1993). |Chiropractic Adjustment: This term refers to a wide variety of manual and mechanical interventions that may be high or low velocity; short or long lever; high or low amplitude; with or without recoil. Procedures are usually directed at specific joints or anatomic regions. An adjustment may or may not involve the cavitation or gapping of a joint (opening of a joint within its paraphysiologic zone usually producing a characteristic audible \"click\" or \"pop\"). The common denominator for the various adjustive interventions is the concept of removing structural dysfunctions of joints and muscles that are associated with neurologic alterations. The chiropractic profession refers to this concept as a \"subluxation.\" This use of the word subluxation should not be confused with the term's precise anatomic usage, which considers only the anatomical relationships.| |Manipulation and Mobilization: During joint motion, three barriers or end ranges to movement can be identified. The first is the active end range, which occurs when the patient has maximally contracted muscles controlling a joint in a particular directional vector. At this point, the clinician can passively move the joint toward a second barrier called the passive end range. Movement up to this barrier is termed physiologic joint space. Beyond this point, the practitioner can move the joint into its paraphysiologic space. The third barrier encountered is the anatomic end range. Movement beyond this will result in rupture of the joint's ligaments. | Source: Haldeman S, Chapman-Smith D, Petersen D (eds). Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters. Gaithersburg, MD: Aspen Publishers, 1993. Bartol (1991) categorized chiropractic adjustive techniques according to their mechanical characteristics. Table 24 lists a classification scheme used by American and Canadian chiropractic practice parameter commissions to categorize types of chiropractic manual interventions. Table 25 provides examples of some better known chiropractic adjustive techniques. The Christensen survey (1993) reported that chiropractors \"routinely\" perform specific chiropractic adjustive techniques, \"frequently\" employ supportive or other non-adjustive techniques, but only \"sometimes\" use instruments (e.g., Activator) in the application of adjustments. Regarding specific forms of manipulation and adjusting used by chiropractors, the job analysis by Christensen (1993) reported that Diversified, Gonstead, Flexion-Distraction, Activator, and Thompson techniques were the most frequently used procedures. All other techniques were used by fewer than 43 percent of practitioners. Over 93 percent of chiropractors reported using such full-spine adjusting procedures as their primary approach to patient care. Fewer than 2 percent indicated a primary emphasis on upper cervical procedures. Although roughly one-third of chiropractors indicated that they used other techniques (such as cranial work), the number reporting them as a primary emphasis was too small to warrant an individual listing in the Christensen job analysis (1993). |A. Manual, Articular Manipulative, and Adjustive Procedures | |B. Manual, Nonarticular Manipulative, and Adjustive Procedures | Adapted from Haldeman S, et al. (eds). Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters. Gaithersburg, MD: Aspen Publishers, 1993. | || | | || | 2. Exercise and Rehabilitation According to Christensen (1993), 96 percent of chiropractors reported that they used corrective and therapeutic exercises. Evidence-based guidelines published by AHCPR stress the importance of early activation of acute low back pain patients in order to optimize recovery (Bigos, 1994). Chiropractors have incorporated patient activation and exercise into their management strategies since the early part of the 20th century (Cook, 1994; Liebenson, 1995). Chiropractors have also become involved in the treatment of athletes, gaining substantial recognition in the sports medicine specialties. The American College of Sports Medicine was one of the first multidisciplinary organizations to allow chiropractors membership status. Chiropractors also have been included by many countries as Olympic team physicians and leading chiropractic colleges have recently sponsored postgraduate certification programs in sports chiropractic and rehabilitation. A clinical journal devoted to sports chiropractic and rehabilitation has been published for the better part of a decade and chiropractic authors have increasingly emphasized rehabilitation and activation strategies (Liebenson, 1995; Cook, 1994; Nelson, 1994; Souza, 1994b). Chiropractic rehabilitation protocols appear very similar to standard rehabilitation practices (Nelson, 1994; Cook, 1994; Liebenson, 1996). **One very important difference exists, however. Many chiropractors encourage patients to enroll in lifelong \"preventative maintenance\" programs. With the increased popularity of fitness and conditioning in recent decades, exercise and rehabilitation have developed their own sub-specialty identity within medicine and physical therapy as well as in chiropractic. Chiropractic approaches to exercise range from the low-tech in-office conditioning and stabilization programs (Cook, 1994; Nelson, 1994; Liebenson, 1996) to more extravagant high-tech conditioning equipment (Christiensen, 1992). The Chiropractic Rehabilitation Association (CRA) publishes rehabilitation guidelines for chiropractic (CRA, 1992). Exercise and rehabilitation have been classified as \"promising\" to \"established\" for increasing functional capacity in chiropractic practice parameters (Haldeman, 1993; Henderson, 1994). 3. Lifestyle and Activities of Daily Living Promotion of wellness and lifestyle strategies is also a significant, if underexplored, aspect of chiropractic practice. More than two-thirds of chiropractors report using nutritional and exercise counseling in practice (Christensen, 1993), and chiropractic college curricula include courses on the subject. Health promotion strategies for chiropractors exist in the literature (Jameson, 1991; Hawk, 1995; Bowers, 1995b); however, data on application in practice is scant. **Chiropractors typically claim that they use a preventive approach. However, detailed look at what they do and don't do would probably prove very embarrassing to the profession. For example, chiropractic surveys show that fewer than half promote immunization. I also believe that most of their nutritional counseling is quacky. 4. Ancillary and Complementary Procedures Chiropractors also use a variety of complementary and ancillary procedures. The most frequently used procedures include cryotherapy, bracing, and nutritional counseling (Christensen, 1993). The majority of practitioners also use rest, heat, orthotics, traction, and physiotherapeutic modalities. Acupressure and meridian therapy are used by about 65 percent of practitioners with fewer than 12 percent reporting that they use acupuncture (Christensen, 1993). **I find it puzzling that the use of meridian therapy is mentioned here without noting that it is a form of quackery. D. Chiropractic Management of Specific Health Care Problems 1. Considerations in Management of Neuromusculoskeletal Problems In recent years manipulation has been the subject of substantial scientific inquiry (Bronfort, 1992; Shekelle, 1991a, 1991b, 1992a, 1992b, 1995) and its role in the management of at least some musculoskeletal conditions appears promising (see Chapter XI for more details on evidence for efficacy of manipulation). However, more study is needed, especially given the current emphasis on cost containment in health care. As previously indicated, the majority of conditions for which patients seek chiropractic are musculoskeletal problems (Hurwitz, 1998; Goertz, 1996; Christensen, 1993) with low back pain and head/neck pain accounting for the great majority. Low Back Pain Chiropractic management of low back pain depends on the characteristics of the patient and the condition. Management of acute low back pain usually entails initial pain and inflammation control, with emphasis on return to normal activity (Mootz, 1991, 1993a; Cox, 1996). Depending on the clinical presentation, manual interventions such as manipulation and adjusting may be directed at restoring joint motion and stretching tight musculature. Other manual procedures including soft tissue work, passive and active movements, and therapeutic exercise may be used based on severity of condition, patient tolerance, and demands of activities of daily living (Cox, 1996; Nelson, 1994). Additionally some chiropractors may use supportive modalities (e.g., thermal or electric physiotherapeutics) to enhance muscle relaxation and tissue metabolism. Treatment frequency and duration depends on the nature and extent of the condition (Hansen, 1994a). Back pain that appears to be associated only with uncomplicated simple joint dysfunction generally resolves within a few days or weeks (Hansen, 1994a; Mootz, 1993a). Acute low back conditions with more substantial soft tissue injury and/or radicular involvement typically involve more intensive and prolonged management (on the order of a few months) (Mootz, 1993a; Cox, 1996). Chronic and recurrent low back conditions often require greater emphasis on modification of daily activities and conditioning (Liebenson, 1996; Skogsbergh, 1994). Manipulation may be combined with rehabilitation protocols for such cases (Mootz, 1993a). Somatization and other types of pain behavior are also frequently considered in treating chronic pain patients as are the impact of the condition on the patient's lifestyle and the extent of the patient's motivation. Collaborative care and/or referral for counseling may be sought in such cases. Cervical and Thoracic Spine Conditions As with low back pain, chiropractic management of cervical and thoracic conditions is based on the nature and extent of the problem as well as on the patient's psychological, social, and physical circumstances. Two of the more common cervical spine complaints seen by chiropractors are neck pain and cervicogenic headache (Hurwitz, 1998). Uncomplicated neck pain that may be related to simple joint dysfunction can be cared for with a combination of manipulation and myofascial work, and should respond quickly to such interventions. Neck pain involving discogenic or radicular complications is also something chiropractors feel comfortable managing (Coulter, 1995). However, this requires careful monitoring that demonstrates improvement under care and manipulative treatment may need to be modified from that used on patients without radiculopathy to avoid possible compression of inflamed tissues within the cervical foramen (Mootz, 1996). Post-traumatic cervical sprain and strain, often associated with whiplash type injury, is another condition frequently managed by chiropractors (Foreman, 1995). This is usually treated with pain control (e.g., cryotherapy, rest, compression, elevation), bracing, rehabilitation, and manual interventions (including manipulation) during the course of care as patient response and tolerance permit (Mootz, 1996). Soft tissue injuries, especially some of the more extensive ones, can heal slowly and develop fibrosis which may prolong response time and increase treatment duration (Foreman, 1995). Extremity Conditions Sports injuries and extremity conditions are also addressed by chiropractors (Souza, 1994b, 1994c; Turchin, 1995) and have been the subject of preliminary chiropractic practice guideline efforts (Chiropractic Rehabilitation Association, 1992). Management methods may include typical nonpharmaceutical pain control, exercise and extremity manipulation or mobilization. 2. Management of Other Conditions Little is known about how frequently chiropractors diagnose and treat non-neuromusculoskeletal problems, and no studies have described how such problems are actually managed. A 1995 survey by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) found that chiropractors estimated that, on average, 16 percent of their practices were devoted to the treatment of nonneuromusculoskeletal conditions (Goertz, 1996). However, as noted earlier, a study using data from chiropractors' office records found that fewer than 5 percent of patients were seen for nonneuromusculoskeletal conditions (Hurwitz, 1998). Chiropractors may often see patients who smoke, are overweight, or who have previously undiagnosed conditions such as hypertension or rheumatoid arthritis. Depending on the extent of the problem, the chiropractor's training and experience, and the scope of practice for which the chiropractor is licensed, specific monitoring strategies and lifestyle modifications may be recommended (Jameson, 1991; Milus, 1994; Bowers, 1995a; Frischer, 1995; Evans, 1995). Disease screening, nutritional counseling, and lifestyle modification are part of chiropractic training (Jameson, 1991, Bowers, 1995a). **How well chiropractic training actually prepares chiropractors to do these things would be an interesting question to research. My guess is that most of the schools don't do it very well. Since the profession's inception, many chiropractors have believed that chiropractic adjusting techniques enhance general health and wellness, and facilitate healing in patients with nonmusculoskeletal disorders. Although some chiropractors promote these beliefs, others are cautious about making such claims for which there is little scientific support. Thus, at this time, these beliefs are based on conceptual biologic models and anecdotal clinical experience but not on scientific evidence. **I believe that the majority promote beliefs that adjustments enhance general health and wellness. Some of the \"conceptual biological models\" are delusionally based. The most controversy surrounding chiropractic management of non-NMS conditions derives from vestiges of early chiropractic and osteopathic models regarding how spinal manipulation might impact a disease process. **My dictionary defines vestiage as \"a visible trace, evidence, or sign of something that once existed but exists or appears no more.\" The \"early models\" included such concepts as subluxations, nerve impingement, nerve energy, and Innate Intelligence. Many chiropractors still cling to them. There are a number of models regarding the physiological effects of manipulation and an overview of research on the topic can be found in Chapter X. The most sophisticated models speculate on the reflex effects spinal manipulation might have on autonomic function (Gatterman, 1995). However, autonomic nervous system function remains poorly understood and specific responses to stimuli are dependent on so many confounding factors as to make predictable and workable models a significant challenge. Many practitioners have anecdotally reported remissions of diagnosed systemic or visceral disease while a patient is under chiropractic care. Although a cause-effect relationship may be apparent to those affected, other explanations must be considered. For example, chest and arm pain may result from cardiac ischemia or mechanical dysfunction in the chest wall or rib cage. Manual methods may relieve a patient with the latter cause, leading to an inaccurate assumption that manipulation influenced heart disease. Natural progression, concurrent interventions, and placebo responses may also provide rival explanations to a direct neurologically mediated response. More research is needed in this area. **The paragraph would be made more meaningful by replacing the word \"rival\" with \"logical.\" E. Practice Guidelines, Clinical Pathways, and Technology Assessments in Chiropractic The first evidence- and consensus-based practice parameters on chiropractic in the U.S. were developed through a large-scale professionwide effort (Haldeman, 1993). This effort, called the \"Mercy Conference\" (after the conference center where the formal nominal group consensus meeting was held) used a formal consensus approach, with input from a broad cross-section of the profession. The recommendations, developed using a standardized and evidence-based approach, address the broad range of chiropractic practices. After a 3-year process, final recommendations were agreed upon (Haldeman, 1993). The guidelines delineate general clinical parameters and lack specificity for approaches to the management of patients with specific conditions. An infrastructure to evaluate and oversee future revisions has been established by the Congress of Chiropractic State Associations. **The Commission for the Establishment of Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice was composed of 35 prominent chiropractors. After chapters were drafted and underwent review by outside consultants, the commission met for several days to reach a consensus on the many recommendations that had been proposed. The final report was completed in 1992 and commercially published in 1993 as a 263-page book. The guidelines address more than 300 aspects of the history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging, instrumentation, laboratory testing, record-keeping and patient consent, clinical impression, modes of care, frequency and duration of care, clinical reassessment, outcome assessment, collaborative care, contraindications and complications, preventive/maintenance care, public health, and professional development. Each clinical procedure was rated as established, promising, equivocal, investigational, doubtful, or inappropriate. (\"Equivocal\" meant that a procedure's value \"can neither be confirmed or denied.\") The first three ratings were considered \"positive\" and appropriate for clinical use and insurance reimbursement. Procedural and administrative items were rated as necessary, recommended, discretionary, or unnecessary, while contraindications were rated as none, relative, relative to absolute, or absolute. Although the Mercy Guidelines were a much-needed step in the right direction, some of the ratings were overly positive and many of chiropractic's quacky practices were called \"investigational\" or even \"equivocal.\" For example. use of chiropractic adjustments for \"preventive maintenance was rated \"equivocal\" because \"the clinical experience of the profession developed over a period of nearly 100 years suggests . . . merit\" Unlike what the medical profession does with prominent medical guidelines, few chiropractors will actually use the Mercy report for guidance. And, as noted below, subluxation-based practitioners rejected it and produced a report of their own. One other chiropractic practice inventory has been developed in the United States (WCA, 1993). It was a narrow scope (\"straight\") practice parameter project, which lacked an explicit process and involvement of different viewpoints. The recommendations promoted lengthy periods of treatment and did not consider evidence contrary to the sponsor's beliefs. The proceedings quickly went out of print and have not been reissued although a second effort has been undertaken. Two more recent efforts have occurred in Canada and Australia (Henderson, 1994; Ebrall, in press). Like Mercy, both used explicit processes to evaluate the literature and synthesize expert opinion on which the recommendations are based. These efforts update Mercy by incorporating new information. Their recommendations were generally similar to those of Mercy. In addition to the efforts to produce practice parameters, a number of condition-specific guidelines and critical care pathways (Table 26) have recently appeared in the chiropractic literature (Hansen, 1994b). Chiropractors also participated in a multidisciplinary panel that produced national guidelines for the management of acute low back pain in adults (Bigos, 1994). Finally, chiropractors have undertaken a number of technology assessments (Hansen, 1996; Mannello, 1996) such as those listed in Table 26. In addition, formal efforts to examine approaches to evaluating and validating chiropractic methods have been undertaken (Kaminski, 1987; Hansen, 1996; Osterbauer, 1996). These efforts have relied on explicit processes to evaluate the literature and expert clinical opinion on individual procedures. | | Chiropractic Practice Parameters Using Explicit Processes Clinical Pathways and Algorithms Technology Assessments F. Quality Management and Medicolegal Issues 1. Quality Management Efforts in Chiropractic Although chiropractic was not included in early attempts to address quality in health care delivery, quality management and quality assurance are now being addressed in the chiropractic literature (Hansen, 1997; Iannelli, 1995; McElheran, 1994). Chiropractic involvement in managed care programs has served as a catalyst for this interest due to credentialling requirements, accreditation of preferred provider organizations, and an increasing need for competitive advantages in the marketplace. Although a number of different definitions of \"quality\" have been proposed, several consistently mentioned dimensions of chiropractic quality include effectiveness of care, appropriateness of care, availability of providers, access, patient satisfaction, adequacy and completeness of medical information and record keeping systems, office environment, and continuity of care (McElheran, 1994; Iannelli, 1995). These components of quality can be roughly categorized into those that focus on clinical services, and those that focus on the delivery of care. The technology assessment and practice guidelines efforts undertaken by the chiropractic profession have served as a springboard for documenting clinical attributes of quality. Table 26 listed several of these efforts. For example, the \"Mercy\" Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters described more than 300 recommended attributes of chiropractic practice in performing history and examination, special studies, diagnostic considerations, modes of care, clinical documentation, and continuing education (Haldeman, 1993). Relatively few recommendations involved condition- and patient-specific issues. Many clinical issues were dealt with in generalities and were given \"equivocal\" ratings, reflecting the current state of uncertainty in the scientific literature. On the delivery and administrative side, however, more specific guidelines were stated concerning such issues as record-keeping and patient confidentiality. An example of a practitioner performance audit form used at the National College of Chiropractic Clinics to monitor quality attributes through chart audits is included as Figure 3 (Iannelli, 1995). An example of chart record content guideline currently used by a chiropractic IPA as a guideline for minimum chart requirements for its network members (McElheran, 1994) is included as Figure 4. - - - Figure 3.

Guidelines for Chart Records Content |Chiropractors have the legal and ethical responsibility to maintain complete and accurate records for each patient. Patient files should be stored neatly and organized to facilitate tracking and retrieval, with a system in place to maintain patient confidentiality. The following guidelines are adapted from the 1994 NCQA Guidelines for Medical Record Review.| To be considered complete, chiropractic chart records should include the following features: Medical Record Overview - 1. Chart documentation is organized. - 2. The record is legible. - 3. If any non-standard abbreviations, codes, or scales are used, a key should be included to allow easy interpretation by any reviewing person. - 4. The patient name is prominent on each and every page. - 5. The date is noted for each provider contact / office visit / phone call / record review. - 6. Entries contain author identification when anyone other than the primary treating doctor makes any entry in the chart record. - 7. When there is significant risk of injury from a procedure, there is documentation of informed consent by the patient. Exam / Intake Records - 8. The patient's name / address / age / family status are noted. - 9. Past medical / health history are recorded. - 10. The list of patient's major problems / diagnosis is prominent, and revised as the patient's condition warrants. - 11. Documented examination findings include adequate and appropriate testing for the patient problem. Daily Chart Records - 12. Relevant history / subjective findings of the presenting problem noted for each visit. - 13. Pertinent objective findings noted when there is significant change. - 14. Assessment / diagnosis noted in encounter entries, corresponding to subjective / objective findings. - 15. Treatment plan / recommendations noted, corresponding to the patient problem / diagnosis. Return time is noted as weeks, months, or PRN. - 16. Notation of care prescribed or provided, corresponding to the problem being treated. - 17. The care provided appears to be \"medically\" appropriate. - 18. Reports (lab, imaging, second opinion, etc) and correspondence are signed or initialed as reviewed by the provider, significant findings are noted in the record. - 19. Notation of patient's response to care. - 20. Notation of home exercises /activities / ADLs given. - 21. Appropriate diagnostic testing or referral is noted. - 22. Notation of review / discussion of specialist findings and further recommendations. - 23. All S.O.A.P. areas are updated for each PRN follow-up visit. - Source: McElheran L, Sollecito P. Delivering quality chiropractic care in a managed care setting. Top Clin Chiropr 1994;1(4):78. - - Standardized systems for quality assurance and management have been successfully implemented in chiropractic settings. Iannelli (1995) reported that the National College of Chiropractic was able to implement the AmbuQual system charting the Program Quality Index (PQI) of facilities. Over a 3-year period, parameters including staff performance, continuity of care, record keeping, patient risk minimization, satisfaction, compliance, and accessibility were tracked. Ianelli concluded that tracking such data and using them in organizational decisionmaking led to increased PQI scores. As chiropractors become more involved in interdisciplinary settings and networks, pressures for and experience with quality assurance and quality management efforts will increase. In addition, wider use of these technologies in teaching clinics should help establish practice habits that incorporate patient- and consumer-oriented performance measures making chiropractic services more accountable and appealing to consumers. 2. Malpractice Experience Chiropractors have among the lowest malpractice insurance premiums of all physician specialties, and the percentage of chiropractic physicians who have been sued for malpractice is lower than the percentages of medical and legal professionals (Brady, 1994; Medical Liability Monitor, 1996). Based on premium rate data provided by the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company (the largest chiropractic malpractice carrier in the U.S.), average annual premium costs for chiropractic malpractice coverage in 1996 ranged from a low of $611 in Indiana to a high of $4,107 in Connecticut with a national average of $2,177. This compares to average annual internal medicine premium costs ranging from a low of $1,308 in Arkansas to over $20,000 in Florida, Illinois, and New York (Medical Liability Monitor, 1996). Although malpractice premiums do not provide an accurate measure of risk, they do reflect the relative number and severity of complications and problems arising from care. Overall, chiropractic procedures appear to be comparatively safe, although potential side effects, complications, and contraindications to adjusting have been identified (Haldeman, 1993; McGregor, 1995). **Malpractice premiums reflect the amounts paid out to plaintiffs and the extent to which the insurance company is able to set its profit margins. It is true that premiums reflect relative number and severity of complications and problems. But they are also influenced by the severity of the original illness (suits and ultimate payouts are more likely to arise when patients are very sick or die) and the willingness of attorneys to file suit. Attorneys are generally less interested in suing chiropractors because they tend to carry less insurance (and therefore the case may not be worth pursuing) and because it is often difficult to find a chiropractor willing to testify against fellow chiropractors. Claims data from Canada revealed that between January 1986 and December 1990, there were a total of 159 claims made against chiropractors with the most common complaints being for lumbar spine injury, rib fracture, soft tissue injury, and cervical spine injury. Cerebrovascular accidents accounted for 8 percent of the claims (Henderson, 1994). According to claims data from the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company for 1990, the most common causes of malpractice claims were for disc problems, failure to diagnose, fracture, and soft tissue injury. Cerebrovascular accidents accounted for 6 percent of claims made (Haldeman, 1993). Estimates of the risk of specific complications from lumbar and cervical spine manipulation are presented in Chapter XI. **As far as I know, chiropractic malpractice insurance companies have not made full public disclosure of the number of claims they have encountered for cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). I believe this is a deliberate strategy to make it impossible to estimate how often such incidents occur. The estimates in Chapter XI are based on incomplete data and should not be considered reliable. In part due to concerns about the risk of adverse events and malpractice claims, guidelines for clinical management, minimization of risks, and informed consent have been published in the chiropractic literature (Haldeman, 1993; Henderson, 1994). Table 27 lists some conditions identified in the Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters that may require modification of high velocity thrust procedures due to possible risks of complications (Haldeman, 1993). Because of the limitations in data quality and availability, the type of evidence available for making these ratings was primarily expert opinion of participating panelists and/or case reports. - Table 27. Examples of Conditions (or Concurrent Conditions) That May Necessitate Modification of High Velocity Thrust Procedures on a Patient Absolute contraindication to high velocity thrust procedures - region with acute episode of rheumatoid arthropathy - acute fracture/dislocation - osodontoideum - active juvenile avascular necrosis - area with malignancy - bone or joint infection - acute myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome Relative to absolute contraindication to high-velocity thrust procedures - joint instability - benign bone tumors - clinical manifestations of vertebrobasilar arteriole insufficiency (to cervical manipulation) - congenital or acquired skeletal deformities Relative contraindication to high-velocity thrust procedures - spondylolisthesis with progressive slippage - articular hypermobility - bone demineralization - patient with bleeding disorders No contraindication - uncomplicated degenerative joint disease - subacute or chronic ankylosing spondylitis - nonprogressive spondylolysis or scoliosis - acute soft tissue injury Source: Haldeman S, et al. (eds). Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assurance and Practice Parameters. Gaithersburg, MD: Aspen Publishers, 1993. **The extent to which chiropractors follow any of the guidelines mentioned in this chapter or even are aware of them is unknown and may be rather low.
