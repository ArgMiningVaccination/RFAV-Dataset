Opioids are not the first-line therapy for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Evidence suggests that nonopioid treatments, including nonopioid medications and nonpharmacological therapies can provide relief to those suffering from chronic pain, and are safer. Effective approaches to chronic pain should: Use nonopioid therapies to the extent possible Identify and address co-existing mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) Focus on functional goals and improvement, engaging patients actively in their pain management Use disease-specific treatments when available (e.g., triptans for migraines, gabapentin/pregabalin/duloxetine for neuropathic pain) Use first-line medication options preferentially Consider interventional therapies (e.g., corticosteroid injections) in patients who fail standard non-invasive therapies Use multimodal approaches, including interdisciplinary rehabilitation for patients who have failed standard treatments, have severe functional deficits, or psychosocial risk factors NONOPIOID MEDICATIONS MEDICATIONMAGNITUDE OF BENEFITSHARMS COMMENTS Acetaminophen SmallHepatotoxic, particularly at dosesFirst-line analgesic, probably less effective than NSAIDs NSAIDs Small-moderate Cardiac, GI, renal First-line toleratedFirst-line for neuropathic pain; TCAs and SNRIs for fibromyalgia, TCAs for headaches Topical agents (lidocaine, capsaicin, NSAIDs)Small-moderateCapsaicin initial flare/ burning, irritation of mucus membranesConsider as alternative first-line, thought to be safer than systemic medications.
