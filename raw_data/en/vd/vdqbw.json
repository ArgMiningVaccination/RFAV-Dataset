Within your arcline, a line of energy that runs from earlobe to earlobe, are embedded karmic blueprints called samskaras. These energetic patterns include karma from this lifetime, previous lifetimes, and your ancestral line. Neuroscience tells us that just one subconscious thought is a million times more powerful than one conscious thought, and that 95 percent of our life is created by these subconscious thoughts, most of which have been patterned in us before the age of seven. Additionally, the science of epigenetics shows that trauma actually changes DNA, and the mutated genes are passed from generation to generation. Your inheritance can affect your physical, mental, and emotional health. But we have the opportunity to reverse these ancestral scars, healing the DNA, clearing the subconscious mind, and removing 15 generations of karma\u2014seven past, seven forward, and our own.
