Chinese Herbs have been studied and formulated for over millennia and are the most complex, yet effective way to utilize plant or botanical medicine to achieve results. Herbs are prescribed in formulas that are specifically designed to suit each individual. Typically, 10 different ingredients will be mixed to form a prescription that is tailored specifically to the patient's needs. What are the Properties of the Herbs Used for Herbal Medicine? The Chinese Herbal Medicine we provide in Plantation and Wilton Manors, FL has little to no side effects due to its low toxicity. This makes it equally suitable for all different types of patients: Adults, pregnant women, children, and babies. When describing herbs, they're broken down into tastes and properties to characterize them. The first breakdown is known as the four main temperatures, yet there is also a fifth. These being: Hot - Expels cold, warms up the interior of the body, used for cold syndromes. Cold - Expels heat, cools the blood, detoxifies, and is used for heat syndromes. Warm - Disperses cold and warms the channel. Cool - Clears away heat. Neutral - Not warm and not cool but has a tendency to be either or. When describing a temperature, we could also use the terms slightly cold and slightly warm. When the terms slightly are used it means that the temperature is not warm enough to the point of being hot and the same goes for cold. In order to properly treat with herbs, this distinction needs to be found early on in the diagnosis process. Although it's said in, \"Chapter 74, of the Inner Classics that, \"Hot diseases must be cooled, and cold diseases must be warmed,\" it's extremely important to gauge every individual's reaction to a specific herb. Next in our breakdown of the properties, we use to distinguish herbs is taste otherwise known in TCM as Wei. This eventually developed into the five-taste theory, which does not include the sixth taste known as bland. In the five-tastes theory, the five flavors refer to both the savors of the herbs and the medicinal effects. Furthermore, the five tastes are not only the true taste of herbs but also the generalization of the effects reflected in their clinical application. In ancient times flavors of the herbs are determined by taste. Later, upon further studies, it was realized that the tastes of herbs follow a relationship with their functions. The different tastes of the herbal medicine herbs Acrid or spicy (xin) - Promotes the flow of qi and blood and treats exterior syndromes such as the common cold. Sweet (gan) - Alleviates pain, harmonizes the functions of the stomach and spleen which aids in better digestion amongst other benefits, and even harmonizes the properties of different herbs. Bitter (Ku) - Clears heat, dries dampness within the body, relieves cough, stops vomiting, and unblocks the bowels. Sour (suan) - Prevents or even reverses the abnormal leakage of fluid and energy in and out of the body. Salty (xian) - Unblocks the bowels aiding in better digestion and release and dissipating nodules. Bland (dan)- Promotes urination, and drains dampness from the body. The actions of herbs with the same temperature but different tastes or same tastes but different temperatures, usually have some common actions but also different actions. The combinations are as followed: \"Some herbs have different tastes and different temperatures.\" \"Some herbs have the same temperatures and same tastes.\" \"Some herbs have the same temperature and different tastes\" \"Some herbs have the same tastes and different temperatures.\" How Does Herbal Medicine Work? \"Modern research has shown that there is a close relationship between the chemical composition and the tastes of herbs. For example, spicy herbs have more tannins and organic acids. Not only those two things but also volatile oil or saponins, and alkaloids. Bitter herbs contain more alkaloids, and glycosides. Sweet herbs have polysaccharides and protein. Lastly, salty herbs contain inorganic salt.\" Like everything in Traditional Chinese medicine and even in life, the tastes and temperatures are broken down into yin and yang. Cold and cool - Yin Hot and warm - Yang Sour, bitter, and salty - Yin Acrid or spicy and sweet - Yang What do our Chinese Herbal Medicine DOCTORS in Broward County take into consideration When it comes to combining herbs to create medicine there are seven features that the herbalist, doctor, or practitioner consider: Single effect - Meaning to use one herb alone. Usually applied when treating simple syndromes diagnosed by the doctor or practitioner Mutual accentuation - This is when two herbs with similar properties and effects are used in combination to reinforce each other's action. Mutual enhancement - Herbs that are not similar but have some relationship in the aspect of medicinal properties and actions are used in combination. One is used as a dominant herb and the other used as an assistant. Mutual counteraction - Toxic properties and side-effects of one herb can be reduced or removed by another herb. Mutual suppression - One herb can relieve or remove toxic properties and side-effects of the other herbs. Mutual antagonism - When two herbs are combined together, and one can restrict the other that reduces the actions of the other herbs and can even lose their positive effects. Mutual incompatibility - When two herbs are used together and through this combination, they can become toxic or reinforce toxicity, as well as, increase side effects, their combination is therefore considered forbidden. For every special case and individual it'll be determined during diagnoses the method of delivery: Boiled powders - \"These are powders that are decocted for approximately ten minutes\" Pills - \"Produced by combining the fine powder of pulverized medicinal substances\" Powders - \"Powders are readily absorbable, convenient, and easily stored in the form of medicinal preparation whose rate of medicinal action is between that or decoction and pills.\" Syrups - \"This form is most appropriate in the treatment of chronic debilitating diseases, cough, and sore throat.\" Medicinal wines - \"One of the most ancient forms of treatment in China. Used in treatment of painful obstructions, traumatic injuries, and a variety of disorders that include a deficiency.\" What Can You Expect from our Chinese Herbal Medicine in Broward County Clinics?
