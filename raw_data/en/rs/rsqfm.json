Sun WEidong China's Ambassador to india China-India@70: Scaling New Frontiers It's been a remarkable journey spanning seven decades. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India on April 1, 1950 marked a defining milestone in multifarious relations between the two neighbours and ancient civilisations. In an eloquent gesture, India became the first non-socialist country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Seven decades later, it's uplifting to see China-India relations transform into a multi- layered Strategic and Cooperative Partnership that encompasses virtually all areas of human activity. High-level diplomatic contacts have been complemented by a burgeoning economic partnership and robust people-to-people and cultural ties. The 70th anniversary felicitation messages exchanges by our leaders have set a positive tone for the future of this partnership. \"China-India relations have now reached a new starting point with new opportunities to be grasped... A stronger China-India relationship will bring more benefits to our two countries and peoples and contribute more positive energy to Asia and the world at large,\" Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a message to President Ram Nath Kovind. Similarly, Prime Minister Modi, in his message to Premier Li Keqiang, stressed on strengthening coordination and mutual solidarity, and jointly tackling the challenges faced by the world. In sync with this spirit of solidarity, our two countries have shown wisdom and maturity by constantly focusing on mutual cooperation to jointly combat the coronavirus pandemic. China and India have maintained close communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention and control. We appreciate the letter of support sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to President Xi Jinping in the early stages of the epidemic. Subsequently, the two leaders attended the Extraordinary G20 Leaders' Summit on COVID-19 in April. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had telephone conversations with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar twice, which focused on enhancing anti-epidemic cooperation. Our two countries have sent medical supplies to each other. We are touched by spontaneous expression of support from the Indian people. China will continue to share its experiences in epidemic prevention, control and treatment with the Indian side in different ways and extend our support to India as much as we can. The counter-pandemic cooperation is a fitting way to mark the 70th anniversary of China-India ties as it reflects our shared commitment to mutual solidarity through thick and thin and forging closer development partnership. To optimise the full potential of bilateral ties, the two countries should follow the four-fold path, including leading, transmitting, shaping, and integrating to achieve the common goal of \"universal harmony\" and mutual development. As we look ahead to a brighter future, I invite you to read this Special Edition of the Embassy magazine, which encapsulates reflections on myriad facets of the China-India relationship in three broad sections: political-diplomatic exchanges, pragmatic cooperation and people-to-people and cultural ties. These are difficult times, but we will leave no stone unturned to win the battle against the epidemic and jointly safeguard global and regional public health security. Given intertwined dreams of over 2.7 billion people of China and India, I am confident that we will take the \"Dragon-Elephant tango\" on a glorious journey in the next 70 years, and write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind.

Mapping the way ahead, the two countries need to follow a four-fold path, including leading, transmitting, shaping, and integrating to achieve the common goal of \"universal harmony\" and mutual development, says Chinese Ambassador to india sun Weidong. H.E. suN WEiDoNG On April 1, 2020, we embraced the important moment of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India. As the only two emerging countries with a population of more than 1 billion in the world, China and India shoulder the historical mission of national rejuvenation, play a leading role in the collective rise of developing countries, and inject strong momentum into the profound changes of the world unseen in a century. The two countries have never been as relevant as they are today. At this moment, it is particularly imperative to recall the original aspiration of establishing diplomatic ties 70 years ago and carry forward the spirit of good-neighborly friendship, solidarity, and cooperation between our two countries. From this new chapter, we should carry forward the profound friendship between our two peoples spanning thousands of years, deepen exchanges and mutual learning between our two civilizations and add new dimensions to how China and India coexist with each other as major emerging and neighboring countries. Fellow Travelers China and India are fellow travelers against all odds. Our two countries had fought side by side in the national liberation movement. Independence and national rejuvenation are our common goals, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence represent our shared wisdom in contributing to international relations. Today, we speak for safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and share the common aspiration of building a more just and equitable international order. Just as President Xi Jinping said, if China and India speak in one voice, the whole world will listen. As the only two emerging countries with a population of more than 1 billion in the world, China and India shoulder the historical mission of national rejuvenation, play a leading role in the collective rise of developing countries, and inject strong momentum into the profound changes of the world unseen in a century.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the two countries embarked on the path of economic reform and development. We have been learning from each other and riding high on the tides of rapid global changes and economic development. Today, China and India rank the second and fifth largest economies in the world, accounting for half of the Asian economy and one-fifth of the world. Our two countries have emerged as important engines of regional and global economic growth. Mutual Learning Among Civilizations China and India are practitioners of mutual learning among civilizations. The two countries have a long history of trade and exchange. China's paper, silk, porcelain, and tea were exported to India, while Indian singing and dancing, astronomy, architecture, and spices were introduced to China, marking a mutual intermingling of culture between the two countries. Zhang Qian was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Western Regions. Zheng He sailed to the Western Ocean seven times and visited India six times.

It is a new chapter of mutual respect and harmonious coexistence between the two civilizations. Jointly Combating Pandemic China and India are partners sailing in the same boat. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic around the world, China and India are standing side by side and helping each other, which highlights the significance of building a community with a shared future for mankind. At the Extraordinary G20 Leaders' Summit via video-link, president Xi Jinping emphasized the imperative for the international community to strengthen confidence, act with unity, and work together in a collective response to the COVID-19 outbreak. we must comprehensively step up international cooperation and foster greater synergy so that humanity as one could win the battle against such a major infectious disease. The Indian side echoed these remarks positively. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a letter of condolence to Chinese President Xi Jinping, expressing support for China's anti- epidemic efforts. Our two Foreign Ministers had two phone calls, and China has taken the initiative to share its experience in epidemic prevention and control with India. Chinese companies and social charity organizations provided anti-epidemic donations to India. China and India have worked together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. in retrospect: Three Keywords Looking back at seven decades of the shared journey, China-India relations have forged ahead despite ups and downs, and traversed an extraordinary path of development. The first key word is independence in the 1950s. The older generation of the two countries, such as Chairman Mao Zedong and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, made the historic decision of establishing diplomatic ties. India was the first non-socialist country to have diplomatic relations with China. Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru exchanged visits, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and attended the Bandung Conference together. Hindi Chinni Bhai Bhai (Indian and Chinese people are brothers) rang like an anthem through our two countries. The second one is development in the 1980s and beyond. In 1988, Indian Prime Minister rajiv Gandhi embarked on an \"ice-breaking visit\" to China. During the visit, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping reiterated the Five Principles of peaceful Coexistence as the defining guideline of international relations. The two sides agreed to resolve the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultations and seek a mutually acceptable solution. Meanwhile, the relations in other fields could be actively promoted. Since then, bilateral relations have developed in all areas, witnessing frequent mutual visits between the two leaders and the establishment of the \"Strategic and Cooperative Partnership for Peace and Prosperity\" between China and India. The third one is strategic communication beginning in 2013. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi established good working relations and personal friendship through \"hometown diplomacy\" in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The two leaders held two informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai in the past two years, creating a new model of exchanges between leaders. The two sides conducted strategic communication on long-term strategic international and regional issues and agreed to strengthen Closer Developmental Partnership between China and India.

NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 11Mapping Next steps The current momentum in China-India relations has been achieved with a lot of hard work and unremitting efforts of generations. As we look ahead to the next few decades, it's time to learn from experience and map the next steps in taking this crucial partnership to the next level. First, adhere to strategic guidance given by the leaders. Over the past 70 years, our leaders have grasped the general direction of China-India relations from a strategic and overall perspective. They have always steered the course whenever we joined hands in the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, or pushed bilateral relations back on track and jointly ushered in the \"Asian century\"; the two leaders conducted \"hometown diplomacy\" and informal Summits in recent years and reached a series of strategic consensus. Their roles are irreplaceable. Second, stick to the general trend of friendly cooperation. China and India have a history of friendly exchanges for more than two thousand years. The friendly cooperation, which has dominated most of the time, is the prevailing theme, through which the two peoples have forged a profound friendship. Our joint efforts in combating the COVID-19 epidemic today remind me of the great sacrifice made by Dr Dwarkanath Kotnis, a member of the Indian medical team to China who saved lives on the battlefield for the cause of Chinese liberation. We will hold an event to commemorate the 110th birth anniversary of Dr Kotnis later this year. As the tides of history roll forward, the waves of friendship and cooperation are moving ahead. More people, particularly the young generation, are joining the cause of China-India friendship and passing on the noble spirit of Dr Kotnis. Third, add impetus to mutually beneficial cooperation. China and India share similar national conditions. Both countries are at the critical stage of President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi established good working relations and personal friendship through \"hometown diplomacy\" in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The two leaders held two informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai in the past two years, creating a new model of exchanges between leaders.

Our two economies are highly complementary, and mutually beneficial cooperation injects impetus into the development of China and India. Bilateral trade volume has grown from less than $100 million in the 1950s to nearly $100 billion today. China has been India's largest trading partner for consecutive years. There's huge potential for bilateral cooperation in medicine, information technology, connectivity, environment protection, poverty reduction, and governance experience sharing. Fourth, strengthen coordination in international and regional affairs. China and India are important members of multilateral organizations and mechanisms such as the BrICS, SCO, G20, wTO, and China-russia- India Trilateral. We shoulder the responsibility and obligation to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, speak up for emerging economies, and forge a more fair, equitable and rational international order to adapt to the rapid changes of the world's landscape. China and India share similar positions on non-traditional security issues such as climate change, energy and food security, and public health. Both countries also share common interests in advancing maritime dialogue, regional connectivity, and \"China-India Plus\" cooperation. We are both seizing the development opportunities of the Fourth Industrial revolution, including 5G, big data, and artificial intelligence. Coordination and cooperation in these areas drive bilateral relations to grow continuously. Fifth, handle the differences properly. There are issues related to boundary and Xizang (Tibet) left by history between the two countries. The evolving international and regional situation has complicated impacts on China-India relations. The two sides have established mechanisms to manage differences and seek a constructive solution through dialogue and consultation. One of the mechanisms is the Special Representatives' meeting on the China-India Boundary Question through which the political parameters and guiding principles for a boundary settlement were agreed upon. For decades, not a single bullet has been fired across the China-India border. Our common interests far outweigh our differences. The two sides should expand cooperation and curb negative factors to break the circle of ups and downs in China-Indian relations, and proactively shape bilateral relations.China and India are important neighbors to each other. To respect each other's development paths and achieve our development is in itself a contribution to world prosperity and stability. Against the backdrop of the current international situation, China and India increasingly shoulder important responsibilities in maintaining global stability and promoting common development. China-India relations have gone far beyond the bilateral scope and are of global strategic significance. Both sides should adhere to the basic judgment that China and India pose no threat but offer development opportunities to each other. We should regard each other as a positive factor in global change and take each other as partners for realizing the dream of development. Both China and India stand for an independent foreign policy. We should correctly analyze and view each other's strategic intentions with a positive, open, and inclusive attitude. we should reject zero-sum games, not target any third party, and not impede the development of relations with other countries. We should continue to push for a new type of international relations guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. New starting Point The China-India relations stand at a new starting point now and are set to usher in new opportunities. The rise of China and India will have a far-reaching The two sides should expand cooperation and curb negative factors to break the circle of ups and downs in China-Indian relations, and proactively shape bilateral relations. NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 13impact on the world. We should seek wisdom from thousands of years of our two civilizations to explore a way to get along with each other in the direction of \"enhancing mutual trust, focusing on cooperation, managing differences and seeking common development\". Enhancing mutual trust is the foundation. Only through mutual respect, consultation on an equal footing, openness and mutual trust, can the two sides correctly view each other's development intentions, subsequently consolidate and deepen the basic judgement that China and India are partners rather than rivals, representing opportunities rather than threats to each other. Focusing on cooperation is the right approach. The two sides should actively seek convergence of interests, seize all opportunities for cooperation, and achieve mutual benefit; and thus, win-win results by making the pie of cooperation even bigger. By doing so, we can continue to accumulate positive energy for the development of bilateral relations. Managing differences hold the key to harmonious relations. The two sides should always bear in mind the overall picture of bilateral relations, put differences in proper perspective, and deal with them properly. The two sides should cut the negative list and not allow differences to interfere with bilateral relations and become disputes. Seeking common development should be the direction of our shared endeavors. China hopes it will develop well and wishes India the same. Seeking common development is conducive to the stability and prosperity of the region and the world at large. China and India should join hands with other developing countries in winning the marathon of achieving economic development, people's happiness, and national rejuvenation, which is an integral component of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Four Keys There are four keys which hold the key to how major emerging and neighboring countries like China and India coexist with each other, namely \"leading, transmitting, shaping, and integrating\". To guide the direction of bilateral relations through the informal summits and reaching consensus; translate the consensus into tangible cooperation and outcomes through the transmission of the leaders' consensus to all levels; shape bilateral relations and accumulate positive momentum by going beyond the mode of managing differences; and achieve common development through strengthening exchanges and cooperation and promoting convergence of interests. Both President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned the dictum \"the whole world is but a family,\" which is similar to the Chinese philosophy of \"universal harmony in the world.\" The ancient oriental wisdom is still showing vitality today. I am confident that China and India have the vision and capacity to blaze a path for friendship. Let's take the \"dragon-elephant tango\" on a glorious journey in the next 70 years, and write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind.

This is a big day worth celebrations, and is very special to me as I spent my entire lifetime forging an indissoluble bond with India.In the past 70 years, China-India relations have undergone profound changes. At a time of profound changes in the world, the rapid development of the Chinese and Indian economies, the rise of their comprehensive national strength and influence in global affairs, the global and strategic significance As China and india jointly commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the two countries have seen a smoother path, a pragmatic approach, and a brighter future for China-india relations, writes Zhou Gang, a former Ambassador of China to india. it is the shared aspiration of the 2.7 billion Chinese and indian people and also good news for the whole world, he says. Blaze a Trail for a BeTTer fuT ureZHou GANG NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 15of China-India cooperation not only arouse the interest of our two peoples but also attract more attention of the international community. A comprehensive and objective assessment of China-India relations in the past 70 years, analysis of the current situation, and an outlook on the future will be conducive to further promoting and deepening bilateral relations. Deepening Partnership In my view, it can be summarized in three sentences. First, the past seven decades have witnessed an unusual journey of bilateral relations, which gradually become pragmatic and mature with temporary unpleasant conflicts, but the main trend of good-neighborliness and cooperation persists. Second, in the 21st century, our relations have reached a new level, and China-India strategic cooperative partnership has been enriching and deepening. Although differences of views and frictions of interests are unavoidable due to historical reasons and respective core interests, both sides have been able to properly handle them from a big picture. Third, in the context of the common task of economic development and the general trend of changing international situations, there is a broad space for win-win cooperation between our two countries. As two ancient civilizations, China and India have made outstanding contributions to human progress, and our two peoples also have friendly exchanges for two thousand years. India was among the first countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. In June 1954, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and was warmly welcomed by thousands of Indian people. On June 28, Premier Zhou and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru signed the Joint Statement reiterating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that guide bilateral relations as well as relations with other countries in Asia and the rest of the world. In October 1954, Prime Minister Nehru visited China and was warmly received by the Chinese side. In 1955, China and India made valuable contributions to the successful convening of the Asian-African Conference and the birth of the 10 principles. In the 1950s, \"Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai\" resounded throughout our two countries. Pragmatic Approach However, China-India relations have not been all plain sailing. British colonial territorial expansion to China's Xizang and its instigation of Xizang's \"independence\" left China and India a difficult issue that remains unsolved till today. Relations between the two countries plunged to a 14-year low ebb after the 1962 border conflict. In 1976, China and India resumed ambassadorial relations, initiating the process of normalization of bilateral relations in the following 12 years under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Indian prime minister rajiv Gandhi made an ice-breaking visit to China in December 1988. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told him that \"the real Asia-pacific and Asian century will not come until China, India and some other neighboring countries have developed,\" and \"If China and India develop well, then we could say we make contributions to mankind\". For this great goal, the Chinese government proposed that all developing countries should improve their relations and strengthen their cooperation, especially for China and India. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Chinese leaders adopted a positive and pragmatic attitude towards improving China-India relations, agreeing to work hard to develop bilateral relations while seeking a solution to the boundary question. The two sides agreed to solve this issue in a peaceful and friendly manner following the principle of mutual understanding, mutual accommodation and mutual adjustment. Rajiv Gandhi reiterated that Xizang is an autonomous region of China, and Xizang exiles are not allowed to engage in anti-China political activities in India. As two ancient civilizations, China and India have made outstanding contributions to human progress, and our two peoples also have friendly exchanges for two thousand years.

In June 2003, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China. In April 2005, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited India. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India. In January 2008, Indian Prime minister manmohan Singh visited China. China- India relations have made rapid progress in all the fields. Since prime minister Narendra modi took office in May 2014, the bilateral relations have maintained a strong momentum based on the past foundation over the years. In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to India. In 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China. Over the past few years, the two leaders met each other and had in-depth exchanges of views on China-India relations on many occasions, including the two informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai. Our two leaders' views and proposals have charted a new course and played a leading role in the sound and stable development of bilateral relations. Strategic Significance China regards its relations with India as one of the most important bilateral relations. China-India relations are of global and strategic significance. The two countries should make joint efforts to maintain the positive momentum of bilateral relations and open up new prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation. we should maintain high-level contacts and enhance strategic communication at all levels, complete feasibility studies on major cooperation projects as planned, and build flagship projects for China-India cooperation. we need to implement China-India cultural exchange programs and carry out cooperation among think tanks, media, and local governments. It is also important to strengthen coordination and cooperation in the United Nations, BRICS, G20, and other multilateral organizations, support each other's participation in the regional cooperation process, and jointly promote peace, stability, and development in Asia. The two countries should develop and make good use of the Special Representatives' meeting mechanism on the boundary question and work for an early conclusion of a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable settlement framework. At the same time, we need to properly manage differences, continue to maintain peace and tranquility in border areas, and not allow the boundary question to affect the development of bilateral relations. As China and India jointly commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties, we have seen a smoother path, a more steady pace and pragmatic approach, stronger measures, and a brighter future for China-India relations. It is the shared aspiration of the 2.7 billion Chinese and Indian people and also good news for the whole world. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in May 2014, the bilateral relations have maintained a strong momentum based on the past foundation over the years. In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to India. In 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China.

(facing page) 18 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping have held two informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai in April 2018 and October 2019, respectively. Many observers, analysts, and researchers ask what exactly have been the outcomes of these summits. Here are the answers to this query. The reason the two countries agreed to such \"Informal Leaders Meetings\" was to give ample time and space to the leaders to talk to each other on topics, which they chose themselves. Naturally, there was some coordination on the broad subjects to be covered beforehand. But the leaders were free to decide on the duration, or in what direction a particular conversation should proceed. While this can even be true of more formal meetings with a set plan, it is the hallmark of an informal meeting. Hence, India and China, which gave the world the Panchsheel or Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the 1950s, have once again contributed to diplomatic practice in the 21st century. setting Precedents The Wuhan and Chennai informal summits between the Indian Prime Minister and the Chinese President were also clear on what is described by some as \"strategic communication\". It was an exercise in understanding the other side's point of view, its dreams, its goals and objectives, its assessments, and its strategies. Starting with each country's civilizational ethic, norms, and traditions, which shape the reality of today, the two leaders also spoke to one another of the hopes, ambitions, and desires of their people. It gave them an understanding of each other's policies, both domestic as well as foreign, and the nature of geo-economics and geopolitics. The meetings also gave them an idea of how the two can work together in large multilateral forums and acknowledgment of the areas where they have differences of opinions and positions. Such a free, frank, and direct exchange of views would perhaps not have been possible in more formal settings where the leaders usually speak from prepared texts and talking points. Informal settings are more amenable to producing candid views and sharing of confidences. So, president Xi and Prime Minister Modi have been trailblazers in setting new diplomatic precedents and norms. Second, the leaders of India and China agreed to work at ensuring that our border areas remain peaceful. The leaders risked their reputation to secure such an outcome is of significance and has an impact on each country. It has positive spin-offs for each of our nations. Only if the India-China border areas remain peaceful we can focus on the more important task of resolving the boundary problem between us. Else, all our energies are spent on de-escalating situations such as the one at Doklam in 2017. After the discussions at the first informal summit at Wuhan, military exchanges NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 19between the countries resumed and even led to mutual visits of defense ministers. Such meetings will also be enhanced as this is a prerequisite for peace. We must also be more ambitious and move from mere exchanges to understanding the thinking of the other side's military. If we can move in this direction, it will reduce mutual suspicions, which would be an important outcome from the informal summits. Reducing Trade Deficit & Attracting investment Third, the establishment of the new High- Level Mechanism headed by the Vice Premier of China and India's Finance Minister on Trade, Investment, and Services, announced in Chennai, indicates that the leaders are keen to reduce India's trade deficit with China and ensure that economics provides the ballast to this relationship. The deficit can only reduce if India sells more services to that country, or if we attract significant amounts of foreign investment from China. Dismantling the non-tariff barriers against Indian exports of services will be a primary goal for this group, and so too for Indian pharma exports. However, India too needs to take its own steps to attract Chinese investment so that the capital account will help balance our payments. For example, we have been working for years on providing Chinese firms with a China-specific industrial park where they can cluster together since it provides them greater confidence in the Indian market. Such industrial parks must come to fruition soon. There is little doubt that economic ties between our nations can become mutually profitable and provide a basis for understanding if there is a level-playing field for both sides. Unfortunately, due to the havoc caused by the coronavirus across the globe, this new High-Level mechanism has not been able to meet and start its work. We hope this can happen soon, once the pandemic has been tackled. Enhancing Tourism & P2P Exchanges Fourth, Prime Minister Modi and President Xi have recognized that if our countries have to enjoy a better relationship and enhance trust, then the ordinary people of India and China need to interact more vibrantly. Therefore, to provide an impetus to such exchanges, they established the High-Level mechanism on people- to-people Exchanges, headed by their respective foreign ministers. Two meetings of this new mechanism have already been held. It is indeed unfortunate that India has not made a focused effort at attracting more tourists from China, and found time to work Informal settings are more amenable to producing candid views and sharing of confidences. So, President Xi and Prime Minister Modi have been trailblazers in setting new diplomatic precedents and norms.

Marketing 'Incredible India' in China will be the first step, and we shall also have to work with Chinese travel agents, airlines, online agencies, and social media to popularize India as a tourism destination. Naturally, we will also have to ensure the facilities in India for Chinese tourists who have special needs. Through such efforts, our mountains, beaches, temples, heritage sites, the Buddhist trail, as well as our wildlife sanctuaries, would be hugely popular with the Chinese. We will ourselves be surprised by the results of our efforts, and we can easily see up to 1.5 million Chinese tourists visiting India over the next few years. It will be significantly more than the current 250,000 Chinese tourists. Multilateral Collaboration Finally, the informal summits between our leaders have enabled India and China to work together at the multilateral organizations. Our approaches to globalization have been similar, so we cooperate closely at the WTO. We must also work together on public health issues like the ongoing coronavirus problem. Perhaps, Indian and Chinese scientists and molecular biologists can together find a vaccine for this disease. We will need to work closely at the United Nations as well so that the positions we have at BRICS and SCO can be voiced at international events. There is little doubt that the two informal summits between President Xi and PM Modi have brought stability to India-China relations.

Both countries have planned 70 activities to celebrate the occasion; however, a sudden outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted this. Nevertheless, looking back on the past seven decades of ups and downs in China-India relations, it seems that such disruptions are not uncommon. India was the first non-socialist country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries immediately entered the honeymoon period with the famous catchphrase \"Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai (Indians and Chinese are brothers)\". Bilateral relations reached a peak in 1954 when the leaders of the two countries exchanged visits within the year and jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which still guide international relations today. However, Xizang-related issues and border disputes have turned bilateral relations from mutual help and good- neighborliness to a 30-year cold period. It was not until late 1988 that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi made an ice-breaking visit to China. Since then, the leaders of the two countries have made great efforts and brought bilateral relations back to the right track of three decades of normalization. However, the 72-day Doklam standoff in the summer of 2017 disrupted the development of bilateral relations again. After that, the leaders of the two countries have made continuous efforts to correct the deviation of bilateral relations. Both cooperation and competition define this relationship, which might see more twists and turns and unexpected disruptions sometimes. Three Major issues At the beginning of the next seven decades journey of bilateral relations, it is necessary to revisit the past experiences and lessons to provide reference and reflection for the future. In the past seven decades, three major factors NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 23have continuously disrupted the development of China- India relations: historical complex, geopolitical rivalry, and competition between major countries. To ensure that China- India relations remain sound and stable in the future, the two sides, from the high-level government officials to ordinary people, should properly handle these three major issues. Channels for Dialogue & Cultural Exchanges It is crucial to open more channels for dialogue and cultural exchanges between our two civilizations to solve the issue of different interpretations of history, which created many problems. In the history of mankind, we saw many conflicts among other nations, but never between China and India, the two ancient civilizations. In fact, our two civilizations have helped each other in many ways. China's historical records have helped India find her lost history, while India's religion and culture have greatly enriched the Chinese language and spiritual world. The two countries should have the wisdom to resolve the historical complex through dialogue and cultural exchanges. The communication of hearts and minds between our two peoples will bring us enlightenment. The brilliant inspiration of \"harmony between man and nature\" and \"harmony between brahman and self\" will enable us to overcome differences and difficulties and forge ahead hand in hand to build greater harmony between China and India and with the world. It also coincides with building a community with a shared future for mankind proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. As the world's two most populous In the past seven decades, three major factors have contInuously dIsrupted the development of chIna-IndIa relatIons: hIstorIcal complex, geopolItIcal rIvalry, and competItIon between major countrIes. chIna's hIstorIcal records have helped IndIa fInd her lost hIstory, whIle IndIa's relIgIon and culture have greatly enrIched the chInese language and spIrItual world.Chinese and Indian soldiers during the 8th China-India Joint Counter-terrorism Exercise entitled \"Hand-in-Hand 2019\" at Umroi Cantonment in Meghalaya in December 2019.

Building the Himalayan Bridge As long as we could draw wisdom from history, our two countries will be able to put aside geopolitical considerations and zero-sum mentality and find a way to coexist peacefully. It is our historical mission to overcome geographical rivalry. The new era of globalization, especially the Internet of Everything, has provided us with a historic opportunity to build a glorious future together. Our dream of transforming the Himalayas from a \"natural barrier\" to a \"bridge\" between the two countries has never been better placed to be realized as both countries are pushing ahead with their connectivity projects. The time has come for China and India to become global powers and make the eastern civilizations glorious again as long as we can solve the problem of geographical competition. Joint Rise & Development The key to properly address problems of the major country competition is to see the rise of each other as an opportunity to bring common development and achievements. With strong late-mover and complementary advantages, our two countries could make full use of their close geographical locations to achieve unprecedented development. The joint development of the two countries will not only benefit the well-being of our nearly 3 billion people, but also the prosperity of the entire region from the Indian Ocean to Asia-pacific, thus creating a more sustainable foundation for the rise of our two countries. We must reject the western logic that \"strong neighbors cannot get along with each other except for one being superior and another being subordinate\". We can draw inspiration from the China-russia strategic partnership for further development of China- India relations. If we want to design a stable and long-term path for the future development of China-India relations, I would prefer to compare it to a relationship of driving in adjacent lanes. China and India should drive in its own lane, not to force others to follow, not to make a sudden lane change or cut in, to avoid causing troubles. The two drivers may stop from time to time to have a tea chat and exchange ideas about driving, lend a helping hand to each other to solve the problem of the breakdown of the vehicle, work together to remove obstacles and solve various challenges on our way forward. We could jointly promote the construction of a better driving environment. By doing so, China-India relations will usher in a smoother next 70 years.

The fluctuating oil prices had a bearing on the US stock market that saw repeated downturns. The impact of the pandemic is probably more severe than the 2008 world financial crisis. Therefore, a global economic slowdown seems inevitable. No country is immune to this crisis. Despite significant economic growth in recent years, China and India also face escalating challenges and risks. 48 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONIndia's annual GDP growth rate exceeded by seven percent on average, becoming one of the engines driving global economic growth. In may 2019, modi was re-elected with a landslide victory. He announced the goals of making India a $5 trillion economy by the 2024 fiscal year, and the world's third-largest economy by 2030. However, India still suffers from underdeveloped infrastructure and a sluggish manufacturing sector and hasn't seen any meaningful improvement in its business environment and demographic dividend. These factors hindered its industrialization and urbanization. Moreover, India has a huge impoverished population and faces immense pressure in employment. In 2019, India's macroeconomic index saw sharp fluctuations, with its growth slowing. Despite increased pressure on its economy, the manufacturing sector provided a glimmer of hope. Economic Transitions China opened up its economy in 1978 while India embarked on economic reforms in 1991. Since then, the two countries have made rapid strides to become the world's two fastest-growing economies. After the 2008 financial crisis, China took vital measures to stabilize the economy. In 2010, China's GDP reached USD$6 trillion, overtaking Japan to become the world's second-largest economy. At the time, the structural challenges arising from rapid economic growth forced China to adjust its development goals to avoid falling into the so- called middle-income trap. China adopted measures to remove bottlenecks for resource allocation, economic reforms, as well as environmental protection. Today, the Chinese economy has entered a crucial stage that pays more attention to quality and sustainable development rather than only high-speed growth. However, since 2018, it witnessed a slow growth rate due to trade disputes with the US and the sluggish world economy. Also, since early 2020, the epidemic posed a significant challenge to the Chinese economy, although the government is managing the crisis with reasonable success. It is noteworthy that India's economy grew at a high rate of 8.9 percent in 2010. Analysts believe that the country's GDP, based on the purchasing power parity (PPP), has surpassed that of Japan, making India the world's third-largest economy. However, its economy didn't maintain the rapid growth rate as expected from 2011 to 2013. During the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the rupee depreciated sharply, private investment plummeted, and the GDP growth rate dropped to 4.1 percent (which was later recalibrated to 4.9 percent), the lowest in the past 10 years. It seemed that India's economic miracle had suddenly faded out. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge of the office in may 2014, he launched a series of development initiatives such as Make in India, Smart Cities, Digital India, and Clean India. He also implemented a bold policy to abolish the country's largest-denomination banknotes and rolled out the landmark Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform. The Modi administration has made tremendous efforts to boost private investment and create a favorable business environment. Modi's Make in India initiative, in particular, created over 12 million jobs each year. In 2014, the growth rate of India's economy hit 7.4 percent, equal to that of China. The following year, India saw its GDP growing by 7.6 percent, surpassing China to become the fastest-growing economy in the world for the first time. During his first tenure, Today, the Chinese economy has entered a crucial stage that pays more attention to quality and sustainable development rather than only high-speed growth.

The two Asian neighbors have a combined population of more than 2.7 billion. In 2019, China's GDP exceeded $14 trillion, and its per capita GDP surpassed the $10,000 mark for the first time. India's GDp reached $2.9 trillion, overtaking Britain to become the world's fifth-largest economy, and its per capita GDP was about $2,100. However, both countries suffered somewhat from the global economic slowdown last year. According to the latest report, China's economic growth rate was 6.1 percent in 2019, a figure still in the range of expectations, but India's GDp growth rate decreased significantly to 4.8 percent. China has comparative advantages in infrastructure and manufacturing, while India's strengths lie in its service industry, information technology, and pharmaceuticals. In this sense, the two countries are mutually complementary in economic development and hold great potential for cooperation. Although China and India seemed natural partners, bilateral collaboration hasn't seen much progress, particularly in infrastructure, manufacturing, and investment. In 2018, the trade volume between China and India reached $95.5 billion. According to the latest statistics of China Customs, bilateral trade was $92.7 billion in 2019, lower than the goal of $100 billion. By the end of 2017, China's direct investments in India totaled $4.7 billion, and in 2018, India's cumulative gross investment in China reached $900 million. Bilateral trade and investment, although on the rise in recent years, remain insufficient considering their huge markets with a combined population of 2.7 billion and mutual economic complementarities. The volume of bilateral trade and investment does not match their economic size and population. The trade imbalance is a primary obstacle hindering further economic cooperation in recent years. In 2019, China's trade surplus with India reached USD$56 billion (USD$60 billion, according to Indian statistics), accounting for 30 percent of India's total trade deficit. It not only thwarted India's will to promote bilateral trade with China but also made a negative impact on mutual trust in investment. The situation came from the failure to leverage the mutual complementarities between Chinese and Indian industrial structures in bilateral economic cooperation. Moreover, China and India complement and compete with each other in terms of goods trade, and their mutual strengths in goods and services trade haven't been fully leveraged. Mutual investment hasn't been perfectly connected to the industrial development of the two countries. The two sides have yet to achieve an optimal balance of their interests and find the most effective way to solve disputes. The trade imbalance between China and India should be addressed not only through expanding mutual trade and investment but also through regional and multilateral mechanisms such as BRICS and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Simply increasing or decreasing exports isn't sustainable, and protectionism cannot solve trade imbalance. Reform and opening up remain the best way to solve economic problems. It has been proven by China's reform and opening up over the past 40 years. Although the world economy faces a crisis, economic globalization remains an irreversible trend. The global market will eventually become an interconnected, interdependent, and integrated \"global village.\" For this reason, international trade and investment will become increasingly integrated, and mutual investment will become an effective way to solve trade imbalance. overcoming Challenges This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of China-India diplomatic ties. The global spread of COVID-19 has made a severe impact on the world economy, and Western developed countries, represented by the United States, began to turn to protectionism. Both China and India have urgent needs for economic 50 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONrestructuring. Now is the time for the two countries to promote economic cooperation and address global challenges with a more active attitude. The Trump administration's protectionist policy targets not only China but India as well. In June 2018, the United States imposed additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from India, causing a loss of $241 million for Indian exporters. On May 31, 2019, the White House announced that the US would end preferential trade treatment for India from June 5. This move would affect Indian exports worth $5.6 billion to the US that were formerly free of tariffs. During his visit to India from February 24 to 25, 2020, US President Donald Trump didn't make any substantive compromise on trade disputes that India was eager to solve. It indicates that Trump's policies are volatile and unpredictable. The consensus reached by Chinese and Indian leaders at their Wuhan and Chennai informal meetings in 2018 and 2019 respectively brought optimism and guided the bilateral relations in the right direction. The two countries have maintained a steady momentum in their cooperation in fields like energy, medicine, information technology, and software, as well as cultural exchanges in areas like yoga and film. The core of modi Economics is to create a friendly environment to attract foreign investment, strengthen infrastructure construction, and enhance the manufacturing industry to create as many jobs as possible. It is also a lesson that China drew in its development process. The 70th anniversary of their diplomatic ties presents an opportunity for China and India to strengthen their cooperation to address the common challenges facing the world economy. The two countries should focus on removing bottlenecks hindering economic and trade development, and expand cooperation in new realms such as alternate energy and digital economy. These moves will consolidate bilateral economic and trade cooperation in the short-term and help China and India play a bigger role in reconstructing the international economic order and gain more say for developing countries on the international stage in the medium and long-term. China and India should focus on their convergences, rather than magnify their differences that will lead to losing opportunities for cooperation. Closer China-India cooperation will not only benefit the two countries but also have regional and global implications. Both countries are major driving forces for global economic growth. Only when China and India work together can the world economy maintain steady growth. It is also the only choice for the world to bounce back from the economic downturn in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, China's GDP exceeded $14 trillion, and its per capita GDP surpassed the $10,000 mark for the first time. India's GDP reached $2.9 trillion, overtaking Britain to become the world's fifth-largest economy, and its per capita GDP was about $2,100.

NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 51The year 2020 holds special significance both for India and India-China relations. It not only marks the 70th year of the adoption of the Indian constitution but also signifies the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations with China. The last seven decades have seen a tremendous transition in India-China relations, which have expanded substantially and become increasingly diverse and multifaceted. The committed leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping have transformed our bilateral engagement through unconventional but effective informal Summits, first in wuhan, China, and second in Mamallapuram, near Chennai. These summits aimed at enhancing both economic partnership and the human relations between the two countries. Thus, the 70th anniversary celebration to foster a comprehensive relationship was also one of the key focuses of the summits. This shared vision of our heads of government needs to be made a reality by all of us together with a holistic approach, especially in a post-COVID environment. Hence, we would like to share five key factors with our two great leaders to achieve this objective. Fostering Cultural Exchanges It is perhaps the most significant area of cooperation going forward. There is no denying that the true essence of partnership between any two nations lies in the exposure and awareness for each other's cultures and values. India and China share a long history of cultural association with Buddhism binding our spiritual beliefs. Despite such deep historical and cultural linkages, the tourist flow between India and China is below potential. For instance, India attracted only around 225000 out of over 140 million Chinese tourists who travelled around the world. We must set ourselves some targets backed with a focused plan to develop robust engagements between our communities, which would subsequently augment the business. The resounding success of Indian movies such as Dangal, Secret Superstar, Bahubali, Hindi Medium, Toilet, and Andhadhun at the Chinese box office only exemplifies the role India's entertainment industry can play in bringing the two peoples closer. It's high time China looks at using India as a backdrop for its cinema to nurture this soft power of our relationship. fICCI's flagship programs like frAmES and Great Indian Travel Bazaar are perfect platforms for promoting people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Multilateral Cooperation India and China share membership with several coveted multilateral platforms such as G-20, BrICS, and SCO. Both countries have expanded economic unlEaSH ing PotEntial for roBuSt india-CHina 2.0 tiES A holistic india-China partnership is crucial for global peace, stability, and prosperity in a post-COVID-19 scenario. The five drivers of cultural exchange, multilateral cooperation, provincial-level connections, building start-up ecosystems, and a balanced and diversified partnership would be the key to robust india-China 2.0 ties, write Manish singhal and Gajendra Badgujar.MANisH siNGHAL GAJENDrA BADGuJAr 52 NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONcooperation with the global community through these vital institutions. Since India and China both account for more than 40 percent of the world's population and represent the common interest and aspirations of many emerging economies, we need to cooperate in these multilateral forums/ groupings. post COVID-19, multilateralism and globalization may take a back seat, and hence our two Asian powers need to further a clear economic agenda at these forums. FICCI serves the interests of the Indian industry at BRICS and SCO and is working towards the development of a plan for India's G-20 presidency in 2022. We must highlight that India and China work together in promoting a business plan during the deliberations at these forums to mitigate any adverse impact on globalization.Building state and Provincial Connect State and provincial connectivity form a cornerstone of this growing economic relationship. Establishing a link between the Indian states and Chinese provinces is crucial as the real action for India lies in the states. FICCI has been actively promoting this provincial-level partnership and has organised several initiatives in the past such as the Gujarat-Guangdong Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference last year in Ahmedabad. Gujarat also conducted similar engagements with Shandong and Hainan provinces. The diversity of Chinese and Indian provincial economies warrants more such arrangements to harness our true economic potential.

Chinese investments in Indian unicorns such as paytm are well-known. Enhanced Chinese investments in Indian start-ups and innovation ecosystem will enable Indian companies to benefit from the experience and technological know-how of Chinese companies that have achieved greater success in their home market in similar verticals. Besides, the Indian consumption market resonates with China and provides a better growth template for Indian start-ups than their western counterparts. At the same time, China can draw benefit from India's focus on social impact innovations, considering that our bottom of the pyramid social set-up has similar development imperatives. Towards this agenda, fICCI nurtures a few successful platforms to find opportunities for Indian start-ups in technical and social impact innovations space. Countries like Rwanda and Ethiopia have replicated some of these programs, while Mexico and others recreated the framework. Balanced and Diversified Partnership Last but not least, India and China continue to be one of the largest trade partners, with a significant increase in bilateral trade over the last decade. However, India's trade deficit with China is not sustainable, and both governments have taken several measures realizing that a one-way relationship does not go too far. At the same time, I would like to urge the Indian industry to utilize platforms such as the China International Import Expo to showcase its products and enhance exports to China. In the manufacturing sector, Chinese companies must look at \"manufacturing partnerships\" and work towards backward integration by developing its ancillary units in India for component manufacturing.FICCI's flagship programs like FRAMES and Great Indian Travel Bazaar are perfect platforms for promoting people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang interacted with a youth delegation from India in May 2013. 54 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONThe diversity of Chinese and Indian provincial economies warrants more such arrangements to harness our true economic potential. From $1.6 billion direct Chinese investment in 2014, mostly by state-owned enterprises, there is an upward trend in inward investments, amounting to $5.08 billion in 2019, significantly coming from private firms. Similarly, several major Indian companies like Tatas, Mahindra & Mahindra, Dr. Reddy's, Reliance Industries, and Larsen & Toubro have their presence in China. The combined Indian direct investment in China until September 2019 is US$ 0.92 billion. It can be increased further through greater market access and diversified outlook. We expect solutions to some of these pertinent issues through the setting up of the \"High-Level Mechanism on Trade and Economic Cooperation.\" It has been set-up to discuss trade, investment, and services between India and China, in line with the agreement of our two leaders at the informal summit in India last year. The effectiveness of such a mechanism would require a clear action plan and intent from both sides, coupled with a structured follow-up mechanism to ensure tangible results. As a representative of the Indian industry, FICCI hopes that it would also expedite and enhance market access for Indian companies in the Chinese market, especially in agricultural, pharmaceuticals, and IT products. The five drivers discussed for our economic engagement gain significance in the post-COVID-19 scenario. Till the time our two big economies cooperate and show the way to the world, which would be trying to wriggle out of a global pandemic, we could be staring at a much slower global economy. We are sure that the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic relations will be a milestone in our engagement and usher in a new era of a holistic and collaborative approach. It will not only strengthen India-China bilateral relations but also work towards a better future for global peace, stability, and prosperity. It could mark the beginning of India-China 2.0.

MANisH CHAND In the backdrop of the 7th century rock-cut monuments at the world heritage site of Mahabalipuram, the leaders of India and China sipped coconut water and shared their hopes for national development and harmonious bilateral relations. On Day 1 of their second informal summit on October 11, 2019, the conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping largely focused on how PM Modi's plan to create a New India by 2022 to mark Chinese President Xi Jinping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Second China-India Informal Summit in Chennai in October 2019. 56 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONWHY india-CH ina E ConomiC and dEVEloPmEnt Partn ErSH iP mattErS the 75th anniversary of India's independence and Xi Jinping's China Dream can open new avenues for widening cooperation between the two Asian neighbours. The shared understanding that emerged from the second informal summit was a recognition and reaffirmation by the two leaders that the simultaneous development of India and China presents mutually beneficial opportunities. High-Level Dialogue Mechanism The second informal summit accentuated the big-picture understanding firmed up by pm modi and President Xi, which has been sharply in focus since the first informal summit in wuhan in April 2019, that only by enhancing economic and development partnership can India-China relations touch the lives of over 2.7 billion people in both countries. In sync with this mandate, the two countries decided to set up the High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue mechanism. The Mechanism promises to be a game-changer for transforming India-China economic relations. India hopes that this mechanism will help it to reduce over $50 billion trade deficit with China and enable Indian companies to gain greater market access to the Chinese market. The two sides also agreed to encourage mutual investments in identified sectors through the development of a broad-based Manufacturing Partnership. Pandemic opportunity The second informal summit, in short, set the stage for upscaling and accelerating India-China economic and development partnership across the spectrum. As the two countries mark the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations, it's time to raise the bar and take concrete steps to fructify the economic potential of this crucial partnership. In this regard, the coronavirus pandemic has come as a disruption as well as an opportunity. This reminds one of the much-cited formulation that the Chinese character for Crisis also means Opportunity. Regardless of the veracity of this expression, it encapsulates ancient wisdom that every crisis carries within it seeds of an opportunity. India and China have done the right thing by focusing on new opportunities rather than allow themselves to be distracted by geo- political games that only polarises the world and fragments the collective response to the pandemic. The two neighbours have promptly sent medical materials to combat the pandemic. Encouraged by the Chinese example, India has seized on the crisis to incentivise its companies to build indigenous facilities for manufacturing masks and protective medical equipment. Global Partners As the world moves towards strategizing global economic recovery, India and China, the world's only major economies that are expected to grow amid the coronavirus-induced recession, will have a critical role to play. The IMF, in its World Economic Outlook, has forecast India's economic growth rate at 1.9 per cent and China's at 1.2 per cent, which makes them the two G20 economies that will be able to escape corrosive effects of the global economic recession. As the two islands of growth amid gloom and doom in the world, India and China will have to collaborate proactively not only for sustaining their own economic growth, but also for stimulating global recovery. India and China, which together account for a population of over 2.7 billion people, will continue to provide large markets for diverse goods and services, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping largely focused on how PM Modi's plan to create a New India by 2022 to mark the 75th anniversary of India's independence and Xi Jinping's China Dream can open new avenues for widening cooperation between the two Asian neighbours. As the two countries mark the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations, it's time to raise the bar and take concrete steps to fructify the economic potential of this crucial partnership.

Taking a macro view, the two emerging Asian economies will also have to enhance their coordination in shaping an effective global economic response to COVID-19 in multilateral groupings such as G20 and BRICS. Balancing Trade India has the biggest single trade deficit with any country. In sync with growing bilateral trade, which has exceeded $90 billion, it's time to balance and diversify bilateral trade. Currently, India's imports from China are dominated by manufactured items, including electronics, telecom products, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals. India imports most of its pharmaceutical ingredients and drug intermediaries from China. Most of India's electrical and electronic requirements, including smart phones and computer hardware, are sourced from China. On the other hand, India has been supplying mostly raw materials and agricultural products. In this regard, the last couple of years have seen some positive developments: China is responding to India's long-standing demand for greater market access for Indian pharmaceuticals, IT services, engineering, and agricultural products including rice, sugar, various fruits and vegetables, oil-based meals. In 2018, following the first informal summit in Wuhan, China granted market access for export of Indian Non-Basmati rice, rapeseed meal, fishmeal and fish-oil. In 2019, protocols for market access for Indian tobacco leaves and chilli meal were concluded. If more such steps are taken in the next few months, they will pave the way for more balanced and sustainable bilateral trade. Boosting investment It's encouraging to see the ascending curve of Chinese investment in India. Over the years, Chinese investment in India have grown to $8 billion, a big jump from a few hundred million dollars only a few years ago. Chinese investment has focused on sectors and products such as mobile phone, household electrical appliances, infrastructure and automobile. In the process, Chinese investments have created thousands of jobs in India. As the world moves towards strategizing global economic recovery, India and China, the world's only major economies that are expected to grow amid the coronavirus-induced recession, will have a critical role to play.Union Minister for IT , Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad at Huawei's 'Make in India' inaugural ceremony in New Delhi in October 2016.

Chinese mobile companies present unfolding success stories in India, with companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo occupying nearly 60% of Indian mobile handset market. Going forward, Chinese companies need to diversify and scale up their investment in manufacturing sector in India. Development Journey Going forward, the two countries should aim at structural transformation in their economic ties, from the buyer-seller model to a more enduring investment-driven model. China has an unprecedented opportunity to partner India in its ongoing developmental journey. India's infrastructure sector needs at least $1 trillion in foreign investment. China, with its huge surplus of foreign exchange, can pitch in with not just cash, but by increasing the involvement of Chinese companies in the infrastructure sector in India. The setting up of dedicated industrial parks in India catering to Chinese companies need to be fast-tracked. Chinese companies are playing an important role in the modernisation of Indian Railways through projects such as speed raising on the existing Chennai-Bengaluru-mysore line, the feasibility studies for the Delhi-Nagpur section of high-speed rail link and setting up of a railway university.The road Ahead Going by present trends, India and China, with a combined GDP of around $17 trillion, will continue to be engines of economic growth in the world. With their complementary strengths in software and hardware, the two countries have a rare opportunity to expand their economic and development partnership to realise dreams and aspirations of their 2.7 billion people. Closer economic and development partnership will need an atmosphere of peace and trust, and hence is inextricably interlinked with the overall tone and tenor of the relationship. If India and China keep their focus firmly on interlinked dreams, they can avoid geopolitical traps in the COVID-configured world and script a new chapter in their mutually empowering partnership.

On April 1, 1950, India became the first non- socialist country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. It was the beginning of a new era when Chinese and Indian people from different walks of life interacted enthusiastically. They were frequent visitors in each other's lands, eager to share and learn from each other's experiences. Today, however, our knowledge of this vibrant period of engagement is overshadowed by the legacy of the 1962 aberration.

Of late, with the special efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping, it witnessed an impetus both on government-to-government and people-to-people levels, focusing on increasing communication, connectivity, information sharing, collaboration, and deeper engagement with the leadership on the other side not only bilaterally but also at all multilateral platforms. Growing Trade optimism Trade and investment have witnessed unprecedented growth in the last fifteen years, and China has become the largest trading partner of India. This collaboration includes the short-term trade by the trading community and the technology- based trade involving the import of equipment and machinery for power, textile, chemical, pharmaceuticals, and packaging sectors, among others. The visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 has proven to be a milestone in giving a thrust to bilateral trade and investment between the two countries. During his visit, President Xi announced an investment of USD20 billion in India, further opening the doors for Chinese companies to operate and engage in the Indian market. Industry chambers and trade associations also worked to not only research and understand the realities of trade, commerce, and investment in both the countries, but also bringing concerned stakeholders together to further advance the official efforts.

International trade fairs have also helped to promote trade between both the countries as it has enabled Indian businesses to source the new products at affordable prices. Many Indian businesses have engaged at a deeper level with their Chinese counterparts, even actively participating in developing products better suited for Indian markets. Many Indian manufacturers have even gone ahead to set up their production bases in China to cater to both their Indian and global markets. Sectors like steel, power, pharma and biotechnology have found a lot of compatibilities in their operations. India has become an important source of raw material for industries like steel and ferroalloys, electrical equipment, auto-components and meat. On the other hand, China has become a supplier for power plant equipment (turbine, boiler and balancing equipment), EPC projects, smartphones, and other electronic items, fertilizers, organic chemicals and plastics. Chinese companies have become the biggest and one of the most reliable contributors to India's power distribution and generation system.

Jointly, the two nations can benefit from learning from each other. Global Partnership With a stronger China, the world is also witnessing the emergence of a new economic order in which it may take a central position. In a recent report, Credit Suisse said that the rash of trade conflicts goes hand in hand with geopolitical challenges, the decline of Western dominance (politically and economically), the emergence of new world order, and the rise of new, groundbreaking, and powerful technologies. In this new order, both China and India will play a significant role. Today, the global community is facing the COVID-19 challenge. It is a unique and significant challenge for humanity. The Chinese government not only handled the challenge successfully but quickly as well. People in Wuhan are going back to their routines. It is also the time of two antagonistic ideologies being debated, discussed, accepted, and vehemently rejected. People, on one hand, will talk about national protectionism, reducing contact with other nations, becoming self-reliant and self-sufficient. The same may be inferred from the approach taken by US President Donald Trump. On the other hand, people will argue for strengthening connections, sharing competencies, working together, and joining hands to find viable solutions challenging humanity. At the World Economic Forum, 2017, President Xi cast himself as a steadfast defender of free trade and joining hands with other countries as opposed to \"America First\" call from President Trump. We strongly believe that in the future, humanity will come across challenges that may have never been thought of. To meet and tackle such challenges, the global community needs to join hands, closely share from each other's experiences, and actively collaborate with others. By simply aggregating or organizing our resources, knowledge, skills, learning, and competencies, the people on this planet will be in a position to live a healthy and meaningful life. An Asian Century At the 70th anniversary of the start of the formal diplomatic relationship between India and China, they need to introspect and understand the power of the 36% of the global population. No stone should be left unturned to remove the trust deficit and move towards increasing trust and collaboration to take their due position on the global stage and share in the global socio- economic order. With increasing pragmatism and better understanding and meaningful efforts from the political leadership from both the sides, this is not too far.

Due to spending a long time in bed, the sick and wounded suffered bedsores, and Dr Kotnis came up with an idea to deal with this by making a hole in the quilt. Others followed suit. During patient transfers, he prepared raingear for the sick and wounded. He was also an active basketball player. Magical Powers Chen Zhi, one of his students, was surprised by his conscientious and responsible work. He revealed that Dr Kotnis was called the \"black doctor\", and both he and the \"white doctor\" (Bethune), who had also worked in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hubei Border Area, were highly skilled. Dr Kotnis cured many illnesses diagnosed as beyond cure. Qi Linhui, the younger brother of the owner of the house where he lived, was once treated by him. He said the Indian medic treated everyone enthusiastically. Mr Qi had a pimple in his leg that was almost necrotic and seemed incurable despite the use of Western and Chinese medicines. However, \"The village was filled with people coming to bid farewell to their Indian friend. Dr Kotnis was not forgotten after the war, and is still remembered.\" The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Medical University was renamed Kotnis China-India Friendship Hospital in 1996.

The old man was grateful to the doctor. At the time, Dr Kotnis was suffering from epilepsy. It attacked him from time to time due to overwork. Commander Nie Rongzhen repeatedly urged him to seek treatment. However, the Indian doctor had already linked his fate with that of Chinese soldiers. People who knew him revealed that he was unwilling to leave his post even for a minute. As Ms Guo Qinglan recalled, \"He was sleeping when epilepsy last hit him. He twitched hard for a long time, but no one had a way out. Just before his death, he was operated in the morning. He passed away in the afternoon.\" On December 9, 1942, Dr Kotnis died in Gegong Village, aged only 32. This diligent and conscientious international fighter was still compiling surgical lecture notes just before his death. Wang Xincheng was a neighbor. \"The village was filled with people coming to bid farewell to their Indian friend. Dr Kotnis was not forgotten after the war, and is still remembered,\" Mr Wang said. China-india Joint Medical Mission To mark the 70th anniversary of the Indian medical delegation to aid China and carry forward Dr Kotnis' legacy, the China-India Joint medical Mission was set up in January 2008. Sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the joint mission consists of 10 Chinese doctors and an equal number from India. They exchange visits, provide medical assistance, and carry out academic discussions, forming an important platform to promote mutual understanding and cooperation in the medical circles. The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hubei medical University was renamed Kotnis China-India Friendship Hospital in 1996. Shan Chunguang, a doctor of the ear-nose- throat department, visited India as a member of the second China-India Joint medical mission in 2010. Besides medical exchanges, the Chinese doctors provided free medical treatment for farmers in Andhra Pradesh. He remembers clearly the friendship of Indian people. He said villagers held a grand ceremony to welcome them, and beat drums and gongs and shouted \"Long Live India- China Friendship\" while holding banners just like Chinese peasants. \"All of us talked about Kotnis, who seemed to be a bond linking us. We stayed in India for eight days. We felt that the friendship between Chinese and Indian civilians was very deep and sincere,\" Mr Shan said. Just as Dr Kotnis showed the Indian people's friendship towards Chinese people during the anti-Japanese war, the China-India Joint medical mission is carrying forward his spirit, Mr Shan said. Mohan Jeudy, an Indian otolaryngologist with over 20 years of experience who runs a private clinic in Hyderabad, said he learned about Dr Kotnis during his school days. In 1985, he joined the India- China Friendship Association as a student. He has visited China many times. As the head of the Indian team of the Second China-India Joint medical Mission, the visit to China in 2010 was of particular significance to him. He said, \"I will never forget the memories. Since my school days, I had heard lots about the great deeds of Chinese people against Japanese aggression. When I was invited to China as the head of the Indian team, I was very excited. We were treated as family members everywhere in China. I will never forget the Chinese people's friendship.\" Mr Mohan said the Dr Kotnis spirit hugely inspired him, and every doctor should carry forward his legacy. He pledged to try his best to organize the exchanges well in India as part of the contribution to Sino-Indian friendship. Dr Kotnis was a great fighter who did his best for the liberation of the Chinese nation until his death. His spirit is an immortal monument standing in the hearts of the Chinese people forever.

Before I came to India, I did not have an optimistic expectation of life here. After living here for a while, I felt that the living conditions, though not very difficult, were indeed compromised. Since I came with a realistic expectation, I was not very disappointed when I started my life in New Delhi. WANG JiANBiNG 80 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONNavigating through indian culture, food, and language, especially when it has a meaning in a specific cultural context, can be challenging for a foreign working professional in india. But with an open mind and eagerness to know may help one find a different side of india, which is full of surprises, like when he discovered the rich taste of Chana Dal, writes Wang Jianbing. Curries Looked same I grew up in a family in Southern China, where people are particular about eating. To be considered appetizing, any dish has to have good taste, smell, and look. when I first came to India, food had become my main concern. Though Chinese food also emphasizes the appearance of a dish, Indians seem to only care about its taste and smell, but not how it looks. Indeed, to me, a lot of Indian dishes looked the same: chicken curry, lamb curry, and all kinds of curries, even the Chinese food made by Indian chefs looked similar to Indian food. For someone who grew up eating Chinese food all his life, how could he find Indian food appetizing? I haven't eaten Indian food for more than 20 times in the first seven years in India. As long as I had an alternative to Indian food, I would go for that. During business trips, McDonalds and Kentucky fried Chicken became my favorite go-to food, even though I have never preferred fast food back home in China. After finishing my term in India, I went back to China. However, in 2019, I again went back to work as a journalist. Maybe because I got to see different I started to appreciate Indian food the more I tasted it with an open mind; indeed, Indians are masters of using different spices that give their curry a rich flavour. NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 81cultures, or because I started to have a more peaceful mindset after growing older, I no longer have an earlier resistance to Indian food that much. I started to appreciate Indian food the more I tasted it with an open mind; indeed, Indians are masters of using different spices that give their curry a rich flavour. For instance, Chana Dal is one of my favorites. It is made from split chickpea, spiced up by masala, and peppers from southern India. I love to eat it with Indian Naan or roti. I learned the recipe from my Indian friends and started making it for my Chinese friends, and it was well-received among them. How did I become a lover of Indian food, from someone who was once repelled by it so much? I think the mindset is the key to this transformation. When I started eating Indian food, I applied the Chinese standards to judge the menu. Undoubtedly, it wouldn't fit our standard. Due to my rejection of Indian food, I missed opportunities to appreciate the rich flavours hidden under the seemingly unappealing gravy in my first seven years living in India. But Indian food remains true to itself, no matter if you like it or not. Similar to food, if you apply set standards from your culture to judge Indian culture, you will find many of them not fitting in with those standards. I found that this kind of closed mindset is prevalent among my Chinese friends living in India. Many of them judged Indian food from its looks. Indeed, their rejection of Indian food partially stems from their unwillingness to accept Indian culture. If we hold an open mind towards Indian food and judge it on its own merits, then we will be able to appreciate it much more. Since Chinese people apply their cultural norms in India, they find the Indian way of life, similar to food, unacceptable, or even difficult to comprehend. A lot of misunderstandings between people from the two countries can be attributed to cultural differences. The more we are willing to know people from a different culture, the more we will be able to accept their way of living. The grudge we hold against India stems from the foreignness of the Indian culture. For example, most Chinese are not religiously affiliated and face language barriers in India. To them, understanding Indian culture is like navigating in the dark. The Endless 'Five Minute' Also, for instance, my Chinese friends in India love to crack jokes about Indians. To Indians, \"five minutes\" most likely mean half an hour or even hours of waiting. \"Tomorrow\" probably means \"forever.\" However, when you start to understand the cultural connotations behind \"five minutes,\" you wouldn't complain about Indians' sense of time! Indians use the phrase \"five minutes\" with an understanding that it will take longer than half an hour; therefore, they won't feel being cheated upon when they have to wait longer. When my Chinese friends finally understood the real meaning behind \"five minutes,\" they could all make a humorous story about it. Indeed, there are many such special phrases in the Chinese language that could only be understood correctly in the 82 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONappropriate cultural context, and foreigners in China must have also experienced some confusion just like we did in India. Some Chinese love India from the depth of their hearts, whereas some don't. People's attitude towards India is decided by how much they know about the Indian culture and how much they are willing to accept a lifestyle that looks hugely different from their own. If there is someone who comes to tell you a story about India, that account could become your beginning of the understanding of this mysterious, yet beautiful country. Keep an open mind, give yourself a chance to know India, make friends, and maybe you will be surprised to find a different side of India, just like I did when I discovered the taste of Chana Dal. (Wang Jianbing is a journalist from China Central Television (CCTV), based in New Delhi.) Some Chinese love India from the deepest of their hearts, whereas some don't.

Northwest of Dunhuang, the Silk Road made its way to the famous Jade Gate, on the edge of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. From there, it bifurcated along two lines. Both the trails eventually re-converged at Kashgar \u2014 another equally important junction along the Silk Road. Out of the two, the northern route, after passing through the Gobi desert, headed to Hami. Then gripping the northern rim of the treacherous Taklamakan desert, the \"road\" passed through a string of oasis towns\u2014 Turfan, Karashahr, Kucha, and Aksu. These settlements are all on the foothills of the \"celestial\" Tien Shan mountains, on the way to Kashgar. NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITION | 85It is, however, the back-and-forth among people and goods along a branch of the southern route, which proved critical in channeling a masterly artistic fusion that is evident at Dunhuang's magnificent mogao caves. Along the southern route, which passes through the other oasis settlements of Miran, Endere, Niya, Keriya, and Khotan, Yarkand in Xinjiang has long been recognised for its key role in the permeation of Buddhist influence from India. Buddha Connect From Yarkand, a major artery headed through the lofty Karakoram pass, leading to vibrant markets of Leh and Srinagar. The passage finally descended through the plains towards India's western coast. While the mercantile class prospered, notwithstanding harassment by brigands and obstacles posed by frequent natural hazards, it was the monks, scholars, and travelers frequenting the Silk Road, who brought the essential message of Buddha to China. In terms of art, it was the Graeco-Buddhist Gandhara School, known for depicting Buddha in human form, that finally reached China, heavily influencing the emergence of what became known as Serendian art, embodying a powerful Chinese artistic tradition as well. Among the innumerable individuals who co-linked India and China with Buddhism through the Silk Road network, three names\u2014 Kumarajiva, Faxian, and Xuanzang, particularly stand out. Kumarajiva, who was born in the fourth century in Kucha, was a pioneer in introducing Buddhist theology into China. He is best known for his ceaseless translations of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit. Not only did he translate important texts into Chinese, but he also played an important role in clarifying Buddhist philosophical concepts and terminology. Kumarajiva revolutionised Chinese Buddhism, by using Taoist and Confucian terms in his translations, thus seeding Buddha's message at the popular level. with Buddhism taking firm roots in China and heightening spiritual curiosity, Faxian\u2014a Buddhist monk, born in 399 AD undertook journeys on foot to India, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia to acquire new Buddhist texts. His journeys and contributions have been the substance of his travelogue: A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms: Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fa-Xian of Travels in India and Ceylon in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline.

For seventeen years, Xuanzang traveled in what is today India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to satisfy his spiritual hunger. His journey to Nalanda in India provided the ammunition for the famous Chinese classic \u2014 Great Tang Records on the Western Regions. That, in turn, triggered the writing, nine centuries after Xuanzang's death of the great novel written by Wu Cheng'en \u2014 Journey to the West, highlighting the continuous renewal of Buddhism across centuries in China. While Buddhism and commercial relations routed through the Silk Road stand out at the foundation of the India-China cultural connect, several layers in different epochs of history have been enriching the India-China people-to-people connection. Tagore's Legacy Both the \"civilization states,\" India and China rediscovered each other in the modern erathrough their rapidly evolving politic)al and cultural response to colonial domination. Here Indian Noble Laureate Rabindranath Tagore stands out in making an important contribution in reconnecting the two countries, aspiring to recover their civilizational identity, largely liberated from the western political and \"superior\" intellectual discourse. By the time Tagore made his first visit to China in 1924, the halo of a Nobel Prize had already turned him into a star guest. But, perhaps, more importantly, his rousing reception can be attributed to the Chinese intelligentsia's familiarity with his writings, and his message of pan-Asian identity and solidarity. Chen Duxiu, one of the founding members of the Communist Party of China (CPC), had already translated Tagore's Gitanjali into Chinese in 1915, far ahead of Tagore's arrival. Tagore's poem, The Crescent Moon, had also been translated and published in Chinese journals, as was the highly popular short story, Kabuliwala. Tagore's idea of \"Asian universalism\" and the coming together of two civilizations have recently echoed powerfully during the two informal summits, in Wuhan and Chennai between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tagore's legacy of bringing modern India and China together is unparalleled because of his role as an institution builder. Tagore established an international university, Visva-Bharati, in Santiniketan in the state of West Bengal. The formation of the first Sino-Indian Cultural Society and Cheena Bhavana there seeded Chinese studies in India. Santiniketan has produced many seminal scholars, including Tan Yun-shan, greatly influencing India's understanding of the Chinese civilisation and its aspirational path to non-western modernity. while the mercantile class prospered, notwithstanding harassment by brigands and obstacles posed frequent natural hazards, it was the monks, scholars, and travelers frequenting the silk road, who brought the essential message of buddha to china. tagore's idea of \"asian universalism\" and the coming together of two civilizations have recently echoed powerfully during the two informal summits, in wuhan and chennai between Indian prime minister narendra modi and chinese president xi jinping.

Raj Kapoor's 1951 classic Awara, with its socialistic subtext and infectious humour resonated extremely well with Chinese audiences, who had emerged out of a socialist revolution in 1949. Bollywood has continued to bridge the two cultures, especially the offerings by Indian filmmaker Aamir Khan, whose recent movies have been runaway hits at the Chinese box office. Secret Superstar , one of Khan's recent films released in China, forked more than $30 million in the first four days of its release - double than Dangal (Wrestling), which had also struck a strong emotional chord with Chinese audiences. The internet is also winning the hearts and minds of a new generation of Indian and Chinese millennials. India's Eros Now, the video streaming platform of Eros International, has signed a content licensing agreement with iQiyi, a Beijing based online video platform. The contract will allow Bollywood content to be streamed on computer and smartphone screens, leading to an exponential rise of viewership of Bollywood films in China. TikTok, a short video-sharing and social networking platform from the stable of Beijing- based ByteDance is also a raging hit among Chinese and Indian netizens, including those residing in tier 2 and 3 cities. TikTok's success underscores that the digital age has unveiled the possibility of a surge in people-to-people ties, opening up the scope for a cyber and people-led cultural renaissance, provided digital influencers on both sides play a responsible and constructive role of sifting facts from fiction, prejudice, and fake news.

The fire will grow until the end of the training. At the ceremony of issuing certificates, each person closed their eyes, and slowly, they whispered in the ear and sent a sincere blessing. Although the chorus, meditation, asanas, Yoga philosophy, teaching skills, and other curriculum specifications are interspersed, they present reasonable difficulty. However, both the beginners and the senior yogis can benefit from the class. As the participants come from across the world, the training paid more attention to create a friendly atmosphere of mutual respect for different cultures and living habits. For example, some students were strictly vegetarian, never touched milk and eggs. So everyone consciously cares about it (Not only in the center's restaurant but also in any restaurant where they went out together.) Although Yoga food is simple, it did not hinder us from sitting on the floor and enjoying the pleasure of music and dance. In the middle of the training, the Gurkha agitation broke out in Darjeeling. It caused food shortages, internet disruptions, curfews, and military deployment, which made the atmosphere tense. The news made parents feel anxious, and the school repeatedly reminded us not to go to downtown. for the difficulties encountered in training, teachers tried their best to help and care. At the same time, I agree with the center's Yoga training philosophy: all exercises are centered on physical comfort and no harmful asanas. Thanks to these rules, although the training is hard, there was no physical injury or unbearable situation, and many high-level asanas had been ridiculously completed even considered impossible. my weight dropped more than five kilograms, and it was not a tough task to complete 108 sets of sun-salutations in limited time. the SuCCeSS oF \"YogA DIplomACY\" AND the INterNA tIoNAl \"YogA tIDe\" hAS CAuSeD DomeStIC expertS AND CulturAl SCholArS to thINk more About the INterNA tIoNAl SpreAD oF ChINeSe CAllIgrAphY .

It plays a pivotal role in the world's cultural arena, together with Bollywood film, Ayurvedic medicine, and software manufacturing. According to statistics in recent years, many countries and regions around the world have promoted Yoga. For most Yoga practitioners, it is not just a fitness system but a complete culture and way of life. At the 4th International Yoga Festival, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that Yoga became a force to promote world integration. For this reason, the Modi government has always spared no effort in promoting Yoga internationally. The success of \"Yoga Diplomacy\" and the international \"Yoga Tide\" has caused domestic experts and cultural scholars to think more about the international spread of Chinese calligraphy. One of my purposes of participating in this training is to experience and observe the inspiration of Indian Yoga in Chinese calligraphy. According to my observation, the number of Yoga practitioners and their international influence increased rapidly. The reasons included the macroscopic aspects of India's political attention, economic tilt, diplomatic promotion and cultural enhancement, and also the obvious effect of improvement of the physical and mental condition of the practitioners and high interoperability of training language. In Yoga class, we can also find some useful details in promoting international Chinese calligraphy communication. A relatively complete system has been set upon access, certification, and screening systems for Yoga teachers, especially for Gurus. Both native organizations such as the Indian Yoga Association and international organizations like Yoga Alliance (USA) have played a huge role in international training, research, and promotion of Yoga. Founded in 1982, the American Yoga Alliance is the world's leading Yoga training institution. The Alliance convened the nation's and even the world's leading Yoga professionals to conduct an internationally certified Yoga teacher training standards by unified discussion and research on the training systems of various genres. The certificate issued by the association has been recognized and widely adopted by the international Yoga community and become an international passport for Yoga teaching. The Registered Yoga Teacher (rYT) with this certificate can gain the trust and favor of Yoga institutions around the world. Due to the quality and effectiveness of training, more and more people became Yoga practicer and teachers. Also, the training language system is conversed orderly. In the process of spreading to the West, Yoga training has formed a normative course and a mature language model: English or INDIA IS CoNSIDereD A bIg CouNtr Y wIth CulturAl SoFt power, AND YogA IS the Core oF INDIAN CulturAl DIplomACY .

Although there have been cases of short-term adjustments in the classroom caused by self-over-pressurized, it was generally reflected that the classroom was relaxed and the atmosphere was pleasant. Compared with the similar training that the author participated in China, I rarely felt this relaxed atmosphere and agile rhythm. Confucius said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\" The ancient Chinese saying is also applicable to the Indian Yoga learning process. Good training results and outcomes also confirm that \"interest is the best teacher\". In the training, the teacher always pays attention to guiding the students to familiarize themselves, understanding and love Yoga from their interests, hobbies, and specialties. The teacher guides students to practice Yoga in their way. As a traditional culture with long history and rich connotation, both Chinese calligraphy and Indian Yoga are facing challenges and opportunities brought about by new situations, ideas, and technologies. Only by constantly accepting, extracting and merging new elements, and exchanging information and energy with external things, can we update, reinvent and revitalize. Cultural soft power becomes an important factor in expanding China's international influence and changing the world. In the process of gradually moving to the center of the world stage, we need to enhance soft power, expand world friendship circle, improve the influence of Chinese culture to stand in the forest of world culture by learning the strengths and experiences from other countries, exploring the intrinsic value of Chinese traditional cultures such as calligraphy, martial arts, and medicine, accelerating the standardization and internationalization of cultural elements, and build a Chinese cultural flagship that can sail to the blue ocean, enhance the interconnection, intercommunication and mutual understanding of the world culture.

It is heartening to see that in recent years there has been a heightened focus on the betterment of our bilateral relations promoting people-to-people exchanges and cultural interactions as the two countries now engage in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the India-China diplomatic ties while designating this year as the \"China-India Year of Cultural and people-to-people Exchanges\". P2P Exchanges Since India and China established diplomatic relations on April 1, 1950, the two neighbors have respected and supported each other, setting an example of equality, friendship, and mutually beneficial cooperation between them following The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known as the Panchsheel Treaty, signed in 1954. But long before the official diplomatic engagement between the two countries, the two peoples residing on either side of the Himalayas have been engaged in \"2,000 years of unbroken interaction\", empowering love and friendship for centuries. Since historical times, people from all walks of life of the two countries have been playing an important role in the development of Sino-Indian ties. More than 1,600 years ago, two famous Chinese monks, Faxian and Xuanzang, visited India through the Silk Road in their quest for Buddhist teachings, and the Indian monk Bodhidharma went to China to preach and establish the Chan Buddhism sect. China had Confucius in ancient times and Tao Xingzhi in modern times while India had Siddhartha Gautama in ancient times and Rabindranath Tagore in modern times.Nobel laureate Tagore, who visited China thrice with the message of love and brotherhood, always wanted that the \"two sister countries\" should promote closer, stronger cultural ties and more people-to-people exchanges. During the war of resistance against Japan (1931-1945), the Indian National Congress party sent a medical team to China and Dr Dwarkanath Kotnis devoted his life to the liberation cause of the Chinese people. The values held by the scholars and statesmen of both nations have enlightened our relations over the years. There is no doubt that the two sides should emphasize more on cultural exchanges to create a real bond between our two countries. The relationship between the two neighbouring countries can never be excellent if there is a lack of political will on either or both sides. It is refreshing and energizing to see that our bilateral ties are at historical best in present times under the strategic guidance of the leadership of our two countries. It is now rightly said that a new 'golden era' has started with the Xi Jinping-Narendra modi meeting at the first informal summit in wuhan in central Hubei province on April 27-28, 2018. During these meetings, the two leaders pitched for culture and people-to-people exchanges in our bilateral relationship. But the most important outcome from the most important outcome from these meetings is that a new mechanism \"china-India high-level people-to-people exchanges\" has been set up, which signaled that the world's two most populous countries would make greater efforts in enhancing cultural and people-to-people exchanges to rejuvenate the \"asian century\".

On the other hand, during the second informal meeting in the southern Indian city of Chennai on October 11-12 last year, the two leaders agreed to use the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties as an opportunity to move forward their bilateral relations, placing the people-to-people exchanges in the larger perspective. Surely, it is a vibrant example of the strong ties between our two nations. But, at the same time, it can be said that the common peoples' participation in such type of a high-level people-to-people exchange mechanism is quite limited. As such, we can hope that the events of people and cultural exchanges, media, academia, and music and dance will give the people on the grassroots-level more opportunity to learn about each other's needs in tune with the realities of the 21st century. A True Friend Despite some trouble spots in Sino-Indian relations, China has extended support to India in its needs as a true neighborhood friend. It was heartening to see that the Chinese satellite provided satellite data to India to help combat floods in Bihar and Assam last year. Undoubtedly, providing satellite data or making donations to Indian educational institutions or granting hundreds of scholarships to Indian students is a true friendly gesture from the Chinese people to their Indian counterparts. India, which is still grappling with extreme poverty, can learn important lessons from china's historic achievements in shaking off poverty over the past decades. also, it's worth noting that after the covId-19 outbreak, the chinese government has taken good care of the Indian students studying in universities and colleges in china like its people while facilitating their safe return from the worst affected hubei province.

China has written a new chapter in humanity's fight against poverty, journeying to achieve its first centenary goal concerning poverty alleviation, and is now sharing its experiences and wisdom gained with the world.

Also, it's worth noting that after the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has taken good care of the Indian students studying in universities and colleges in China like its people while facilitating their safe return from the worst affected Hubei Province. Since India is now in the grip of the novel coronavirus infection, it can learn from China's effective disease prevention and control measures in containing the virus. Cultural relations Chinese culture, festivals and films are aimed at strengthening friendships between nations and enhancing cultural communication. While delivering a speech at Peking University on May 4, 2015, President Xi pointed out: \"We the Chinese have our own unique spiritual world.\" Surely, this \"unique spiritual world\" of Chinese culture has tied other countries with a message of friendship. In the context of Sino-Indian relations, screenings of films in each other's country have helped showcase their respective cultures while promoting people- to-people contact and mutual understanding. In recent years, Bollywood films like Dangal, Secret Superstar, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Bahubali 2, Hindi Medium, and Hichki have been hit movies in China. However, Chinese movies are not regularly shown in Indian theaters. The two countries might have different cultures and religions or separated by borders and topography, but one thing that has the power to bind us all is the cinema. Unfortunately, only a few Chinese films have been released in India. Ordinary Indian people would like to see more Chinese films screened in India, which could help us get to know the culture and life of our neighboring country. Cultural celebration such as film festivals will make Indian people know more about the diversified and rich culture of China, further increasing people-to-people contacts between the two countries. Way Forward A Chinese proverb says, \"When brothers are united, their sharpness can break metal.\" There is no denying that a more solid Sino-Indian friendship is beneficial for the people of our two great neighboring nations and the entire world. It is expected that the leadership of our two countries should explore new avenues and channels for the common people on both sides for a renewed spring in our ties in the new era. Truly, the common people want to hear a trust-based cordial story of India and China, rather than some hawkish rhetoric. The two governments should give a chance to the general public of the two countries (not only the political representatives or selected high-profile persons) for more visits and access to each other's cultural resources to deepen mutual understanding and cultivate friendly feelings. These are the general expectations of the people from the leadership of our two countries.

During the 1950s, the Cheena Bhavan and the Mahabodhi Society played an important role in cultural and scholarly exchanges between India and China. It is considered the golden period in their relations. Over the past 70 years, such interactions firmly cemented people- to-people bonds. for instance, Chinese scholar and artist Xu fancheng lived in India for 33 years and contributed in introducing Indian philosophy in China. Xu, a renowned scholar, hailed from Changsha and visited India as part of a cultural exchange program organized by the Viswabharati Santiniketan in 1945. He lived in India from 1945 to 1978, but spent most of his time in pondicherry (1951-1978). Xu Fancheng's Legacy Xu could translate Sanskrit texts into Chinese. His major works include the translations of The Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Kalidasa's Meghdhootam and Sri Aurobindo's writings. He also translated many Indian scholarly books and Chinese paintings. Xu played a significant role in connecting India and China through culture and arts. Many contemporary scholars such as Prof. Huang Xin Chuang, Prof. Huang Xiannian, Prof. Priyadarshi Mukherji, and Prof. Nirmala Sharma regard him as the cultural bridge between India and China. Vice Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui was a student of Xu Fancheng. For celebrating Xu's contribution to promoting people-to-people contacts, a symposium was inaugurated by Mr Luo in Pondicherry in March 2018. Based on the event, a book was published by the Cultural Department of the Chinese Embassy in the same year.

It is possible that Xu and Chang met each other and shared their knowledge during their stay at Santiniketan.

It has been 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relationship between India and China on April 1, 1950. As a Chinese saying goes, \"A man seldom reaches the age of seventy years in ancient times.\" Looking back on history, one can't help but be overwhelmed with emotions. The establishment of diplomatic relations was a major event in China-India relations, which had significant international implications. Through the sufferings of aggression by colonialists and fascists, the two ancient Eastern civilizations have come together side by side and opened a brilliant chapter in the journey of national independence and liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, ushering in the process of reviving Eastern civilizations.

Ambassadors of Friendship The India-China friendship Association (ICfA) was at the forefront of establishing diplomatic and people-to-people relations between the two countries. After the new China was formed under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, Pandit Sundarlal pioneered the formation of the Association with an anti-imperialist character. Karnataka was first to form such an association on November 1, 1949, led by ex-parliamentarian m. Govinda reddy, while Sundarlal became the first president of the ICfA at the national level. The towering mountains and the vast expanse of deserts could not block the warm exchanges between Chinese and Indian civilizations. Prof. Xu Fancheng, the famous Chinese scholar and translator, spent 33 years in India, where he translated the Hindu classic Bhagavad Gita. The Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, visited China twice and advocated eastern spiritual civilization together with Tan Yunshan, the founding director of the Department of Chinese Language and Culture at Viswabharati Cheen Bhavan, Santiniketan. During the war against Japanese aggression, Tagore tirelessly worked for the restoration and revival of old ties between India and China. His address delivered on the occasion of the founding of Viswabharati Cheen Bhavan on April 14, 1937, remains relevant even today. India sent a medical mission to China in which doctor Dwarkanath Kotnis, one outstanding member of this team, sacrificed his life in China. In memory of Dr Kotnis, both India and China jointly constituted a Joint Medical Mission (JMM) on January 14, 2008, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao. Heralding A New Journey The establishment of diplomatic ties opened a new journey in the development of modern China-India relations. India was the first non- socialist country to establish relations with China. \"Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai\" became a catchphrase and a much-told story in the history of bilateral exchanges. In 1954, during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, both sides signed the Panchsheel Agreement and advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It was welcomed by many countries across the globe. In the same year, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Beijing, making him the first head of government of a non-socialist country to visit China since the founding of the Republic. After the 1962 war, the two countries broke their ambassador-level ties; but in May 1976, the Indian government, led by Indira Gandhi, restored the ambassador-level relations, and K.r. Narayanan assumed office as India's Ambassador in Beijing. In 1988, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi started his \"ice-breaking visit\" to China at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart. Gandhi laid a strong foundation for bilateral ties, and the two sides agreed to \"look forward\" to developing partnerships in different fields while seeking the sino-Indian relationship, with a unique history of over 2000 years of cooperation and friendship, assumes greater significance than ever before in the context of preserving world peace. the interests of china and India converge as they share similar positions on international issues. by speaking in one voice, they are injecting new impetus into the development of their relations.Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Great Hall of People in Beijing in January 2008. 102 | NEwS frOm CHINA | CHINA-INDIA rEVIEw | SpECIAL EDITIONa mutually acceptable solution to the boundary dispute. The two countries found a common language in seeking development and cooperation, promoting reforms, opening up through mutual learning, and pushing for the settlement of issues left over by history. After Mr Gandhi's visit, India opened the Consulate-General office in Shanghai and Guangdong, while China opened similar offices in Mumbai and Kolkata. From then on, our relations rapidly improved with many state-level visits as well as people-to-people contacts. Both sides established media forums and university-level contacts to strengthen co- operation. Further, we established relations with provincial-level governments. In 1996, Karnataka and Jiangsu province signed an MoU, establishing a direct political and cultural contact. Similar contacts were also established between Karnataka and Sichuan province. Current Momentum The current momentum of people-to-people exchanges and development has not come easily. Despite hard times and twists and turns in their relations, China and India have overcome the obstacles. The past seven decades have proved that friendly cooperation, which has dominated most of the time, is the general trend and more important than their differences. In 1981, both sides decided to resume Indian pilgrimage to Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar in Xizang. Also, the two countries continued to establish direct contacts between cities and provinces, promoting political and cultural exchanges. Currently, over 1,000 Chinese companies are doing business in India, and Chinese mobile phone brands, such as Xiaomi, VIVO, and OPPO, represent half of the Indian market. India's National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) have established three IT corridors in Dalian, Guizhou, and Xuzhou. Both countries also have great potential for cooperation in medicine, IT, and interconnectivity. As members of multilateral organizations, such as RIC, BRICS, SCO, and the G20, both China and India share common interests in promoting globalization and opposing trade protectionism. The interests of China and India converge as they share similar positions on international issues. By speaking in one voice, they are injecting a new impetus into the development of their relations.In recent years, the two countries have been exploring \"China-India plus\" as a new model of cooperation and successfully carried out a joint training program for the Afghan diplomats. It should be the direction of efforts for China and India to enhance mutual trust, enlarge cooperation, and narrow down the divergence. As China's Ambassador to India Sun Weidong has said, \"China-India relations stand at a new starting point. We should draw wisdom from our thousands of years of civilizations and explore a way to get along with each other for enhancing mutual trust, focusing on cooperation, managing differences, and seeking common development.\" The Way Forward 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India. It is also the China-India Year of Cultural and people-to-people Exchanges. The two sides agreed to hold 70 celebratory activities to demonstrate their age-old connections and growing relationship to boost exchanges between legislatures, businesses, academics, cultural and youth groups, and defense forces. As both countries celebrate this momentous occasion, they should incorporate Xi Jinping's thoughts on diplomacy and highlight three aspects of \"transmission,\" \"stability,\" and \"vision\" to achieve long-term relations.
