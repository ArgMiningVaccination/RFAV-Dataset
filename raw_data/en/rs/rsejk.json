DISCOVERING THE MANY WAYS WE HEAL Our values Our MIssion Thank you for visiting my site. Today, I'd like to share with you some insights. We face an ever-changing world that is in a time of transition, from the old patterns of past failures and destruction to a new era. We all, consciously or subconsciously, seek to return to a time of balance and harmony within ourselves and with Mother Earth. Likewise, it is generally unknown how specifically all this transition will take place. Most certainly, it is a felt sense that our planet is in a constant state of rebalancing. Just like us, she cycles through changes to restore, replenish and renew. As individuals, we are responsible for our part. Through the highest truth and deepest body consciousness, we have the opportunity to tune in to the sound of the soul within, that has seen these changes already occur in their non-linear form. Similarly, the human soul deeply intends to be of help and of assistance to the body. This coming together is an internal job. Above all, it requires patience, courage, and understanding of the individual to participate with the naturally occurring cycles in one's lifetime. Subsequently, the union requires determination and commitment to personal growth. I invite you to join me in holding space for balance and harmony.
