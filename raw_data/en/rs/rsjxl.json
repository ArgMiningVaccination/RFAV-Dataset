Set aside. - Ensure the reagent bottle is intact and solution is not turbid or discolored. Discard bottle if unsatisfactory. - Unscrew the sample processing vial and add sample. - For solid, semisolid, or viscous stool, use the sampling stick to collect a small portion of stool from two or more areas in the sample and insert in the sample processing vial. NOTE: \"Stab\" do not \"scoop\" to avoid picking up particulate matter that may clog the dipstick membrane. - For liquid stool, use transfer pipette to add 2 drops of sample to the sample processing vial. - Tightly recap sample processing vial and shake to mix contents. - Break the outer end of the cap from the sample processing vial. - Dispense 4 drops of processed sample into labeled 5 ml test tube. - Carefully open aluminum pouch along perforated line. - Inspect contents. REMINDER: Only touch the top of the dipstick. - Check dipstick for damage (e.g., no tears, splits, discoloration). - Ensure the pouch contains desiccant that has not changed white in color. - Discard dipstick if damaged, or if desiccant is missing or changed to white in color. - Label top of dipstick with patient identifier. - Place the dipstick in the test tube with the arrows facing DOWN. - Confirm the end of the dipstick (\"the dipping area\") is submerged in the processed sample. NOTE: The arrows should remain above the level of the sample. - Wait 15-30 minutes, remove dipstick and read the result. (See table below for results interpretation.) - Place all waste in a double-lined plastic bag labeled or -||-| *Control band must appear for the result to be considered valid. "}
