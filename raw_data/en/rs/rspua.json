Vegetarian diets meet the same food requirements as vegan diets, with the difference that in their production or processing, the following ingredients (or their components or derivatives) may be added or used: milk and dairy products, colostrum, eggs, honey, beeswax, propolis or wool grease (including lanolin derived from the wool of living sheep or their components or derivatives). Choosing a preparation When choosing a preparation that is suitable for a vegetarian or vegan it is necessary to consider the appropriateness of both the active and inactive ingredients. Excipients (inactive ingredients) Certain excipients (such as gelatin) make a preparation unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans. See our other work on excipients and vegan patients: [Excipients: What are the general considerations for vegan patients?](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/excipients-what-are-the-general-considerations-for-vegan-patients/) Whilst a specific excipient may not be listed as present in a particular product, it cannot be guaranteed that the product has not been in contact with milk-derived or animal-derived products during the manufacturing process. Where necessary, contact the manufacturer for further information on the manufacturing process. Active Ingredients [The BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/) lists many different vitamin D preparations. Proprietary vitamin D preparations contain colecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). There are no licensed oral vitamin D2 preparations. Licensed Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) preparations Colecalciferol is synthetically produced using 7-dehydrocholesterol derived from lanolin (wool fat). Products originating from wool fat are unacceptable to vegans. - Lanolin sourced from the wool of live sheep, and not bred for slaughter for the meat industry, is considered suitable for vegetarians. - Lanolin sourced from the wool of sheep that have been slaughtered, or are about to be sent to slaughter, is unsuitable for vegetarians. Suitable for vegans There are no licensed vitamin D preparations which are suitable for vegans.
