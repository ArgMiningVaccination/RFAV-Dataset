BIOCHEMISTRY AIMS AND SCOPE OF THE COURSE IN BIOCHEMISTRY The major aim is to provide a sound but crisp knowledge on the biochemical basis of the life processes relevant to the human system and to dental/medical practice. The contents should be organised to build on the already existing information available to the students in the pre-university stage and reorienting. A mere rehash should be avoided. The chemistry portion should strive towards providing information on the functional groups, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and weak valence forces that organise macromolecules. Details on structure need not be emphasised. Discussion on metabolic processes should put emphasis on the overall change, interdependence and molecular turnover. While details of the steps may be given, the student should not be expected to memorise them. An introduction to biochemical genetics and molecular biology is a must but details should be avoided. The exposure to antivitamins, antimetabolites and enzyme inhibitors at this stage, will provide a basis for the future study of medical subjects. An overview of metabolic regulation is to be taught by covering hormonal action, second messengers and regulation of enzyme activities. Medical aspects of biochemistry should avoid describing innumerable functional tests, most of which are not in vogue. Cataloguing genetic disorders under each head of metabolism is unnecessary. A few examples which correlate genotype change to functional changes should be adequate. At the end of the course the student would be able to acquire a useful core of information, which can be retained for a long time. Typical acid tests can be used to determine what is to be taught or what is to be learnt. A few examples are given below. 1. Need not know the structure of cholesterol. Should know why it cannot be carried free in plasma. 2. Mutarotation should not be taught. Student should know why amylase will not hydrolyse cellulose. 3. Need not know the details of alpha - helix and beta - pleats in proteins. Should know why haemoglobin is globular and keratin is fibrous. 4. Need not know mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation. Should know more than 90 % of ATP is formed by this process. 5. Need not know details of the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin. Should know hydrochloric acid cannot break a peptide bond at room temperature. 6. Need not remember the steps of glycogenesis. Should know that excess intake of carbohydrate will not increase glycogen level in liver or muscle. 7. Need not know about urea or creatinine clearance tests. Should know the basis of increase of urea and creatinine in blood in renal insufficiency. 8. Need not know the structure of insulin. Should know why insulin level in circulation is normal in most cases of maturity onset diabetes. 9. Need not know the structural details of ATP. Should know why about 10 g of ATP in the body at any given time meets all the energy needs. 10. Need not know the mechanism of action of prolyl hydroxylase. Should know why the gum bleeds in scurvy. 11. Need not know the structure of Vitamin K. Should know the basis of internal bleeding arising due to its deficiency. 12.

FORENSIC ODONTOLOGY (30 hrs of instruction) Definition Forensic is derived from the Latin word forum, which means 'court of law.' Odontology literally implies 'the study of teeth.' Forensic odontology, therefore, has been defined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Dentaire International (FDI) as \"that branch of dentistry which, in the interest of justice, deals with the proper handling and examination of dental evidence, and with the proper evaluation and presentation of dental findings.\" Objectives of the undergraduate curriculum At the end of the programme, the dental graduate should: 1. Have sound knowledge of the theoretical and practical aspects of forensic odontology. 2. Have an awareness of ethical obligations and legal responsibilities in routine practice and forensic casework. 3. Be competent to recognise forensic cases with dental applications when consulted by the police, forensic pathologists, lawyers and associated professionals. 4. Be competent in proper collection of dental evidence related to cases of identification, ethnic and sex differentiation, age estimation and bite marks. 5. Be able to assist in analysis, evaluation, and presentation of dental facts within the realm of law. Curriculum for forensic odontology 1. Introduction to forensic dentistry Definition and history Recent developments and future trends 2. Overview of forensic medicine and toxicology Cause of death and postmortem changes Toxicological manifestations in teeth and oral tissues 3. Dental identification Definition Basis for dental identification Postmortem procedures Dental record compilation and interpretation Comparison of data, and principles of report writing Identification in disasters and handling incinerated remains Postmortem changes to oral structures 4. Maintaining dental records Basic aspects of good record-keeping Different types of dental records Dental charts Dental radiographs Study casts Denture marking Photographs Dental notations Relevance of dental records in forensic investigation 5. Age estimation Age estimation in children and adolescents Advantages of tooth calcification over 'eruption' in estimating age Radiographic methods of Schour & Massler, Demirjian et al Age estimation in adults Histological methods - Gustafson's six variables and Johanson's modification, Bang & Ramm's dentine translucency Radiographic method of Kvaal et al Principles of report writing 6. Sex differentiation Sexual dimorphism in tooth dimensions (Odontometrics) 7. Ethnic variations ('racial' differences) in tooth morphology Description of human population groups Genetic and environmental influences on tooth morphology Description of metric and non-metric dental features used in ethnic differentiation 8. Bite mark procedures Definition and classification Basis for bite mark investigation Bite mark appearance Macroscopic and microscopic ageing of bite marks Evidence collection from the victim and suspect of bite mark Analysis and comparison Principles of report writing Animal bite investigation 9. Dental DNA methods Importance of dental DNA evidence in forensic investigations Types of DNA and dental DNA isolation procedures DNA analysis in personal identification Gene-linked sex dimorphism Population genetics 10. Jurisprudence and ethics Fundamentals of law and the constitution Medical legislation and statutes (Dental and Medical Council Acts, etc) Basics of civil law (including torts, contracts and consumer protection act) Criminal and civil procedure code (including expert witness requirement) Assessment and quantification of dental injuries in courts of law Medical negligence and liability Informed consent and confidentiality Rights and duties of doctors and patients Medical and dental ethics (as per Dentists' Act) Theory sessions and practical exercises Total hours for the course Didactic - 10-12 hours Practical - 20-25 hours Detailed didactic sessions for the above components, either in the form of lectures or as structured student-teacher interactions, is essential. Specialists from multiple disciplines, particularly from legal and forensic sciences, can be encouraged to undertake teaching in their area of expertise. An interactive, navigable and non-linear (INN) model may also be utilised for education. Practical exercises (real-life casework and/or simulated cases) must complement didactic sessions to facilitate optimal student understanding of the subject. Mandatory practical training in dental identification methods, dental profiling (ethnic and sex differences, radiographic age estimation), and bite mark procedures, is of paramount importance. In addition, practical exercises/demonstrations in histological age estimation, comparative dental anatomy, DNA methods, medical autopsy, court visits, and other topics may be conducted depending on available expertise, equipment and feasibility. Approach to teaching forensic odontology Forensic odontology could be covered in two separate streams. The divisions include a preclinical stream and a clinical stream. Preclinical stream Introduction to forensic odontology Sex differences in odontometrics Ethnic variations in tooth morphology Histological age estimation Dental DNA methods Bite marks procedures Overview of forensic medicine and toxicology It could prove useful to undertake the preclinical stream in II or III year under Oral Biology/Oral Pathology since these aspects of forensic odontology require grounding in dental morphology, dental histology and basic sciences, which, students would have obtained in I and/or II BDS. Clinical stream Dental identification Maintaining dental records Radiographic age estimation Medical jurisprudence and ethics It would be suitable to undertake these topics in the IV or V year as part of Oral Medicine and Radiology, since students require reasonable clinical exposure and acumen to interpret dental records, perform dental postmortems and analyse dental radiographs for age estimation. 21. ORAL IMPLANTOLOGY (30 hrs of instruction) INTRODUCTION TO ORAL IMPLANTOLOGY Oral Implantology is now emerged as a new branch in dentistry world wide and it has been given a separate status in the universities abroad.
