Making sure that I can provide a clean, safe space for your baby is more important now than ever before. While we still don't know what our \"new normal\" will look like, I am putting extra measures in place on top of what we already do to sanitize the studio for our littlest clients and their families. Please know that I am taking this virus very seriously, as my job requires me to work with babies that have very delicate immune systems. I also have two children at home myself and I am doing everything I can to prevent bringing any germs home to them. Your baby's safety has always been and continues to be my number one concern. While studio cleanliness has always been a priority, I will be taking extra steps for your health as well as my own. Below you will find an updated list of precautions and studio policies that will be in place as we move forward. Before Your Session - If anyone in your household is feeling sick or has a fever 7 days prior to your session, we will need to reschedule. - Likewise, if I or someone in my household become sick I will contact you as soon as possible to reschedule. - At this time we are asking that only members of your household that will be photographed attend the session. Please reach out to me in advance if you would like to bring a Grandparent or other family member to help assist you with baby.
