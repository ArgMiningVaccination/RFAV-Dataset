OLD BUSINESS: Dr. Bloodworth moved to approve the minutes from the September 2020 DUR Board M eeting, seconded by Dr. Fitts , and unanimously approved by the DUR Board. Resource Utilization Review: Dr. Pittman presented the resourc e utilization re port for July 2020 - September 2020. Enrollment numbers continued to climb since April 2020 with 6.4% more beneficiaries receiving pharmacy benefits compared to September 2019. While enrollment numbers increased, the number of prescription fills decreased compared to September 2019. The total dollars paid for prescriptions was approximately equal to that for the same perio d in 2019. Feedback and Discussion from Board: No follow -up discussion concerning previous DUR Board topics was held. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 6 3 NEW BUSINESS: Update on MS -DUR Educational Interventions: Dr. Pittman provided an overview of all DUR mailings that occurred September 2020 - November 2020. Special Analysis Projects: Adult and Child Core Set Quality Measures Dr. Catherine Brett provided an overview to the Board describing quality measures and Medicaid's continued work to improve care provided to beneficiaries. Following Dr. Brett's presentation, Dr. Pittman reviewed the adult and child core set measures MS -DUR ran for CY 2019. For each measure, Dr. Pittman provided a brief description of the measure, pe rformance reported, and comparative national data, when available. No action was taken on items from this report. Naloxone Use in High Risk Beneficiaries Dr. Pittman provided a report describing the use of naloxone among beneficiaries at high risk of experiencing adverse opioid event s or overdose. This report was the result of a request from the Board at the September 2020 DUR Board Meeting. The analysis revealed that among Medicaid beneficiaries identified as high risk, less than 2% had a naloxone claim. The board discussed various methods for increasing naloxone use among beneficiaries at high risk of overdose events. Following a robust discussion, the following recommendation was considered: 1. DOM should distribute educational reminders to prescribers and pharmacists regarding the FDA's recent recommendation for naloxone, the covered status of naloxone products on the P referred Drug List, and the M ississippi State Department of Health 's Naloxone Standing Order. Dr. Torrey motioned to approve the recommendation, seconded by Dr. Bloodworth, and unanimously approved by the Board. Adult Vaccines Dr. Pittman reviewed a report on the administration of adult vaccines to Medicaid beneficiaries during calendar year 2019. DOM is seeking appro val from CMS to expand adult vaccine services offered through pharmacies. The report detailed adult vaccination rates overall and highlighted opportunities for increasing vaccination rates through the pharmacy benefit. The following recommendation was c onsidered: Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 7 4 1. Upon CMS approval of the Vaccine State Plan Amendment (SPA), DOM should begin an educational initiative targeting pharmacists. The education should highlight the expanded opportunities granted pharmacists through the updated SPA and serve as a call to action for pharmacists to actively engage in adult immunizations. Dr. Fitts motioned to approve the recommendation, seconded by Ms. Dunaway, and unanimously approved by the board. FDA Drug Safety Updates : Dr. Pittman presented FDA drug safe ty communications for September 2020 - November 2020.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , in 2018 over 1 million individuals in the United States and dependent areas had an HIV diagnosis with an estimated 38,000 new infections occurring that year.2 While overall trends in new HIV infection rates have decreased in the US, progr ess has stalled in recent years . The disease burden of HIV is disproportionately distributed across the US . The overall rate of HIV diagnosis in the US in 2018 was 11.5 per 100,000 population. Individuals age 20 to 24 years and 25 to 29 years had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses per 100,000 population at 27.9 and 32.6, respectively. Incidence among Black/African Americans w as more than twice the rate when compared to other racial/ethnic groups at 39.2. 2 Although Southern states mak e up 38% of the population, they accounted for 52% of new diagnoses in the US in 2018.2 Drilling down even further, Mississippi was included among those states with high rates of HIV infections. According to the 2018 HIV Surveillance Report, there were ov er 9,000 people living with HIV in Mississippi.3 In 2018, Mississippi was tied with Maryland as having the 6th highest incidence of HIV infection among adolescents and adults in the US with a diagnosis rate of approximately 19.3 per 100,000 population , while the US average diagnosis rate was 13.6 per 100,000 population. 4 (Figure 1) More specifically, Jackson, Mississippi had the 8th highest diagnosis rate of HIV infections (28.4) for all metropolitan statistical areas measured in the US .5 FIGURE 1: HIV Diagnosis Rates per 100,000 population for the US in 2018. 4 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 22 In 2019, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched an initiative, Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America. 6 This multi- year initiative's goal was to drastically reduce incident HIV infections in the US by 90% within 10 years. (Figure 2 ) The initiative was designed to rapidly increase utilization of these key components in 48 counties, plus Washington, D.C., and San Juan, Puerto Rico with the highest number of new HIV diagnoses in 2016 and 2017. Additionally seven states with a high proportion of HIV diagnoses in rural areas (Mississippi was included) were added to the focus areas .7 FIGURE 2: Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for Ameri ca Key Components .6 One of the primary components of this initiative is prevention , which many consider the key to eliminating HIV. 8 Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is one aspect of prevention that involves the use of antiretroviral medications on a routine basis by individuals that are HIV negative who are at high -risk of being exposed to HIV. Currently, there are two FDA products approved for use as PrEP. Both products are combination antiretroviral drug formulations consisting of emtricitabine and tenofovir. The first product approved by the FDA in 2012 to be used for PrEP was Truvada \u00ae.9 A second product, Descovy\u00ae, was approved in October 2019.10 Both products are approved for use in PrEP for adults and adolescents > 35kg to reduce the risk of H IV infection .9,10 A key factor in the effectiveness of HIV PrEP therapy is adherence . Studies have shown that PrEP can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV from sex by up to 99% and from injection drug use by 74%, but effectiveness was highly associated with the degree of adherence.11 In 2019 the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued updated recommendations on PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection. After a syste matic review of evidence, PrEP was found to be of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV infection among high -risk persons. Adherence to PrEP was highly associated with efficacy at preventin g HIV infection , and PrEP use was associ ated Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 23 with minimal harms.12 Categories of individuals identified by USPSTF as high -risk for acquir ing HIV infection include: o Men who have sex with men, are sexually active, and have 1 of the following characteristics : A serodiscordant sex partner (i.e., in a sexual relationship with a partner living with HIV) Inconsistent use of condoms during receptive or insertive anal sex A sexually transmitted infection (STI) with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia within the past 6 months o Heterosexually active women and men who have 1 of the following characteristics : A serodiscordant sex partner (i.e., in a sexual relationship with a partner living with HIV) Inconsistent use of condoms during sex with a partner whose HIV status is unknown and who is at high risk (e.g., a person who injects drugs or a man who has sex with men and women) An STI with sy philis or gonorrhea within the past 6 months o Persons who inject drugs and have 1 of the following characteristics Shared use of drug injection equipment Risk of sexual acquisition (s ee above) For Mississippi Division of Medicaid beneficiaries , PrEP m edications are covered under the Universal Preferred Drug List (UPDL) . Both branded Truvada\u00ae and Descovy\u00ae are preferred agents available without prior authorization requirements . To further increase access to PrEP products, DOM's Family Planning Waiver is available to women and men to receive family planning related services, including many medications for the treatment of sexua lly transmitted infections/ sexu ally transmitted diseases ( STIs/STDs ). The two medications currently approved for PrEP use are included on the list of medications covered under the Waiver. MS-DUR conducted an analysis assessing the utilization of PrEP products in Mississippi Medicaid between 2014 and 2020. A summary of those findings follows. METHOD S A retrospective analysis was conducted using Mississippi Medicaid fee -for-service (FFS) and coordinated care organization [CCOs: United Healthcare (UHC), Magnolia (MAG), and Molina (MOL)] claims for the period of January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2020. The identification period for beneficiaries on HIV Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP ) was Jan uary 1, 2014 to Oct ober 31, 2020, which allowed for a 12 month look back period and a 30-day follow -up period for every beneficiary in the sample . MS -DUR ha s complet e medical claims in its database beginning CY 2013. Beneficiaries on (PrEP) were identified according to the algorithm developed by Wu et.al. which is used by CDC . 13,14 Beneficiaries aged 16 years who were prescribed tenofovir and emtricitabine ( TDF+FTC or TAF +FTC) for PrEP were included in the sample. The first claim was assigned as the index date. D ual eligible beneficiaries and those age > 64 years were excluded from the study sample. Additionally, beneficiaries with a diagnosis code for Hepatitis B (HBV) or an Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 24 HIV infection (assessed from medical claims) at any time before or within 30 days after the index date were excluded from analysi s.13 All 25 ICD 10 diagnosis codes as well as the principal diagnosis code of each claim were checked from inpatient, outpatient and medical claim files to identify beneficiaries with HIV or HBV. Beneficiaries having a prescri ption intended to treat HIV or HBV (assessed from pharmacy claims), at any time before or within 30 days after the index date , were excluded from analysis.13 Finally, beneficiaries prescribed TDF +FTC or TAF +FTC for Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) , identified as those with a prescription for 28 continuous days , were excluded from the analysis.14 Figure 3 provides a description of the attrition associated with the algorithm used. FIGURE 3 : Sample Attrition for Beneficiaries on PrEP Therapy Plan was determined as of index da te (earliest prescription fill date for PrEP) . Information on beneficiaries' race, gender, age, and plan (FFS/UHC/MAG/MOL) were summarized in the analysis (Table 1). Age and plan were assessed as of index date. Trends in number of people utilizing PrEP was reported according to the plan as of index date, for each year from 2014 -2020 ( Figure 4 & Figure 5) . PrE P utilization patterns for beneficiaries on PrEP were reported according to plan at index date in terms of mean duration of continuous use and length of continuous use in the following categories 29 -60 days, 61- 90 days and 91 days or more (Table 2 ). Contin uous use was defined as continuous PrEP use with a maximum allowable gap of up to 14 days between consecutive prescription fills after adjusting for early refills. Co de of eligibility (COE) for each index PrEP fill was reported by plan in Table 3. County level distribution of number of unique providers that prescribed PrEP during the study period was reported in Figure 6 . Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 25 RESULTS In Table 1 demographic characteristics of beneficiaries initiated on pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) between January 1, 2014 and October 31, 2020 are displayed. A total of 159 beneficiaries were initiated on PrEP therapy. 71.7% were between the ages of 18 -35 years. 55.3% were male. 75.5% were African American. Figure 4 display s yearly trends in benef iciaries initiating PrEP Therapy. The maximum number of annual initiates of PrEP therapy occurred in 2019 with 40 beneficiaries. 2020 saw a 30% drop compared to 2019. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 26 FIGURE 5 also show s a decrease in 2020 in the total number of beneficiaries having a PrEP prescription claim . The se declines follow national trends associat ing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic with changes in PrEP utilization . 15 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 27 Length of therapy patterns for Medicaid beneficiaries prescribed PrEP products is detailed in Table 2. Mean length of therapy across all programs was 72.46 days. The majority of beneficiar ies (104/159) appear to have taken PrEP < 60 days. As menti oned earlier in the report, PrEP therapy is covered under Medicaid's Family Planning Waiver. Of the 159 beneficiaries started on PrEP therapy, 53 were covered und er the Family Planning Waiver as of the index fill date. (Table 3 ) Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 28 One of the key components to initiating PrEP therapy is beneficiary access to providers that will identify high -risk individuals and prescribe PrE P. Providers were identified across the state that had prescribed PrEP to Medicaid beneficiaries during the study period. (Figure 6 ) FIGURE 6 : Distribution of Unique Providers Prescribing PrEP by County A total of 76 Providers across 20 counties prescribed PrEP therapies to Medicaid beneficiaries between 2014 -2020. Hinds county accounted for 48.7% (37) of the providers prescribing PrEP therapies. Only 24.4% (20) of the 82 counties in MS had a provider prescribe PrEP to a Medicaid beneficiary. 55% (11/20) of the counties where PrEP was prescribed only had 1 provider. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 29 CONCLUSIONS HIV infections continue to be a major public health issue in the United States , with Mississippi among the highest states in the nation in HIV incidence rates. One of the keys to ending the HIV epidemic is prevention through PrEP. PrEP therapy is covered under Medicaid's UPDL with no prior authorization criteria needed and is also included under the Family Planning Waiver. Even with no restrictions to access, there have been only 159 beneficiaries initiated on PrEP therapy since January 2014. In order for PrEP therapy to be effective in reducing incident HIV infections in Mississi ppi, more high- risk individuals need to be identified and initiated on PrEP therapy. RECOMMEND ATION 1. The Division of Medicaid should conduct provider education on PrEP therapy to include: Incidence rates for HIV infections in Mississippi; Categories of individuals identified as being high -risk for acquiring HIV infection; Preferred status of PrEP products on UPDL ; Inclusion of PrEP products as covered medications under the Family Planning Waiver for both males and females; Need for more providers around the state to identify high- risk beneficiaries and prescribe PrEP. 2. MS-DUR to conduct future research related to PrEP utilization in the Medicaid population to include: Compare sociodemographic, clinical, and social determinant of health character istics between PrEP utilizers and those newly diagnosed with HIV infections ; Assess PrEP persistence patterns and predictors of PrEP persistence; Assess geographical disparities in PrEP uptake and persistence; Assess p otential b arriers to PrEP therapy (soc ial stigma, provider stigma, adherence, lab monitoring, etc.) .

Unlike THC, another phyt ocann abinoid having antiepileptic effects, CBD has no known abuse potential and lacks detectable psychoactive properties, providing patients the benefit of reduction in seizure frequency while experiencing minimal psychoactive side effects .3 Epidiolex is available as an oral solution and is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox -Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), or tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC) in patients 1 year of age and older . 4,5 Several phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that Epidiolex is effective and well tolerated when added to conventional antiepileptic regimens for these indications. 6-9 Dosing of Epidiolex should be initiated at 2.5 mg/kg by mouth twice daily, and titrated up in weekly increments of 2.5 mg/kg twice daily as necessary and tolerated to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg/day for LGS and DS and 25 mg/kg/day for TSC.4,5 Common adverse drug effects occurring i n greater than 10% of trial participants included somnolence, fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, diarrhea, insomnia, infection, and elevated liver transaminases. 6-9 Epidiolex is considered an add -on therapy for treatment- resistant epileps y, where patients are typically inadequately controlled on at least one antiepileptic drug (AED). 4,5 Valproate is commonly considered valproate are common second - and third -line treatment options. 11 There are many AEDs commonly used for the control of seizures associated with TSC and their use depends on several factors including seizure type, affected individual's age, other organ systems im pacted, and symptom severity; however the only medications with FDA approved indications for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis are Epidiolex and Afinitor (everolimus). 12,13 While Epidiolex is the only FDA- approved prescription CBD product, there are other cannabidiol containing products on the market, including hemp oil nationally and medical marijuana and CBD supplements in sel ect states. In Mississippi, Initiative 65, a measure allowing qualified patients with debilitating medical conditions (including epilepsy and other seizures) to use medical marijuana, was passed by voters in November 2020. This amendment allow s medical marijuana to Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 33 be provided only by licensed treatment centers.14 Despite their availability , these other products are not federally regulated and either have mixed or are completely lacking efficacy and safety data in relation to seizures.15 Epidiolex is nonpreferred on the Universal Preferred Drug List (UPDL) with the following SmartPA requirements: minimum age limit of 1 year, diagnosis requirements, and prior anticonvulsant use requirements for those with a diagnosis of Lennox Gastaut. (Figure 1) FIGURE 1: Mississippi Medicaid UPDL Listing for Epidiolex Since its FDA approval in 2018, Epidiolex use has steadily risen in Mississippi Medicaid. MS -DUR conducted an analysis of Epidiolex utilization trends among Medicaid beneficiaries from June 2018 through December 2020. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 34 METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted using Mississippi Medicaid fee -for-service (FFS) and coordinated care organization [CCOs: United Healthcare (UHC), Magnolia (MAG), and Molina (MOL)] claims for the period June 2018 to December 2020 to identify beneficiaries prescribed Epidiolex. Beneficiary age, race, sex, and health plan were identified according to the first claim of Epidiolex (index date) during the study period (Table 1) . Target diagnoses were assessed in medical claims data during the period beginning January 2016 until the Epidiolex index date (Table 2). A beneficiary was considered to have a target diagnosis if medical claims data contained an ICD-code for any of the associated diagnoses during the measurement period. Quarterly trends in Epidiolex utilization by number of beneficiaries, pharmacy claims, and associated pharmacy costs were summarized (Tables 3 -4, Figure 2) . For each Epidiolex claim, characteristics of prescribing providers were also identified (Table 5) . Quarterly dosing trends in Epidiolex utilization were evaluated and descriptive statistics were assessed during the study period (Figures 3a -e). Daily Epidiolex dose was calculated by taking the product of the submitted quantity on the claim (ml) and the strength of the product (100mg/ml) divided by the days supply submitted for that claim. Antiepileptic drug utilization in a 90 -day period pre and post -Epidiolex ut ilization was assessed from pharmacy claims data (Tables 6 -7). Trends in drug use were summarized by ranking utilization based on n umber of beneficiaries prescribed the drug and associated costs. Concurrent antiepileptic drug use was als o summarized by number of distinct drugs and drug categories used in the pre and post -Epidiolex period. RESULTS In Table 1, beneficiary demographic characteristics are presented for those prescribed Epidiolex. 70.1% (115/164) of beneficiaries were < were males; 52.4% (86/164) were Caucasian ; 55% (91/164) were in FFS Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 35 Table 2 examines target diagnoses associated with beneficiaries prescribed Epidiolex. Medical claims data was evaluated from January 2016 (> 2 years prior to the first Epidiolex claim) to identify target diagnoses. A beneficiary could have more than one target diagnosis present in claims data. Each target diagnosis identified in claims data was noted in Table 2. 22.6% (37/164) of beneficiaries did not have a target diagnosis present in claims data. o Dravet s yndrome did not have a specific ICD -10 diagnos is code assigned until late 2020. Other ICD -10 codes commonly utilized for Dravet syndrome (G40.40, G40.41) were also used in identifying beneficiaries with that diagnosis. 18.3% (30/164) of beneficiaries had dual target diagnoses present in claims data. n % Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome 57 34.8% Dravet Syndrome 92 56.1% Tuberous Sclerosis 8 4.9% No Associated Diagnoses 37 22.6%Beneficiaries (N=164)Target Diagnoses*Table 2: Summary of Target Diagnoses for Beneficiaries Prescribed Epidiolex *Target diagnoses were evaluated from January 2016 until Epidiolex index date.

There have been a total of 2,061 claims for Epidiolex with 55.7% (1,148) in FFS. The total number of quarterly claims/beneficiaries treated rose consistently through Q2/2020 after which the num bers leveled off . Additional information for Table 2 : A beneficiary was considered to have target diagnoses if they had any claim with ICD-10 code for the said diagnoses during the evaluation period.

Figure 3a details quarterly dosing trends. Figures 3b- e show trends for each plan. Median daily dose point estimates and interquartile ranges are displayed for each quarter. Generally speaking , median daily dose has steadily risen across all plans with a few peaks occurring throughout the analysis period. When examining interquartile ranges, Magnolia and UHC appear to have had the largest consiste nt increases in dosing ranges. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 39 Upon examining provider characteristics, neurologists and pediatricians made up the majority of prescribers associated with Epidiolex claims. (Table 5) Tables 6a/b describe antiepileptic medication utilization during the 90 -day period prior to and immediately following Epidiolex initiation. Spending on antiepileptic me dications , excluding Epidi olex, in beneficiaries prescribed Epidiolex decreased from $ 1,214,165 prior to initiating Epidiolex to $ 1,061,593 after initiating Epidio lex.

Since its introduction in 2018, utilization of Epidiolex in Mississippi Medicaid has steadily increased. Analys es indicated that while the number of beneficiaries being treated with Epidiolex appeared to st abilize beginning Q2/2020, costs associated with its use continued to climb. Increased costs could be associated with an increase in dosage ranges prescribed for beneficiaries. RECOMMENDATION 1. In light of the apparent increase in the dosage ranges being prescribed, DOM should establish dosing limits based on the labeled maximum dose recommendations. Such limits would allow for clinical review through prior authorization for doses exceeding these l imits.

Somatropin promotes tissue and linear growth along with stimulating the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and minerals . Somatropin is a subcutaneous injection routinely adm inistered daily. It is most commonly used to treat short stature due to growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Prader -Willi syndrome, short stature homeo box-containing gene (SHOX) deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, idiopathic short stature and children small for gestational age.1,2 The Division of Medicaid's Universal Preferred Drug List coverage for growth hormone is provided in Figure 1. Current Smart PA guidelines require diagnosis criteria for individuals > 18 years. Figure 1: Universal Preferred Drug List (01/01 2021) 3 MS-DUR conducted a class review of growth hormone utilization within the Division of Medicaid to assess prescribing trends, associated diagnose s, and provider characteristics. METHODS A retrospective analysis of Medicaid point of sale (POS) pharmacy claims and medical claims data from fee-for-service (FFS) and the three coordinated care organizations (CCOs) was conducted for the measurement period Jan uary 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020. Beneficiaries were included in the analysis if they had at least one fill for any growth hormone agent during the study period. The date of the first prescription was identified as the index date. Medicaid's Smar tPA criteria for growth hormones was used as a guide for this analysis. Beneficiaries were categorized by age as being either < 17 years or 18+ ye ars based on the Smart PA criteria. Beneficiaries were assigned to the respective age group and plan they were enrolled in as of the index date. The period from January 2017 - December 2020 was used to identify relevant diag noses for beneficiaries . Current Smart PA guidelines do not require a diagnosis check for beneficiaries less than 18 years. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 45 RESULTS Table 1 provides demographic characteristics for beneficiaries prescribed growth hormone agents January 2018 - December 2020. 340 total benefic iaries were prescribed growth hormone agents during that period. 97.6% (332/340) were < 17 years. 62.4% (212/340) were male. 55.6% (189/340) were Caucasian. Table 2 displays a monthly trend analysis of number of prescription claims and costs associated with growth hormone utilization. Average monthly costs and average monthly number of claims by Year: o 2018 - $651,385 / 154 o 2019 - $517,635 / 127 o 2020 - $538,166 / 131 Comparing 2018 figures to 2020: o The average total monthly spend decreased by 17.4% in 2020. o The average monthly number of claims decreased by 14.9% in 2020. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 46 Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 47 Diagnoses associated with the use of growth hormone agents are detailed in Table 3 : By far the most common associated diagnoses present in clai ms data were growth hormone deficiency and short stature . Of the 332 beneficiaries < 17 years of age prescribed growth hormones, only 3. 3% (11) did not have an associated diagnosis present in medical claims data. Mississippi Division of Medicaid DUR Board Packet (Ver 1) - March 2021 - Page 48 From Table 4 it can be determined that pediatric endocrinologists and pediatricians are responsible for the overwhelming majority of growth hormone prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS Although a small number of beneficiaries receive treatment with growth hormone agents, this group of medications contributes to a significant amount of monthly s pend. After conducting an analysis of utilization, t he vast majority of growth hormones are being prescribed for beneficiaries under the age of 18 years (97.6%). Although SmartPA criter ia does not require a diagnosis edit for beneficiaries under 18 years, analysis showed that only 3.3% of beneficiaries under 18 years did not have an associated diagn osis present in medical claims data. Most beneficiaries receiving these agents had an associated diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency or short stature present in claims data. There does not appear to be any significant inconsistencies in the prescribing of growth hormone agents with regards to appropriate diagnoses . RECOMMENDATIONS 1. MS -DUR recommends extending Smart PA diagnosis requirements to all beneficiaries prescribed growth hormone agents.
