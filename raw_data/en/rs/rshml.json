Has anyone that had the same symptoms seen relief? This is horrible! [@michaelk](https://vestibular.org/participant/michaelk/) vestibular neuritis is what my PCP thought I had, and the neurologist agreed (and I agreed as well!), but I saw an ENT who flat out refused to accept it could be that \"because there is no hearing loss\" (which is what differentiates vestibular neuritis from other conditions, I thought). I am seeing a different ENT tomorrow and am curious what he will say... Day 7 after Moderna shot #1... I woke in the middle of night, vomited. Then the room was spinning. Day 8 after shot, horrible vertigo, lots of ringing in my right ear. Also a strange crystal like sound in the ear. I read to not eat salty, fatty foods, etc for vertigo. But then called a medical friend who suggested the opposite, eat fatty, greasy foods. He said my body is COLD due to the vaccine and I need to warm it. After eating a real meal and turning up the heat, I felt much better. I've also been taking Ibuprofen because I believe this is due to inflammation in my ear. I've also taken Claritin because it's likely an allergic reaction. And Vit. C because folks on this thread suggested so, as well as making fresh juice. Now I'm on day 12 since the vaccine and I am slowly getting better. I didn't spin much yesterday and so far today, no spinning. I even could do my morning workout, but I still can't lower my head upside down without feeling weird. Still have the ringing, but that crystal sound is gone. Still feels like my ear is clogged tho. I'm still taking it easy, moving slowly, but I do think I'm getting better. This thread was a god send, thanks for all who posted. I will post an update when it feels right. But I think the Ibuprofen and eating warm, big meals, even if you're not hungry, is important and lots of water. We're kinda on our own here folks, keep sharing what's working for you. Thank you. Curious as to how long they said delay it - my Husband had his Pfizer shot on Feb 26th and then following week 6 days later he got vertigo, dizzy, hearing loss, water eyes and some brain fog. An ENT said he had labrythitis - a virus inner ear and he is on prenisone with very little improvement - he is scheduled to get his second shot in a few days........I asked the ENT if it was the vaccine and they said it could be but the treatment wouldnt change - so not sure what to do I am so happy I am finally able to post here. I have been reading this forum every single day this past week for all of your updates. I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday, February 26th, in the morning. I was fine all day Friday, and great Saturday. Around 1:30am on Sunday, February 28th, I woke up spontaneously with double vision. I could not maintain my balance at all, and I was sitting up in bed. Suddenly, my stomach got cramped up and I ran to the bathroom. I got lightheaded and suddenly vomited. Still feeling dizzy. Got lightheaded again, and had diarrhea. I was dizzy beyond belief but managed to crawl back to bed to try to sleep. I woke up and was still so dizzy. I have had dizziness everyday, waking up, walking around, and going to sleep dizzy. The week after, on Friday, March 5th, I suddenly developed a huge lump under my armpit. The dizziness everyday was too much for me, so I went to the ER on Monday, March 8th. All my labs, BP, sugar levels, etc, were completely normal. They did a finger neurologic test and diagnosed me with vertigo. The lump, is actually lymphodenopathy (inflammation of the lymph node), which is a side effect some people are developing with the vaccine. But vertigo, they claimed they had not seen yet. They gave me meclizine and told me to schedule to see an ENT. I went to see the ENT on Friday, March 12th. He told me that he suspects I have a viral ear infection. He said vertigo is NOT a disease but a symptom of a disease, which he said I most likely had the ear infection. And suspected maybe I contracted it from someone, while getting the vaccine, but he also suspected I might have developed it from the vaccine itself. He said, of all his patients, he still has not He checked my ears and even did an auditory exam, but everything came back normal. He told me to get off the meclizine cause its a vestibular supresant. And prescribed me prednisone for a few days before my 2nd Pfizer dose, which is Friday, March 19th. But I do not think I'm going to take it. Honestly, the dizziness has decreased over the past few weeks, but it still comes and goes. I didn't take the prednisone until today, cause I've suddenly had another bout of this dizziness happening. Also, I noticed my lump is starting to go down, but its till there. [@clrohe40](https://vestibular.org/participant/clrohe40/) wow sorry to hear about this. My experience was not quite as harsh but similar. I got my 1st shot on 3/12. About 4 hours later I was laying in bed and I just got really dizzy when reaching for the remote. And it was downhill from there. I woke up during the night to go to the bathroom and had to hold on to the walls from the dizziness. I Went back to bed and then got up the next morning feeling so dizzy and nauseous. I had to call in sick to work! Took Dramamine and Slept all. following day still dizzy just no nausea. Went to ER because I've just never really felt this way that I can ever remember and I just knew it was from the vaccine. The Er gave me IV fluid and did bloodwork. Bloodwork was normal. They gave me vertigo meds and then sent me on my way. Told me to follow up with ENT doctor. It's been 4 days since I got the vaccine and still not feeling normal. I'm able to drive and I went to work last night but it was rough. If I turn my head a certain way I get really dizzy, I feel very tired, I feel like my head weighs a ton and still have not very good balance. I am going to make an appointment with primary care doctor. I just hope this goes away but from some of the comments I'm reading on here, it's not looking good. I don't think I will be getting my 2nd shot because I can't afford to feel this way or miss work. I'm 47 and my only health issue I've ever had was prehypertnsion which I take a low grade blood pressure pill for. I just want to feel normal again. I'm always very active and this is slowing me down and has me extremely worried! [@clrohe40](https://vestibular.org/participant/clrohe40/) wow sorry to hear about this.

I did not go to work today, because it seems to be getting worse. My eyes are also watery. I was perfectly fine before taking the shot and now am terrified to take the 2nd one. Has anyone that had the same symptoms seen relief? This is horrible! Nearly 4 weeks after my first vertigo attack and 5 weeks after the Pfizer vaccination, I suppose I am close to a full recovery. But if I make certain movements, such as bending over a chopping board whilst cooking, I can suddenly experience a slight vertigo feeling, not enough to really upset me but enough to make me straighten up and wait for it to pass. Here's a question for you all: do you trust yourself to drive your car? I haven't yet had a vertigo attack while driving. But under UK law I am supposed to inform the vehicle licensing centre if I have vertigo attacks, and the form requires me to give my doctor's details and state whether I am on medication for the vertigo. I suppose the risk is that I would be barred from driving. I haven't yet reported it, but I wondered what others were doing about this. I stumbled on this forum researching Covid and vertigo. 3 weeks after receiving 2nd Moderna shot I woke up at 02:00 AM covered in sweat and unable to stand or walk without bouncing off walls, nauseous and disoriented. After 2 hours of this I went to ER by ambulance, because I live alone and couldn't possible drive. All tests done in ER were normal, diagnosed with acute benign positional vertigo. After being treated I returned home and have been slowly feeling better. I am still dizzy with uneven gait and ringing in ears. I have noticed ibuprofen helps more than what was prescribed. This forum has helped immensely understand whats going on. [@rosi12](https://vestibular.org/participant/rosi12/) I am glad I came across your post. I struggle with vertigo but not as bad as it has been after getting the Moderna 2nd dose. I started feeling really dizzy 2-weeks after the 2nd dose. I am also concerned and I don't know if I should see a Dr. How are you feeling? has the dizziness subsided for you? I had my first shot of the Moderna vaccine on January 14th and no problems or symptoms. I received my second dose on Feb 23 and developed severe symptoms within 24 hours. I ran a high fever, ached all over, and had a terrible headache with dizziness. Those symptoms lasted approximately 2 days and everything seemed fine. A week later I developed a double ear infection and strep. I had not had either of these in about 20 years. Now I have almost continuous dizziness, so bad sometimes it causes me to lose my balance and fall. I am very concerned and will be making an appointment with my doctor to see if anything can be done. Has anyone else had any similar experiences with the Moderna vaccine? [@ranger72](https://vestibular.org/participant/ranger72/) I can't believe you have the same symptoms I have been experiencing. Thank you for your post because i did not even know how to put it into words without people thinking I was crazy or all in my head. I did find that Ibuprofen helps as well. My anxiety has also increased after the 2nd dose. Very bizzar symptoms. How are you feeling now? Received Pfizer vaccination on a Wednesday. Three days later, woke up in the middle of the night with severe spins - classic vertigo. Spins continued when I woke up the following morning, but after that, was limited to sustained dizziness throughout the day when I moved my head in any direction. Three days later, since mild dizziness continued, went to the ER, but the doctor said they hadn't heard/read of vertigo being a vaccine side effect. Took it very easy and drank a lot of water for a week and, gradually, the dizziness is subsiding. Hi, I also took 1st Pfizer shot March 11. On March 14 Sunday I woke up and staggered into the bathroom. I felt dizzy and nauseated. I did feel better for most of that day after taking antihistamines and ibuprofen, however, today I was much worse with balance but nausea has gone. Took more antihistamines and Ibuprofen but it did not help like last time. I Feel dizzy when bending or moving to quick and need to wait until it passes. Like others I never felt this before. I was semi relieved when I found the site to find others have the same issues, sorry. This has to be from the vaccine. There is no other cause but from taking the vaccine. I have another dose coming April 1. I will report back any findings or solutions. I just took Vit-C-D3 and Zinc. Some have reported feeling better so let's hope it's just a matter of time for all of us. I am going to get the second shot unless something changes my mind. "}
