Radiotherapy cures more cancer than any treatment other than surgery. The women in this storyare still alive 20 years after their treatment. But for them, and severalhundred others treated at that time, the consequences of treatment haveruined their lives. Their problems become more of a burden with each passing year, yet they become increasingly invisible - yesterday's women. But is this yesterday's problem? The particular set of circumstances that led to this story may never happen again. But complex cancer treatmentis not risk- free. From time to time clusters of treatment-related problemsare inevitable. By 2020 there will be over 2 million people alive in the UK who have received cancer treatments. These treatments may affect their health in a range of different ways - from the trivial to the catastrophic. Yet, untilrecently, there has been little research on the measurement ormanagement of 'chronic survivorship illnesses'. There is no nationalsystem to record outcome for those who have received radiation therapyor chemotherapy, and so no way of allowing national trends to be studiedor clusters of problems to be spotted early. And meanwhile, newequipment, surgical techniques and drugs are being introduced at anever-increasing rate. Health professionals have developed hospital based follow-up systems to monitor people who have been treated for cancer. However, it might bemore effective to educate people who are treated for cancer to recognise,record and report problems rather than to rely on the hospital systems.This would make it easier for problems to be picked up earlier. If a medical treatment were found to have serious consequences, what would people receiving the treatment reasonably expect? They wouldexpect to be warned of what might happen. But they would also expectthat if problems arose, their needs would be recognised and appropriatehelp would be made available. They would expect to be given informationto help them to help themselves manage changes in their health andsocial circumstances, and they would expect support to navigate thecomplexities of health and social care systems. Sadly, when a treatment does result in a serious side effect, the NHS does not routinely move to provide this kind of support to those affected.Instead, there is a requirement that fault is allocated to individual peopleor organisations and tested in court. Yet many patients in this situationjust want access to services to which others with equivalent disability areentitled. The women in this story found that an illness without a labelmade (and continues to make) every request for help a potential battle -and some felt forced to resort to litigation.Yesterday's 1: Raising awareness of injuries and campaigning for sympathetic medical care in standards in radiotherapy . . .45Aim 3: To seek compensation - via DH and through litigation . .59Aim 4: 9Executive summary This report aims to tell the story of R.A.G.E. (Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure), drawing on written material and interviews with a number ofpeople who were part of their history. R.A.G.E. is a group of women whoexperienced terrible long-term side effects as a result of radiotherapytreatment for breast cancer. Radiotherapy works by destroying cancercells in the treated area. Long-term effects after treatment for breastcancer are relatively rare, but can be severe. They begin months or yearsafter treatment, tend to persist and get worse rather than better. Theyinclude loss of use of an arm, chronic uncontrollable pain, fractured ribs,difficulty with breathing, severe burns to the skin, digestion and circulation problems. It seems that during the late 70s and early 80s, within a particular group of hospitals in the UK, a number of factors combined to result in anincrease in radiation-induced injuries. These risk factors are wellunderstood today and are now carefully avoided. But it took a very longtime for this understanding to become public knowledge. The R.A.G.E.women initially found it very difficult even to get their problemsrecognised, let alone to gain an understanding of how and why they hadbeen damaged. It wasn't until as late as 1991, when one of the women, Lady Ironside, took her doctor to court, that the women realised that there were otherslike them. Although Lady Ironside had to discontinue her case because ofcosts, her case was crucial to the development of R.A.G.E. Lady Ironside met up with the other women who had experienced similar damage, including Jan Millington, and together they set up R.A.G.E. Asan organisation, R.A.G.E. has four key aims: to raise awareness of the injuries and campaign for sympathetic medical care within the NHS to campaign for national standards in radiotherapy to seek compensation commensurate with the injury to provide mutual support. The work that R.A.G.E. has taken forward to achieve each of these aims is summarised below. Raising awareness of the injuries and campaigning for sympathetic medical care within the NHS R.A.G.E.'s early campaigning on this issue was extremely successful in gaining support from MPs and the leading cancer experts. In 1994, inresponse to lobbying from R.A.G.E., the Royal College of RadiologistsYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 8In the specific case of late effects of cancer treatment, what most people want (in common with people with other chronic conditions) is informationand support for self-management. They need face-to-face access tospecialists relatively infrequently. A few survivors, like the women in thisstory, need ongoing help from a multidisciplinary team. Here the need isnot just for such a team to assess them and clarify what interventionsmight help, but also to support them to access the services they needlocally, where there may be no expertise or interest. A link oncologist ineach cancer centre is helpful. But he or she can only deliver what isrequired by mobilising local services. The failure to implement guidelinesproduced by the Royal College of Radiologists (in partnership withR.A.G.E. - Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure) for those with radiation-induced injuries following treatment for breast cancer illustrates this challenge. Nobody wants a system that makes a bad situation worse. Yet the R.A.G.E. story shows how this could still happen. No one emergesunscathed from this story: doctors, politicians or lawyers. Yet all meantwell. Radiotherapy for breast cancer is very much safer than it was - in no small way due to R.A.G.E.'s campaign. Macmillan Cancer Support hopesthat this report will stimulate more discussion about chronic survivorshipconditions in general and the late effects of radiation treatment inparticular. Macmillan Cancer Support will be working on others to focuson six areas: the need for a national register of consequences of cancer treatment the need to support patients to recognise & understand changes in their health after cancer treatment, to provide the information and helpthey need to manage these and to understand when and from whomthey should seek help, including appropriate face-to-face, written andweb based information. the need to improve communication between primary and secondary care the need to develop innovative ways to bring multidisciplinary specialist expertise to patients with rare, severe treatment relatedchronic illness the need for innovative commissioning models to help people with severe chronic survivorship illnesses get the care that they need the need to develop an expert patient programme for chronic treatment related survivorship conditions. Jane Maher, Chief Medical Officer, Macmillan Cancer SupportYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 11Seeking compensation commensurate with the injury The lives of all of the R.A.G.E. women were profoundly affected by their radiation-induced injuries. Like many people who feel they have beenharmed in some way as a result of medical treatment, they wanted anapology and an appropriate level of compensation. In 1993 R.A.G.E. appointed a legal adviser, who worked for Russell, Jones and Walker (RJW). She led the women to believe that they had astrong legal case for compensation. Some R.A.G.E. members did not want to follow the legal route - they were more in favour of pushing the Department of Health for a public enquirythat might lead to compensation. But others felt they really had no choice.Government officials told them repeatedly that the only way they wouldever gain compensation was by going through the courts. This led to agreat deal of tension amongst members of the R.A.G.E. Committee. By 1995, the women's concerns about the legal action had reached such a peak that they decided to separate themselves from the litigation andfocus on seeking compensation through other means. They thenconcentrated their efforts on lobbying MPs, the House of Lords andgovernment ministers. This led to Early Day Motions, as well asquestions in the House of Commons and House of Lords. But the answerfrom ministers was always the same - that compensation would only bepayable if negligence could be shown through legal means. In the meantime, the litigation did proceed but without the support of R.A.G.E. RJW took forward a group action involving over 130 women(only half of whom were R.A.G.E. members). They gained Legal Aidassistance for 125 of these. The group action was a big risk - very fewhave been successful in this country. But the fact that Legal Aid had beensecured made the women believe there was some hope of winning, butalso made it very difficult for them to go elsewhere for legal advice. In 1995, 10 test cases were selected to represent the 130 women, and RJW initially identified nine principal issues, which they believedunderpinned their case. But after the defence team's experts pointed outserious flaws in their arguments, RJW concluded that the nine principalissues could no longer be supported, and reduced them to one. In December 1997 the litigants were summoned to a meeting and advised that only three of the original ten lead cases could proceed. Thiswas a devastating blow for the women whose cases were dropped. Almost on the eve of the trial, the defendants offered to settle for \u00a32 million. But the women weren't told how this sum would be divided andrealised there would be little left over after covering their costs. So theydecided to proceed to trial. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 10(RCR) set up the Maher Committee. This committee was tasked with considering how the NHS should manage the treatment of women withradiation induced injuries and published its report in 1995. The reportrecommended a multidisciplinary approach to the care of the women,with a focus on symptom control. Perhaps most importantly, thecommittee recommended that there should be one oncologist in everycancer centre with responsibility for women with radiation inducedinjuries, who would act as the link person and co-ordinate each patient'scare. Although highly valued on its release, in the longer term this report had very little impact. One of the key lessons for those involved was theimportance of focussing on the implementation of guidelines, as well astheir development. Based on their experience of using cancer centres over a number of years, the R.A.G.E. women have concluded that they need a specialistnational centre, staffed by professionals with an understanding of theirinjuries and the skills to help them manage their symptoms moreeffectively. Although there have been a number of promising offers andinitial plans, no national centre has yet been established and manyR.A.G.E. women still aren't able to access effective treatment. R.A.G.E. has also instigated and supported research to find new ways of treating the women's symptoms. In 1996 they secured funding for a trialto look at whether there were any benefits from hyperbaric oxygen - atreatment that had shown promise in treating people with multiplesclerosis. Regretfully, this trial showed no benefit for women withradiation damage. Campaigning for national standards After extensive lobbying by R.A.G.E., the Department of Health agreed tofund an audit to investigate how the R.A.G.E. women's radiotherapytreatment had led to such serious injuries. Thelma Bates, who had beenthe Senior Vice President at the RCR was asked to lead the audit. The Bates and Evans report, published in December 1995, identified the common factors in the treatment of 126 women who took part in theaudit. The main finding was that moving women in between treatmentsgreatly increased the risk of injury. High dose techniques also increasedthe risk. Based on these findings, the report made a number ofrecommendations to help improve radiotherapy practice. Views about the impact of the report are divided. But disappointingly again for the R.A.G.E. women, it was of little help in gainingcompensation for the injuries they had suffered.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 13view is that legal action is not the best way to resolve the issues for people damaged by medical treatment. Many believe that the vastamount of public money wasted in legal fees could have been betterspent in providing the women with compensation. It is also clear that more should have been done when the women first raised their concerns. This could have avoided costly legal action. Somehealth professionals have commented that most of the problems arosebecause at the time no one was willing to take responsibility for what had happened. The story also highlights the need for better follow-up of patients after any form of cancer treatment or therapy, especially if any aspect of atreatment is changed. Such a system could have identified the problemsexperienced by the R.A.G.E. women much earlier and perhaps preventedsome of the women's injuries. Once a problem is found, it is alsoimportant that there are better ways to support the people with injuries, tohelp them manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. We are now entering an era where people with cancer are living longer after treatment - by 2020 there will be over two million people alive in theUK who have been treated for cancer. Quality of life is thereforebecoming an increasingly important issue. Yet, until recently, there hasbeen little research on how many people suffer long term damage aftertreatment, or how best to care for them. And there is no national systemto record what happens to people after they receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The lessons from R.A.G.E. are therefore still very relevant today, in helping us to remember the importance of living well after survivingcancer. In response to this report, Macmillan Cancer Support will be working with others to focus on six priorities: a national register of consequences of cancer treatment support and information for patients after cancer treatment improved communication between primary and secondary care the development of innovative ways to bring multidisciplinary specialist expertise to patients with long term effects of cancer treatment the development of innovative commissioning models to help these patients get the care that they need the development of an expert patient programme. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 12The trial took place in early 1998. Only two of the original test cases were tried, and neither of these women had been treated at a hospital wherethere had been high rates of radiation induced injury. The central legalquestion was whether the doctors had been negligent. In her summingup, the judge said that she found the case to be of exceptional difficulty,and commended the women for their courage in coming to terms withtheir condition. But she found in favour of the defendants, concluding thatthe doctors' practice had not been negligent and consistent with thestandards at that time. Losing the case was a huge blow for the women involved and for some resulted in great financial loss. Even though R.A.G.E. had long sincedistanced itself from the case, the judge's conclusions seriouslyundermined their attempts to gain compensation by other means. TheGovernment has since stated that R.A.G.E.'s claim for compensation haseffectively been fought and lost in the courts. However, the R.A.G.E.women still believe there are strong moral arguments for compensatingthem for their suffering. Providing mutual support One of the experiences shared by many R.A.G.E. members was a deepsense of isolation. After years of wondering and worrying, R.A.G.E.helped hundreds of women to finally find out what had caused theirinjuries. These women also found much-welcomed practical andemotional support and benefited greatly from the understanding of otherswho shared their experience. In addition to providing practical advice onhow to cope with daily living, some R.A.G.E. members have acted asadvocates for their peers. This mutual support has been an essentiallifeline for many R.A.G.E. members. Throughout its history, R.A.G.E.'swork has therefore involved much more than its activity aroundcampaigning. R.A.G.E.'s achievements Although R.A.G.E. has not yet achieved all its aims, it has still achieved agreat deal. Many people, professionals and patients alike, believe thatR.A.G.E.'s greatest achievement has been to improve the standards ofradiotherapy treatment for breast cancer in the UK. For R.A.G.E.members, it is particularly important that other women are prevented fromgoing through the same experience and that women today are able tomake better informed choices about their treatment. Lessons R.A.G.E.'s story offers a number of important lessons. A very widely heldYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 15Finally, in chapter six we offer some conclusions and recommendations for the future. This report has been written for the layperson. We have not referenced every point, as we believe this would make the report hard to read.However, we have listed all of the documents we referred to in Appendix1. Most of the report is based on what people told us during interviews.Copies of the interview tapes are held by Macmillan, where intervieweesagreed to this. Some people's names have been changed to protect theiranonymity. The personal stories of R.A.G.E. members This report is the story of R.A.G.E. - but to understand the story of thegroup, it's important to understand the experience of the women who areR.A.G.E. members. Below, you can read the stories of three R.A.G.E.members, in their own words. Each of the stories is anonymised. Story A At Christmas 1981 I felt as though I was on the crest of a wave. I had completed my first term at law school and had done very well in theChristmas exams. Then I read in Michael Baum's Breast Cancer - the facts that the typical breast cancer patient was '51, fat, childless and hypothyroid'. As I had all these risk factors, I went to my GP to ask for amammogram. His reaction was typical, 'You women, you read all thesebooks and then come down here imagining you've got everything'. Hechanged his tone when he discovered a slight thickening in my left breastand proposed to send me to a general surgeon at the local hospital. Iasked instead for referral to a specialist breast unit at X hospital, andthereby possibly signed my own death warrant. I was seen immediately and within a week had a small lump removed. It was, I understand, at a very early stage and the lymph nodes were notaffected. I was then given an appointment for radiotherapy. There was no discussion on alternatives or possible risks, just an appointment. I hadradiotherapy every other day for 6 weeks. I did not know at the time thatthis would involve a higher dose of radiotherapy at each session than if Ihad attended every day and that this higher dose involved a greater riskof injury. In August 1982 (about four months later), I began to have very severe tingling all along my arm, followed by pain, then complete loss of feelingin the arm, even though the pain persisted. In December, I told thesurgeon about this. He just barked, 'You are absolutely A1,' and rushedout of the room. Loss of feeling could be associated with a number ofYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 14Chapter 1: Introduction Aims of this report This report tells the story of R.A.G.E. (Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure) - a group of women who experienced terrible long-term sideeffects as a result of radiotherapy for breast cancer. R.A.G.E. was set upin 1991 and at its most active from 1993 to 1998. The group continues toexist and still offers support to nearly 250 members. R.A.G.E.'s experience offers useful lessons for different groups - other patient groups who feel they have been harmed by the NHS; healthprofessionals who provide treatment which can have damaging long-termside effects; and government ministers and officials who are faced withdemands from patients who believe they may have been harmed bymedical treatment. Yet R.A.G.E.'s story has never been written down. Different papers are held by various members of the group and by others who were involvedin R.A.G.E.'s campaign. R.A.G.E. members are getting older and frailer.So with help from Macmillan Cancer Support they have decided to createa record of their experience - before more key members of the group,and others who played an important part in R.A.G.E.'s story, die orbecome too unwell. R.A.G.E. members feel they are 'yesterday's women'as their story seems to have been forgotten. They are anxious to ensurethat no one has to learn the same lessons all over again. This report therefore aims to tell R.A.G.E.'s story - where possible in the words of people who were part of the story at the time. Structure of this report At the beginning of this report, you'll find the stories of three R.A.G.E.members, that they have written themselves. We hope this will set therest of the report in some context. We then describe the methods we used to put this report together. In chapter three, we offer some background to the development of R.A.G.E.- in particular the history of radiotherapy over this period, and thendetails of a legal case that led to the establishment of R.A.G.E. Chapter four forms the bulk of this report, as it tells the story of R.A.G.E., using the group's four key aims as a structure. In chapter five we reflecton the impact of R.A.G.E., as well as the problems the group faced andthe outstanding issues for its members.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 17problems and suffering pain that could have been relieved. Yet they have the nerve to recommend a 'positive attitude'. In September 1997, I drew attention to extremely severe stabbing pains in my neck and to the fact that when I did my neck exercises, I could feelsomething pulling in the middle of my chest. Both these were quite newproblems and clearly distinct from the previous radiation problems. At mynext appointment, I asked to see the consultant and explained thesymptoms. A junior doctor was instructed to get scans from theneurologist, investigate the problem and call me in for an MRI at Xhospital. No progress of course. So I asked the neurologist to carry outan MRI, which showed in January 1999 that I had a recurrence ofmalignancy!! This time X hospital flew into action, prompted no doubt bytheir knowledge that I had taken full detailed notes of all my interviews.The tumour was completely separate from the breast cancer and lifethreatening - it was a sarcoma induced by radiation!! The support of the R.A.G.E. committee members was I am sure, invaluable. As well as their personal support and comfort to me, Xhospital would know that I was not going to sit down and die quietly!! The operation to remove the sarcoma left me very, very breathless, and I cannot walk far or bend down at all. I also have a painful lymphoedema.There was of course the dreadful fear that the sarcoma might havespread elsewhere, particularly considering the long delay in diagnosing it. I try to push this to the back of my mind, but it comes back when I cannot sleep. Almost every day it is the first thing on my mind on waking. It hasof course cast a great cloud of anxiety over our last years. Had this beeninevitable I should have found it easier to bear, but it was not inevitable. Itwas caused first of all by excessive radiation, but most of all by therefusal of X hospital to admit the problem or follow me up. I am now under the care of a very understanding consultant for whose support and meticulous monitoring I am most grateful. But we are nowleft in a state of great anxiety, particularly as chemotherapy would not beeffective against any recurrence. I have constant severe pain and wemust have lost thousands of pounds in lost earnings and all because of atreatment that might not have been necessary. Story B My breast cancer was diagnosed in May 1990 and probably like many others before me, I found the news that I had the disease almost unrealin that it was conveyed to me in a few short sentences. Treatment to that date had been surgery (lumpectomy). This was then toYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 16serious problems and he would have been careless had he not arranged for these to be checked out. He didn't of course, because he must haverealised it was radiotherapy damage. At subsequent 'check ups' hediagnosed I was suffering from arthritis. My GP sent me to a number ofdoctors to investigate. This of course involved more scans and X-rays.Worst of all was the terrible anxiety that this was a recurrence of cancer.It was useless to tell me that nothing was wrong because I knew it was. I arranged a private appointment at another hospital, eventually reaching an eminent neurologist. He wrote to my surgeon in 1986, ' She must be suffering from radiation damage , which is likely to progress '. I was recently shocked to discover that X hospital had themselvesacknowledged to my GP in that same year that I had brachial plexusneuropathy (BPN). Nevertheless, the hospital kept denying to me thatthere was any problem at all. My request to see a radiologist was refused- 'There was no point'. The consultant almost reduced me to tears. I was'neurotic, arthritic' and it was 'all in my mind'. My husband was advised to'trade me in for one that doesn't moan'!! In all this time, the pain had become unbearable and the arm progressively weaker and the dreadful anxiety of recurrence remained. In 1991, I read of Lady Ironside's action (see page 29). She had been treated on a very similar protocol to mine. It was admitted that hertreatment (part of a cost cutting exercise) had unfortunately resulted in ahigher than expected incidence of injury and had been discontinued.Quite clearly then, the hospital knew that I was radiotherapy damaged,yet they took no action at all, apart from one X-ray in 1982 andmammograms. I had no tests whatsoever until 1999. In 1994, I suddenly became breathless. I had tried everything possible to keep fit, in spite of my pain and had swum 3 times a week. Suddenly, Icould hardly manage one width. The neurologist I had seen beforecarried out extensive tests to discover that my left diaphragm waselevated and paralysed. He said this might be due to radiotherapydamage, or possibly a recurrence and referred the problem to X hospitalwho denied the diaphragm was paralysed. I had 'gas in the stomach'. Itwas however conceded that the other symptoms were caused byradiation damage - the first time the hospital had admitted after 12 yearsof denial. Had it been admitted earlier, I might have had a decompressionoperation or specialised pain relief. Searching my medical records, I discovered that mention had been made of the pain clinic at X hospital, though no one had thought to tell me thatsuch a clinic was available. I went there, and was given nerve blocks andacupuncture. What blessed relief after all those years of pain; I was ableto sleep at night. It beggars belief that doctors, who are supposed to beso concerned for the patient's welfare, could just sit back and watch for12 years, knowing that I was desperately anxious about the cause of myhealth problems had to be a \"radiotherapy accident\". I put in a claim to my personal accident insurers. That company eventually received areport from the hospital, which said that I had \"radiation changes to thelung and chest wall\". This was my first real knowledge and theinformation had obviously been forced out of the hospital by my placing aclaim for what I eventually concluded had been an 'accident'. My experiences were so distressing that I eventually refused to return to the hospital which had administered my radiotherapy treatment. My life now revolves around morphine for severe pain. I seldom leave my home; any exertion leaves me breathless and the pain quickly breaks thecontrol barrier with the minimum exertion. Sometimes I have to spendday after day in bed. I find that complete rest seems to be the partialanswer to comfort. At least it helps to keep the pain under control formost of the time. The pain is always there, but bearable provided there is no exertion. To exert oneself is a recipe for chronic pain. It is so very bad that one feelsat times almost close to death. This feeling, I am sure, has to beexperienced to be understood. Story C This R.A.G.E. member had a successful business career until 1986, when she had to give up her job because of the impairments caused bylate radiation damage. She has not been able to work since, and has hadto give up her house. Her hobby was fine needlework, which she has notbeen able to do since 1986. This letter was drafted to the chair of Xhospital in November 1993, but never sent. 'I was diagnosed in early 1985 as having bilateral breast lumps. Within a week the surgeon at X hospital had performed the necessary operations.As I had always had regular check-ups, the two growths were detected intheir very early stages. One was malignant. I was advised in the daysfollowing my operations that three courses were open to me: To donothing, and hope for no recurrence of the disease - this was felt to berisky. To have total mastectomies - this was considered to be far toodrastic in the circumstances. Or to have a course of radiotherapytreatment - this was the strong recommendation. Neither then nor at any other time, either before or after the surgery, or before or during the radiotherapy, was I given any counsellingwhatsoever. The only comment made about radiotherapy was that somepatients sometimes felt a little tired after the treatment. Since early 1986 I have been in constant pain and have now lost the useYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 19be followed by radiotherapy and here my problems really started. I was sick almost every day, suffered a severe shoulder and arm pain andcould not swallow. I was also exhausted. The radiotherapy doctor had warned me about the swallowing problem. No one however, advised me of any other difficulty. The exhaustionlasted for several months and I felt permanently tired, although could notsleep in spite of this. I returned to work in October on a part-time basis. Agreement was reached that I should return to full time work in November. We alsodiscussed my plans to continue in employment until the age of 63 years. Ithoroughly enjoyed my work, which was as PA/secretary to a director atone of the major UK banks. But my plans to continue in employment to the age of 63 were short lived. During one Saturday and prior to returning to work full time thefollowing Monday, a sudden onset of severe chest pain which travelled tomy throat and into my jaw, had me convinced that I was suffering a heartattack. I was taken to the local hospital's emergency department where,after many hours of exhaustive tests, I was advised that I had a \"lungblood clot\". I was admitted, but much later was told that I was suffering achest infection. This was all very confusing, but at that time I felt too ill toraise any questions. A scan carried out on my last day in hospital revealed 'severe internal bruising' and my consultant asked me whether I had 'been involved in amajor accident'. So lacking in knowledge were my husband and I that wedid not at this stage attribute my internal injuries to the radiotherapytreatment and we were both astonished by the 'major accident' question.The following year one of my lungs was found to be 'scarcely working'.The year after that, three of my ribs fractured, my left arm ceased tofunction properly and my diaphragm was elevated (paralysed). And sothe catalogue of disasters continued. I was passed from clinic to clinic atthe hospital and was becoming increasingly unwell with absolutely noidea of the cause of my problems. My husband and I eventually, and very much later, concluded that my problems had to be connected with radiotherapy, but we also thought thatthere had probably been an 'accident' with the radiotherapy. The furtherconsultation with a radiotherapy doctor left me so distressed that I wasnever to return to that clinic - he had commented, \"It is not cancer, it isstill all there - but I cannot help you\". When I asked what the problemwas, he said that he \"did not know\". He then left the room, leaving mewith a nurse. She commented that I appeared distressed and could she\"reassure me by pointing out that there were many grey areas inmedicine\". I was not reassured. I felt very ill and did not know why. After many more months, my husband concluded that my continuingYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 18Chapter 2: Our approach Our approach involved carrying out a literature review as well as interviewing key people from R.A.G.E.'s history. We first read throughessential background documents selected by Jan Millington, R.A.G.E.member and Jane Maher, the Chief Medical Officer at Macmillan CancerSupport. The people we interviewed also provided us with additionaldocuments and papers from their personal records, which we included aspart of the literature review. How we selected and recruited people for interview We drew up a long list of potential people to interview, based onrecommendations made by Jan Millington and Jane Maher and throughidentifying key people in the background papers. The list of people weinterviewed (who also agreed to be named in this report) can be found inAppendix 2, along with a brief biography. A short-list of twenty individuals was agreed with the Project Steering Group (Steering Group members are listed in Appendix 3). This includedeight R.A.G.E. members and twelve professionals. These people wereselected because individually they each played an important role inR.A.G.E.'s history and as whole they included people with a diverserange of perspectives. Recruiting R.A.G.E. members Jan Millington sent a letter of invitation to the relevant R.A.G.E. members asking if they would be willing to take part in the project (Appendix 4).The letter introduced the researchers, and briefly explained the project.We also offered to meet with individuals or to talk to them on the phoneto provide more details about what taking part would involve. We spoketo everyone who agreed to take part, before sending them a detailedinformation sheet (Appendix 5) and subsequently setting up a time andplace for interview. The interviewees were able to choose a time andplace that most suited them. Recruiting professionals We sent the professionals a letter of invitation (Appendix 6) and a detailed information sheet about the project (Appendix 7). Again weoffered to speak to individuals on the telephone to address any queriesthey had before making their decision about whether to take part.Interviews were again arranged at a time and place to suit the peoplewho agreed to be interviewed. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 21of my right arm and hand. On my visits to X hospital, I tried to bring my increasing pain and disablement to the attention of my radiotherapist, andin every case I was treated as if I were a troublemaker. There are severaloccasions, but the following particularly come to mind. In the earlystages, I detailed my symptoms to my radiotherapist and he said he hadarthritis too. On a later occasion when attending the hospital foroccupational therapy, for which my condition soon became too severe tobe of benefit, I arrived in great pain and distress. The therapists wereinstantly helpful and sympathetic, and telephoned for a doctor. I was seenby my radiotherapist. He said there was nothing he could do. He said Ishould just tuck my arm in my coat, like Napoleon or Nelson and hedidn't remember who. Were you aware that women were being damaged by incorrect or incorrectly administered dosages of radiation in your hospital? That whenit was brought to the attention of your radiotherapist, he always gave theimpression that in some way it was the women's fault? If you wereaware, why did you not immediately form a committee of neurologistsand other disciplines to try to help us in our plight? If you were not aware,how could that possibly be other than by a watertight conspiracy? Theseare questions that will not go away'. This R.A.G.E. member adds: Many years after the above operations and radiotherapy to my right breast area, during a regular check-up, my cancer specialist foundabnormalities and he said that a mastectomy must be performed withoutdelay. This cancer was a direct result of the over dosage and carelessplacement of my original radiotherapy. I am left deformed and disabled bygross medical mistakes and can only function at all on a regime ofquantities of medication, prescribed by a pain clinic. There are now known to be hundreds of cases of serious post breast cancer radiotherapy injury. Many women have had amputations. All of usare in constant pain. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 20and proposal to two researchers with extensive experience in this area and made amendments in light of their comments. The final versionswere then agreed by the Steering Group. Providing support for interviewees We did not expect the interviews to cause anyone any distress. However, because we were concerned that talking about the past might beupsetting for some people, we arranged for a counsellor to be available,to offer short-term help after the interview. The R.A.G.E. intervieweeswere given contact details of the counsellor so they could make anappointment themselves if they wished to do so. Ensuring confidentiality We explained to the interviewees that during the project it would only be the researchers who would have access to the tapes and written notesfrom the interviews. We also informed them that the notes would bestored on personal computers, so that no one else would be able toaccess those files. At the end of the project, rather than destroying all the material, we asked the interviewees if they would be willing to allow Macmillan CancerSupport to keep the tapes as a historical record. We explained thatMacmillan might refer to the tapes in future projects, and that theindividual could specify who could have access to their tapes. We alsogave people the option to have the tapes returned to them. Similarly, weexplained that computer files would be erased, unless they specificallyasked for Macmillan to keep them for possible follow-up work. We also explained that the interviewees need not be identified in the final report, or could choose to be recognised for their contribution withouthaving any of the information attributed to them. We checked with eachperson at the end of each interview, which information they wanted to bekept confidential (ie not included in the report) or which information theywanted anonymised (ie included in the report but not linked to them). All of the people we interviewed were given an opportunity to review early drafts of this report, before the final version was made publiclyavailable. This step ensured that they were happy with all of theinformation that had been attributed to them. This does not mean thatthey necessarily agreed with everything that has been said by other people. Obtaining consent to use the information from the interviews At the end of each interview, we asked the interviewees to sign a consent form (Appendix 8) in which they: agreed that they had read the information and understood what the project was aboutYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 23How we carried out the interviews At the beginning of each interview, we introduced ourselves and explained the aims and objectives of the project. We then explained theissues around confidentiality (see 'Ensuring Confidentiality'), asked theinterviewees if they had any further questions and finally asked forpermission to record the interview before starting the tape recorder. During the interview, we based our questions on a semi-structured interview schedule, previously agreed with the Steering Group. Thisincluded questions about: how the person had been involved in R.A.G.E.'s story what they thought R.A.G.E. had achieved over the years relating to the four main aims of: -raising awareness of the injuries and campaign for sympatheticmedical care within the NHS -campaigning for national standards in radiotherapy -seeking compensation commensurate with the injury -providing mutual support what lessons they thought had been learnt through R.A.G.E.'s experience what they would like to see happen to the report.Each individual was also asked specific questions relating to their particular expertise. For example, R.A.G.E.'s parliamentary officer wasasked questions about R.A.G.E.'s lobbying and campaigning, while thelawyers were asked about the details of the trial. At the end of each interview, we asked the interviewee to sign a consent form (Appendix 8) (see 'Obtaining Consent' below). We also askedwhether they had any other relevant articles, photographs or newspapercuttings. We photocopied these documents and returned the originals byregistered post within 7 days of the interview. Immediately after each interview, we made brief written notes of the key points and our overall impressions. We then made detailed notes fromthe tapes, which were only shared between the two researchers. How we ensured ethical practice We initially sought advice on how to select and approach intervieweesfrom an expert in oral history. We then drafted invitation letters andinformation sheets and developed a detailed proposal of how we wouldrecruit people and conduct the interviews. We sent the draft documentsYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 22Chapter 3: Background In this chapter, we describe some of the background to R.A.G.E.'s story. This includes background information on radiotherapy, in particular how itwas used to treat breast cancer in the late 70s and early 80s at the timewhen the R.A.G.E. women received their treatment. We go on to describehow that differs from treatment today and why those differences exist. We also provide details of a landmark court case that brought radiation damage to everyone's attention for the first time. This was LadyIronside's court case in 1991. Lady Ironside attempted to sue the doctorwho had given her a course of radiotherapy for breast cancer which hadresulted in severe and permanent damage. It wasn't until her case waspublicised that the R.A.G.E. women began to realise that there wereother people with similar injuries to themselves. It was therefore pivotal toR.A.G.E. coming together. Finally, we provide some background information on how R.A.G.E. was initially established and how their early work gained them increasingnumbers of members. Radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer What is radiotherapy and why is it used? Radiotherapy involves using radiation to treat disease. It is most commonly used to treat cancer - sometimes to cure people, sometimesto reduce the chances of the cancer coming back and sometimes to helpreduce the symptoms. Radiotherapy works by destroying cancer cells in the treated area. Although normal cells are inevitably damaged as well, they usually repairthemselves more effectively. The problem with radiotherapy has alwaysbeen getting the balance right - giving enough radiation to deliver thebenefits without damaging too much healthy tissue. Historically, therewas a trend towards higher doses. Doctors assumed that the risks of anyradiation-induced damage were insignificant when compared to the risksof not giving a high enough dose - which might result in the return of thecancer and possibly death. Like all treatments, radiotherapy has both short-term and long-term side effects. The short-term effects begin during or shortly after treatment andusually don't last for more than a month. Following breast radiotherapy,they include tiredness, reddening or blistering of the skin, loss of appetite,nausea and vomiting and temporary difficulty swallowing. Not everyoneexperiences side-effects and those who do don't necessarily experienceYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 25 agreed to the notes from their interview being used for this report described what they wanted to happen to the tapes and computer files from their interview. R.A.G.E. members were also asked if they agreed to being contacted by Macmillan about any follow-up work and if they were happy for theircontact details to be passed to Macmillan. The limitations of our approach We recognise there are many limitations to our approach and do notclaim that the story we are presenting is 'the absolute truth' about whathappened. This story is based on people's recollections of events, someof which took place over twenty years ago. Inevitably, over this length oftime some of those memories will have faded. It is also likely that theywill have been altered in the intervening years; people often avoid thetrauma from remembering distressing or even shameful times by findinga 'story they can live with'. We have tried to find out how people were thinking and feeling in the past by referring to papers and letters that were written during thatperiod. However, the written records have not always been complete andwe have mostly relied on what people have been able to tell us. It isimportant to remember that many of the R.A.G.E. women only have theuse of one arm and are often in constant pain - so writing, filing andmaintaining records was not only very difficult but understandably maynot have always been the highest priority. Sadly, some people we have interviewed are now quite elderly and frail and expressed some difficulty in recalling precisely when and wherecertain events took place. This highlights the importance of carrying out aproject like this early on in any story. In spite of these limitations, we believe this report brings a new and valuable perspective on what R.A.G.E. achieved. Not only is this the firsttime that the views of R.A.G.E. members and the various professionalshave been brought together, but it has also provided an opportunity tofind out more about where people agreed about what happened, wherethey had different opinions and why those differences exist. We believe there are important lessons from R.A.G.E.'s story - we hope it will inspire people to take some action, or at the very least, help othersto avoid repeating the same mistakes. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 24Although not all the R.A.G.E. women had this brachial plexus injury, the radiation damage they experienced was just as severe. Some had brittlebones, leading to fractured collarbones and ribs. These fractures wereslow to heal or never healed and sometimes ulcerated through the skin.Others experienced damage to their chest muscles causing difficultybreathing, which in some cases was fatal. Many had skin burns andrashes, and experienced swelling of the arm (lymphoedema) morefrequently than other women treated for breast cancer. They also haddigestive and circulation problems. The long-term pain and increasingdisability has in many cases led to clinical depression and other stress-related illnesses. Why was there an increase in radiation-damage at thetime the R.A.G.E. women were treated? - A brief history ofradiotherapy. Radiotherapy is extremely complex and historically it used to be muchmore of an art than a science. With hindsight, it seems that a number offactors all combined at the time the R.A.G.E. women were being treatedto result in an increase in radiation-induced injuries. These factors areoutlined below: A limited understanding of how to calculate the 'right' dose Rather than being given all in one go, radiotherapy is usually split into chunks, known as fractions. This maximises the damage to cancer cellsand minimises the damage to normal tissue. When the R.A.G.E. womenwere being treated, the biological effects of radiotherapy were thought todepend on the following factors: the total number of fractions, the size ofthe individual fractions, the intervals between the fractions (ie the numberof fractions per week), the overall treatment time and the total dose ofirradiation. Doctors used a formula that was based on this understanding,to work out what the 'right' dose should be. What this formula didn't takeinto account was the fact that different tissues vary in their sensitivity toradiation eg nerve cells are more sensitive than skin. A better formula,the linear quadratic equation, wasn't used routinely in clinical practiceuntil the end of the 1980s. Limited understanding of 'good' technique The risk of harmful effects in normal tissue can also be reduced by aiming the radiation beam from a number of different directions over the course ofthe treatment. This means that the total dose delivered to the tumour is fargreater than that delivered to any of the surrounding tissue. But whengiving the treatment from different directions, the radiologist has to becareful about areas of overlap - as these can turn into 'hotspots' that havethe potential to cause damage. It is notoriously difficult to plan the radiationtreatment of breast cancer to avoid any hotspots, because there is somuch variation in the shape of women's breasts. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 27all of these problems. The long-term effects following treatment for breast cancer are rare, and can be severe. They begin months or years after treatment, tend topersist and get worse rather than better. They include loss of use of anarm, chronic uncontrollable pain, fractured ribs, difficulty with breathing,severe burns to the skin, digestion and circulation problems (see below'What long-term damage did the R.A.G.E. women experience?'). It seemsthat during the late 70s and early 80s, at a particular group of hospitals inthe UK, the way women were treated for breast cancer resulted in anincreased incidence of this type of long-term radiation-induced damage. What radiotherapy treatment had been given to theR.A.G.E. members? The R.A.G.E. women had all been given radiotherapy treatment forbreast cancer. Although there were huge variations in their individualtreatments, typically they were given radiotherapy to their affected breastand to their armpit on the same side. Breast cancer cells can migrate through the body via the lymphatic system (part of the circulation). If caught early on, they will have onlymigrated as far as the nearest lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. At thetime when the R.A.G.E. women were being treated, if nearby lymphnodes tested positive for cancer cells, they were usually removed and thesurgical site then treated with radiotherapy. The armpit region wassometimes treated even if there wasn't any evidence of the cancerspreading - just as a precautionary measure. The goal was to kill off anypossible remaining cancer cells, and so reduce the risk of the cancercoming back. What long-term damage did the R.A.G.E. women experience? Some years after their radiotherapy, usually between 2 and 5 years later,the R.A.G.E. women started to suffer serious long-term side effects. Formany, this was due to damage to the brachial is a bundleof nerves in the region of the shoulder that supplies power and sensation tothe arm. The precise cause of the injury is unknown. It could result fromdirect damage to the nerve or could be caused by a build-up of scar tissuecompressing on the nerve. Either way, the injuries were severe andirreversible. They began as tingling and numbness in the thumb andforefinger, weakness of the hand and pain in the shoulder. Over the yearsthe symptoms got much worse. Many women eventually lost the use oftheir arm and continue to live with chronic excruciating pain.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 26The risk of injuries could not have been foreseen at the time and because of the delay in seeing any late effects, doctors only becameaware of the damage resulting from changes to the system after 1984. Changing technology New developments in radiotherapy technology resulted in machines producing more powerful beams, which pass through the skin leaving itmore or less undamaged. These also produce higher doses at theinternal site of a tumour. Two major incidents occurred in the UK between1988 and 1991 where it was discovered that patients had received thewrong dose from high-powered machines. Problems were found in theway the machines had been calibrated, which lead to an audit of allradiotherapy departments and the introduction of new professionalguidelines and regulatory standards. But these standards only related tochecking that the machines were delivering the right amount of radiation- including standards linked to inspection and testing, internal audits andtraining. They had no bearing on the question of whether the plannedradiation dose was the right one or whether the right technique was beingused. The problems with the new technology were not a factor inexplaining what happened to the R.A.G.E. women. The only difference that the new equipment made in the R.A.G.E. story was to reduce the incidence of short-term skin reactions. Because thenew beams passed through the skin more easily, they didn't cause asmuch damage on the skin surface. These effects, more commonly seenwith the older equipment, had actually proved useful, as they quicklyalerted the radiotherapists to places where there was overlap betweenfields of radiation. They could then adjust the treatment regimeaccordingly. Without these early warning signs, they were less likely to beaware of overlaps at a deeper level inside the tissue. In summary, there were very many factors that could have contributed to the injuries the R.A.G.E. women received and each case might have hada slightly different cause. These risk factors are well understood todayand are now cautiously avoided. However, it took a very long time for thisunderstanding to become public knowledge. The R.A.G.E. women initiallyfound it very difficult even to get their problems recognised, let alone togain an understanding of how and why they had been damaged. It wasn'tuntil as late as 1991 that the women even found out there were a numberof them who had been injured in the same way. When one of the women,Lady Ironside, took her doctor to court, they became aware for the firsttime that they were not alone - this was ten years after they had firstbeen injured. Lady Ironside's case Lady Ironside's case was crucial to the development of R.A.G.E. Beforethe case was publicised in the media, women with late radiation damageYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 29At the time the R.A.G.E. women had their treatment, doctors were routinely giving radiation to the breast from the front and back as well asirradiating under the arm to treat the lymph nodes. But what they weren'taware of was the fact that this combination was creating hotspots at thelevel of the brachial plexus. They may not have had any concernsanyway, because they also mistakenly believed that nerves wereresistant to radiation. Nowadays, most centres no longer routinely carryout such treatment. The lymph nodes are only treated if there seems tobe a high risk of the cancer coming back. Radiotherapy is often avoidedaltogether, particularly in cases where breast cancer is detected very early. In the years since the R.A.G.E. women were treated, new techniques have also been developed to improve the targeting of the radiation beam,including the use of ultrasound and IT. This means that it is now possibleto plan radiotherapy treatment more effectively, to only treat the site ofthe tumour and reduce the irradiation of the surrounding healthy tissue.However, these techniques are not yet being used routinely. Lack of consistent standards In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was little consistency in how radiotherapy was delivered in different departments, or even betweenconsultants in the same department. Each individual developed their ownapproach - usually based on a mixture of what they had learnt whereverthey trained and what they had observed during clinical practice. In theUK, there were two major approaches, one from The Manchester Schoolof Radiotherapy, which dominated the North of England, and another thatrelied on international protocols was used in the South of England andScotland. The variation in approach may not have been a problem initself, since most of the treatment regimes being used were probablyachieving a similar result. But problems probably did emerge whenclinicians who moved jobs started to use new and different equipment -while still relying on old and now inappropriate techniques from theirprevious departments. Lack of manpower and machines During the time the R.A.G.E. women were treated, many radiotherapy centres in the UK were also seriously troubled by an ever-increasingcaseload combined with a lack of staff and/or lack of equipment. Thiscaused them to start reducing the number of daily radiation treatmentsthey gave to each woman with breast cancer, to try to increase thenumber of people they could treat. According to the formula they wereusing, this meant increasing the size of each fraction (each chunk ofradiation) at the same time as reducing the total dose (the total sum of allthe individual chunks). But because they were using the 'wrong' formula(the improved formula, the linear quadratic equation was not in routineuse until the late 80s - see above), some doctors didn't reduce the totaldose far enough. Combined with overlap between fields of treatment, thismay have been enough to cause the increase in late radiation damage.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 28Ironside decided to sue her consultant. She was not eligible for legal aid, and therefore funded the cost of the action herself. She was advised shehad a good chance of winning. The case came to court in March 1991,and attracted a lot of press attention. However, it seemed as if the odds were stacked against her. Lady Ironside had an expert solicitor and barrister, but she couldn't afford a QCor a legal team of the size taken on by her opponents. The doctor inquestion was backed by one of the two defence bodies that coverdoctors against negligence claims, and so could afford a QC as well as ajunior barrister and a number of solicitors. Faced with mounting legal bills, Lady Ironside continued with the case for as long as she could, without risking losing everything. She says thatduring the trial: 'Twice I was rung up in the evening and threatened. I was told that if I didn't drop the case they would go on until they bankrupted me. It costme over \u00a3100,000. I couldn't risk losing the house. I withdrew on the lastday where I could get out without paying their costs, which were thenrunning at over half a million pounds. So they went laughing on their way'. When the case was dropped, the defence team accepted that Lady Ironside had suffered radiotherapy damage, and that this was 'a tragicerror'. However, they argued that this was not negligence, as the riskscould not have been foreseen. The doctor involved in the case said, 'Itwas the worst experience of my life'. He is also convinced that thetreatment he gave was the best he could have given at that time: 'At the time, the treatment we gave was considered correct. In no way was it thought to be negligent. We were trying to spare these ladies fromhaving a breast removed. At that time, thousands of other women werecured of their breast cancer and the radiotherapy had helped with that'. Lady Ironside felt the whole process had failed her. Shortly after the trial had ended, she told a reporter at The Guardian : 'I've been left with no compensation, I've lost the money I put up, and I'm worse off than before. It doesn't seem like British justice'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 31thought they were the only ones who had this problem. When they heard about Lady Ironside, it was an immense relief to find there were otherslike them. Lady Audrey Ironside was first treated for breast cancer in 1982. She underwent a lumpectomy at that time (and following further operationsunderwent a mastectomy much later in 1997). She has described whathappened with her initial treatment as follows: 'I was very fortunate, I was operated on by a specialist breast surgeon who assured me that he was very content in his mind that he had got ridof the cancer as it was at a very, very early stage, and... he said hewould like me have radiotherapy purely as an extra precaution... Theradiotherapist told me it was standard routine treatment. My husbandsaid \"Are you sure?\". \"Yes\", he said, \"Don't go round looking for trouble\".' Her radiotherapy treatment began in November 1982. She was treated as a private patient. She experienced serious side effects from theradiotherapy immediately: 'I was very badly burnt, but they told me not to make such a fuss. I had great big open weeping blisters. I thought this can't be right'. Two years later she began to have other problems.'I started dropping things. I had continuous pins and needles. I went to my GP and he said \"You must have tennis elbow\". I had cortisoneinjections, but it got worse. All this went on for nearly a year. Then adoctor friend took me off to see a neurologist and he said straight away\"You've got radiation neuritis\", which I'd never heard of. I said \"What doyou do for that?\". And he said \"There's nothing you can do\". I went backto my specialist and said, \"There's something terribly wrong with myarm\", and he said, \"Not you too\". He said, \"There's been some troublewith the radiotherapy and I was hoping you were alright\".' Lady Ironside's symptoms gradually became worse - her pain was incessant. \"In 1987 my specialist told me the only way to restore my arm was a decompression operation. He did it - that was 5 years after thetreatment. I was told later by a lot of people that that's only any good if it's done 3 years after. I think that made me worse. I've slowlydeteriorated all the time. In about 1989 my specialist announced I wasn'tgoing to get any better. Before that they'd told me that I should be patient- that the nerves would regrow\". Believing that the doctors had been negligent in their treatment, LadyYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 30stories of what we'd been told and going along for this decompression operation and not having any good from it. There was a lot of emotionthere, it was quite heavily charged'. After the meeting, the women contacted Clare Dyer. Clare was a legal correspondent at The Guardian newspaper who had reported extensively on the Ironside case and continued to follow her story. The R.A.G.E.women sought her advice about what they should do next. She advisedthem to form a pressure group - and R.A.G.E. was born. As JanMillington recalls: 'At the outset the aims of R.A.G.E. were clear and simple. We wanted an enquiry into the delivery of radiotherapy for breast cancer in order toestablish the incidence and cause of the injuries. All agreed that it wasunacceptable that a patient be left to face what could be a full lifetimewith such a poor quality of life. If there was ANY risk of injury, fullinformation should be given ahead of treatment so that the patient maygive informed consent. We wanted medical, practical and emotionalsupport for those of us already injured'. These aims were later adopted as part of R.A.G.E.'s constitution, and printed as follows on their publicity leaflet: to raise awareness of the injuries and campaign for sympathetic medical care within the NHS to campaign for national standards in radiotherapy to seek compensation commensurate with the injury to provide mutual support. We describe R.A.G.E.'s activity under each of these aims in Chapter 4 of this report. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 33The establishment of R.A.G.E. Throughout the entire time leading up to her court case, Lady Ironside believed she was the only person to have experienced such terribleinjuries. However, there were women all over the country reading thearticles in the press about her court case with surprise and recognition.Lady Ironside returned home to hundreds of letters from people who hadsuffered similar damage. Most of these women were also under theimpression that their experience was unique. Some had received no diagnosis. One of these women was Jan Millington. Jan had her breast operation in 1982 and was then prescribed a course of radiotherapy in 1983. LikeLady Ironside, Jan began to experience problems of tingling andnumbness in her arm. This started in 1985, and by 1989 she had lost theuse of her right arm and hand and was in constant pain. 'I'd already had a diagnosis of my problem in the late 1980's. I thought it was a pretty rare problem. I also thought the problem could be improved.I think by then I was told that it probably couldn't, but it wouldn't get much worse'. Like Lady Ironside, Jan Millington was told by her doctor that the effects she experienced were extremely unusual and that he didn't know anyoneelse who had them. Jan was on holiday during the Ironside trial, butfriends phoned to tell her about the reports they had seen in the press.Jan was one of the many women who wrote to Lady Ironside. LadyIronside replied, and suggested a meeting. Every woman who had beenin contact was invited, although not all were able to attend. This first meeting of what was to become R.A.G.E. took place in July 1991, at the home of Liz Gebhardt. Liz, an actress, had also experiencedradiotherapy damage. She died in August 1996, aged 51. About 18people came to this first meeting - including a man from the BBC, and awoman involved in an action against the Christie Hospital in Manchester,where a number of women had suffered terrible injuries after radiotherapytreatment for gynaecological cancer. Most of the women at the meetinghad been treated at one particular hospital. Writing about this first meeting a few years later, Jan Millington remembered: 'It was at the same time sad and exhilarating to meet others who shared such strange experiences. We were all suffering varying degrees of painand paralysis although not all had been told the cause of the problem. Notone of us had been forewarned of any risk of permanent injury. We all hadproblems coping with everyday life, cooking, cleaning, sewing, dressing'. 'We all got extremely indignant. We were all telling each other theseYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 32An important aim for R.A.G.E. was therefore to make women in general more aware of the risks of radiotherapy, so that they would be fullyinformed before consenting to treatment. The need for improved care Many of the R.A.G.E. women also faced extreme difficulties in gettingany form of treatment for their injuries at any stage of their condition. Norwere they offered any psychological support or counselling. The variousdoctors who saw them didn't appear to communicate with each other andthe treatments that they did offer proved ineffective. When the womenspoke to their doctors, whether they were GPs or cancer specialists, theyfelt fobbed off or let down. As Jan Millington describes: 'When I thought I was going to lose all use of my arm, I couldn't believe this was going to happen to me. I went for this decompression operationthat clearly didn't work, and I thought they'd pull something else out ofthe bag. And the doctor said \"I'm sorry this operation hasn't worked\", andhe got up and walked towards the door with me, and said \"I'm truly sorrythere's nothing more we can do for you - we can't see you again\".' The women were desperate for anything that could relieve their constant pain or put a stop to their decline. As Jan explains: 'I've spent so much money on alternative therapy, because you're desperate for relief. I did the lot. Different acupuncturists. Went to ahealer. Different nutrition therapies, massage, aromatherapy. And it costsevery time you go. But you hang on in there because you're soconvinced something's going to make a difference. Private pain clinics,kinesiology, cranial osteopathy, chiropractic, homeopathy. The guy whowas Princess Diana's homeopath, he did dowsing. He told me I'd got toput pills on my head. I did it. I'd have done anything. You're so desperate,you think something's got to make this stop'. There was unanimous agreement amongst R.A.G.E. members that one of their key aims should be to get better treatment and support throughthe NHS. Early campaigning One of the early steps that R.A.G.E. members took was to write to theMP, Jack Ashley, who had a reputation for campaigning for disabledpeople. They hoped he might be able to offer advice about how theymight achieve their aims. He responded positively and invited them tomeet with him in 1992 as Jan describes:Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 35Chapter 4: The R.A.G.E. story Aim 1: Raising awareness of the injuries and campaigning for sympathetic medical care within the NHS Getting their injuries recognised One of the problems faced by many R.A.G.E. members was that their injuries were not recognised by their doctors. Many women weren't givenan explanation of how their injury had occurred, or what could be done tohelp. Some were told they were the only patient their doctor had seenwith this type of damage. It was only the publicity about R.A.G.E. thathelped the women find one another and gain a better understanding ofwhat had happened. Following the media cover.a.g.e. of the Ironside trial in 1991, the R.A.G.E. women continued to raise awareness of their injuries throughtelling their stories to the newspapers. In February 1993, the Mail on Sunday published an article describing the experiences of Margaret Forrest, another early R.A.G.E. member. As a result of this article, about200 more women joined the group. Jan Millington recalls: 'In the same year, the issue of disparity in cancer treatments between the North and the South hit the news... R.A.G.E. was literally under siegeand articles appeared in the press under such headlines as CANCERVICTIMS MAY SUE and CANCER WOMEN'S RADIATION AGONY.Literally hundreds of women came forward thinking that they weresuffering similar injuries and regional newspapers were constantly ringingfor details of women prepared to give interviews. R.A.G.E. was given TVand radio coverage nationally and locally'. This press coverage meant that R.A.G.E. continued to grow - at one stage to over 1,100 members. Many of these women had experienceddamage to their brachial plexus. Others had different symptoms -including brittle bones and scars that would not heal. What they all had incommon was a deep frustration at not having been given any explanationabout their injuries and real anger at not having been forewarned of therisks of their treatment. The lack of support and information made the women's situation much worse. As highlighted by the Maher Committee (see page 36), wholooked in depth at the women's injuries 'One of the worst deficiencieswas the denial that there might be a problem, which compounded thereal anger they felt at not being warned of possible dangers ofradiotherapy treatment'. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 34The Maher Committee had its first meeting on 30 August 1994. Its terms of reference were to investigate the problems the women wereexperiencing and to produce a set of guidelines on 'best treatments'.However, one of the biggest problems the committee faced was thatthere was 'no solid research' in this area and therefore no evidence onwhich to base any guidance. No one knew how best to treat brachialplexus nerve injury or any other type of radiation damage. Nor hadanyone in the UK, including the RCR collected figures on the extent ofthe problem. One of the Committee's final recommendations wastherefore that there should be more clinical trials in this area, to help buildup the evidence base on how best to manage these types of injury. Because of the lack of research evidence, R.A.G.E. agreed to undertake a survey of their membership to find out more about their symptoms and the impact that radiation damage was having on their lives.Questionnaires were sent out to 640 women and 180 replied. In theirresponses the women described their main symptoms as beingunrelieved pain, paralysis of the hand or the whole arm, severe fibrosis,lymphoedema, respiratory problems, chronic skin conditions anddigestive problems. Sixty percent of these women had previouslyreceived a diagnosis of radiotherapy damage. The survey also asked women how their symptoms were being treated. A wide range of treatments were reported - ranging from amputation ofthe damaged arm or surgery on the nerve through to prescription ofopiates, acupuncture, massage or paracetomol. Twenty-five percent ofthe women had attended a pain clinic, and almost all of these had foundthis helpful. Only 5% of respondents had received any psychologicalsupport. Overall the results of the survey showed that what mostrespondents wanted was: (1) an expert diagnosis, (2) a more honestprognosis and (3) more effective pain control. The Maher Committee's final recommendations therefore stated that what was needed was: 'A collaborative multidisciplinary approach with honest explanation and communication with the patient, as well as all health careprofessionals involved'. The committee also concluded that 'In the absence of definitive treatment, management should be directed towards optimising symptom-control and function to maintain as good a quality of life as possible. Thisshould be combined with careful surveillance to detect and treat recurrentcancer, particularly in the first two years after presentation'. Symptommanagement was agreed to include assistance with daily living andpsychological support. Perhaps most importantly, the committee recommended that there should be one oncologist in every cancer unit/cancer centre who would act asYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 37'Instead of the usual polite, not-to-worry letter there was a phone call inviting R.A.G.E. to a meeting with him in the House of Commons. Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith (an MP who had experience with the HIVinfected haemophilia sufferers) also attended. Jack told the group toconduct a polite methodical campaign but to expect minefields. Heagreed to ask pertinent questions of the then Secretary of State forHealth, Virginia Bottomley... Jack Ashley said that it was important to gainwide publicity to discover how widespread the injuries were and wherethey were clustered in order to strengthen the campaign'. In the same year, the group gained the support of Professor Karol Sikora, a cancer specialist. R.A.G.E. approached him because he was seen tobe 'on the side of the patient' and had been involved with the BristolCancer Support Group. (This was a group of women affected by breastcancer, who had attended the Bristol Cancer Support Centre, and thenchallenged some flawed research that had been carried out to assess theimpact of the Centre.) R.A.G.E.'s early campaigning was therefore extremely successful in gaining support from MPs and the leading cancer experts. This enormousinvestment of time and energy finally resulted in a pivotal meeting on 22February 1994 between Lord Ironside and Jan Millington from R.A.G.E.,the Chief Medical Officer from the Department of Health, Chris Paine(then President of the Royal College of Radiologists - RCR) and KarolSikora. It was at this meeting that the Royal College agreed tocommission two important pieces of work - the first was to carry out anaudit of the radiotherapy treatments received by the R.A.G.E. women toinvestigate the cause of their injuries (see page 48) and the second wasto set up a committee to consider how women with radiation inducedbrachial plexus nerve injury should be managed by the NHS. BaronessCumberlege made a public announcement about the committee during adebate in the House of Lords in May 1994 in response to a questiontabled by Lord Ironside asking the government 'in what ways they expectto improve diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer and avoidhazards in radiotherapy treatment of this condition'. The Maher Committee The committee set up to investigate possible treatments for the R.A.G.E.women was chaired by Jane Maher, a consultant oncologist from MountVernon Hospital in Middlesex (who already had some experience ofworking with patient groups). It became known as the Maher Committee.R.A.G.E. was represented by Jan Millington and Margaret Forrest.Although R.A.G.E. had asked for four places, it was decided that only twowould be offered. However, Jane Maher did meet with the whole ofR.A.G.E.'s committee to listen to their views and concerns. As a result ofthis meeting, the Maher Committee recruited additional people withexpertise in areas identified as a concern for R.A.G.E. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 36them had found good people... but the report hadn't achieved what they would have liked'. Jane Maher believes there are a number of reasons for this: 'The doctors who see people with non-specific symptoms, ie GPs, knew nothing about radiation damage, so when people came with theirsymptoms the GPs didn't know what to do with them. Also, BPN was sorarely heard about once the original publicity had died down. Thespecialists, who people found helpful, didn't necessarily work with anyothers as part of a specialist group. So you couldn't form properspecialist teams. For a multi-disciplinary team to work together they haveto have some relationship and work together on a regular basis - sowithout good teams the guidelines couldn't be enforced... If a specialistmoved on a new specialist wasn't identified... So when people hadforgotten about it and it was off the agenda, you had no levers for implementation'. The Maher Committee did try on a number of occasions to get the guidelines on to the agenda of the Department of Health ClinicalOutcomes Group - a precursor to NICE. This would have encouragedclinicians to use the guidelines by making them standard NHS practice.But the Clinical Outcomes Group refused to accept them because of thelack of an evidence base. By this time the whole culture of the healthprofession had undergone a major change in favour of evidence-basedmedicine. So the fact that the guidelines were not informed by clinicaltrials reduced their credibility and gave clinicians little impetus to act on them. For the R.A.G.E. women this seemed doubly unjust. In the 70s and 80s they had received inappropriate treatment apparently because doctorswere free to base their practice purely on clinical experience, but by the1990s they were being denied any help with their medically-inducedinjuries, because doctors were now insisting on basing their practice onresearch evidence. For Jane Maher, the lessons were clear:'It's not the creation of guidelines that's important. It's the implementation that you need to focus on. You can't just create them and go away. Youhave to work at what the levers are for keeping people interested. Andyou have to engage with GPs'. Written information for radiotherapy patients One of the issues raised by the R.A.G.E. members on the MaherCommittee was the huge public demand for information about the risks ofYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 39the link person for women with radiation induced injuries, and ensure that each patient's care was co-ordinated. Looking back, Jane Maher believes that the involvement of R.A.G.E. members in the committee had a major impact on thecommittee's recommendations: 'Doctors essentially are interested in diagnosis and treatment - as are patients - but patients are also interested in management. So it changedthe whole tenor of the thing, to a much more practical approach'. Publication of the Maher Committee's guidelines The Maher Committee presented their guidelines to the Royal College of Radiologists in February 1995. It was sent to all directors of public healthat district and regional level, and to all the medical directors at NHSTrusts with a covering letter from Dr Graham Winyard, the Deputy ChiefMedical Officer, in October 1995. There was huge demand and copiessoon ran out. Jane Maher reflects: 'When the report first came out it felt as if clinicians saw it and said, \"We can go with this\". And it was what the patients wanted... I got a ton ofletters from people saying what a valuable document it was'. The College admitted it had not anticipated such high demand and wrote to the Department of Health in January 1996 to request funding for a reprint: 'The College underestimated the demand for the report when we set the print run. This demand, which comes not from our Fellows but (i) frompatients making contact with R.A.G.E. complaining of a wide variety ofsymptoms and (ii) from the various health care professionals involved inthis area, reflects the need for good quality information about theseproblems. It would be very unfortunate if the report were to go out of printwhile R.A.G.E. are still lobbying Parliament for investigations ofradiotherapy injury, as they value it highly'. In a subsequent letter to the Department of Health, the College also argued that 'the work of the Maher Committee was never properlyfunded'. The impact of the Maher Committee's guidelines Although highly valued on their release, in the longer term the Maher Committee's guidelines had very little impact. Jane Maher described howshe consulted large numbers of women with BPN about two years afterthe guidelines were published to find out whether they had noticed anydifference in their treatment. She found that: 'The women were more sympathetically handled, but that was it. Some ofYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 38mind set. And for us, we're cured, or at least we're walking about. So it's a different feeling towards you. And I don't really like going there, I don'twant to take up their time. And it brings back horrible memories... and Idon't want people to look at me and think they might end up like this'. They felt the medical profession were always letting them down, as Jan explains: 'They (doctors) might think it's their problem for a little while, but then they leave you. It's like being in a pen, like the elephant man. Everyonecomes along with cameras and notebooks, and you think perhapssomeone might say I can help you. But they come along, they walk roundand in the end they walk away. They always do'. Karol Sikora believes this is because doctors are poorly equipped to help, because there is nothing that can be done medically - 'just occupationaltherapy and physiotherapy'. However, doctors are the only professionalswith a knowledge and understanding of radiation damage. Occupationaltherapists and physiotherapists may have the appropriate skills, but havelittle awareness of how the women's problems have been caused or howthey might develop. R.A.G.E. women were rarely offered this kind ofsupport anyway. As Jan describes: 'I've never been offered any occupational therapy, gadgets for the kitchen or anything like that... I went back to the physiotherapist and she saidthere's absolutely nothing I could do to help you. And I went all the wayto X hospital for that'. The R.A.G.E. women realised that they needed a specialist clinic, one that was staffed by professionals with an understanding of their injuriesas well as all the right skills to help them manage their symptoms moreeffectively. But because late radiation damage is rare, there were simplynot enough women to justify the provision of specialist services at a locallevel. R.A.G.E. therefore lobbied for a national centre. They wanted thecentre to provide treatment on an ongoing basis, offering: 'An assessment from someone who understands the ramification of the injury, what the prognosis is... who can understand thoroughly whatexpertise you need, by the way of physio, if you can have any massage.Sometimes it's counselling, and occupational therapy... or what youshouldn't do'. Attempts to establish a specialist clinic In 1998, it seemed there might be an opportunity to establish a specialistclinic opening at Guy's & St Thomas' Cancer Centre in London. Given itscentral location, the R.A.G.E. committee members hoped their membersYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 41late radiation damage. R.A.G.E. was finding it difficult to keep up. The Committee therefore recommended that new written information forradiotherapy patients should be produced. After the work of the Committee had finished, Jane Maher, Jan Millington and others worked with CancerBACUP, Breast Cancer Care andCancerLink to produce three new leaflets about radiotherapy. This wasthe first time that the cancer charities had collaborated successfully inthis way. However, the response was again somewhat disappointing.Although the Department of Health paid for the leaflets to be producedand they were made available through voluntary organisations, there wasno systematic dissemination across the NHS. It seemed that the healthprofessionals were reluctant to give out the information, in case it worriedpeople unduly. Jane Maher recalls: 'I got Macmillan to agree that their breast care nurses would distribute the leaflets. But what I learned was that distribution of information is anincredibly value-laden thing. And whereas nurses are the gatekeepers ofinformation within a hospital, they take their lead from the doctors, and ifthe doctors don't prioritise that information, and the patients aren'tclamouring for it, it won't get given out'. R.A.G.E. members are therefore still concerned that women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer aren't being adequately informed aboutthe risks. The need for a specialist clinic As the years progressed, R.A.G.E. members became increasinglyfrustrated by what Margaret Carling, a R.A.G.E. member, described as'The disparities in care between what we aimed for in the [MaherCommittee] Guidelines and the realities of today'. She explained: 'I saw a very pleasant breast cancer surgeon who clearly had no expertise in brachial plexus nerve injury, he did not even examine myarm. He enquired about pain management but agreed with me entirelythat most medication for severe chronic pain is normally only meant forshort term acute situations and accepted that I felt I had exhausted thearmoury of pain killers'. The R.A.G.E. women came to the conclusion that cancer centres were no longer the right place for them to go. As Jan Millington describes: 'Some [R.A.G.E. members] go to pain centres, but most go to cancer clinics... But I can't see they've got the discipline... They have a differentYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 40running yet another survey. One of the problems was that however well- meaning politicians and health professionals were, they didn't provideany form of support to carry out this kind of research. Each requestrequired a mass mailout - and because almost all R.A.G.E. membersonly have the use of one arm, it is a huge undertaking both to carry outthe survey and for individuals to complete the questionnaires. Given theirprevious experience, R.A.G.E. Committee members were cynical thatanything would happen as a result of yet another piece of research. Theytherefore decided not to follow-up this course of action. In October 2003 Jan Millington wrote again to Melanie Johnson (who had taken over from Hazel Blears) requesting a meeting to explain R.A.G.E.'sconcerns. However, the Minister's reply did not take them any furtherforward: 'You were asked to write with details of the services causing concerns if you wanted the Department to follow this up. I am not aware of any suchletter... If you wish to write to me about the services that are vital to thegroup and that you find it difficult to access, I will look into this. I do notbelieve that meeting with me would take this matter further'. Jan Millington approached Jane Maher, by now the Chief Medical Officer for Macmillan Cancer Support, to ask her to explore the possibility ofestablishing a specialist clinic. In February 2003, motivated by thepromise of real action from Jane, the R.A.G.E. committee did write againto all of its members to try to assess how many of them had brachialplexus nerve injury. The results of this survey were analysed by R.A.G.E.and passed to Macmillan. In 2005 Jane Maher began discussions with R.A.G.E. members about the possibility of setting up a 'virtual' specialist clinic. Since a relativelysmall number of women experience severe radiation damage, setting upa clinic at a local or even regional level is not really practical. Jane Maheris therefore exploring the use of telemedicine to connect up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals, ranging from neurologists to benefitsadvisers, who could all contribute to a combined package of therapy.R.A.G.E. members are keen to be the first group of people with lateradiation damage to be treated by such a team. If this idea receivesfunding, pilots should begin in 2006. Research into new treatments for radiation induced injuries Given the lack of research evidence to support any particular treatmentfor women with radiation damage, R.A.G.E. members have over theyears, shown a keen interest in taking part and supporting any researchin this area. They have been instrumental in taking forward two clinicaltrials - a trial for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment and a trial ofradiotherapy for breast cancer (see page 56).Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 43would be willing and able to travel at least once to the clinic for a proper assessment. In November 1998 Dr Adrian Timothy, a consultant clinicaloncologist at the Centre wrote to Valerie Eldridge, a R.A.G.E. Committee member: 'You are correct that at St Thomas' we have a real interest in providing a 'one-stop clinic' facility for patients who have suffered late effects frombreast radiotherapy. I think we are ideally placed since we have theChronic Pain Unit... and an Orthopaedic Surgeon with a particularinterest in nerve and upper limb problems, together with a whole range of diagnostic facilities from MRI to PET scanning'. However, two years on, there had been little progress. Dr Timothy wrote again in September 2000: 'I have had some difficulty in identifying both clinicians and funding to establish the sort of clinic we had envisaged. I am rapidly coming to theconclusion that we may need to do this in some form of trial whereby anyintervention we are able to offer can be properly evaluated, and in thisway, we may be able to obtain suitable funding to put in the sessions thatwe need from the various clinicians involved'. This option was felt to be untenable by R.A.G.E. members - if the clinic was to form part of a trial, then there would presumably need to be acontrol group of women who would not be allowed to use the clinic. Andwho should be denied access to this treatment? Since all of the womenlived with damage, it was felt that all of them should be given a chance toaccess any services offered. Whilst this debate was going on, ValerieEldridge, the R.A.G.E. Committee member who had been pursuing thispossibility, became very ill and later died. The project was not progressedany further. But R.A.G.E. did not lose hope and decided to lobby again for specialist services. This included lobbying government ministers. Lady Ironside,Pam Pond, Margaret Carling, Christina Rogers and Jan Millington metwith Hazel Blears, Under Secretary of State for Health, in the spring of2003 and received a fairly positive letter after the meeting. The letter stated: 'It would appear that much of your drive for compensation has been fuelled by the problems your members have experienced in accessingNHS services which may be able to help your condition. Improvingaccess to these services is something I believe the Department cangenuinely help with. In order to proceed on this front it would be helpful ifyou could discuss with your members the types of services you havefound most beneficial and those which you have found particularly difficultto access and write to me with the details'. However at this point in time, the R.A.G.E. Committee could not faceYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 42a trial for that. And we were upset and hurt by that because we know lymphoedema is awful, but it is recognised and there is a certain amountof treatment for it. It felt that brachial plexus nerve damage had beenpushed aside again'. The HBO trial was therefore yet another frustration for the R.A.G.E. women. They had worked hard to raise the money, and were activelyinvolved in supporting it, to the extent that Joyce Pritchard was named asfirst author on the paper reporting the results. But it came to nothing. Theresearch carried out to date has only led to disappointment, as PamPond describes: 'I have tried any thing they have wanted to test... but it never seems to go anywhere. You go up there, you give up your time... it doesn't matterhow hard we have tried to help ourselves by letting them experiment onus... you feel they aren't getting anywhere... They need to come up withsomething else. They can send a rocket to the moon - but can't dosomething to make this [her arm] look nice - not even proper bandages.It may seem cosmetic - but it affects my quality of life'. Aim 2: Campaigning for national standards in radiotherapy Gathering evidence of what had happened From the beginning, the R.A.G.E. women were convinced that something had gone seriously wrong with their radiotherapy treatment, but it provedhard to find any information or evidence to support this conclusion.Initially, they carried out their own research into what had happened bysurveying their members (see page 61). This research revealed aconcentration of injuries at particular hospitals, which suggested thatfaulty procedures were involved. They also knew just from talking to eachother just how much variation there was in the treatments given towomen with breast cancer at that time. As Jan Millington describes: 'One lady and I compared notes about our treatment plans. HERS was totally different to mine. She had four fields of treatment to my three. She was treated daily, me every other day and we went to differentmachines... I asked my surgeon why the disparities in treatment? Washer disease less rampant, was the tumour a different type? Bless hisdear honest heart, my surgeon said 'The treatment would have nothing todo with her condition, more to do with the clinicians' preferences'. Heimplied that as there was no agreement on the best way to treat breastcancer, and basically it was all a bit muddled'. Lady Ironside's trial had also provided R.A.G.E. with a lot of valuableYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 45Jan Millington first heard about the potential benefits of HBO for treating nerve damage from the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Since HBO had beenused to alleviate the symptoms of nerve damage in other situations, itseemed reasonable to hope that it might help relieve the symptoms ofbrachial plexus nerve injury. Jan discussed the idea with Jane Maher,who in turn discussed it with John Yarnold, a Professor of ClinicalOncology at The Institute of Cancer Research. They began to considerthe possibility of running a trial. John Yarnold met with the R.A.G.E. Committee to start planning the work, and two members of the committee, initially Jan Millington andMargaret Forrest, agreed to join a steering group. At the instigation ofLady Ironside, Jan Millington successfully applied to the National LotteryCharities Board for a grant to support the trial. R.A.G.E. was awarded\u00a3117,620, to be administered by John Yarnold's research department. But recruitment to the trial proved difficult. In February 1997 letters were sent to 766 R.A.G.E. members, asking if they would be interested intaking part in the trial. Two hundred women responded positively.Unfortunately, only 26 of these women were considered eligible to join. Joyce Pritchard, a R.A.G.E. Committee member who took over from Jan Millington on the trial steering committee and became centrally involvedin the trial, recalls: 'Most of our people were turned down because they were too badly damaged, they'd been damaged for too long'. The trial involved women staying in Portsmouth for six weeks, but they willingly came and took part from all over the country. For R.A.G.E.members, this trial represented a possibility that something might befound to alleviate their symptoms. Jan Millington commented: 'You can only tolerate this thing with the feeling that one day it's going to end. Not by dying, but with the feeling that one day somebodysomewhere is going to find something. So you pin a heck of a lot onthese trials or whatever. To think that anyone even wants to trialsomething that could be of use... If it's likely to be of any benefit I'll give ita go... You say I'll accept the risks because you're so desperate forsomething that's going to work'. Disappointingly the trial did not show any benefits in terms of treating brachial plexus nerve injury. However, unexpectedly it did seem tosuggest that HBO might help women with lymphoedema. As Jandescribes: 'There was a great deal of excitement because one particular lady with lymphoedema appeared to have been helped, and then there was talk ofYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 44- 20 or more injuries at each of another five of the centres - 59 injuries at one of the centres- less than 10 at any of the remainder. The letter, drafted by Julie Turner and signed by Jan Millington, stated: 'You will be concerned to hear that the number of women throughout the United Kingdom who have now contacted us complaining of severeradiation injuries to their shoulders, arms, hands, lungs, chests andbreasts on the irradiated side, exceeds 1,000 and the number isincreasing daily. We write to you today with three purposes: firstly to object strenuously to any inquiry chaired or controlled by the Royal College of Radiologists;secondly to press in the strongest possible terms for a fully independentpublic inquiry and thirdly to make the strongest representations to youregarding the terms of reference and preferred procedures for that inquiry. Clearly public confidence in the provision of breast cancer treatment in the UK is shaken and only a public inquiry in which the public can havecomplete faith can address that concern'. They also requested that the terms of reference for the public enquiry include: 'The thorough review of the history and efficacy of radiotherapy both in the past and now in the treatment of breast cancer; The drafting of guidelines or further regulations to prevent the occurrence of these injuries in future; The development of a consent form designed to ensure that women about to undergo radiotherapy have full information about their disease; The provision of counselling and medical services for those already injured; The provision of adequate compensation to women who have been injured by radiotherapy treatment'. The letter also threatened that they would go to the press if they didn't receive an adequate response. Julie Turner anticipated that theDepartment might not respond, and hoped to use this to fuel theargument for litigation. R.A.G.E. wasn't entirely convinced by thisapproach. In the end, the Department of Health refused to co-operate,but no further action was taken.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 47evidence. They knew from the trial in the late 70s and early 80s, that many radiotherapy departments had developed new treatment regimesbecause of a lack of staff and equipment (see page 27). These newtechniques, which combined high doses and large fraction sizes, seemedto be responsible for greatly increasing the risk of injury. The leading cancer specialists at that time had reached similar conclusions. For example, Professor Karol Sikora wrote an article for theBMJ (published in January 1994) that said: 'There seems to be a considerable clustering of affected patients to certain hospitals and year of treatment, suggesting that technique ratherthan individual radiation sensitivity is the problem. Furthermore, there isan association with the use of high treatment doses and large fractionsizes. I believe that the culprit is overlap between fields. British radiotherapy services are overstretched. Staffing and equipment shortages are well documented. There is also good evidence of widevariation in the doses and technique used to treat many patients. Suchvariation does not make sense. Why should one hospital use 15 fractionsand another 30 to treat exactly the same disease? Either one is usingsuboptimal treatment or the other is wasting resources'. He concluded that there was a need for an urgent and comprehensive review of Britain's cancer services. In the early days, R.A.G.E. repeatedly pushed for a full investigation into precisely what had happened to them during their treatment - not only fortheir own peace of mind but also, and more importantly, to stop it fromhappening again. Lobbying for an independent enquiry was a majorfeature of their early campaigns (see page 62). Lobbying the Department of Health On 13 September 1993, acting on the advice of Julie Turner, who wastheir legal adviser at that time (see page 61), R.A.G.E. drafted a formalletter to Virginia Bottomley, then Secretary of State for Health, calling fora full public inquiry into radiotherapy for breast cancer. They knew therewere no centrally held records of the outcome of breast cancertreatments - the Royal College of Radiologists had freely admitted asmuch. R.A.G.E. therefore presented evidence of the problem in the formof data gathered from its own membership records. R.A.G.E. gave the Department of Health, on a privileged basis, a list of 525 members with their places and years of treatment. This showed thatout of the 53 radiotherapy treatment centres in the UK there were: - 10 or more injuries at each of 12 of the centresYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 46does not appear to have settled on any such criteria before embarking on its investigation. If the Royal College has decided upon such criteria,participants in the exercise should be entitled to see them so that theycan query, if necessary, the finding made in their individual cases'. As adviser to the litigants, she said she was also '...extremely concerned about the potential for damage which would inevitably be inflicted on thelitigation by a less than objective Audit Report'. By this time, R.A.G.E. was trying to separate itself from Julie Turner, who had been developing a legal case (see page 64), and the womentherefore decided to co-operate with Thelma Bates and the RCR.Although they recognised that the audit would be far from perfect, theyseized on it as an opportunity to achieve their goals at the same time asavoiding any lengthy and costly litigation. The Bates audit The scope of the audit was limited to 15 of the 51 cancer centres inEngland and Wales and to R.A.G.E. members who were treated at thesecentres during a 14-year period, 1980 to 1993. R.A.G.E. was happy withthis decision because 'They chose the hospitals that had had the mostinjuries, and they confined it to a period of time, which is what we wanted'. There were 249 R.A.G.E. members who had received treatment at these centres during the 14-year window and all were invited to take part in theaudit. R.A.G.E. had no direct role, other than sending out letters ofinvitation. Joyce Pritchard and Thelma Bates believe that some womenwere advised by Julie Turner not to take part in the audit because of thepotential threat to any future litigation. Of the 126 women who did finallyagree to co-operate, only 48 were found to have brachial plexus injuries.The remainder all had other types of radiation-induced injuries. The audit involved visiting each of the 15 cancer centres, consulting staff, inspecting equipment and viewing patients' medical records to build up adetailed picture of the treatment received by each of the 126 women. Thedata from R.A.G.E.'s own research was also considered. The work tookover a year to complete and the final report written by Thelma Bates andRGB Evans was published in December 1995. Thelma Bates was satisfied with the report at one level because:'We had a lot of co-operation from every centre, and I cannot criticise any of them. It was easier because we all tended to know each other.They gave access to all their files. There was never any cover-up in any department'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 49Agreement to carry out an audit R.A.G.E. then took matters into their own hands and sent another letter to the Department of Health. This time they wrote it themselves. It hadmuch more of an impact and resulted in a meeting on 22 February 1994between Lord Ironside and Jan Millington from R.A.G.E., the Departmentof Health and RCR officials, and Kenneth Calman, the Chief MedicalOfficer at that time. It was at this meeting that the Department agreed tofund an audit to investigate the treatments received by R.A.G.E.members with brachial plexus nerve injuries. At the same time theyagreed to set up a committee to look at how these injuries could betreated (see page 36). Thelma Bates, who had just stepped down from being Senior Vice President of the RCR, was asked to lead the audit. She believes she wasinvited to take on this role because: 'Previously I had been involved in an enquiry into radiotherapy practice, an investigation of underdosing... So I knew how to go into people'sdepartments and find out what happened without upsetting people'. The R.A.G.E. women believed she would do the job well, because 'Kenneth Calman had said he trusted her to do it'. They met with herearly on and found her very encouraging. As Jan Millington describes:'Thelma Bates said if we leave it with the lawyers it could be years. Shedid imply that there could be a global settlement - but she didn't put it in writing'. Thelma Bates' impressions from that first meeting were that 'Most of the women were in a great deal of pain and were very angry. They kept usingthe words \"Now listen\" which meant they hadn't been listened to beforethen'. She thought that the R.A.G.E. women '...were wanting tounderstand what had happened and wanting to make sure it didn'thappen again, but that throughout the whole thing there was also hopefor compensation, as an undercurrent - not upfront'. However, not everyone was convinced by the RCR's proposal. Julie Turner, in particular, was very concerned. She questioned whether theaudit could be truly independent when the RCR were effectivelyinvestigating themselves. She wrote to R.A.G.E. in October 1994 saying: 'The difficulty with the audit is that by sheer weight of numbers of the hospitals concerned, any positive conclusion on the part of the RoyalCollege of Radiologists will necessarily involve criticism of a substantialand influential number of its own members'. She also advised that '...the diagnosis of radiation-induced injury is in fact quite complex and we are devising our own sophisticated criteria fordealing with this problem. We are concerned that the Audit CommitteeYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 48radiotherapy dose and technique'. Instead they recommended that large- scale studies be carried out to identify whether high doses were reallynecessary to improve patients' survival prospects and also to establishthe optimal radiotherapy regime. But overall, the report was positive about the future, convinced that the advances in treatment, widespread use of chemotherapy and thedevelopment of specialist breast care centres, would ensure thatradiation induced nerve injuries would 'continue to become even rarer inthe future'. Thelma Bates has commented:'Even though this wasn't a scientific study - we got the most out of it we could. I think we squeezed the most juice out of that orange'. How did R.A.G.E. respond? Their views on the conduct of the audit R.A.G.E. was somewhat disappointed with the way the audit had been carried out. As Jan Millington describes, 'We weren't consulted as muchas we should have been. We did have a couple of meetings with DrBates, but she didn't examine anybody. We all thought she was going tolook at people'. Joyce Pritchard remembers that Thelma Bates 'said in the [invitation] letter... she wanted permission to speak to their GPs and bring them infor examination. She never did that'. Thelma Bates explained why in the end she decided it wasn't necessary to see the women: 'It was because of the quality of the medical records. Many women had been photographed; there were diagrams, descriptions of damage. I sawno reason to doubt what was in the records, because there was so muchradiation damage reported. Some of the women were invited to see a Consultant Neurologist for assessment, because their diagnosis was uncertain. Eight of theseeleven women gave their consent to be seen and brachial plexusdamage confirmed in four of them. Seeing a neurologist was, in myopinion, more valuable than seeing me'. As a researcher she was focusing on finding out what had caused the damage. She only wanted to identify which women had been damaged,so she could then go back and look in detail at how they had beentreated. She wasn't interested in finding out how badly the women hadYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 51But she also recognised its limitations: 'With a self-selecting group of patients... it was always going to be a limited study. We were looking backwards and not able to see everybodyand every centre. We had to look at their total care - everything that hadhappened to them - not just the radiotherapy. There were limitations onhow many people we could do this with'. The report therefore came under some criticism, mainly because the sample was heavily biased. It relied on people putting themselvesforward and only included a minority of the total R.A.G.E. membership.There were also likely to be other women with radiation damage who hadnot joined R.A.G.E. and therefore hadn't been included. Nor was anycomparison made with the women who had not been injured but hadreceived similar treatment at those centres. This would have been amonumental task as this group of women included another 65,000 breastcancer patients. In spite of these limitations, the authors were able to draw out the details of the radiation damage experienced by the 126 women who took partand were able to identify factors common to their radiotherapy treatment.Their main finding was that moving women in between treatment to thebreast and treatment to the lymph nodes greatly increased the risk ofinjury. 'High dose techniques' also increased the risk. 91% of the womenwho were moved whilst being treated with a high dose regime went on todevelop a brachial plexus nerve injury. Based on these findings, the report went on to make a number of recommendations for radiotherapy practice. These were: treatment of the lymph nodes in breast cancer patients should not be considered routine - patients should be carefully selected for thistreatment based on risk of reoccurrence patients should not be moved during treatment all cancer centres should have an agreed written protocol for breast cancer management, which is subject to audit and reviewed regularly all breast cancer patients should be looked after by a multi-disciplinary team of breast specialists with a wide knowledge of the disease health professionals need to be more aware of brachial plexus nerve injuries caused by radiation patients need acknowledgement and, when possible, an explanation of their symptoms, whether or not these are thought to be due to theircancer or its treatment. Notably, the authors said they were unable to advise on an 'optimumYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 50sent it back to X hospital. How could she [Thelma Bates], if she hadn't seen the records of my injuries, know that I had bone necrosis, nervedamage etc... I would think she took a lot of it from the forms we filled inabout our problems. But she couldn't have checked them all'. Margaret Carling also commented 'There were lots of inaccuracies. The audit didn't paint as black a picture as it should have, as it was based onthe hospital notes'. One woman in particular, Margaret King, wanted to work on developing a full and detailed critique of the audit's conclusions. She spent thefollowing year carrying out research into members' experiences withadmin support from Joyce Pritchard. Jan Millington and others felt that Margaret's work wasted precious time, 'We were railroaded into that, it went on and on and on. She said she'dspent hours and hours going through this. I couldn't see the point of it all.I couldn't get through to Margaret how much we'd put into this and whatthe intention was'. Margaret King eventually produced her own report that was made available by the RCR in 1997. But it had little or no impact. Jan believes the delay in waiting for Margaret King's report caused R.A.G.E. to lose precious momentum. They also lost opportunities toargue their case. It looked as if they weren't willing to accept what theRCR had concluded. As Jan describes: 'We didn't want too much probing. But as a result of doing that we shot ourselves in the foot. We lost time and momentum... We played right intotheir hands. We should have taken that [the Bates Report] to another bigrally, and then gone straight for it'. The wider R.A.G.E. membership also lost interest. As a result of the audit, some women had been told they didn't have radiation damage,which was difficult for them to hear. Jan concluded, 'I do think that was aretrograde step for us. I think it did dilute us. We had the momentumgoing at the time, and we should have hung onto that like grim death'. Joyce Pritchard is also dismissive of the audit. She believes 'The Bates report was done to appease us, to keep us quiet. I think they loved thatyear when nothing happened'. How did the radiotherapy profession respond? Thelma Bates believes that the audit was very effective in leading topermanent changes in radiotherapy practice as she describes:Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 53been damaged as she explains\" 'It was important for us to find out what went wrong - why did this group have this trouble... if we had lined them all up and listened to every onewe might have found more damage than we did - but what we wereinterested in was marrying the damage to what had actually happenedduring treatment. We saw a lot of damage anyway and didn't minimalise it. Some of the R.A.G.E. women could have been worried that their doctor only wrote down half of what they suffered. I could understand that - but it wouldn't have got us any more answers - it may have muddied the waters'. Jane Maher believes there were tensions over the amount of evidence that needed to be collected that compromised the audit from the start,'There were two somewhat conflicting demands on it. Firstly to get theevidence the women needed for their compensation claims and secondlyto draw out the lessons as to what might need to change in radiotherapypractice. You can't do both at the same time'. R.A.G.E.'s views on the final report R.A.G.E. members were also frustrated by the fact they weren't given an opportunity to comment on the report before it was published. They hadexpected to be able to comment in detail on a draft version, but were notshown the report until 48 hours before it was released to the press.Thelma Bates recognises that she could have 'communicated more'. Shecommented that 'R.A.G.E. is not an easy group - but that doesn't meanwe shouldn't have tried harder. I have always taught my students that adifficult patient is a worried patient and needs more of you and needsmore time. We could have given more of ourselves instead ofconcentrating on getting the report as good as we could'. In spite of their reservations, some R.A.G.E. members were still reasonably happy with the outcome. Jan Millington thought at the time,'We knew instinctively that the audit wasn't a perfect job... but we felt thatit was done in the right spirit. We thought it was enough... that it wasgoing to curtail this long costly court business. If the government hadthen said we'll do this, this and this for you, it could have all been settled'. Lady Ironside commented, 'We thought we were home and dry when the Bates report came out'. But not all R.A.G.E. members agreed. Some were still concerned that the audit relied too heavily on written medical notes, particularly as they knewtheir own notes were inaccurate or incomplete. As Joyce Pritcharddescribes, '...my consultant had taken papers out of the file before heYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 52general view was that an unusual combination of events had caused the injuries, none of which on their own would have led to damage... This isthe Swiss cheese model of accidents... if you put a knitting needlethrough all the holes in Swiss cheese, now and again it will go through allthe holes and come out the other side and that's what happens... nowand again all the holes line up - all these things happen at same timewhich leads to an accident... By the time the report came out we'd allrealised this. So there was no real interest in revisiting it'. The radiotherapy community were also facing far greater pressures caused by the continuing shortage of equipment and manpower. As KarolSikora described, 'British radiotherapy has never been great - the waitingtimes were too long. So while that was still happening, it seemed therewere far more pressing problems than a few women who got damaged20 years ago. The question was what were we going to do to benefit themajority of women with breast cancer?'. Although its impact on radiotherapy practice may not be agreed upon, as John Yarnold describes, 'That was not the only reason it was done... Itwas documenting what had happened, and why we think it happened andsaying this is something doctors have to recognise happened... It waspart of addressing what the profession had done - publicly stating that asa group this is what we have been responsible for'. Jane Maher agrees, 'It brought relief and closure. I think people had already begun to change their practice, but the Bates report confirmedwhat many people had already decided was the issue'. However she is also concerned that the 'Radiotherapy profession never fully took on the responsibility for allowing this to happen. Although it didtake on the responsibility of sorting out the subsequent problems -producing guidelines and standardising procedures, the emphasis was ondefending the profession. The audit made it look as if the Royal Collegewas responding, but they didn't really do enough'. How did the Government respond? There was also scepticism about the audit from other quarters, includingMPs. Jeremy Corbyn MP, spoke about R.A.G.E. in Parliament on 22November 1995. In his speech, he raised the following concerns: 'The Department of Health is about to publish an audit conducted by the Royal College of Radiologists on the practices of its own members, toestablish how such injuries occurred. R.A.G.E. was denied anindependent, multidisciplinary inquiry. I hope that the audit will go someway to supporting the arguments constantly made on causation and forproper compensation. There is strong support for an independent inquirythat is not dominated by the medical profession, but takes evidence fromYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 55'One criticism of the centres was the lack of a protocol - only three of the 15 centres had a written protocol. After the report, everyone had aprotocol, and improved their audit. It certainly stopped people movingpatients. It stopped people giving mini boosts here and there - it led toclinical trials... So good came out of it'. But some professionals believe that many in the radiotherapy profession were already aware of the issues raised in the report. Researchpublished by John Yarnold back in 1984 had shown that irradiating thelymph nodes was unnecessary in most cases of early breast cancer. By1995, when the Bates report came out, it was no longer routine practice. The profession were also aware of the lack of consensus regarding best treatment and the need for clinical trials in this area. Back in 1989, theRoyal College had carried out a survey of all the radiotherapy centres inthe UK, which showed that 52 different treatment schedules were beingused to treat the same hypothetical case of breast cancer. The studyconcluded that despite this variation, all the treatments were essentiallyvery similar in their outcome - 'what we are seeing in effect is differentclinicians reaching the same biological endpoint by different routes'.However, the report still concluded that there was a need for moreconsistency in radiotherapy schedules, if only to 'ensure that resources inRT departments are being effectively utilised'. Nor was the experience of the R.A.G.E. members new to radiotherapists. Lady Ironside's trial and all of R.A.G.E.'s campaigning work had alreadywoken up the health profession to the need to 'get their house in order'.As Karol Sikora describes, 'When the Ironside case fell through in 1991,everyone got more careful. It woke everyone up to the problem.Everyone started recognising it and a lot was written about it. This madepeople review their technique'. R.A.G.E.'s exposure in the press in the early years had also prompted Stanley Dische, a nationally respected oncologist, to write a paper inClinical Oncology in 1993, which said 'Clinical oncologists in the UnitedKingdom must have been considerably embarrassed by the recentdiscussions in newspapers and on television concerning post-radiationmorbidity and the influence of fractionation. Particularly discomfortingmust be the confession by a number of eminent oncologists to theinsecurity of our knowledge concerning the optimum fractionation ofradiotherapy'. He went on to describe what was known about theoptimum radiotherapy treatment and advised his peers to become more'...familiar with the data and the evidence to support their practice inradiotherapy'. So by the time the Bates Report was published at the end of 1995, much of the radiotherapy profession believed they had already moved on. AsKarol Sikora commented 'The report didn't have much of an impactbecause it seemed as if women weren't getting injured anymore... TheYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 54The idea of using large fraction sizes was of great concern to R.A.G.E. members, because larger doses were believed to be responsible for theirinjuries. John Yarnold therefore agreed to meet with R.A.G.E. to discussthis issue. The R.A.G.E. Committee concluded that it was unwilling tobecome involved in supporting the clinical trial as Jan Millingtondescribes: 'As a group we felt it unprincipled and untimely to add support to a clinician's research which was going to cost vast amounts of money. Itwould have meant 'rubbing salt in the wounds' of our severely affectedmembers, for whom as yet, NO money could be spared. We felt thatfighting the huge battle to have our members' needs met had to be ourpriority and it absorbed all our scant resources'. However, two of the women, Joyce Pritchard and Margaret King, were personally very interested in the trial and subsequently became involvedin developing the trial protocol (the plan for the trial), though not asofficial representatives of R.A.G.E. These two women proved to be key togetting the trial funded as John Yarnold describes, 'I first submitted an application for funding of the trial in 1996 or 97, but because of the concern about adverse comments from R.A.G.E., the RoyalCollege of Radiologists who had been formally supporting the trial felt theyneeded to withdraw their support - they were afraid of the publicity. Over the next 2-3 years I developed the protocol with Joyce and Margaret's input and when I then submitted another application to theMedical Research Council, it was the letter of support from those twowomen that was very important to everybody - not only to me personallyand the research team but also the funding agencies - with this apparentsupport from patients they had no reason not to fund it. Joyce and Margaret saved that whole initiative. Then everyone else jumped into line - including the College. It was very much down to Joyce(Mrs Pritchard) - she was persuaded by the arguments - and eventhough the other R.A.G.E. Committee members were not convinced - herview was heard'. Before the START Trial actually began, John Yarnold approached R.A.G.E. again to ask if they would join the Management Committeeoverseeing the trial. But there were still some concerns, as JoycePritchard describes, 'The answer from the R.A.G.E. Committee was no.They felt that he was going to use protocols that some of the committeemembers who were badly damaged had had themselves'. Jan Millington explains 'We weren't too sure about the START Trial. We thought it was in many ways a backward step, because it was usingfractions that we were worried about'. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 57its members - in the way that a select Committee does'. However, neither the Bates report nor this support from MPs, helped R.A.G.E. further their claim for compensation (see page 65). The only comment the Government has made in subsequent years is that it recognises the contribution R.A.G.E. has made to raising radiotherapystandards. In a letter to R.A.G.E. on 8 April 2003, Hazel Blears, thenUnder Secretary of State for Health, commented: 'The work undertaken by R.A.G.E. has highlighted the need... for further research on fractionation schedules and the need for standards relatingboth to radiotherapy and to the provision of supportive care. I am pleasedto say that progress has been made in each of these areas'. The START Trial The national Standardisation of Adjuvant Radiotherapy (START) Trial waslaunched in January 1999 with the aim of identifying the optimumradiotherapy treatment for breast cancer - both in terms of reducing therisk of the cancer coming back and minimising the damage to normaltissue. The results of the trial have not yet been reported (the trial wasexpected to last ten years), but it has already had an enormous impacton breast cancer care in terms of standardising radiotherapy treatment inthe NHS. Professor John Yarnold was the researcher who developed the idea for the trial and has been running it ever since. He described how the trialcame about 'The main scientific reason to do the START Trial came froma pilot study. The pilot study involved 1400 patients and started in 1986.The pilot study confirmed the results from another piece of publishedresearch - together they suggested that breast cancer is more sensitiveto fraction size than other cancers. That was just amazing. Because ithas always been assumed that what really matters to a cancer is the totaldose of radiation, so that it doesn't matter if it's in a few big doses or lotsof little ones... but breast cancer is different. It is more sensitive tofraction size - which means if you give lots of small doses, you mayspare the cancer and increase the risk it will come back'. Professor Yarnold was therefore concerned that the standard radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer was not as effective ateliminating the cancer as people thought - because the size of theindividual chunks or fractions was too small. He thought larger dosesmight be more effective, but that this needed to be tested in a robustclinical trial. As a scientist, he was also interested in finding out whatunderlying biology might be responsible for these differences betweencancers, and if this might lead to a way of testing people to see if theirtumour was more likely to respond to small or large fraction sizes.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 56Aim 3: To seek compensation commensurate with the injury The case for compensation The lives of all of the R.A.G.E. women were profoundly affected by their radiation-induced injuries. Many had to give up their jobs because theywere unable to use their arm, or because their brittle bones made themtoo fragile, or they were simply in too much pain. This meant that somewomen lost their homes. Many suffered a reduced income andconsequently were unable to save for a pension. Lorna Patch, who joinedR.A.G.E. soon after its inception, describes how her life changedfollowing radiotherapy for breast cancer: 'The radiotherapy happened to me in 1985. I began having problems in 1986. I had to give up my job then. I haven't had a penny in income sincethen, except old age pension... Having lost my job, I lost my house'. David Bainbridge describes the situation for his wife, treated in 1998:'Brenda had a job, she was a deputy headmistress. She lost her job seven years ago and with it her entire income. She has a small pension,but not a lot because she had to retire early. We could have lost ourhouse. She could have found better, less damaging treatment elsewhereif she had known'. Pam Pond, another R.A.G.E. member, also experienced huge changes in her life following radiotherapy: 'I had a complete life change. I had to give up my lovely job, my 4-bedroom house and bought a mobile home. But because of problemswith my chest I had to move again. I was living in an area where theysprayed crops. When I went to the doctor, she said you can't live upthere, it's making your chest worse. So now I am renting a much smaller house'. Many R.A.G.E. members also spend money on complementary therapies, such as massage and acupuncture, which they feel necessaryto give temporary relief for some of their symptoms. They also have tobuy special clothing, either because of their mastectomies or becausetheir arms are swollen by lymphoedema, and have extra costs becausethey have lost the use of their arms. As Pam Pond describes: 'If you get your hair done, its \u00a310. The little money you have goes quickly. But if you've only got use of one arm, you can't do your hair. Little thingslike that mean such a lot. They really affect your quality of life... Clothesare a problem - to find things with big sleeves... there was someone whomade special clothes - but they weren't good quality and wereYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 59A compromise was reached with Joyce Pritchard and Margaret King joining the Management Committee, purely as observers. However, JoycePritchard believes they have had more of a positive impact throughinfluencing the design of the trial. She describes how 'Margaret told themone of the dosages they were using was wrong. And they amended it, andMargaret was quite content about it. It was giving a 3rd dose from theback'. John Yarnold has commented that they became 'a really positiveforce' which he has certainly benefited from. Some R.A.G.E. members are still fairly negative about the trial. They are concerned that the real interest may not be about finding the most effectivetreatment regime to treat breast cancer, but rather finding the mosteconomical way to deliver radiotherapy. Jan Millington believes, 'Everybodyknows what's a safe and effective dose, but nobody wants to settle for that.They just tinker away with this. If there's a good standard, why not stick to it'. David Bainbridge, a R.A.G.E. member whose wife experienced late radiation damage in 1998, has also commented, 'The START Trial isdesigned to show that high doses can be used safely. This would allowpeople to be treated in half the time. The motivation is not clinicaleffectiveness - but economic and political. ...Economic because of theextreme shortage of staff, machines and funding - even now in 2006 andpolitical because they won't tell politicians they can't cope withoutincreasing the dose rate given to breast cancer patients. I would be moreconvinced by the results of the START Trial if they were actually examiningpatients, in detail, using scanning processes for all of the areas of damagewithin the treated volume. Particularly the muscles, ribs, lung and heart'. In contrast, from the professional's point of view the START Trial has been of major significance. As Jane Maher describes, 'The START trial placedrigorous quality assurance demands on centres before they were allowedto take part. Very many centres across the UK took part - it was one of thehighest recruiting trials ever. The quality standards for the START Trial thuseffectively became the quality standards for radiotherapy in the UK. This ishow R.A.G.E.'s experience led to a harmonisation of standards'. John Yarnold explains how this standardisation was carried out, 'We got half a million pounds from the Department of Health to appoint threeexperts full-time to do quality assurance. We built a dummy body withproperties similar to people - but full of dosimeters and films to measureexactly what dose is being given. We spent the first year driving roundradiotherapy centres. Before centres could start work on the trial, they hadto show, using the dummy, that they were achieving the right doses. We'vealso been monitoring a subset of patients during the trial to check theywere maintaining the standard. In this way the trial has effectivelystandardised UK practice... If Joyce and Margaret hadn't supportedSTART, then these improvements across centres wouldn't have happened'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 58you've lost your job. You lose pretty much everything if you've lost your right arm... We didn't want \u00a3400,000... it wasn't realistic. It was a fewthousand pounds, whatever the figure is for industrial injury. That's allmost people would have been happy with'. There was a widely held feeling amongst the group that a claim for compensation should be high on their list of priorities. In the first fewyears, this involved three different areas of intense activity - developing alegal case, campaigning for a public inquiry and lobbying MPs. Therewas some confusion and disagreement as to which of these activitiesshould become a priority, so initially they were all taken forward in parallel. Developing the legal case Not long after R.A.G.E. got started, one of the women brought along asolicitor from the firm Russell, Jones and Walker (RJW) to a R.A.G.E.meeting. This solicitor was Julie Turner. She became R.A.G.E.'s legaladviser at that time, and was to have an enormous influence on the restof R.A.G.E.'s history. At the beginning of 1993, Julie Turner advised R.A.G.E. to gather statistics on the women's injuries as evidence to support their case.Every R.A.G.E. member was sent a questionnaire - the first of many. Andevery woman who contacted R.A.G.E. during that time was asked to takepart in the survey and to help with the costs of collecting this information.The initial data confirmed what the women had long suspected - theirinjuries were clustered around certain hospitals over a specific period intime - at that time 23% of R.A.G.E. members had been treated at oneparticular hospital. Over the next few meetings, Julie Turner explained how she thought she could help R.A.G.E. members win compensation for their injuries throughlegal means. She was very persuasive. The women even agreed tocontribute \u00a3200-300 each to a 'fighting fund' to help research their case. Julie Turner sent a letter to everyone who completed the R.A.G.E. questionnaire. It was very encouraging, leading the women to believethey had a strong case. She told them that a QC had advised there weregood grounds for seeking legal aid for a group action. She also said theywould be able to seek compensation for all types of radiation damage -not just the brachial plexus nerve injuries. She also began to put thepressure on R.A.G.E. members. She warned that legally claims had to bemade within 3 years of a woman realising her injuries were due toradiation so that 'if you have any intention of seeking legal redress foryour injuries, it is most important that you seek legal advice NOW'. Jan Millington felt Julie was helping enormously at the time, 'Julie reallyYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 61expensive... but you want to keep your arm covered - so people don't ask about it'. In March 1995 when Lady Ironside and Jan Millington presented evidence on behalf of R.A.G.E. to the Health Select Committee (whichwas investigating breast cancer treatment in the UK), they gave a veryclear summary of the reasons that they felt compensation was justified.These were stated as follows: (a) As a result of injury, entitlements to statutory benefits and state pensions have been eroded (b) As the type of injury is not recognised by the Department of Social Security and the consequences are far-reaching for R.A.G.E.members who are suffering a much reduced quality of life, through nofault of their own, R.A.G.E. believes that statutory benefits cannot beregarded as the sole remedy for the state they find themselves in.Also Disability Allowances are discretionary and may becomeregionally dependent. They also presented a list of factors they felt should be taken into account when considering their case. These were: (a) Women have been forced to give up work and have therefore lost earning power and had to forego pension contributions (b) They have had to pay for very expensive mechanical aids in their homes, such as stairlifts and other devices (c) They have had to employ domestic help, odd-job men and garden help (d) They have had to give up driving and have had to pay for taxis and other forms of transport, thus curtailing their ability to travelfreely and move about (e) They have had to attend clinics regularly, some of which are difficult to reach (f) They have had to forego leisure pursuits. What were the R.A.G.E. women hoping for? Most of the R.A.G.E. members were not seeking huge sums of money. Like many people who feel they have been harmed in some way as aresult of medical treatment, they wanted an apology and an appropriatelevel of compensation. As Jan Millington describes: 'All I wanted was for this to be settled, for someone to say \"Don't worry about this, we'll look after you\", to say \"This is awful. But here's somemoney - invest it so you can get some help in the house\". BecauseYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 60wanted to be certain that what had happened to them would not happen to anyone else. They were aware that a public enquiry had the potentialto achieve much more than a court case. As David Body and JonathanGlasson (a solicitor and barrister who were involved in litigation related toHuman Growth Hormone and CJD) have described: 'Litigation has a restricted palate of remedies to offer to Claimants, of which damages are the most obvious. If damages are the only remedysought, then a multiparty action is the most obvious means of redress; if there is a broader agenda of resolution then litigation can only ever beof partial satisfaction. The fact that public inquiries follow a broader remitthan litigation is more reassuring to those who say that the events beingenquired into \"must not happen again\". Since the recommendationsmade by a public inquiry are susceptible to political implementation, the breadth of potential redress is much wider'. Therefore with the aim of calling for a full public inquiry into radiotherapy for breast cancer (see page 46), R.A.G.E. signed a formal letter that JulieTurner had drafted and sent it to Virginia Bottomley, then Secretary ofState for Health. The Department of Health did not respond. Lobbying MPs A small sub-group of the R.A.G.E. Committee focused their attentionlobbying MPs, the House of Lords and government ministers as a meansof seeking compensation. Lorna Patch was a key member of this sub-group, along with Valerie Eldridge and Margaret Carling. Margaret's view,which was shared by many of the R.A.G.E. Committee, was that thewomen had a strong moral case, rather than a legal one - and that thisshould be a focus of R.A.G.E.'s lobbying. They began with a successfulparliamentary lobby in 1993. This was undertaken in partnership withNorthern R.A.G.E. (which later re-named itself COUR.A.G.E.), a group ofwomen who had suffered late radiation damage following treatment forgynaecological cancer. Tensions increase At the same time as work on the legal case and government lobbyingwas moving forward, Professor Karol Sikora was working with anothersub-group of the women to push for a Department of Health sponsoredinvestigation. Towards the end of 1993, they were close to agreeing withthe RCR that they should carry out an audit of the women's injuries (seepage 48). However, this was causing ever increasing tensions betweenR.A.G.E. and Julie Turner. Things reached a head when RJW refused toshare the results of their early survey of the R.A.G.E. members withanyone else, and in particular the RCR. They strongly warned R.A.G.E.against working with any organisation likely to be a defendant in a legalYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 63revved up our campaign. I can't blame her for doing that as she got an awful lot of publicity for us and brought in a lot of new members... weasked all of them for a contribution to the fighting fund because wetrusted her at that time'. The first rally Julie Turner's activity certainly helped the early campaigns. It was Juliewho enlisted the support of Lynn Faulds Wood, a TV presenter, whohelped the group organise a big rally at the London School of Economicsin September 1993. Lady Ironside and Professor Karol Sikora spoke atthe rally, which was attended by over 500 people. Many of the womenhad travelled some distance, some in great pain, to attend the event. AsJan Millington describes: 'It was heady stuff, almost exhilarating to have gone from being of absolutely no consequence to such dizzy acclaim'. The rally led to even more publicity. R.A.G.E. was featured on a number of television programmes, including The Time and Place and The Big Story . These in turn brought many more members. The media were asking various cancer experts for their opinions. Many expressedsurprise at the severity and frequency of injuries, and publicly stated theirsupport for the R.A.G.E. women. For example, on a Panorama programme about radiotherapy, Dr David Skeggs, a consultantradiotherapist, commented: 'I feel that somebody in the medical establishment has got to stand up and speak for them. If you realise an injustice has been done to a patientyou are morally bound to stand up and support them. It should neverhave happened in the first place'. Campaigning for a public enquiry Unfortunately, Julie Turner's activities soon began to cause greattensions within R.A.G.E. Some members were not at all interested inpursuing the litigation. They were more in favour of pushing for aDepartment of Health investigation - either through a public enquiry oranother type of investigation that might lead to compensation being paid.As Margaret Carling said at the time: 'Access to the Courts is for most of us, out of the question. We have lost health and livelihood. We cannot afford to put our homes at risk byembarking on the lottery of litigation'. R.A.G.E. members also wanted more than financial compensation - theyYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 62great deal of choice about who they turn to for any kind of support and had R.A.G.E. heeded this advice and not behaved pro-actively, it is likelythat the injured women would still be without any acknowledgement'. Seeking compensation by lobbying Government Having effectively divorced itself from the legal case, R.A.G.E. nowfocused all of its efforts on seeking compensation by other means.However, they were always overshadowed by the legal action. The R.A.G.E. parliamentary sub-committee encouraged the membership to write to their MPs, to ask for their support. Lorna Patch, who led thework of this sub-committee, went to see any MP who agreed to help,accompanied by other R.A.G.E. members. From 1993 onwards there wasa great deal of activity, as Lorna remembers: 'About one in 10 MPs responded when we wrote to them. I would then telephone. It isn't just one phone call, it can be as many as five. Thenyou have to set up an appointment, then it's cancelled - not his fault, he'scalled away. Then he'd give you a meeting on the one day you couldn'tgo. It was a very very hard slog'. Margaret Carling compiled a detailed report on what had happened to R.A.G.E. members. A copy of her report was given to all MPs whoexpressed an interest as part of an 'information pack' on R.A.G.E. Herreport stated: 'The R.A.G.E. case is quite simple. We are the innocent victims of medical procedures - often unnecessary and sometimes experimental.We could do nothing to prevent our injuries. We trusted the medicalprofessional and our trust was betrayed. As a result we are left disabled,in excruciating pain, unable to work, pursue hobbies, to care forourselves or our families. As Lady Ironside has commented, \"Before our purely precautionary treatment, we had two good arms. As a result of that precautionary treatment we now have one\". Nothing can restore our lost health but as our injuries have been caused by errors and sometimes experimentation in the medical procedures towhich we were subjected without our consent, there is a MORALobligation on the government to make an ex-gratia payment as a partialcompensation for our loss. Payment to us would not set a precedent. Our claim for compensation is unique in that the risks of treatment, though known, were not disclosed tous. Nor was the treatment necessary to preserve life'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 65case. In a letter to Jan Millington on 10 Nov 1993, Julie wrote: 'I understand that the idea has been mooted... that R.A.G.E. apply for a Government grant in order to undertake and complete a survey ofR.A.G.E. membership, which will be handed to the Royal College ofRadiologists... from the perspective of the legal cases of R.A.G.E.members this would be extremely dangerous. As long as the Defendantsare unaware of the extent of the information we have obtained, it is a'Sword of Damocles' hanging over the health authorities' heads and it islikely to encourage an early settlement... ...It is most important to remember R.A.G.E.'s days \"in the wilderness\" when no-one from the Royal College, the Government or establishedcancer charities would give R.A.G.E. the time of day. It was only whenlitigation on a large scale was mooted that these bodies becameinterested and it would be sensible to view their current offers with adegree of scepticism and a great deal of consultation with the R.A.G.E.membership as a whole and your legal advisers'. R.A.G.E. was in a very difficult position. There wasn't strong support for pursuing the litigation - but they also felt that they had no choice. Theywere told repeatedly by government officials that the only way they wouldever get compensation was by going through the courts (see below). R.A.G.E. separates itself from the legal action By December 1993, R.A.G.E. was in a state of great conflict. Manymembers wanted to co-operate with the government and the RCR. At thesame time, the litigation seemed to be discouraging people from joiningR.A.G.E. Jan Millington was severely criticised for working with RJW. Shewas so distressed that she even considered stepping down from her roleas R.A.G.E. co-ordinator. Julie Turner did resign as legal adviser toR.A.G.E. In a letter to R.A.G.E. in January 1994, she wrote: 'There has been a breakdown in the essential relationship of trust that must exist between solicitor and client, and in these circumstances, it isappropriate that I should now tender my resignation as legal adviser'. However, she continued to act as the solicitor in the court case, taking it forward independently of R.A.G.E. R.A.G.E. now began to see its interests as diverging from those of the radiotherapy litigants. They did not respond to RJW's advice andcontinued to work with other organisations. With hindsight, they're stillglad they made this decision. As Jan Millington says: 'Cancer patients, especially those with radiation damage, do not have aYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 64spoke, as did Liz Lynne, Wardle. Baroness Cumberlege, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forHealth, attended the lobby to respond to the question R.A.G.E. had posed: 'Will the Secretary of State for Health consider the award of compensation to those women suffering permanent, progressive anddisabling injury after radiotherapy for breast cancer?' All the speakers, except for Baroness Cumberlege called for compensation to be paid to R.A.G.E. members. Yet again, the responsefrom the government was negative. Early Day Motions in Parliament MPs continued to raise the case for compensation through Early Day Motions (EDMs). In 2001, Edward Davey, Liberal Democrat MP putforward an EDM that stated: 'This House believes there is a moral obligation for the government to provide an ex gratia payment for women who have been injured by theirradiotherapy treatment; recognises that in the past women were notwarned of the dangerous risks before their radiotherapy treatments, werenot given counselling after them and that the treatment was administeredwithout informed consent being sought or given; understandsradiotherapy injuries can include painful, uncontrollable and permanentinjuries such as the paralysis of an arm or spontaneous bone fractures;notes that no compensation has been paid since EDM 512(COUR.A.G.E. campaign for patients with radiotherapy damage) wastabled in December 1997; asks the Secretary of State for Health toempower the Health Service Commissioner to recommend the award ofex gratia payments in appropriate circumstances, as proposed by theHealth Select Committee in 1999; and urges the Department of Health tolook again at the provision of an arbitration system to provide no-faultcompensation for exceptional cases where the NHS is responsible fornon-negligent harm'. The impetus for this EDM was that haemophiliacs who received blood transfusions infected by the hepatitis C virus had won their case forcompensation in court - and the government had chosen not to appeal.The R.A.G.E. women - and many of their supporters - felt that therewere a number of similarities between these two groups. However,nothing happened as a result of this EDM, and R.A.G.E. felt that EdwardDavey lost interest after he had tabled the Motion. Lobbying of ministers continued Alongside the work to lobby MPs and House of Lords members, R.A.G.E.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 67This campaigning proved very successful. At one point, over 100 MPs were publicly supporting R.A.G.E.'s claim for compensation. One of the MPs who offered support was Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP for Islington North (although support for R.A.G.E. cut across politicalparty lines). He raised the need for compensation for R.A.G.E. membersduring a House of Commons debate in November 1995: 'All the work of R.A.G.E. has been done by women in constant and dreadful nerve pain, whose personal and professional lives have beenshattered. Some members of R.A.G.E. have had their limbs amputatedand almost all have been left with only one usable arm. For the rest oftheir lives, in addition to being under the cloud of the possible recurrenceof cancer, they will become progressively disabled... The government should give urgent consideration to what is happening to those women and to giving them the compensation that they sodesperately need and deserve. The government's present position is that victims must seek compensation through the courts... That is unacceptable, because onemust be very rich to pursue compensation that way. It costs around\u00a3200,000 to mount an effective case to prove medical negligence in theHigh Court, which is totally beyond the means of almost everyone in thiscountry. It would certainly be beyond the means of an individual who hassuffered as a result of breast cancer, lost her income and, moreimportantly, forgone any prospect of future income... The Governmentmust instead produce a compensation package... The least we can do isto ensure that women who have suffered so grievously in the pastreceive proper compensation, ensure that such suffering does not recurand try to conquer that awful illness\". Mr Corbyn, along with a number of others MPs including Charles Wardle and Alice Mahon, continued to raise questions in the House of Commonson behalf of R.A.G.E. But each time, they were told that compensationwould not be paid by government: 'The government's policy is clear: that compensation will be paid when negligence is established in court. That, we believe, is the right way inwhich to protect patients, and to safeguard the precious resources of theNational Health Service for patient care'. The second parliamentary lobby R.A.G.E. organised a second lobby of parliament in December 1996. Thiswas chaired by Lynn Faulds-Wood. Lady Ironside welcomed everyone toa full lobby room. Karol Sikora and Skeggs (both oncologists)Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 66And in October 2003 Melanie Johnson, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health wrote to Jan Millington: 'Compensation for injury or damages as a result of clinical negligence can only be obtained through the civil justice system, where legal liabilitymust be established and where it is necessary to prove fault on the partof the defendant. R.A.G.E. made such a case and I understand thatgiven the state of knowledge and techniques used at the time that there was no evidence of negligence on which to base a claim for compensation'. What were the barriers to R.A.G.E.'s campaign for compensation? One of the problems for the R.A.G.E. women involved in lobbyinggovernment was that every time they seemed to make progress with aminister at junior or senior level, there was a re-shuffle and the processhad to start all over again. Lady Ironside comments: 'We were so near victory so many times, when the minister says, this is disgraceful. Then two or three days later you pick up the paper andthey've been moved. Very convenient... Every time a minister saidsomething must be done, they were moved'. There was also a change of government during the campaign. Originally when the Labour Party came into power in 1997, R.A.G.E. memberswere optimistic that progress might be made, as many Labour MPs hadexpressed support for them whilst in opposition. But this changed oncethey were in government. For example, Tessa Jowell (at that time an opposition MP) met with R.A.G.E. members in April 1996 and was 'plainly prepared to help'. Butas Minister for Public Health she announced in the House of Commonsthat compensation would not be offered unless negligence could beestablished in court - and rebuked the MP who raised the issue. HazelBlears was very active in the EDM that sought compensation forC.O.U.R.A.G.E. (see page 63). But when she became Under Secretaryof State for Health, whilst remaining sympathetic to the women's plight,she refused to consider compensation. Whichever party was in government it seemed that the overriding concern was that a payment to R.A.G.E. members would set aprecedent. For example, Lord Hunt, Under Secretary of State for Healthwrote to Valerie Eldridge in October 1999: 'I hope you will appreciate that our position has to remain the same in that we can only compensate patients where there has been negligence.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 69continually lobbied government ministers. The R.A.G.E. Committee and other R.A.G.E. members wrote to a succession of Secretaries of State forHealth asking for help and compensation. MPs also wrote on behalf oftheir constituents who were R.A.G.E. members. But it came to nothing,and R.A.G.E. simply felt they were fobbed off. As Jan Millington reflects: 'Once you get into the Department, they write these letters saying we have every sympathy, but how are they showing that sympathy? It's justwords, they're not doing anything. They're quite prepared to spend allthat money sending off all those reams and reams of letters rather thansorting it out'. The answer from ministers was always the same, typified by this letter written by Lord Hunt, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State on 25October 1999 to Valerie Eldridge, a R.A.G.E. Committee member: 'We fully acknowledge and sympathise with the women who have suffered severely as a consequence of the radiotherapy treatment theyreceived for breast cancer. However, the government's position has beenconsistent that compensation should be payable only if negligence canbe shown'. The other commonly offered response was that there was provision for individual NHS Trusts to make one-off payments. Baroness Jay, Ministerof State, wrote to Lorna Patch, R.A.G.E. Committee member in January 1998: 'With regard to ex gratia payment, NHS bodies already have the authority to consider whether such a payment should be offered in individualcases. Decisions to do so for those suffering adverse effects frommedical treatment are a matter for the individual Trust, after carefulappraisal of the facts. However, I should point out that it is unlikely an ex-gratia payment would be made whilst legal action is pending'. The R.A.G.E. women felt trapped - as a committee, they had disassociated themselves from the legal action - but the legal action wasgoing ahead anyway. Even more frustratingly, it was still being seen asR.A.G.E.'s action by the Department of Health - and the Department wasusing the court case as a reason not to consider compensation throughany other means. Once the legal battle had been lost (see page 78), the government then argued that the trial had demonstrated that R.A.G.E. had no case forcompensation. For example, in 1999 Lord Hunt of King's Heath, thenParliamentary Under Secretary of State wrote to Lord Ironside: 'The NHSLA 1is not able to settle any case where evidence of negligence cannot be shown and so no compensation is payable'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 68'The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) was set up in 1995 to handle negligence claims made against NHS bodies in England.What could R.A.G.E. have done differently? With hindsight, some R.A.G.E. members wonder if they were simply too nice, and that this meant that their claims could be ignored. They felt theycould have been more aggressive, and put the Department of Healthunder more pressure. Other members felt that they should have pushed for more public sympathy, and gained more public support this way. As Margaret Carling describes: 'It's not strictly comparable, but the war widows got money because they got sympathy . The suffering of R.A.G.E. women over the years should have generated sympathy'. Although the work to gain compensation has not yet succeeded in accessing any financial support for R.A.G.E. members, many of theR.A.G.E. Committee do not see it as a failure. Margaret Carling alsocommented, 'This area of work wasn't a failure. The compensation claimwas a means of hanging on to all of our other aims... It wasn't a waste oftime because it raised the level of awareness'. The court case In the early years, the R.A.G.E. women felt they had little choice otherthan to pursue a legal case for compensation (see page 67). As JanMillington describes: 'We had no cause at the beginning not to support the legal route, we had a very, very reputable firm... and the Government said the same, theysaid the same all along, they said medical negligence has to be proved incourt'. They were also hugely influenced by Julie Turner. The R.A.G.E. women had no reason to doubt her. She came from a well-respected firmrecognised by the authorities as a specialist in medical litigation. JulieTurner was personally very motivated by the case, and her enthusiasmdid much to persuade some of the R.A.G.E. members. Getting legal aid to fund the case At the beginning, Julie Turner told the women she would aim to win 'out of court settlements' in just one or two 'good' cases. By the time, RJWapplied for legal aid in January 1994, this plan had changed. Based onthe advice of the very eminent QC, Dan Brennan, they were nowproposing to proceed with a group action with over 130 women. As IanWalker from RJW describes:Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 71We cannot pay for events during the evolution of medicine when treatments were not as well understood as now. Unfortunately, R.A.G.E.is not the only group of patients who have suffered non-negligent harmand the potential implications of no-fault compensation for the provisionof NHS services today are immense'. R.A.G.E. members were also challenged by the fact that their injuries had made them sick and disabled. As Jan Millington describes: 'When I saw my MP, Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, he said it's a minefield, you've just got to stick at it. You've got to keep going back. But as an illperson, you don't always feel up to that. And you just think you'll settle forthe rest of your life. Because that's how it makes you feel, as if as anindividual you're worthless.' Efforts to gain other types of financial support The R.A.G.E. Committee tried other ways to access financial support forR.A.G.E. members. In 1999 Jan Millington approached Macmillan CancerSupport, to see whether the charity could offer any help to R.A.G.E.members. Macmillan replied: 'Macmillan recognises that those individuals who have experienced disablement and other health problems associated with radiation damageare a special case. It has therefore been agreed that individuals with aspecific diagnosis of Brachial Plexopathy or Radiation Enteritis, may beconsidered eligible for the whole range of Macmillan grants. Eligibilitywould of course still be dependent upon meeting our usual financialcriteria. We are not able to award ongoing help or assist with treatmentcosts, education or training courses, special diets or supplements, dailyliving expenses, telephone bills or items of major expenditure such asstructural alterations'. Macmillan therefore ruled out offering help in precisely the areas where R.A.G.E. women most needed assistance - complementary therapy anddaily living expenses. And the requirement for R.A.G.E. women to meet'the usual financial criteria' presented them with yet another hoop to jumpthrough. But this they did and some members successfully applied for grants. R.A.G.E. Committee members have also worked hard to help members obtain (and retain) welfare benefits. For example, their understandingfrom the then Chief Medical Officer, Kenneth Calman, was that those withbrachial plexus injury should receive Disability Living Allowance.However, over the years R.A.G.E. members have had these benefitswithdrawn, and have had to repeatedly challenge this action. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 70Some people have commented that the decision to go with a group action effectively diluted the women's case. Initially the focus wasclusters of injuries at a small number of hospitals over a limited period oftime. Adding the other claims not only increased the number ofdefendants but also increased the period of time over which the claimswere being made. This made it even more difficult to prove negligencebecause of the broader historical context. It also reduced the number ofcommon elements shared by the cases in the group action, since manymore factors had to be taken into consideration. Some people havequestioned whether taking this approach was the right decision. There were radiotherapy experts who were also seriously concerned about the decision to go ahead with a group action. Professor StanleyDische commented: 'The decision to go for a group action was a veryserious move. It was unusual in being a group action against a largeproportion of a profession. Most others involve a single product - a drugor device. But when a high court agreed to a group action against halfthe radiotherapy departments in the country, this was unprecedented. Ithad enormous implications not only for oncologists but for medicine as awhole'. R.A.G.E. members also had their concerns, as it seemed as if the issues they believed to be important had been lost. But the fact that legal aidhad been secured made it difficult for them to go anywhere else for legaladvice. As Steve Walker, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authorityexplained, 'They couldn't go elsewhere and retain the legal aid. If theyhad gone elsewhere they would have had to apply again and the LegalAid Board might say this is being managed by someone else'. The legal aid funding also meant that any woman pursuing her own case had to put her legal action on hold. Some were even taken to court byJulie Turner to put a stop to their cases. She had the support of the legalaid system to do this - the whole point of funding the group action was toreduce the costs from having lots of individual trials all going ahead at thesame time. R.A.G.E. separates itself from the case By the end of 1994, tensions within R.A.G.E. had reached breaking point.There was considerable opposition to the group action which ledR.A.G.E. to completely separate itself from the litigation (see page 64).Some of the women who were now part of the group action were stillR.A.G.E. members, but they made up less than half the total number oflitigants. It was understood that these women were now actingindependently of R.A.G.E., effectively pursuing their individual claims. Over the years R.A.G.E. of course kept an eye on the proceedings but became more and more concerned. To them it seemed as if the caseYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 73'The decision to go for a multi-party action was made by RJW - based on advice from Dan Brennan. Because Dan felt so strongly that this was acase that could succeed - he was one who initially said go for a multi-party action. So when someone like him says that, you tend to go with it.As he was the one who was going to be standing up in court to fight it'. RJW were successful in their application. One hundred and twenty-five of the litigants received legal aid assistance, although the remainder werefaced with paying privately. Getting this funding was crucial for RJW asIan Walker describes: 'We were very keen to take on this case because we believed in it... we certainly don't do legal aid cases for the money - it was a very highprofile case potentially - we believed we had the expertise to do itproperly. But it would not have got off the ground at all without legal aid'. The Legal Aid Board supported the proposal for a group action - so as to reduce the amount of court time required to try the case and so reducethe overall costs. RJW had also argued that because the cases were socomplex, they would need to be tried by a single high court judge, whocould gain a deep understanding of all the issues and so make a betterinformed decision. As Ian Walker describes: 'If 100 women used 100different solicitors to fight 100 cases - it would have been mayhem -someone had to control it - and if it wasn't brought together then 100different judges would make different decisions... There were alsobenefits to the women agreeing to share costs. Lady Ironside lost\u00a3100,000 on fighting her case alone. If 200 women had brought individualcases the overall cost (using Lady Ironside's figures) would have been\u00a320 million'. Jan Millington has commented, 'I don't think there would ever have been lots of individual cases... it seemed to me as if many of the womenwouldn't have considered litigation if it hadn't been for the class action'. However, taking this approach was a big risk. Group actions are less likely to succeed than individual cases and very few have ever beensuccessful in this country. They also require a lot more investigation, asGillian Solly from RJW describes: 'In a group you have to not only assesswhat happened to each individual, but also to make comparisons acrossa group and try and work out similarities and differences... so it raises alot more complex issues than if it were just an individual on her own. Thebenefits are that if you win on one aspect you win for everybody - but alot more work has to be done'. Ian Walker has also commented: 'In my view it's important not to forget the very complex nature of this litigation. This was a huge legalundertaking for the claimants and for us, and was no where near thesame as a single-party accident case'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 72Professor Karol Sikora had initially provided expert advice and supported the case. However, he was not convinced by the principal issues andtried to advise Julie Turner of the problems. He explains, 'If she pursuedher line, the whole [radiotherapy] community would end up being sued byevery patient... she would be saying that all the doses we'd been usinghad been incorrect - which couldn't be right'. He believed the arguments were over simplistic '...because they wanted to make out that treatment within a certain dose range was negligent...when other people had been using higher doses and not seen any injury.We couldn't get it over to the lawyers... they refused to accept it'. He made it clear that he couldn't 'Stand up in court or write a report... because the defence would say 'Sikora - YOU were doing it' - and we'dall be stuck.' Jane Maher agrees, 'Because it could have been anyone who did this - any individual would have been 'torn to shreds', in order to defend thecommunity'. After withdrawing his support, Professor Sikora received no further correspondence from Julie Turner about the case. He described how'They moved on without us and we weren't informed about what washappening... If you told her what she didn't want to hear - she didn't likeyou. She antagonised a lot of consultants'. It seemed to him as if 'The lawyers kept turning to more and more doctors to find someone who would agree with them.' In his view, 'Alawyer can't control how good a case is, but they can decide to stop if it'sno good'. Other radiotherapy experts were also sceptical about the nine principal issues as Professor Dische describes: 'Here were nine different things that could have gone wrong - but they were all very different. They went from irradiating people who shouldn'thave been irradiated through to technical errors when giving treatment -having overlapping fields or giving too high a dose. With such variation, itwas extraordinary that they agreed this was suitable for a class action'. Although some of the litigants were also worried that the case was going in the wrong direction, they had little option other than to put their trust inthe legal system. As Jan Millington (one of the R.A.G.E. members whoremained a litigant) describes: 'It seemed to me as if none of us knew what was going on. We were all very concerned. But we thought the Legal Aid Board is bound to beoverseeing this because they're spending such a lot of money. They'reYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 75was being fitted around all the people who wanted to sue, whatever their reason. They felt the original purpose of the case had been lost. AsMargaret Carling describes, 'The injuries that went to court were nottypical of R.A.G.E. members' injuries'. In 1996, the R.A.G.E. Committee made a formal decision to no longer tell new members about the case, unless specifically asked. Pulling together the group action On 8 March 1995, RJW attended a case management hearing at theRoyal Courts of Justice. This involved presenting their proposal as to howthe action should be fought. The judge, Mr Justice May accepted theirproposal, which was based on selecting 10 test cases that wouldrepresent the whole group. If the 10 were then successful, the other 121cases would be judged along similar lines to resolve them relativelyquickly. Mrs Justice Ebsworth was appointed as the judge for the trial. IanWalker comments: 'It seemed an oddly structured multiparty action - butquite sensible'. Some women thought that Mr Justice May would have detected the weaknesses in the group action, and perhaps stopped it from goingahead. However, at such early stages it is uncommon for a judge to readdeeply into the issues surrounding a case. He or she is more likely toaccept it at face value, basing his or her decision on the representationsfrom the lawyers. RJW therefore went on to develop nine 'principal issues' which they believed underpinned their case. These were the things they believedhad gone wrong with the radiotherapy treatment the women hadreceived, based on the advice they had been given and the researchthey had carried out. As Ian Walker describes: 'In the beginning it looked as if the correct view was that all these women had been damaged for nothing. Some shouldn't have had it[radiotherapy] at all - but then if they had had it - did they have itproperly? The other expert advice was that the science of radiotherapywas not well controlled...there was a view that the radiotherapyprofession was a dustbin profession - so the picture was that womenwere being given dangerous, harmful treatment by people who weren'tthat well- qualified, who weren't being properly controlled. So it seemedas if things were going desperately wrong'. The nine principal issues were presented and accepted by the courts in May 1996. But by this time these principal issues had little support from elsewhere. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 7484), while the strength of the defence team had a very positive influence. In Stanley Dische's view, 'The problem with the litigation is that it became a battle between two teams. Our team was more successful. When youlook at the result I think the better team won - which doesn't mean to saythat their case was better... it seems to me that the other side started offwith the wrong proposition and went to the wrong people'. The group action collapses In the months leading up to the trial, the defence experts were given anopportunity to examine each of the ten women in the group action andprepare their own detailed reports. In May 1997, they handed over theirreport to the plaintiffs. This delivered a devastating blow to the groupaction. As Ian Walker describes: 'What happened was our experts changed their view... We ended up with a team of four who were all prepared to say things were wrong - but theexperts for the defence thought something totally different and when theyswapped their expert reports - our experts start to think about it - it'seasy for one expert to say something in a report and in counsel with youbecause no one is batting against them - then suddenly there are fast-bowls from the opposition - and one by one they all began to say 'I mayhave been a bit bullish on this one' - which meant that one by one thegeneric issues were no longer supportable. In the beginning it was very tempting once an expert says what you want to hear and backs it up with what appears to be good science - you thinkwell that's great... but I've learnt you really have to challenge them agood deal more - but as a lawyer you can't necessarily see past thescience. If they come up with the right literature that seems to back upwhat they're saying - it's very hard to say we think you're talking rubbish.Because that's the definition of expert'. There were other problems in the RJW team. With Dan Brennan's departure, RJW needed to appoint another QC. They finally recruitedAdrian Whitfield to help rethink the case, as Gillian Solly describes: 'He was an eminent clinical negligence QC - equivalent in standing and status to Dan Brennan - the two of them were involved in most of theleading cases at the time. He was very heavyweight and it was verydesirable to have him acting for you'. The defence team's expert report had pointed out serious flaws in RJW's arguments. In July 1997, Adrian Whitfield spent four days in consultationwith three experts to discuss these issues in depth. They agreed thatthere were serious discrepancies between the two sides. What theyYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 77bound to watch carefully what's going on... we had a top firm of city lawyers... with a very good name.. they couldn't be more prestigious. Soat the end of the day we thought ours is not to question, they must knowwhat they're doing'. Pulling together the defence With large numbers of women now involved in the group action, largenumbers of radiotherapy centres were forcibly drawn into the case.Beachcroft Stanleys, a firm of solicitors based in London were given therole of co-ordinating the solicitors representing all the different Trusts.The defence team was led throughout by Stephen Miller QC. He broughttogether a wide range of experts to work on the case - includingProfessor Charles Joslin and Professor Stanley Dische - the two mosteminent and respected experts in radiotherapy in the UK. Charles Joslinplayed a major role in helping to select other defence witnesses as andwhen was needed to address the varying claim. This included an expertin the effects of radiation on nerve tissue who came from overseas. According to Professor Dische, the strength of the defence's team was key to their success. He describes how 'We all got on very well together.We were a good team. Their team went through difficulties. Our teamwas good and we didn't change anyone.' In contrast to the defence, the RJW team found themselves in serious trouble. In 1997 Dan Brennan left the case to defend a new case abroad.There was also the added complication in trying to find UK experts tosupport RJW's case. As Stanley Dische describes: 'No one was willing to act against their colleagues. At the time, clinical oncology was a small specialty so most people knew each other. No onecould claim to be an independent witness when giving evidence againstso many friends and acquaintances'. RJW were forced to rely on the evidence of a retired oncologist and radiologists from abroad. As Ian Walker describes: 'We knew that we could not hope to fight the case without very heavyweight expert witnesses because what you've got to get is a highpowered expert to say everything that was done was wrong. To beginwith we had a lot of people who were prepared to say that - but we hadto travel the world to get them. We were very worried because it lookedas if going to have experts from outside the UK all saying 'Do you knowhow bloody backward you lot all are?' which is not an attractive way toput it to a judge'. It did seriously weaken their case in the eyes of the trial judge (see pageYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 76told, they were called in one by one and told by the QC their cases had failed. They weren't allowed in the room with the rest of us, they were justushered out'. This was devastating for the women whose cases were dropped. As Jan says: 'When the cases tumbled... we were all absolutely distraught...everyone knew the case was a shambles. Everyone was sitting aroundwaiting for their destiny. To see whether they'd been thrown out. That wasa shock'. Soon after, Julie Turner resigned from RJW. From NHSLA Chief Executive Steve Walker's point of view, this was evidence of theweakness of the plaintiff's case: 'When partners who've been taking a high profile and saying 'I'm going to make new law, I'm going to make my name', when they resign -defendants normally think they're on a winner'. It was at this point that Ian Walker took over the case. In contrast, he remained convinced there was still a chance of success: 'By that point I was managing it and I was pretty sure we were going to get an offer. And we did - we thought this was vindication of our position'. A few weeks later, almost on the eve of the trial, the women were summoned again to a meeting with the QC. About 20-30 claimantsattended. This time there was an offer of \u00a32 million on the table from thedefendants. This offer had come from the NHSLA. The NHSLA inheritedthe case late in 1997. As Steve Walker describes: 'This was the first group action that we inherited. A series of health authorities had been running it, all using their own lawyers. Then we tookit over and made the offer'. He explains why, 'The offer was made very, very late. It was cheaper to give them something, to buy off the risk, than to risk losing it... We knewthere were some cases that would probably win - a very small number.There were others where there was a small risk but we thought we'd beOK. But the overwhelming majority we thought we should win... but younever know what the judge is going to do. So we made the offer that wethought would be attractive to them, that might persuade them to thinkwe could live with this and take it, and avoid the trial, because the costsof the trial were going to be horrendous'. With a case funded by legal aid such as this one, the defendants have to pay their costs whether they win or lose. Most will try to avoid going tocourt. From the NHSLA's point of view 'It's all about money, it's all aboutavoiding paying \u00a31,000's a day on either side to have your case talkedYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 79realised was that each side had used different formulas to calculate the doses of radiotherapy that the women had received. What this meantwas that the nine original principal issues could no longer be supported. Soon after in the summer of 1997, two of the ten cases settled because both the litigants and the defence agreed these individuals had receivedinappropriate treatment. However, for the remaining cases, the nineprincipal issues had to be cut down to one. This single issue now simplystated that some women had received too high a dose of radiation. Thisof course made the women's case much more vulnerable. It cast seriousdoubts on their credibility. However, there was still some hope. AdrianWhitfield believed the single issue could stand. His advice was that theyhad about a 50-60% chance of success. However his main concern was the women who were privately funded. If they lost, they were likely to have to pay even higher costs - because thedefence would claim for time wasted investigating issues that had thenbeen abandoned. He wrote to the remaining women saying: 'We would be entirely sympathetic to any private claimant who took the view that she did not wish to remain on the register with the prospects ofsuccess which we have identified'. Some people have commented that at this stage the lawyers had every reason to press ahead with the case, because within the rules of thelegal aid system they were guaranteed to get paid whatever the outcome- win, lose or draw. From Ian Walker's perspective: 'By the time the generic issues collapsed - we'd already had five years of litigation so it would have been whollywrong to have dropped it. We had produced six-monthly reports to thelegal aid board - huge detailed reports which they had gone through witha fine tooth comb and then said they were happy to support this... WhenAdrian Whitfield realised we were in deep trouble - he wrote a very longadvice which we sent to the legal aid board and we had a meeting withthem. We said 'We can stop but we don't think we should - becausesome individual cases will succeed. We think we should bat on'. The trial proceeds In December 1997, the remaining litigants were summoned very hastilyto meetings at the lawyers' offices. They were told, by Adrian WhitfieldQC, that because of all the changes only three of the 'lead' cases out ofthe original 10 could proceed to trial. They were told one at a time, asJan Millington describes: 'The people who were the ten lead cases got called up... and they wereYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 78Mrs Justice Ebsworth handed down her written judgement on 8 May 1998. She ruled in favour of the defendants. Why the women lost The central legal question in the trial was whether the doctors had beennegligent in their treatment. In order to prove negligence, the litigants hadto show that the doctors had treated the women in a way in which noother 'reasonable' radiotherapist would have done at the time - or in away that would not have been accepted as proper by a 'responsible' bodyof radiotherapists. In such cases the judge can also reach a decision onwhether the practice considered 'proper' by a 'responsible' body isdefensible. If the professional opinion is not logical, for example becausethey're sticking to out-of-date ideas, this can also be considered asnegligent action. The two women in the trial - Mrs Robb and Mrs Unitt - had been treated in 1979 and 1980. So the judge was trying to assess whether theirtreatment was appropriate given the state of medical knowledge at thattime. The key questions that the court needed to address were: (a)should doctors have known about the risks of radiation-induced injury atthat time and tried to avoid them? (b) had the women been given theproper radiotherapy treatment - in terms of the dose and technique? (c)should the women have been given radiotherapy at all? The court's discussions around these questions will be considered in turn. (a) Should doctors have known about and avoided the risks of radiation-induced injury? There had been several scientific reports of injuries to the brachial plexus caused by radiation years before either of the two women had receivedtreatment. The litigants therefore argued that the doctors should haveknown about the risks and tried to avoid them - especially as one of thedoctors had come from a large teaching hospital supposedly at theforefront of medical research. Adrian Whitfield QC, acting for the litigants,also pointed out that it might be reasonable to expect any consultant whobecame aware of \"a bad result from comparable treatment to thatprovided by his hospital\" to ask himself 'Could this apply to me?'. Thelitigants argued that the doctors seemed to have ignored what theliterature was saying. In their defence, the opposition argued that the literature wasn't important and for lots of different reasons. They said that no doctor could beexpected to read everything that is published in an international field.They also argued that because the papers only suggested there wererisks in extreme conditions - the aver.a.g.e. doctor who had treatedhundreds of patients successfully, and never seen any serious injuries,Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 81out. The sooner you can talk about your case outside the court the better, cheaper for both sides, and as long as the claimant gets what he or shemight have got in the high court, we feel that's fair'. The \u00a32 million offer from the NHSLA was to be shared between all the litigants. This was either to be shared by everyone, which would justabout have covered all their legal costs, or it was to have beendistributed amongst the 'strong' cases. But the women weren't told whothe strong cases were. They were only told that the defendants knew andrefused to say. It was suggested there were about forty, which meant thatminus costs they would have each received about \u00a325,000. None of thewomen felt they were given enough time to think about this, or that theyhad been given sufficient advice. R.A.G.E. member Christina Rogers recalls, 'On the Friday afternoon I got a call saying there was an offer on the table. I got a call from anotherwoman who was so excited, saying there was an offer. I said don't getexcited, we haven't got it yet. At that point I thought there was somethingfunny going on... chaotic was the only word you could use to describe it'. Jan Millington was also there and from her point of view it was 'Another Alice through the Looking Glass thing... we'd got absolutely nothing onwhich to make a decision. Some of the litigants were just in tears. Youcan imagine after all these years thinking they were going to get money'. Her case had been funded by her husband's trade union and a representative of her funder was there. He confirmed that he wouldcontinue to support her case and advised 'rather than accept settlement,the cases, such as they are, should be tried'. Ian Walker also remembers the meeting: 'We had a meeting in the RJW office... overwhelmingly they all said to stuff the offer - even though theadvice we gave was that there was a good chance we could lose. Fromour point of view - what were we supposed to do with two millionpounds? How were we to decide who should get the money?...Andunless you get every member of the group agreeing this is how youshould do it - you can't do it - which is great weakness of a multi-partyaction. There's not just one client, but 150. There was a small group whowere very vociferous, very angry, and who wanted to go ahead - thinking'We've got this far - let's see what the judge says'. The women decided to proceed to trial. Steve Walker said 'If I'm honest I was flabbergasted'. The trial of the three remaining cases began on Monday 12 January 1998 and ended on 5 February 1998. One case settled during the courseof the trial. So only two of the original 10 test cases were eventually tried.Neither of these women had been treated at a hospital where there hadbeen high rates of injury. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 80In turn the defence argued that the doctors had simply done their best, under what were very difficult circumstances. They had treated as manywomen as possible in the only way they knew how. In the 80s, the effectsof radiation on cancer cells versus normal cells were far from beingunderstood. The doctors used academic physicists to calculate the rightdose and regime - and as long as they were within the confines of thatformula, the doctors believed the dose they were giving was safe. Soevery department - and even doctors within the same department - weregiving different treatments, none of which had been effectively comparedwith each other. But what they all believed was that they were essentiallydoing the same thing. The defence experts were still critical of the treatment that the women had received. Charles Joslin spoke frankly, saying that he would have,even in 1980, questioned the dose in use at the hospital where one ofthe women had been treated. But he didn't go as far as saying hethought that treatment was irresponsible, only that he would havequestioned how they managed to achieve so little radiation damage. The other key factor was that in the 1980s, doctors weren't aware of the sensitivity of the brachial plexus. In fact it was generally thought of asone of the structures most resistant to radiation. So none of the doctorstook into consideration what was happening to the brachial plexus whenthey calculated their doses - which certainly isn't the case now. So what the defendants were able to conclude was that even though the treatment the women had received differed considerably from their ownpractice, and would never be considered acceptable now, it was stillwithin the limits of what any reasonable consultant would have prescribedat the time. They were able to say that the doctors hadn't been guilty ofnegligence - because they couldn't have known that their treatmentcarried unacceptable risks. Others have since concluded that what the doctors were guilty of was allowing a state of ignorance to be maintained - but this was never amatter for the courts to decide. (c) Should the women have been given radiotherapy at all? Doctors were still taking a 'belt and braces' approach to treating breast cancer when the two women in the trial were treated. They typicallyprescribed radiotherapy on top of surgical removal of the tumour and thelymph nodes - as they thought this was necessary to eliminate all thecancer cells. They also tended to err on the side of caution - favouringlarger doses to reduce the chances of the cancer coming back.Nowadays, radiotherapy is given much less often. It tends to be avoidedin cases of early breast cancer, since surgical removal of the tumour isoften 100% successful. But back in the 80s, doctors recommended - andwomen often preferred - to do 'everything that we can to fight the cancer'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 83would have no reason to be concerned or to change what they were doing. As Stanley Dische said, 'You do not change an established regimeon the basis of one paper reporting a problem encountered at onecentre'. They also stressed that the medical literature tends to beunbalanced - people shout more about sudden disasters than aboutlong-term successes. The defendants also explained how in the 1980s doctors hadn't been familiar with the concept of evidence-based medicine. It was thenconsidered the norm for doctors to base their practice on what they hadbeen taught wherever they had been trained, or had subsequentlylearned through many years of experience. In some radiotherapydepartments, a 'strong' head would dictate the policy and insist thateverybody followed it. Doctors saw no reason to change what they weredoing unless they were alerted to problems by their patients. Sinceinjuries to the brachial plexus nerve are so rare, the defence argued thatdoctors couldn't have been expected to know about it. The judge was persuaded by the defence's arguments - accepting that at that time more weight was given to doctors' informed opinions than theresults in the medical literature. Stanley Dische, while agreeing with the judge's conclusion says 'I was concerned through the trial that the clinicians should have been morefamiliar with radiobiological science and more prepared to relate it to their practice'. (b) Had the women been given the proper radiotherapy treatment - in terms of dose and technique? There was much debate during the trial about what should have been considered a proper radiation dose in the 1980s. The litigants hadoriginally claimed that a treatment regime of a total of 50 Grays (the unitfor measuring radiation) in 25 lots of 2 Gray fractions should have beenrecognised as the international standard. They later changed their mindsabout this and said it should have been a total of 60 Grays in 30 lots of 2Gray fractions. The defence didn't argue against this being anappropriate dose - but simply argued that there hadn't been anyrecognised standard. There hadn't been a clinical trial to determine themost effective regime for radiotherapy treatment. And in the absence ofsuch evidence, neither side was in a position to say whether the dose thewomen had received had been inappropriate. At the time the women were being treated (see page 27) radiotherapy in the UK was undergoing massive changes. New and more powerfulmachines were being introduced at the same time as there were hugeproblems with staffing levels. To make sure that they could treat everyonewho needed it, doctors changed the way they delivered the radiotherapy.The litigants argued that doctors should not have changed the treatmentregime without first trialling its effects. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 82What happened after the trial? Some cases dragged on over the following year. These were cases that were deemed to be outside of the findings of the judgement. JanMillington believes that 'Fifteen out-of-court settlements were made and\u00a31,800,000 paid out in compensation. One quarter of this went to anindividual whose case was never part of the group action'. Steve Walker, Chief Executive of the NHSLA believes that offers were made to twelve women - not necessarily those who were in the courtcase. In almost all of the cases he says the settlement was \"a fraction\" ofthe amount asked for by the lawyers. The women who had been part of the group action were subsequently presented with huge legal bills by RJW. The case had proved to beextremely expensive. The total bill was \u00a33.3million including counsel'sfees, expenses and VAT, although much of this was covered by legal aid.The case had been expected to be costly because the legal team hadinvested so much time in researching, pleading and preparing for thetrial. But some of the women who were privately funding their case werestill alarmed at how much they were being charged. As Jan Millingtondescribes: 'The people who had to pay their own bills were appalledwhen they got this great big bill of costs, which had to itemise all theexpenditure, because they weren't consulted. Other people were facedwith bills of around \u00a325,000 each despite their cases never reachingcourt'. Three of the privately funded women decided to challenge the bill, with the help of solicitor Richard Stockdale, from the Brooke North firm inLeeds. Christina Rogers was one of these women. The appeal was successful. The bill for the private fee-paying clients was reduced by over one million pounds, and the Legal Aid Bill reduced byjust over \u00a3750,000. It was thanks to Christina Rogers that the legal feeswere reduced. As Jan Millington commented, 'If it hadn't been forChristina, that money would still have been with RJW'. In a letter to the journal Medical Litigation in May 1999, Richard Stockdale condemned the trial for being such a terrible waste of publicmoney. He believed, as did many others, that the money could havebeen used far more effectively if it had been given directly incompensation to the women: 'This case will also add to the debate as to whether society is best served solely by a system of fault-based compensation. The \u00a33.3 millionclaimed by the law firm when added to the estimated \u00a31.5 million costs ofthe various NHS defendants could have been used much moreproductively to found a structured settlement for the 132 women whosuffered injury. It is ironic that the bulk of the actual expense of the caseYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 85Which arguments persuaded the judge? In her summing up, the judge stated that she had 'found this case to be of exceptional difficulty'. She commended the two women in the trial for'what can only be regarded as remarkable and courageous efforts tocome to terms with their painful and disabling condition'. She also made clear how she had 'found the defendant's witnesses more convincing and relevant than those called by the plaintiff'. This had verymuch influenced her opinion. In particular, she found 'Professor Discheconfronted the problems caused by the passage of time more acceptablythan Dr Halnan [an expert for the litigants] and was better able todistinguish his own views from what would have been a respectablealternative view 17/18 years ago'. She \"could detect no professionaldefensiveness in his approach'. She 'reached the firm conclusion that there was more than one view of proper radiotherapy treatment up to 1980 and beyond' and was'impressed by the fact that in 1995 the Royal College of Radiologists, feltitself unable to advise on an optimum treatment regime'. Professor Joslinhad persuaded her to keep in mind that she was \"not conducting acomparative review of optimum techniques of treatment, but consideringthe reality of routine standard treatment in the context of heavy caseload'. She was also unsympathetic to the litigants' case because so much of it seemed to be based on American research and international practice. Asshe said, \"It does not follow... that a particular technique is negligent simplybecause it can be shown that things were done differently elsewhere... Dr Orton [called by RJW] was used as a vehicle to introduce the literature in the case and to place non-controversial material before the court. He issubstantially criticised by the defendants... on the basis that hisexperience is essentially American and therefore arises from a social andcultural background to treatment, which is not appropriate to the issues inthese English cases... In cases where... heavy emphasis is placed upon the weight to be placed upon contemporary medical literature, I was frankly troubled bythe extent to which reliance was placed upon a radiation physicist fromthe United States to set out the literature and its claimed significance forUnited Kingdom clinicians\". Overall she felt the women's case should not have been tested in the way that it had. She concluded by saying 'I regard it as unfortunate thatlitigation in terms of medical negligence was felt to be the onlymechanism available to obtain the answers. Because medicine isconstantly developing, there are obvious problems inherent in allegationsof negligence directed to the choice of a method of treatment used manyyears ago'. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 84The R.A.G.E. women feel they had been forgotten through all of this, as one of the women described in an article in Clinical Oncology in 1999: 'All that palaver about us. All that court stuff, the telly, the papers...Parliament... It's all been about us but at the end of the day nothingrelates to us, like we don't exist'. Much of what had happened in the lead up to the trial had not been in the public domain. After the trial the women began to feel that involvingthe legal profession had made things worse for them. They felt that thelaw firm had encouraged them to pursue a claim that only had a remotechance of success and that they should have been made more aware ofthe problems. Some time after the case, another medical negligence lawyer called and asked to meet a few of the failed litigants. He was curious as to how theircase had been presented to the Legal Aid Board. He appeared veryinterested in the R.A.G.E. story, but it turned out that this was only so asto inform his own work. This meeting didn't lead to any further legal helpfor the R.A.G.E. women. The women feel very angry about the whole experience - another group of professionals had let them down. And it seems as if R.A.G.E.'s casefor compensation has suffered as a result. As Pam Pond describes, 'Nowevery time these legal cases get thrown up as if we've had a fortune -but we've had nothing'. How did the government agencies respond? A few years after the trial, Jan Millington met again with Steve Walkerfrom the NHSLA to discuss pursuing R.A.G.E.'s goal for compensation.After that meeting Steve Walker wrote to Yvette Cooper, Health Minister,on 21 March 2001 and explained how 'We ended up knowing more aboutthe background and motivation for the action in the hour we spent talkingto Jan Millington than we had over the last five years trying to engagewith the solicitors'. Therefore some government agencies did recognise that R.A.G.E. had effectively divorced itself from the case very early on. However, otherGovernment agencies and professional bodies continued to see R.A.G.E.and the court case as one and the same thing. While R.A.G.E. continuedto lobby for some kind of compensation, time and again the trial wasbrought up as a reason why their claim was invalid. The Governmentcontinued to refuse payment to the women with severe injuries on thegrounds that negligence had not been proved. For example Hazel Blearsresponded in a letter to R.A.G.E. on 8 March 2003: 'In your case, an action was taken through the civil justice system and the judge decided in favour of the defendant. In these circumstances it isYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 87has come from the public purse, but has instead been spent on an unproductive legal battle of titanic proportions'. Jan Millington responded in the same journal agreeing with his conclusions, and adding, 'The failed litigants would say that added totheir financial costs are those of huge stress, frustration, anger anddemoralisation generated by protracted litigation over which they had nocontrol. They would agree with Mr Stockdale that the costs vastlyoutweigh the benefits one hundredfold'. A solicitor from RJW also responded in the journal, defending their involvement in the case. She concluded 'We believe that the legalaction... has led directly to improving standards in medical treatment.Guidelines are in force now involving radiotherapy treatment for womenwith breast cancer that were not in place, and had no signs of being inplace, before the litigation started'. Ian Walker's reflections on the case were: 'I think that from a lawyer's point of view - it was very difficult to litigate on a large group of peoplewho were as angry as these ladies were. For many of them we didn't feelthat what we were saying to them about the difficulties was going in. Ifyou have clients who aren't listening to your advice - it makes it verydifficult to continue acting for them. I think the way we managed the casehere was actually was very good. Julie had a grip of iron on the facts ofeach case. We maintained meticulous records. We had a detailedanalysis of every case. We actually controlled the thing as well as couldbe done - but what can you do when the experts walk away from you? If we went back in time - we would probably do it still - on the basis of what we thought we knew then. It was an action that had to be fought'. What was the impact on the women involved in the case? 'After the court case I think people lost heart'. Christina Rogers said. Losing the case was clearly devastating to those who had been involved in the litigation, as their hopes had been built up over a period of severalyears. Ian Walker thought it must have been terrible for the litigants: 'The impact on individual ladies must have been devastating... By running anylitigation for any person you give them hope, because they say 'Youwouldn't be running this if you didn't think it would win'. When the case islost and there's no suggestion the NHS will make it up in other ways...they get devastated. It must be adding insult to injury - a ghastlyexperience for them'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 86Aim 4: To provide mutual support Overcoming isolation One of the experiences that many R.A.G.E. members shared was a sense of isolation. Many were told that they were the only person whohad this type of injury. Margaret Carling, who went to one of the firstR.A.G.E. meetings, describes how vulnerable she felt before joining thegroup, 'The pain was absolutely excruciating. And of course the worry ofit too. You were thinking, my God, I've got the cancer again. It's hard toput into words. You feel so vulnerable'. Christina Rogers, another early R.A.G.E. member, describes the sense of isolation felt by many of the women: \"About two years after I had myradiotherapy I had pain again and my arm swelled... I went back to Xhospital and was referred to the lymphoedema clinic. That's how it allbegan... I never met a soul. Nobody said that anyone else was sufferingfrom such a thing'. After years of wondering and worrying, R.A.G.E. helped the women to find out what had caused their injuries. They were also able to find muchwelcomed support and understanding from others who shared theirexperience. Christina Rogers describes what this felt like: 'I was so relieved that I wasn't isolated. The first meeting I went to was a big meeting, because after the newspaper article we all came out of thewoodwork... I felt, at last I'm not the only one. Because you wonderwhat's going to happen to you. It was a total wall of silence at X hospital.Then I went to this rally with all these people. It was a relief - thank Godfor that, I'm not on my own, at least I'll be able to get some help'. Margaret Carling shared these feelings when she attended her first R.A.G.E. meeting: 'It was a blessed relief that something was happening,that we're going to get to the bottom of this, and also that they're notgoing to get away with this. You think, thank God somebody understands,somebody has the same thing. It was nice just to talk to other people,swap experiences... It was the comfort of having the mutual support'. This mutual support was a lifeline for many R.A.G.E. members. Providing support by telephone For some women meeting others whose injuries were further advanced came as quite a shock. Margaret Carling recalls that at her first meeting'One of the depressing things was seeing how progressive it was. Thatwas one of the downsides'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 89not possible for me to offer compensation of patients, such as yourselves'. This is a source of continued frustration on the part of R.A.G.E. members, as Margaret Carling describes, 'Some individuals chose topursue a legal action for negligence. Some of those were, or had been members of R.A.G.E. but the majority were not. It is absurd to attempt toclassify this as 'an action by R.A.G.E.' on the grounds that some of thelitigants may also have been members of R.A.G.E. Would a legal action,in which some litigants were members of the Labour Party, be classifiedas an 'action by the Labour Party?' How did the radiotherapy profession respond? Jane Maher felt that when the legal case got started it was 'a wake-upcall' to the radiotherapy profession. She believes that 'People who'd hadthe odd case thought that this was just one of those unfortunate things.And then when they saw it being taken to court, there's a sudden thing,'It might be me'. At that time there were only about 200 radiotherapists inthe country. It's a small world. People would have started to reflect on itand talk about it before it got to court'. John Yarnold has commented that the final judgement was still a concern to the profession, even though negligence hadn't been proved,'Everybody realised something had gone badly wrong no matter what thecourts had said. There was sense of collective shame. But it must havebeen worse for the patients because they were humiliated, they didn't getany money and were still left with the injuries. That was a very, very deephole to have been left in'. Professor Stanley Dische thought there were some very important lessons for the profession that came out of the trial. He concluded that:'Radiotherapists were wrong to have been much more influenced bytraining than by the new knowledge that was coming through. Butclinicians were sceptical about the basic science. They tended to think - Iknow what I can see and that's what matters. Although nothing is moreimportant than listening and observing and seeing patients - withquantitative issues you've just got to have research data'. Professor Dische wrote a report of the trial that was published in the journal Clinical Oncology . He thought this was important to do because he was concerned that 'People tried to not know about it - to avoidanything uncomfortable or bad news'. He was amazed about how ignorant the profession was about the case. He says 'They didn't want to know'. Professor Karol Sikora came to asimilar conclusion, 'It's an episode of British radiotherapy that no onereally wants to remember'.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 88Providing practical support The support provided by R.A.G.E. has therefore been practical as well as emotional. In addition to the advice on daily living, some R.A.G.E.members have acted as advocates for their peers, by going to tribunalsand hearings with members whose entitlement to Disability LivingAllowance has been challenged. This has helped some women accessthe benefits they are entitled to. Throughout its history, R.A.G.E.'s work has therefore involved much more than its activity around campaigning. The vital role that R.A.G.E. playedin providing support to its members was recognised by the MaherCommittee (see page 36). They recommended that 'The supportive aswell as the campaigning role of R.A.G.E. should be acknowledged'. A lot of people said that without R.A.G.E. they simply would have been lost. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 91For this reason and because they sometimes found it difficult to travel, some women chose not to attend meetings and gained their support byphone instead. Jan Millington describes how people would call 'All dayevery day. Some days the phone just didn't stop ringing'. Even today, providing telephone support continues to be seen as crucial by members of the R.A.G.E. committee. Pam Pond explains: 'Thetelephone advice is really important because many women can't talk totheir GP or practice nurse - but they can talk to R.A.G.E. membersknowing that they are going to get the most up to date advice - hints andtips. We always put a note that it [the advice] is based on personalexperience. Telephone help has done a lot of good'. These days people who believe they may have been damaged by radiotherapy can get help and advice from R.A.G.E. members, whilstpeople who are about to undergo radiotherapy can call to talk about theirfears. Whenever there has been a discussion about dissolving R.A.G.E., it is the role of providing mutual support, particularly by phone that hasmotivated members to carry on. As Lorna Patch describes: 'It cheerspeople up. And if you've only done that - at least you've donesomething'. Keeping in touch Some long-standing members still speak to each other regularly, andhave developed very strong friendships. As Jan Millington describes: 'There are people you'll always be friends with. It's almost spiritual, the kind of bonding you have with them'. This strong connection has developed because of all that they have been through. As Pam Pond describes: 'If you just met Jan or Margaret at aparty and they became your friend at that level, you'd never have thesame automatic built-in feeling of sympathy and understanding for them,and admiration for each other'. Over the years R.A.G.E. has produced (and continues to produce) a regular newsletter for its members. This contains practical suggestionsabout coping with everyday tasks with the use of only one arm, anddetails of complementary therapies that members have found helpful. Itprovides another forum for R.A.G.E. members to exchange experiencesand offer encouragement to one another. Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 90'Their achievements have been a massive improvement in British radiotherapy - people woke up in response to R.A.G.E....There are nomore cases of BPN due to radiotherapy, so they have achieved the long-term goal of changing practice. They may not see that they wereresponsible. That has been a major problem. The success of R.A.G.E.got no recognition from anyone - professional, political or legal'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist They also set a precedent as being one of the first cancer patient groups to be established and helping to ensure that other patients were betterinformed of the risks of radiotherapy: 'At the beginning we were the only cancer lobby, there wasn't the networking. And we've achieved more in the way of informed consent'. Jan Millington, R.A.G.E. member 'There are now lots of patient pressure groups all of which have playedtheir part in improving medical treatment. R.A.G.E.'s unique place is as aforerunner of all of these groups... R.A.G.E. helped serious late-effectradiation injuries to be discussed in public for the first time and brought tothe attention of the country, the lack of uniformity in treatment and thevariance in the knowledge and understanding of the science ofradiotherapy... This was possibly the first time, in the history of the NHSthat a patient group had confronted, in the nicest possible way, such anestablished body of medical opinion'. David Bainbridge, R.A.G.E. member What can we learn from R.A.G.E.'s story? Lesson 1: Legal action is not the way to resolve the issues for people damaged by medical treatment Many people concluded that going to court had simply been the wrong way to address the women's concerns. \"This is not a good way to sort things out. That's a message to everybody\". Jane Maher, Oncologist 'Some public action was required, but it would have been better to havean independent public enquiry to look into it and devise compensation ifnecessary. But with litigation it turned into a battle. So it becametactical... which fogged the issue'. Stanley Dische, Clinical OncologistYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 93Chapter 5: Reflections on R.A.G.E.'s story As part of the interviews with R.A.G.E. members and professionals, we asked everyone to reflect on the whole of R.A.G.E.'s story to draw outthe lessons that might be useful to others. In this chapter, we report on what people concluded. As far as possible we have tried to do this in people's own words. What were R.A.G.E.'s greatest achievements? There was almost unanimous agreement that R.A.G.E.'s greatestachievement was to improve the standards of radiotherapy treatment forbreast cancer in the UK. 'R.A.G.E.'s biggest achievement - to raise awareness and to improve radiotherapy standards'. Margaret Carling, R.A.G.E. Member 'Thanks to the row R.A.G.E. has made, standards are much better...They say it was R.A.G.E. that forced annual audits, that forced hospitalsto keep records'. Lady Ironside, R.A.G.E. President 'The most important thing that happened as result of the R.A.G.E.experience was the START trial. It became clear that there had to besome sort of standardisation of radiotherapy treatment... So theyintroduced a really rigorous quality assurance system to enter the trial.And nearly everyone entered the trial. It was one of the fastest recruitingtrials because everyone wanted to know the answer. So the QualityAssurance programme became the standard for every department'. Jane Maher, Oncologist 'It was R.A.G.E. alone that really has improved radiotherapy treatment inthis country. That alone is wonderful. Anyone walking into hospital has abetter chance of having non-damaging radiotherapy'. Lorna Patch, R.A.G.E. Member 'Through our campaigning we've made sure it doesn't happen again... Idon't know that we could have done any more - we got the Maher workdone, we frightened the radiotherapists and got them to change things,we've lobbied parliament til we're sick of lobbying... we've done the EarlyDay Motions - I don't know that we could have done more as we're onlya group of women'. Pam Pond, R.A.G.E. MemberYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 92'Whenever you saw six of the women in a row, all with the same injury, you could see they weren't nuts, there was clearly a problem. But no onefelt responsible - the women couldn't speak to anyone... it was reallyonly the clinicians who could have come clean about what reallyhappened... But because it seemed to have been a technical problemwith the treatment, no one else, including the Chief Medical Officer or theRoyal College of Radiologists, saw it as their responsibility. They sawtheir role simply to be to lean on the individual hospitals to carry out anindependent enquiry'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist Many people also expressed a great deal of frustration that so much money was wasted in legal fees which could have been given to thewomen in compensation. 'Instead of spending money on the doomed legal case, it could have funded clinics for the women - a centre with a multidisciplinary team witha consultant for assessment. The money would have easily paid for that'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist 'That sum [the amount spent on the case] tells you how wrong it was togo through litigation. Most money went to lawyers and experts... But isthat the way society should spend its money to solve problems?' Stanley Dische, Clinical Oncologist Lesson 2: Time and resources need to be invested in establishing a new group and maintaining its effectiveness 'The journeys we've had should provide lessons for some people. Anybody setting out on this trip could find the same pitfalls'. Jan Millington, R.A.G.E. member Their lack of experience when the R.A.G.E. committee first formed caused many tensions, as Jan Millington describes: 'To be honest I think that was a turning point, a cracking point. That [establishing a committee] didn't work to our advantage, because nobodywas that experienced. Already people were taking different angles... Newpeople were sounding off when they had no real background'. There were additional tensions created when new members came on board and expressed concerns that the original members held on to toomuch power and information. This was a major issue for Jan as shedescribes: 'They felt I wanted to do too much myself - that I wanted tokeep possession of things - which I didn't. My only intention was to tryand keep things on an even keel. I had the history, I'd had the meetingsand in my head I knew where we were going. But you get careercampaigners who want to make a meal of it... I just thought you can'tYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 95'The court case made relationships worse between the professions and the patients. It was an expensive legal disaster without any realconclusion. It was a real mess - that was a low point for everybody. Noone came out well. Court cases force people to be confrontational. Thatcan't possibly work well - it isn't a therapeutic process - it only brings outthe worst in both sides'. John Yarnold, Clinical Oncologist The way the case was constructed was also thought to be a major problem: 'Poor technique [in radiotherapy] led to a lot of the women's problems - but I didn't think people should have been had up in a court for that. Sothough I had misgivings, I felt it appropriate to act for the defence. Thecase was constructed in such a way as to hold up whole profession... thewomen would have done very much better if they had sued particularhospitals and if they had done so, they might have got experts in thiscountry to act on their behalf'. Stanley Dische, Clinical Oncologist Many believe that more should have been done when the women first raised their concerns. This could have avoided all the costly legal action. 'If the hospitals involved had taken responsibility for sorting this out - if that had been done earlier, it would have been very different. The womenwouldn't have got so cross... If a clinic with a relevant team had been gottogether, it would have probably solved the problem and stopped thelegal case'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist 'The great lesson - when something goes wrong it is best to becompletely honest and open - and involve the people who think they'vebeen aggrieved in the process of trying to resolve it- resolve the problemin dialogue not in confrontation'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist 'The best thing to do if you make a mistake is to say you're sorry andmake sure you don't do it again. If you said 'I'm sorry we didn't realise' -that would solve the problems for most patients. But many doctors find itvery difficult to cope with problems and won't see the patient - whichmakes it far worse'. Stanley Dische, Clinical Oncologist The health professionals recognise that most of the problems arose because no one was willing to take responsibility for what had happened:Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 94Chapter 6: Conclusions and recommendations Conclusion 1: There is a need for better monitoring ofcancer patients The main conclusion that emerged from the interviews is that patients needbetter follow-up after any form of cancer treatment or therapy, especially ifan aspect of that treatment is changed. 'If you introduce a new intervention, however small, you need to be aware that this can have untoward effects. If you change a small thing you haveto reflect very carefully and treat it as a major change in behaviour. So youneed to get radiotherapists to reflect on their practice, because radiationtherapy is a complex intervention'. Jane Maher, Oncologist 'All doctors must be trained to monitor to see if problems are arising - theyshould realise when problems occur and do something about it... Noteverything can be answered by a randomised controlled clinical trial -sometimes follow-up and careful observation of patients is better'. Stanley Dische, Clinical Oncologist 'We put all this effort into things after something's happened - look at theamount of effort the lawyers went through to sort out all the details -compared to the little effort we put into the follow-up of individualtreatments - it's skimpy compared to the legal efforts'. Karol Sikora, Clinical Oncologist Better monitoring and longer term follow-up of the R.A.G.E. women could have: alerted the health professionals more quickly to the late radiation damage allowed quicker identification of the treatment regimes causing damage helped identify and share 'good' clinical practice provided more in-depth information for other patients on the risks of radiotherapy.Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 97have too many voices. It's not that you think that your voice is the most important, but in meetings, somebody can get on their hobbyhorse thenthe next 15 minutes have gone, and you've only got an hour'. At a more emotional level, there were also differences between the levels of passion and anger felt by different members of the committee.Margaret Carling observes: 'People say R.A.G.E. is such an angrysounding name, but we were angry. Now we're quite respectable, but wewere angry. We had a right to be angry, we had a moral case'. These views are quite distinct from those of Joyce Pritchard, another member who joined at the group in 1993, and remembers her firstmeeting: 'It was terrifying. The anger, you could smell it, you could tasteit, you could feel it... The R.A.G.E. members there, some were very, veryangry, you could feel the anger in the room. This anger. I wouldn't bringpeople together unless there was enough people who are not angry tokeep it all under control. That's how we cope in committee. Some of usdon't have this destructive anger'. These tensions were never completely resolved and so re-emerged repeatedly to cause some disagreement and ill-feeling amongst R.A.G.E.committee members. With hindsight, they recognise it would have beenhelpful to invest time and resources in settling these disagreements rightat the beginning, and to have worked on clarifying the motivations andaims that committee members could have collaborated on. As JanMillington reflects: 'I can see now that it's a huge mistake involvinganybody who doesn't feel exactly the same. You've got to feel hugepassion and indignation, and that's got to be the unifying thing'. Lesson 3: It's important to keep up pressure on government and not to lose focus In hindsight some of the R.A.G.E. members felt that they allowed themselves to be sidetracked at some stages of the campaign. Forexample, after the Bates Audit, campaigning for compensation ceasedwhilst some members spent time challenging the detailed findings of theaudit. Jan Millington reflects: 'I do think that was a retrograde step for us.I think it did dilute us'. Some R.A.G.E. members also feel that, because they were women, they were not aggressive enough in their campaigning. As Jan Millingtonobserves: 'As women you're scared aren't you? You have this protectivefeeling towards people, you don't want to add to their distress and worry'. And as Margaret Carling reflects: 'I would advocate being more aggressive, much more assertive, flood The Sun and The Daily Mail with complaints\".Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 96Conclusion 2: There is a need for better systems to support people who are damaged by medical treatment R.A.G.E. members were one of the first groups of people who had beendamaged by medical treatment to join together in a campaign. JanMillington comments, 'We've been pioneers. It was uncharted territory. It was a minefield - every step, something's blown up in our faces. If we can chart a course, so thatpeople who follow us can avoid the minefields, it will make it a lot easier'. Many people thought there could be better systems put in place to provide compensation for people damaged by medical treatment, without themhaving to prove negligence and at the same time providing them with betterpsychological support. 'The minute you involve the legal profession you're in it up to your neck. I don't think it's appropriate. Courts of law feel like a criminal thing. You think,what on earth has my experience got to do with that?' Jan Millington, R.A.G.E. Member 'The public purse compensates innocent victims of crimes of violence whenthere is no civil claim through the Courts (the Criminal InjuriesCompensation Appeals Authority). The compensation is modest comparedto what can be achieved through a Court but at least it is something. Whycan't there be something like this for patients seriously damaged bymedical treatment?'. Thelma Bates, Clinical Oncologist 'We need to have a mechanism for dealing with situations where thingshave gone wrong, without resorting to the law'. Jane Maher, Oncologist Conclusion 3: The lessons from R.A.G.E. must not be forgotten 'Now they think they've got clever and it doesn't happen anymore - they think they don't need to listen to us. But as new people come in - are theyeven told about BPN?' Pam Pond, R.A.G.E. MemberYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 99Recommendations as to how people might be better followed-up in the future included: Ensure that all professionals and patients have their say and are listened to. 'Patients with radiation damage should be followed up at the Centre where they were treated. Patients should be listened to and their damage spottedearly. Serious side effects following radiotherapy are rare and the only wayto spot unusual morbidity [damage or side-effects caused by a treatment] isthrough regular multidisciplinary audit. A nurse could be the first tocomment on the unusual... Nothing is more important than careful follow-up, audit and quality assurance in oncology'. Thelma Bates, Clinical Oncologist Pay more attention to people's quality of life after cancer treatment and don't just focus on mortality statistics. 'Everyone wants to cure people and no one wants to talk about the dark side of the coin. Oncologists are caring and want to do their best for theirpatients. But they still have a blindspot - they don't face the damagecaused by their treatment... If I had my way, as well as gathering statisticson waiting times and mortality rates we should also collect statistics onmorbidity... if you look at the medical literature - it's amazing how morbidityof treatment is given very little space'. Stanley Dische, Clinical Oncologist 'In 2001 we spent a lot of time and effort getting assessments of my wife'scondition all over the country - not enough to make a case - but along theway we gathered a lot of evidence that there is a serious disquiet amongoncologists. They are muddling along as best they can. The worst thing foran oncologist isn't that the patient is damaged but that the patient dies. Butthere are currently a lot of people with recent damage from radiotherapy'. David Bainbridge, R.A.G.E. MemberYesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 98and an integral part of any redress package. Radiation damage is a potentially fatal condition, yet there seems to be no effective mechanism(or research) to cope with it. If one is to have confidence in any medicaltreatment, then those suffering injuries from it cannot be simply abandoned. Although we may be perceived as 'yesterday's women', R.A.G.E. is still very much alive. Thanks to R.A.G.E., radiation injuries on this scale areunlikely in the future - so 'today's women' and 'tomorrow's women' shouldnever have to go through our experience. Margaret Carling and Jan Millington R.A.G.E. Committee Members April 2006Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 101Afterword When R.A.G.E. was founded most members appeared to be surviving cancer and were generally aware of the open-ended prognosis. One neverforgets the possibility of a return of the disease even though years mayhave elapsed. Many of us initially thought that the symptoms of radiationdamage were signs of returning cancer. It was a shock to learn that atreatment aimed at the control of the disease could lead to a lifetime of painand disability and that the body had no natural ability to cope with excessradiation. Once our campaign was under way it was equally shocking to discover we were virtually 'out in the cold' encountering a good deal of indifference andeven denial of the fact and ramifications of our injuries. Our idea that cashpayments would be appropriate - not so much as 'compensation' but as agood will gesture to help us to care for ourselves - seemed to exacerbatethose indifferent attitudes. Yesterday's Women is a skilfully compiled account of our complex struggles. The authors, by some means, have managed to extricate themost relevant threads of our campaign from a massive pile ofdocumentation covering fifteen years of disjointed and spasmodic activitywith government, press, The Royal College, charities, lawyers and manyother agencies. Ill-health has frequently affected continuity in ourcampaign. We are grateful to have our story published in this way. Nobody has ever actually questioned the validity of R.A.G.E.'s aims and objectives. It is a matter of much dismay and concern that our best efforts,self-funded and with very limited physical resources have attracted themedia and appeared to interest Parliament, but have failed to changeattitudes and policies in any material way. We areassured that radiotherapy standards have improved and there is more opportunity forinformed consent for patients - but hopefully medicine would evolve in thisway naturally. We do not see how we could have been more co-operative with the Department of Health, yet in terms of our own wellbeing we are no furtherforward. It is still the support - emotional, moral and practical - that we giveeach other that we rely on, though as individuals we have so little to spare.When one of our members dies we feel a profound loss as one would for afamily member. Our advancing years and cash strapped NHS Trusts meanthat we have to fight for a place in the queue for care - or fund it privately,which few can do now. In spite of what our efforts have achieved for future breast cancer patients, virtually nothing has been done to alleviate the suffering of those alreadyinjured. Millions of pounds can be spent on legal costs, but we are almostforgotten. We are expected to be grateful for any medical attention, yet, asproposed in the NHS Redress Bill, remedial treatment should be a right,Yesterday's Women: the story of R.A.G.E. 100Appendix 1: Useful reading Bates T and Evans RGB.

His mother, treated with radiotherapy for early breast cancer in1961, died in 1988 from the late developing radiation injuries, includingischemic heart disease. His wife Brenda, treated in 1998, wassignificantly damaged by sub-optimal treatment.

Up to the present date I have had a broken collarbone, four broken ribs,and five breaks in my arm. I have been in this state for a third of my lifenow, and am still deteriorating; all due to the radiotherapy treatment,which I was later told I did not need anyway. The hospital has nevergiven an apology to me'. Lord Ironside Lord Ironside was an active member of the House of Lords and had a career in industry.

Jan Millington Jan Millington is a 66 year old retired primary school teacher, as well as a mother and grandmother. Her symptoms of radiation injury began in1985, two years after treatment, just as she and her husband hadpurchased a preparatory school as a retirement project. As her symptomsprogressed in terms of pain and disability, the project was abandoned in1990, as was an associated property in France. Jan joined Lady Ironsideto form R.A.G.E. in 1991. For her, the most devastating effect of herinjury was the inability to cope with her very sick husband, now in anursing home with advanced dementia.

Pam has BPN, fibrosis of the lung and verysevere lymphoedema. She has undergone trials for lymphoedema anddone a lot of research into treatment for the condition in the UK andAustralia. She feels very upset that she has given a great deal of timeand energy in trying to help R.A.G.E. members to give them some kind ofrelief from the quality of life they have all been reduced to, without anykind of consideration of their plight from the people who should havebeen helping.

She has told me that you might be willing to talk withme about your experience as a R.A.G.E. member. I'm working with my colleague on a project which has been funded by Macmillan Cancer Relief [now Macmillan Cancer Support]. Our aim is topull together the story of R.A.G.E.'s experience, by talking to a number ofpeople who were involved, either as members of R.A.G.E. or as otherkey stakeholders - for example, doctors and solicitors. At the end of theproject we'll produce a written report of all the different strands of thestory, based on what people tell us. A steering group, which includes two R.A.G.E. members (Jan Millington and Margaret Carling) is overseeing the project and will decide whoshould receive the report, and what should happen as a result. We'rehoping that at the very least this project will provide R.A.G.E. with a clearsummary of where they've got to, and what might be possible in thefuture. Everyone who takes part in the project will receive a copy of thereport. The project is at a very early stage - we're currently reading relevant documents. But a really important part of the project will be to listen tothe experience of some R.A.G.E. members, and to ask them what they'dlike this project to achieve. Jan Millington thought you would be a goodperson to talk to and I'm writing to ask you whether you would beprepared to meet with me to share your story. This would involve talkingwith me for maybe two hours, at a time and date to suit you. I can cometo your home, or I can meet you at Macmillan's offices in London, orelsewhere if that's easier for you. With your permission, I would like totape record our conversation, but would check this with you before webegan talking. I would not share anything you tell me with anyone elseexcept my colleague without your permission. I hope very much that you'll agree to talk with me, but appreciate that you may want to hear a bit more about the project, or about me, before youagree. You might also want to talk more about what you'd like from theproject before agreeing to take part. So I'd be very happy to come andsee you, or to talk with you over the phone, before you tell me your story.

The aim of this project is to pull together the story of R.A.G.E.'s experience from when it was first formed through to the present day. Weare planning to talk to a number of people who were involved either asmembers of R.A.G.E. or as other key stakeholders, including doctors andsolicitors. At the end of the project, we will write a report that pullstogether all the different strands to produce a single, coherent story thatmakes sense to all the people who were involved. We are expecting tofind out where people agree about what happened, where people havedifferent opinions about the story and why those differences exist. The report will describe the key events that took place, include some of the most memorable images and explore what lay behind criticalmoments along the way. It will also draw out general lessons for differentstakeholders - Macmillan, other patient advocacy groups, the medicalprofession and the Department of Health. We hope that others may thenbenefit from the lessons that R.A.G.E. has learned. A steering group, which includes two R.A.G.E. members, is overseeing this work. This group will decide what happens to the final report andwhat other action might be taken at the end of the project. Jane Maher,the Chief Medical Officer at Macmillan, is Chair of the steering group. Who is funding the project? The project is being funded by Macmillan Cancer Support [formerly Macmillan Cancer Relief]. When and how is it being done?
