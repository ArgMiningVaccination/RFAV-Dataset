Prior to initiating treatment, it is important to address and acknowledge several relevant issues regarding these treatment approaches. Treatment recommendations are evidence-based (treatment backed by scientific evidence) and take into consideration possible benefits as well as toxicities. We will need to verify your insurance information to ensure that we have the most recent data in our system. Please immediately notify us of any changes in your insurance coverage. Please note that your health insurance may not cover the cost of the recommended treatment or drug; therefore, we recommend that you contact your insurance provider to determine eligibility and in-network status. Kellogg Cancer Center Patient Financial Advocates will contact your insurance carrier to review coverage. If this treatment is not covered by your insurance, we will review other options to help with the financial burden, and appeals will be submitted when prior authorization is denied. Kellogg pharmacy staff will work with industry foundations to determine available resources, including free or reduced-cost drug and financial support. When applicable, efforts will also be made to obtain a drug on a \"compassionate use\" (use of an investigational product not approved by the FDA) basis. Confirmation of treatment schedules will be reliant upon approval status and/or drug availability.

Come to your first appointment 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time to complete the check-in process and have your lab work done. Please have your insurance and drug prescription cards with you. Eat a light breakfast at home. You may want to bring a light snack. Coffee, juice, tea and water are available in the treatment area. If you will be at the Kellogg Cancer Center's treatment area for an extended period, you may bring a small cooler or thermal lunch bag with food and beverages. Take your regular prescriptions that day, unless instructed otherwise by your oncologist. Please bring a complete list of your current medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and herbal supplements. It is recommended that you have someone drive you to your first appointment. You may want to arrange for child care for the entire day, so you can focus on yourself, your treatment and take time to ask any questions. This is not a day to feel rushed. If you are the main cook in the family, you may want to arrange to have dinner brought in or have someone else do the cooking tonight. Your nurse will review all medications given during your treatment and those you will take with you when you go home. You will receive a copy of your After Visit Summary, which includes home instructions and any return appointment details. You are encouraged to bring reading materials, a personal audio player, a laptop or a tablet. In addition, instructional videos are available on our interactive patient television system. Ask your nurse for details. All Kellogg Cancer Center locations have wireless internet connectivity available for your convenience. Our goal is to make this journey as smooth as possible. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you or your family.Your Treatment Kellogg Cancer CenterYour First Day of ChemotherapyYour Treatment 5 09/2021You can make daily or weekly notations, or just write down anything significant when it happens.

The healthy or normal cells that are most likely to be destroyed by the chemotherapy are those that are growing at a fast rate. You have three different kinds of blood cells: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. This section discusses precautions to take when you may develop a low white blood count or low platelets, because low blood counts can put you at greater risk for infections. Neutropenic Precautions What does it mean to have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) lower than 500? The normal neutrophil (a type of WBC) count is 2,500 to 6,000. When you have 1,000 or fewer neutrophils, your risk for infection is increased. When your ANC is lower than 500, you are at risk for getting a serious infection. This condition is called \"neutropenia.\" If you are neutropenic and develop a fever or signs of infection, contact your doctor immediately. You may be given antibiotics to fight the infection. The following list contains information to help you care for yourself while you are neutropenic: Check your temperature twice daily. Notify your nurse or doctor if you have a temperature above 100.4oF. Notify your doctor or nurse of any new redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage or odor on any part of your body, including your central line site. Shower or bathe daily. Perform mouth care every four hours, especially before and after meals. Wash your hands frequently. Many infections are transmitted through hands and things you touch. Washing your hands thoroughly is the most important thing you can do to prevent infection. Avoid having contact with crowds and people with active infections (like colds, flu and sore throats). Do not get manicures or pedicures. Use gloves when you do gardening. Avoid cleaning birdcages, cat litter boxes and fish tanks. Avoid hot tubs and Jacuzzis. Swim only in chlorinated swimming pools. If you cut or scrape your skin, wash it well with warm water and soap. Then apply a bandage. Use an electric shaver rather than a razor. This information is based on recommendations from the National Institutes of Health. (continued)Your Treatment Kellogg Cancer CenterTreatment PrecautionsYour Treatment 8 09/2021Platelet Precautions Your blood counts, including platelets, will be monitored prior to each chemotherapy treatment and other times as ordered by your physician. Platelets are the blood cells that enable your blood to clot. If your platelet count is low, you will be given specific guidelines on precautions that are applicable to your illness. These guidelines may include the following: Be careful with physical activities that could cause injury or bruising. Discuss with your physician or nurse prior to using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NAIDs), such as Advil or Motrin products. Avoid the use of razors and hard toothbrushes (electric razors and soft-bristled toothbrushes are good options). Report unusual bruising, heavy nosebleeds, blood in urine or excessive menstrual bleeding. Notify your oncologist or nurse if you are scheduled for any invasive medical or dental procedure. Anemia Precautions Anemia is caused by low levels of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin (HGB), the part of the red blood cells that delivers oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The normal HGB range is 13.0-17.0 gm/dL. Certain underlying conditions such as cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, hemorrhoids, surgery or other medical conditions increase the risk for developing anemia. Anemia symptoms can develop slowly without affecting normal activities because the body adjusts to low oxygen levels; however, when anemia becomes more severe, the body can no longer compensate and symptoms may become noticeable. Symptoms may include: Feeling tired, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, pale skin, irritability, shortness of breath, a coldness in your hands or feet, brittle nails, headache, loss of concentration and developing palpitations (feeling of heart racing). Severity of Anemia Severity: HGB Range: Symptoms: Mild 9.5-13.0 Often no signs or symptoms Moderate 8.0-9.5 May present with symptoms Severe < 8.0 Symptoms usually present Guidelines: Allow for adequate rest periods between activities; pace yourself. Get up slowly from a sitting or reclining position. This will lessen dizziness. Report persistent gasping, wheezing or difficulty breathing after doing strenuous work. Notify your physician or nurse if you experience unrelenting fatigue.Your Treatment Kellogg Cancer CenterTreatment PrecautionsYour Treatment 9 09/2021Please schedule all diagnostic tests ordered by your physician\u2014such as CAT scans, MRIs and PET scans\u2014within one or two days before your next visit with your medical oncologist. Your insurance policy may require preauthorization for diagnostic testing. The Kellogg Cancer Center Preauthorization Team will assist you in completing this authorization and may contact you with questions. This allows your physicians to give you the results for your tests in the most timely manner possible. If you schedule tests too far in advance of your physician visit, your physician must either delay the sharing of your results or relay your results via a phone call. Neither is our preferred method of communicating with you in a direct and timely manner. If you are a member of NorthShoreConnect, your test results will be released to you by your physician when reviewed or auto-released in three days. NorthShoreConnect will give you test values, but only your physician can interpret these values. If your appointment is within a day or two, your physician may choose not to release the tests to allow for discussion in person. In many cases with cancer patients, results that are automatically released and have \"abnormal\" values may be a reflection of the chemotherapy and other treatments and not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. You and your physician will discuss the meaning of the results, including whether treatment may be affecting the values. If you are not already a member, consider registering for NorthShoreConnect. This easy-to-use, online resource provides a gateway to all medical care you receive through NorthShore. It is a great way to stay in contact with your Kellogg Cancer Center care team.

A Mouth Care Assessment and Intervention Plan are provided if you experience oral complications from your cancer treatment. Your team\u2014including a dentist, pharmacist, medical oncology doctor and nurse\u2014will review and discuss the approach that is best for you. Your doctor or nurse will provide you with referrals as needed. Routine dental care should be performed by your regular dentist. You may wish to alert him or her that you are being treated at Kellogg Cancer Center. Note: Routine teeth cleaning should not be done while on chemotherapy. Discuss any planned dental work with your oncology doctor or nurse. Managing Mouth Sores Mouth sores are a common side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. However, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the mouth and throat, is made up of cells that divide rapidly. This is why the GI tract is especially susceptible to damage to the mouth (mouth sores) and/or throat, which is also called \"mucositis.\" Symptoms of mouth sores may occur three to 10 days following chemotherapy treatment. You may experience a burning sensation followed by redness and a sore (ulcer). Usually these sores are painful, which makes it difficult to eat or drink. It is important to let your nurse or doctor know if you get mouth sores, because you may need special medication to help you heal and control the pain. Preventing Mouth Sores Practice good oral hygiene: Rinse your mouth with a saltwater solution two or three times per day. Brush your teeth two or three times per day with a soft toothbrush. Your doctor may prescribe special medication to help you prevent mouth sores.Taking Care of Yourself Kellogg Cancer CenterDental InformationTaking Care of Yourself 5 09/2021For many patients, a cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event that can trigger emotions such as shock, fear, depression, anxiety and anger. Kellogg's Psychosocial Oncology Program addresses the psychological and social challenges of cancer and is committed to treating you as a whole person. Staffed by clinical social workers, counselors and master's-level interns, the program recognizes that managing emotional and practical needs is a vital part of coping with illness and promoting quality of life.

Psychosocial team members collaborate with your physicians and nurses to provide the best continuity of care available. The following services are available: Psychosocial assessment Ongoing supportive contact throughout treatment Psychotherapy Referrals to community resources (home care, support groups, transportation, psychotherapy) Crisis intervention Assistance with financial matters, insurance and related concerns Assistance with advance directives, including Living Wills and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Our aim is to provide a supportive atmosphere in which you and your family members can express concerns, hopes and fears.

Our definition of healing is expanded to include your mental, emotional and spiritual aspects, to improve your quality of life and achieve successful outcomes. Increasingly, patients are seeking ways to expand their conventional cancer treatment\u2014both during treatment and after treatment has been completed. Alternative therapies can relieve some of your anxiety and help you continue to feel empowered. Integrative medicine combined with conventional cancer therapy may be effective for you to significantly improve important factors for good quality of life\u2014energy, strength, appetite, digestive functioning, wellbeing and restful sleep. NorthShore's Integrative Medicine Program is one of the largest and most successful programs of its kind in the region. The team of board-certified physicians and alternative practitioners are committed to improv-ing your health through a broader approach to health and illness by embracing an expanded range of therapies including: Integrative medicine physician consultations. Traditional Asian medicine and acupuncture. Integrative counseling and stress relief strategies. Integrative bodywork, including various forms of massage.

At NorthShore, we know that the end of treatment is not the end of the cancer experience. With progress in treating cancer comes a new and unique challenge\u2014ensuring the long-term health of the nearly 18 million cancer survivors in the United States. That is why we have the Myra Rubenstein Weis Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program. About LIFE LIFE is NorthShore's Cancer Survivorship Program, designed to create a bridge for continued care of post-treatment cancer survivors back to their communities, their families and the primary care setting. LIFE was uniquely designed by its program director Carol A. Rosenberg MD, FACP, Director of Preventive Health Initiatives for NorthShore, to adhere to the guidelines proposed by the National Academy of Medicine and the Commission on Cancer. The LIFE Program, implemented in part through a Livestrong Foundation Community Cancer Survivorship Program Grant, is the first program of its type in the Northern Lake/Cook County area. The LIFE Program features an initial visit where treatment is risk-adapted by a specialized advanced practice oncology nurse in the Kellogg Cancer Centers. This visit features a customized Survivorship Care Plan, which is tailored to each cancer survivor as a unique individual and includes education regarding cancer diagnostic and treatment summary, follow-up and medical surveillance guidelines, long-term and late effects of the cancer treatments, healthy lifestyle practice recommendations, and directed navigation to health professional services and survivorship resources. Survivorship 101 An important aspect of the LIFE Program is the Myra Rubenstein Weis Survivorship 101 Seminar: Thrivership! This educational workshop and resource series is available to all in the community at large and is free of charge. It covers major topics of cancer survivorship and promotes the acquisition of skills to understand, select and navigate community-based survivor resources. The topics in the series\u2014 including nutrition, fitness, self-esteem, sexual intimacy, cognitive function, genetics, insurance and employment\u2014focus on the survivorship perspective. Programs are held at NorthShore Hospitals and the Cancer Wellness Center in Northbrook.

Tobacco use is most obviously linked to lung cancer but additionally is known to contribute significantly to the risk for many other cancers, including head and neck, pancreatic, bladder, kidney, stomach and uterine. While there is significant evidence that continued tobacco use after the diagnosis of cancer decreases the patient's chances of survival, reduces treatment efficacy, and increases treatment toxicity and the risk for recurrence, many cancer patients continue to smoke after diagnosis. At Kellogg Cancer Center, our diverse team of experts are certified as tobacco treatment specialists. Clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence recommend using the time of cancer diagnosis as a \"teachable moment\" for tobacco cessation. The combination of support from a trained professional and the use of tobacco cessation medications increases the chances of quitting successfully. The Tobacco Cessation Program is supporting the mission of the Kellogg Cancer Center to provide the highest level of care possible while supporting continued research and prevention efforts.

NorthShore has long been committed to research, spearheading and participating in clinical trials that allow many of our patients to participate in studies with the latest medications, procedures or therapies. Since 1983, NorthShore has been a key participant in clinical research. We have continued to serve as a focal point of the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored research that bridges the disciplines of medical oncology, surgery, gynecologic oncology and symptom management. We continue to benefit from the participation of outstanding leaders in each of these disciplines who remain active in research. Our involvement with the NCI, in conjunction with academic research institutions and our close relationships with multiple pharmaceutical industry leaders, provides our patients with access to more than 70 actively accruing research trials for 11 different disease sites. We have a dedicated staff of research nurses, each specializing in individual disease sites. As such, our patients benefit from each research staff member's in-depth knowledge of their specific disease. This means that the multidisciplinary team that designs your customized care plan can draw upon the research teams' specialized expertise about new therapies that may help you. For those with advanced cancers, the treatments and prevention therapies offered through clinical trials may provide a ray of hope when no other treatment options exist. NorthShore's Kellogg Cancer Center is uniquely qualified to bring both national cooperative group cancer treatment and studies to our community. We are truly committed to pioneering and promoting groundbreaking discoveries and speeding their translation from the laboratory to the bedside. The clinical trials program at Kellogg is fundamental to keeping NorthShore on the forefront of medical advancement. We truly believe that research will lead to a cure.Pioneering Research Kellogg Cancer CenterResearch and Clinical Trials09/2021Research and Clinical Trials 2 Four different types of clinical trials may be offered at NorthShore's Kellogg Cancer Center: Prevention Trials: Much of the promise for cancer prevention comes from observational studies conducted on large groups of people that show links between lifestyle factors or environmental exposures and specific cancer. Our prevention trials are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ways to reduce the risk of cancer. These studies can involve medications, vitamins or other supplements. Screening and Early Detection Trials: Family history may identify people with an increased risk of cancer or may serve as the first step in the identification of an inherited cancer predisposition that could cause a high lifetime risk of cancer. Our screening and early detection trials are designed to test new ways or find cancer in people before they have any cancer symptoms. These trials are generally conducted with people who are at greater risk of getting cancer because of their genetic make-up. Treatment Trials: Treatment trials are conducted with people who have already been diagnosed with cancer. Our treatment trials are designed to compare a new treatment with a standard treatment\u2014the best treatment currently known for a cancer\u2014based on the results of past research. In treatment trials, patients will receive (at the minimum) a standard treatment that is widely used and best known for patients who have that particular cancer. There are three types of treatment trials: Phase I trials\u2014Researchers test an experimental drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dose range and identify side effects. Phase II trials\u2014An experimental drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate safety and determine side effects. Phase III trials\u2014The experimental drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely. Cancer Control Trials: Cancer control trials, or supportive care trials, explore ways to improve the comfort and quality of life cancer patients and cancer survivors. Our cancer control trials study drugs to help reduce side effects of chemotherapy and other primary treatments. They also study beneficial effects of nutrition, group therapy or other alternative approaches.
