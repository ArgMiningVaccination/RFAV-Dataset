Holding ceremony with Cacao allows you to communicate with the Cacao Spirit, spirit animals and ancient energies of Mother Earth herself. Ceremonial host, Gemma Petherbridge, invites you to join a circle of like minded people wanting to reconnect, open up to their intuition and take time for self care. What to expect: Gemma will start by giving a brief introduction so you know what to expect throughout the event. After a small opening ceremony, everyone will be welcomed into the Circle, and Gemma will show you how to place crystals around your cacao so it can be imbued by the crystals energy, creating a Cacao Crystal Elixir. She will then talk about working with Cacao before allowing you space to enjoy your Cacao Crystal Elixir while she pulls some oracle cards for the group. Drinking Cacao is done slowly, in a meditative state, and usually takes 15 to 30 minutes. Once you have finished drinking, Gemma will invite you to lie down and relax, while she takes you through an enchanting reiki meditation so you can meet the Cacao Spirit and converse with your guides and higher self. Once you are brought out of the meditation, Gemma will stay with you, allowing time to journal and answer any questions you may have. What to bring: Please come in comfy clothes that will keep you warm through the ceremony. You are also welcome to bring any crystal you feel will enhance your experience. Plus your journal, pen and a bottle of water. (Drinking Cacao normally makes you thirsty so drink lots of water after.) Please note: If you are taking antidepressants, have a heart condition, epilepsy or are pregnant we recommend a small dose only. Alternatively you could hold your cup but not sip and follow the meditation, the heighted energy of the group practice will allow you to experience the plant's energy without having to consume it.

Please only take part in the event if you are physically able. If you are unsure for any reason please contact your doctor or mental health professional first for advice. About cacao: Please note that cacao contains theobromine which, as a stimulant, can have a similar effect to caffeine. If you are caffeine sensitive, please let us know and we can provide a smaller dose or an alternative drink. We would advise to avoid ingesting cacao if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or you take any heart Medic*tion or anti-depressants as they can react with the cacao.
