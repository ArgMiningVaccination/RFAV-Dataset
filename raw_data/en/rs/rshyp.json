This necessary evolution has many benefits but also has a shadow side. Individual humans are born into general humanity and have to learn that all other humans expect to be recognized as unique. Ironically then, the experience of our uniqueness is what we all have in common. The lessons needed to navigate this paradox successfully are unconsciously learned in the child / parent dyad relationships of the first three years of life. Adulthood requires that these early lessons be reviewed consciously. Methods for the conscious reassessment of early dyad relationships will be the focus of a twelve session online course given by Dennis Klocek. Interactive exercises with dyad partners will accompany presentations on the neurology of social interaction, the role of symbolic thinking, the esoteric structure of the soul and spirit, educational perspectives for special needs students and other topics relevant to the contemporary challenges of hyper-individuality in a social environment. This course is a set of four series which can be purchased individually or as a full course. Each session includes include exercises to practice with a partner. Part 1 - Soul and spirit The teachings of Rudolf Steiner about the role of the human \"I\" or True Self as a cosmic fulcrum between the spiritual world and the manifest world. The transformation of sentient soul into life spirit, mind soul into spirit self and consciousness soul into spirit human will be the focus. An exercise in storytelling with a partner accompanies the presentation. Part 2 - Soul to Soul The techniques of dyad work will be the focus of this session. Three tools useful for working with others are explained. The temperamental mandala as a fundamental archetypal pattern of change, the use of storytelling as transpersonal soul character and the use of an image toolbar useful for freedom of choice that avoids transference issues are explained and accompanied by exercises. Part 3 - Soul and Senses The neurological basis for memory and learning will be presented along with a set of alchemical medallions designed to elicit sensory responses. This is accompanied by dyad exercises. These patterns are the basis for autistic spectrum challenges. Part 4 - Soul and Myth The use of mythic themes as a basis for social dialogue is the focus of this session. The journey of the Sophia being from the Gnostic story of the Pistis Sophia is the base of dyad conversation exercises focused on the healing potential in myths. Part 5 - Soul and symbol A set of alchemical medallions forms the basis for dyad exercises designed to focus on how symbolic interpretation represents a healing potential available in the imaginal realm where dreams and manifest reality interact. Dream work is presented. Part 6 - Soul and Karma A twelve position mandala of human soul attitudes is the focus for exploring family of origin beliefs using dyad conversation exercises about karmic belief patterns inherited from Polarities of executive/manager, hermit/activist, journalist/historian, priest/actor, healer/technician, artist/agent are presented. Part 7 - Soul and Color The twelve-tone color wheel is presented as a tool for understanding some deeper aspects of the patterns by which relationships occur between people that either unite them or present potentials for conflict. From this point of view the soul can be seen as a colored flame. Artistic exercises for color meditations are presented. Part 8 - Soul and Suffering: The Flaming Door An age-old question has been, if the Divine Creator is all good what is the role of suffering for human beings? Suffering, sometimes known as the flaming door we all have to pass through, is the necessary cosmic balance for the joy of being a recipient of the gift of life and autonomous consciousness. Suffering serves to help humans evolve to higher states of consciousness. It is an awakener to more understanding and power to create out of ourselves. Without suffering there would be no impulse to do anything since life would quickly become terminally boring. Being terminally bored would offer no avenue to freedom, the most precious gift given to us. This workshop explores the role of storytelling and creative activity in dealing with suffering. Part 9 - Soul and Ceremony The use of personal ritual allows an individual to frame questions that can be directed to the spiritual world. Ceremony is a way for the soul to bring to consciousness the interface between eternal and temporal timeframes. Marking time with personal ritual makes use of the ancient concept that an activity that is initiated by conscious observance has a much better chance of unfolding in a positive way. This presentation addresses the three aspects of word, image and movement that constitute ritual. These principles are used to illustrate a ritual for anointing yourself or another that is accompanied by good wishes and requests for insights about life on earth and its relationship to eternal life. Part 10 - Soul and Death This session works with the speech of the Guardian of The Threshold as taught by Rudolf Steiner. The text is treated as a story using the storytelling mandala as a model. The various issues addressed by the speech of the Guardian are then used to form a storyline with the story relating to an episode in one's personal life where the nature of death became conscious. The story is then related to a personal selection from the themes of the speech. Sharing the written story with a dyad partner and revealing its root in one's biography is the exercise. Part 11 - Soul and Freedom Jumping mouse, the path of sacrifice This session works with the Native American tale of Jumping Mouse. This teaching story for children is a remarkably powerful lesson for the whole of life. You can work with a dyad partner using the storytelling mandala to parse out the transformation of a timid little mouse into a powerful self-sacrificing being. An episode is then selected that mirrors an event in your own biography that can be seen as a metaphor for your own search for higher sight. Part 12 - Soul and Initiation Overcoming despair, Hiawatha There are many variations of the story of Hiawatha. In this session the dynamic between Hiawatha and the sorcerer Ahutaro is the focus of an excerpt from the story. The moral compass of Hiawatha that is masterfully depicted in the various tales is a remarkable masterpiece of psychological aspects of the process of initiation. A sharing of one's own struggle to understand the relationship between despair and initiation follows.
