Panchakarma, a small therapeutic retreat for a maximum of 8 people, is the preeminent healing and detoxification process in traditional ayurvedic medicine. According to [ayurveda](/amrit-blog/vibrant-health/ayurveda-101/), this cleanse is one of the most effective treatments in healing disease, clearing toxins, and restoring balance to the body. Ayurveda believes all illness stems from toxin (ama) accumulation and energetic imbalances in the body and mind. Through the gentle, yet comprehensive purification offered in Panchakarma, these toxins are cleared and energies are brought into harmony. You will feel cleaner, energized, and more vibrant in body and mind. Whether you seek a simple seasonal re-balancing or an in-depth therapeutic evaluation for more serious concerns, this restorative cleanse will bring rejuvenation and healing. Our experienced wellness team has been leading the panchakarma cleansing retreat for over 19 years, and they have the expertise and respect to honor your self-care journey toward restoration. Join us for four days of purification, healing, and renewal. Who Manages the Program? The entire retreat is overseen and managed by the medical director of the [PureRejuv Wellness Center](/retreat-center/purerejuv-wellness-center/), Dr. Carrie Demers.

The treatments were excellent. The people here were amazing\u2014hard to name one thing! Also biofeedback\u2014awesome experience! This program enlightened me about matters concerning my diet, re-introduced me to yoga and meditation, and showed me how to self-manage my health concerns. Speaking with Dr. Carrie and learning ways to address my concerns about the changes in my body was so valuable to me. I feel like I can now connect cause and effect, and response. The yoga classes were phenomenal. I felt like the 4 classes we had have \"fed\" my practice enough to draw on them for months. This program has taught me to take time out of my day for yoga, and that it doesn't have to be difficult or painful. I also learned that Ayurvedic cooking can be amazingly flavorful and good. All of the staff working with us were excellent, compassionate, and...well, awesome! I am deeply relaxed, have a new interest in yoga, and am very excited to have had an intro to ayurvedic medicine.
