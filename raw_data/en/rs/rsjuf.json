One of the critical testing parameters skipped during Covid 19 shot development was 5-year data collection with human subjects. Given the vast short-term morbidity and mortality data that has already been collected for the Covid 19 shot, in addition to a plethora of personal testimonies and eyewitness accounts, since it was introduced, we should assume injury is occurring to the reproductive health of men, women, and the unborn (fetuses) as a result of direct exposure to the shot's contents. Mandatory exposure to an improperly tested pharmaceutical is a gross misuse of power and, in the case of the Covid 19 shot, threatens human health and safety. I appeal to you as a deeply concerned Maine citizen, please halt all mandatory subjection to the Covid 19 shot. The people of Maine need longitudinal data on the temporary and permanent effects of this man-made substance to their bodies, and their unborn babies, to make an educated decision on whether to voluntarily receive the Covid 19 shot. Thank you for your consideration to this statement in support of this bill. "}
