This section may be cited as the ``Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996''. Subsection 1. Findings. Congress finds that\u00d0 (1) the use of children in the production of sexually explicit material, including photographs, films, videos, computerimages, and other visual depictions, is a form of sexual abusewhich can result in physical or psychological harm, or both,to the children involved; (2) where children are used in its production, child pornog- raphy permanently records the victim's abuse, and its continuedexistence causes the child victims of sexual abuse continuingharm by haunting those children in future years; (3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of seducing other children into sexual activity; a child whois reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, orto pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes beconvinced by viewing depictions of other children ``having fun''participating in such activity; (4) child pornography is often used by pedophiles and child sexual abusers to stimulate and whet their own sexualappetites, and as a model for sexual acting out with children;such use of child pornography can desensitize the viewer tothe pathology of sexual abuse or exploitation of children, sothat it can become acceptable to and even preferred by theviewer; (5) new photographic and computer imagining technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or othermeans, visual depictions of what appear to be children engagingin sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishableto the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographicimages of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (6) computers and computer imaging technology can be used to\u00d0 (A) alter sexually explicit photographs, films, and vid- eos in such a way as to make it virtually impossible forunsuspecting viewers to identify individuals, or to deter-mine if the offending material was produced using children; (B) produce visual depictions of child sexual activity designed to satisfy the preferences of individual childmolesters, pedophiles, and pornography collectors; and (C) alter innocent pictures of children to create visual depictions of those children engaging in sexual conduct;(7) the creation or distribution of child pornography which includes an image of a recognizable minor invades the child'sprivacy and reputational interests, since images that are cre-ated showing a child's face or other identifiable feature ona body engaging in sexually explicit conduct can haunt theminor for years to come; (8) the effect of visual depictions of child sexual activity on a child molester or pedophile using that material to stimu-late or whet his own sexual appetites, or on a child wherethe material is being used as a means of seducing or breakingdown the child's inhibitions to sexual LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 is the same whether the child pornography consists of photo- graphic depictions of actual children or visual depictions pro-duced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or othermeans, including by computer, which are virtually indistin-guishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic imagesof actual children; (9) the danger to children who are seduced and molested with the aid of child sex pictures is just as great when thechild pornographer or child molester uses visual depictionsof child sexual activity produced wholly or in part by electronic,mechanical, or other means, including by computer, as whenthe material consists of unretouched photographic images ofactual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (10)(A) the existence of and traffic in child pornographic images creates the potential for many types of harm in thecommunity and presents a clear and present danger to all children; and (B) it inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child pornographers who prey on children, thereby increas-ing the creation and distribution of child pornography andthe sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children who arevictimized as a result of the existence and use of these mate-rials; (11)(A) the sexualization and eroticization of minors through any form of child pornographic images has a deleteriouseffect on all children by encouraging a societal perception ofchildren as sexual objects and leading to further sexual abuseand exploitation of them; and (B) this sexualization of minors creates an unwholesome environment which affects the psychological, mental and emo-tional development of children and undermines the efforts ofparents and families to encourage the sound mental, moraland emotional development of children; (12) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornog- raphy will encourage the possessors of such material to ridthemselves of or destroy the material, thereby helping to protectthe victims of child pornography and to eliminate the marketfor the sexual exploitative use of children; and (13) the elimination of child pornography and the protection of children from sexual exploitation provide a compellinggovernmental interest for prohibiting the production, distribu-tion, possession, sale, or viewing of visual depictions of childrenengaging in sexually explicit conduct, including both photo-graphic images of actual children engaging in such conductand depictions produced by computer or other means whichare virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer fromphotographic images of actual children engaging in such con-duct.

SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996''. SEC. 602. FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the secu-rity, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its part-ners in the Alliance. (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to anynation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include asfull and equal members emerging democracies in Central andEastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and securityin Europe by fostering their integration into the structureswhich have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945.Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation.America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked tothe security of the countries of Europe. (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratictransformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members ofthe Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressingthe security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creatingthe stable environment needed for those emerging democraciesin Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete politicaland economic transformation. (4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democ-racies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to Europeanpeace and security. (5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace pro-gram an important forum to foster cooperation between NATOand those countries seeking NATO membership. (6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occa- sions since 1949. (7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new mem- bers to NATO and the European Union at an early date andhas sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new membersinto NATO. (8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies inCentral and Eastern Europe into existing European structures,but also the eventual economic and political integration ofthese countries into existing European structures. (9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability inEurope should be shared more widely. Facilitation of theenlargement process will require current members of NATO,and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the politicalwill needed to build on successful ongoing programs such asthe Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by makingNATOEnlargementFacilitation Actof 1996.22 USC 1928note.110 STAT. 3009\u00b1174 PUBLIC LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospec- tive new members are themselves undertaking. (10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under theNorth Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949(hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Washington Treaty''). (11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joiningNATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATOmembership, the United States should encourage and supportefforts by such countries to develop force structures and forcemodernization priorities that will enable such countries tocontribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, mostimportantly, territorial defense of the Alliance. (12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that haveexpressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peace-keeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint PeacekeepingForce, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can makean important contribution to European peace and security andinternational peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countriespreparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO mem-bership, and accordingly should receive appropriate supportfrom the United States. (13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organiza- tion capable of conducting effective military operations andpreserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region. (14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between membersof the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurredbetween two Alliance member states since the inception ofNATO in 1949. (15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a positionto further the principles of the Washington Treaty wouldcontribute to international peace and enhance the security ofthe region. Countries which have become democracies andestablished market economies, which practice good neighborlyrelations, and which have established effective democraticcivilian control over their defense establishments and attaineda degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluatedfor their potential to further the principles of the WashingtonTreaty. (16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those statesinterested in possible NATO membership. (17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security,and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, thehuman rights records of the emerging democracies in Centraland Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to theircommitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obliga-tions of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles ofthe Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the HelsinkiFinal Act. (18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken110 STAT. 3009\u00b1175 PUBLIC LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities. (19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. AsNATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the UnitedStates and NATO should continue to examine means tostrengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of UnitedNations recognized countries in that region. (20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify atthe same pace, the accession date for each new member willvary. (21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready forcloser ties with NATO and should be designed to assist othercountries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move for-ward toward eventual NATO membership. (22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have madesignificant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth insection 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 andshould be eligible for the additional assistance described inthis Act. (23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe shouldbe based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteriafor NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO'ssecurity and the approval of all NATO members. (24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consen- sus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO membersand ratification in accordance with their constitutional proce-dures. (25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their terri-tory although they are accorded the full collective securityguarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclearweapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularlyin the current security climate. However, NATO retains theright to alter its security posture at any time as circumstanceswarrant. SEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY. It is the policy of the United States\u00d0 (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold Warworld; (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countriesmay eventually qualify for NATO membership; (3) to support the enlargement of NATO in recognition that enlargement will benefit the interests of the United Statesand the Alliance and to consider these benefits in any analysisof the costs of NATO enlargement; (4) to ensure that all countries in Central and Eastern Europe are fully aware of and capable of assuming the costs110 STAT. 3009\u00b1176 PUBLIC LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 and responsibilities of NATO membership, including the obliga- tion set forth in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty thatnew members be able to contribute to the security of the NorthAtlantic area; and (5) to work to define a constructive and cooperative political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and theRussian Federation. SEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGE- MENT OF NATO. It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Roma-nia, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine\u00d0 (1) the United States should continue and expand its sup- port for the full and active participation of these countriesin activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO membership; (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic means available to press the European Union to admit assoon as possible any country which qualifies for membership; (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should continue and expand their supportfor military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between andamong these nations, nations of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, and Russia; and (4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be lim-ited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the CzechRepublic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance. SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA AND LITHUANIA. In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithua- nia into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-RibbentropPact and the refusal of the United States and other countriesto recognize that incorporation for over 50 years, it is the senseof the Congress that\u00d0 (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns that must be taken into account by the UnitedStates; and (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be disadvan- taged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorpo-ration into the Soviet Union.

TITLE VIII\u00d0FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE This title may be cited as the ``Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.'' SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. (a) F INDINGS .\u00d0The Congress finds the following: (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progresshas been made in recent years, Federal accounting standardshave not been uniformly implemented in financial managementsystems for agencies. (2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal prac-tices have failed to\u00d0 (A) identify costs fully;(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and (C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the fullcosts of programs and activities. The continued use of thesepractices undermines the Government's ability to provide credi-ble and reliable financial data and encourages already wide-spread Government waste, and will not assist in achievinga balanced budget. (4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the govern-ment and reduce the federal Government's ability to addressvital public needs adequately. (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Fed- eral Government, and restore public confidence LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 Government, agencies must incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Govern-ment into their financial management systems so that all theassets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses,and the full costs of programs and activities of the FederalGovernment can be consistently and accurately recorded, mon-itored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Govern-ment. (6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred toas the ``FASAB'') has made substantial progress toward develop-ing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting con-cepts and standards for the Federal Government. When theaccounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB areincorporated into Federal financial management systems, agen-cies will be able to provide cost and financial information thatwill assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluatethe cost and performance of Federal programs and activities,and will therefore provide important information that has beenlacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financialmanagers and the Congress. (7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, overthe long term, improve Federal financial management.(b) P URPOSE \u00d0The purposes of this Act are to\u00d0 (1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standardsthroughout the Federal Government; (2) require Federal financial management systems to sup- port full disclosure of Federal financial data, including thefull costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens,the Congress, the President, and agency management, so thatprograms and activities can be considered based on their fullcosts and merits; (3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal financial management; (4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Fed- eral Government financial management; (5) establish financial management systems to support controlling the cost of Federal Government; (6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101\u00b1576; 104 Stat 2838), the Govern-ment Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103\u00b162 107 Stat. 285) and the Government Management ReformAct of 1994 (Public Law 103\u00b1356; 108 Stat. 3410); and (7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports that comparespending of resources to results of activities.

MAIL-ORDER BRIDE BUSINESS. (a) F INDINGS .\u00d0The Congress finds as follows: (1) There is a substantial ``mail-order bride'' business in the United States. With approximately 200 companies in theUnited States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 men in the UnitedStates find wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year.However, there are no official statistics available on the numberof mail-order brides entering the United States each year. (2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business earn substantial profits. (3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests thatmail-order brides find themselves in abusive relationships.There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial numberof mail-order marriages are fraudulent under United Stateslaw. (4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-order brides who are battered often think that if they fleean abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often the citizenspouse threatens to have them deported if they report theabuse. (5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals andUnited States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for perma-nent residence is 8 percent. It is unclear what percentage of these marriage fraud cases originate as mail-order marriages.(b) I NFORMATION DISSEMINATION .\u00d0 (1) R EQUIREMENT .\u00d0Each international matchmaking organization doing business in the United States shall dissemi-nate to recruits, upon recruitment, such immigration and natu-ralization information as the Immigration and NaturalizationService deems appropriate, in the recruit's native language,including information regarding conditional permanent resi-dence status and the battered spouse waiver under such status,permanent resident status, marriage fraud penalties, theunregulated nature of the business engaged in by suchorganizations, and the study required under subsection (c).

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF NEW BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL SALES TAX. (a) F INDINGS .\u00d0The Congress finds as follows: (1) In July 1993, Canadian customs officers began collecting an 11 percent New Brunswick provincial sales tax on goodspurchased in the United States by New Brunswick residents,an action that has caused severe economic harm to UnitedStates businesses located in proximity to the border with NewBrunswick. (2) This impediment to cross-border trade compounds the damage already done from the Canadian Government's imposi-tion of a 7 percent tax on all goods bought by Canadiansin the United States. (3) Collection of the New Brunswick provincial sales tax on goods purchased outside of New Brunswick is effected onlyalong the United States-Canadian border, not along New Bruns-wick's borders with other Canadian provinces; the tax is thusbeing administered by Canadian authorities in a manneruniquely discriminatory to Canadians shopping in the UnitedStates. (4) In February 1994, the United States Trade Representa- tive publicly stated an intention to seek redress from thediscriminatory application of the New Brunswick provincialsales tax under the dispute resolution process in chapter 20of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), butthe United States Government has still not made such a claimunder NAFTA procedures. (5) Initially, the United States Trade Representative argued that filing a New Brunswick provincial sales tax claim wasdelayed only because the dispute mechanism under NAFTAhad not yet been finalized, but more than a year after suchmechanism has been put in place, the claim has still not beenput forward by the United States Trade Representative.(b) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u00d0It is the sense of the Congress that\u00d0 (1) the provincial sales tax levied by the Canadian province of New Brunswick on Canadian citizens of that province whopurchase goods in the United States\u00d0 (A) raises questions about a possible violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the discrimina-tory application of the tax to cross-border trade with theUnited States; and (B) damages good relations between the United States and Canada; and(2) the United States Trade Representative should move forward without further delay in seeking redress under the110 STAT. 3009\u00b1716 PUBLIC LAW 104\u00b1208\u00d0SEPT. 30, 1996 dispute resolution process in chapter 20 of the North American Free Trade Agreement for the violation.
