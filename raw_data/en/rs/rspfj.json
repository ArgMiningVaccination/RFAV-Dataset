From my point of view the results for physicians were positive, even though there is a lot of work to do. The DCMA would like to recognize the leadership of the Miami-Dade County Legislative Delegation for delivering several bills that will have a beneficial impact on our members. Your DCMA was heavily involved in advocating for our legislative agenda this session. Through different initia-tives and events, we were able to engage our elected offi-cials on issues of importance to our members. The end result of our efforts is that a good number of our priori-ties moved through the process and have either become law or are awaiting the Governor's signature. The following are our priority issues that passed this legislative session: SB 7014 - COVID-19-related Claims Against Health Care Providers - SB 7014 extends the length of time that health care providers receive certain liability protec tions from Volume 18 Issue 10 $5.00 April 2022PRSRT STD U.S. Postage PAID West Palm Beach, FL Permit #4595 THE REGION'S MONTHLY NEWSPAPER FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS & PHYSICIANS Continued on page 5 Continued on page 13 Continued on page 17 TM See pages 21-28 Continued on page 8MALPRACTICE INSURANCE Increasing Cyberattacks Driving Up Cyber Insurance Rates Page 5 OUR 18TH YEAR SERVING THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY! DCMA Advances Legislation Important to Physicians Dr. Jose David Suarez BY DANIEL CASCIATO Aurelio M. Fernandez, III, FACHE, CEO of Memorial Healthcare, will retire at the end of April after six years leading one of the state's largest healthcare net-works, which includes six hospitals, urgent care centers, a nursing home and 14,000 full-time employees. Fernandez says he was ready to step down after a 45-year career in healthcare. \"We have a gem here in south Florida,\" he says. \"Memorial has been providing the highest quality of care that is immeasurable, not just in our county , but south Florida. We should be very proud to have that kind of resource in our backyard.\" Reflecting back on his tenure, one thing that surprised him was how coop-erative all of the hospitals in the system were during the pandemic. \"Before the vaccines became available, when we were in the middle of the pan-demic, all area hospitals collaborated and helped each other,\" Fernandez says. The pandemic of the past two years was certainly the most challenging time, he admits. \"We found ourselves in uncharted waters,\" he says. \"But we came out extremely well in providing the communi-ty we serve with the safest possible envi-ronment. We also did everything we need-ed to do to have a safe environment, such as providing PPEs for our physi cians, Aurelio Fernandez Retires as Memorial Healthcare CEOSteven VANESSA ORR When Arianna Silcott Lo, HCMBA, LSSGB, decided to pursue a career in healthcare, she had a number of role mod-els to follow , including her mother, who was a nurse for 30 years; her aunt, a nurse for 20 years; and her uncle, who was a doctor. But it wasn't until she joined the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) that she realized how many other healthcare paths there were to explore. \"ACHE's mentoring program was very important to me because it showed me how many different ways there are to get into healthcare, and how many different routes you can take,\" explained Silcott Lo, whose original plan was to study to become a trauma surgeon. \"It helped me to figure out what my niche was. \"I'm more interested in operations and strategic planning, but someone else might be more interested in the financial aspects of healthcare or supply chain management,\" she continued. \"Working with mentors in the field can help you figure out what route is most beneficial for you.\" Silcott Lo, who is ACHE of South Florida's 2022 Student Service chair-elect, is current- ly a doctoral student in health administration at Franklin University , where she works as a research assistant. She earned her MBA in healthcare from Florida International University and her bachelor's degree in healthcare administration from the University of Central Florida. Arianna Silcott Lo BY STEVEN SHILL According to the 2022 BDO Healthcare CFO Outlook Survey , which polled 100 healthcare industry CFOs with revenues ranging from $250 million to $3 billion in October 2021, 63% of healthcare organiza-tions are thriving, but 34% are just surviv-ing. And while healthcare CFOs have an optimistic outlook - 82% expect to be thriving in one year - they'll need to make changes this year if they're going to reach their revenue goals. To prevent and solve for financial distress, CFOs need to review and address the underlying causes. Otherwise, they might find themselves falling short of expectations in the year ahead. Below are six ways the industry can relieve its financial strains. 1. Staffing Shortages 40% of healthcare CFOs say retaining key talent is a top workforce challenge in 2022. How can you avoid a labor shortage? Think about increasing wages for your frontline staff, especially your nurses. You could also reconsider the benefits you're offering and ask yourself what offerings would be attractive for your frontline staff. For example, whether you offer free child-care could mean the difference between your staff staying and walking out for another employment opportunity . 2. Budget Forecasting 45% of healthcare organizations will undergo a strategic cost reduction exercise in 2022 to meet their profitability goals. How else can you cut costs? One option is to adopt a zero-based approach to budget-ing this year. This allows you to build your budget from the ground up and find new areas to adjust costs to free up resources.

You can reach Charles Felix at Charles@southfloridahospitalnews.com Charles Felix Publisher's NotePublisher's Note First, let me say Happy Easter and Good Pesach to all those among us who observe and celebrate. And if I've left out any other holiday celebration, my apologies but my addled brain can only do so much. Why am I addled, you might ask? (At least more than normal, Carol might add.) You see I just got off a \"thrilling\" airboat ride in unseasonably cool weather right after a heavy thunder-storm. No, Carol and I didn't succumb to a sudden impulse to explore the Everglades. Instead, I was guilted (per usual) into the excursion by my visiting son Josh who insisted it would be a fun experience for my youngest grandson Wyatt, promising him his first up-close alligator encounter. So off we went accompanied by Josh's wife Tori and my youngest sibling Shari. Carol (who pos-sesses no accessible guilt gene), of course, pleaded the work excuse since her last visit to the Everglades had ended in a mosquito swarm. It's funny , when I think of an airboat trip I think about alligators, fish, turtles. But the one thing I completely forgot about was that it's really all about the birds. And if there is one thing my sister Shari has always been freaked out by - it is birds. This is a woman who won't even walk into a Pet Supermarket because of the caged parakeets. But as the tour proceeded, it quickly became apparent she was in for some serious \"cold turkey\" trauma treatment. I can hon-estly say Shari probably is the first person on an Everglades tour who never opened her eyes because it was birds on steroids. But with Shari on the verge of hysteria and Wyatt totally discouraged by the lack of alligators, one lone reptile finally saved the day . Now I don't want to cast aspersions on our tour guy , but just when we thought all was lost, he steered us into a completely vacant swamp area just in time to see one lone gator raise his pointed stout, take a big yawn and re-submerge. (Between you and me, I think the gator's brother does time at the Jungle Cruise ride in Disneyworld.) But mission accomplished, we came, we saw a gator, and Shari's therapy for ornithophobia will continue.

South Broward Hospital District, Board of CommissionersSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com April 2022 5BY VANESSA ORR It is imperative that healthcare companies carry cyber insurance; after all, protecting patients' medical records is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately , as the threat of cyberat-tacks, including malware and ransomware increases, so do the rates for this essential coverage. \"We are now seeing our healthcare clients face cyber insurance renewal rate increases of between 45-90 percent,\" explained Matt Gracey , manag-ing director, Risk Strategies / Danna-Gracey . \"Within the last three to four months, this coverage has gone complete-ly crazy with much higher pricing, much more restrictive underwriting and more requirements placed on clients\u2014like hav-ing multifactor authentication now as a base requirement for coverage\u2014in prac-tices of every size. \"This was happening even before the Russia/Ukraine situation and increasingly high threats of Russian cyberattacks on America,\" he added. \"Healthcare is the number one attacked industry in the cyberattack world, and we have to consid-er the fact that we could face severe dis-ruptions in its delivery .\" Gracey noted that in 2017, hospitals in England and Scotland had to shut down emergency room care as the result of cyberattacks caused by WannaCry ran-somware. \"And those were more 'normal' times,\" he said. \"These are extraordinarily fearful times in the cyber-warfare world.\" In the past, the healthcare industry was mainly concerned with ransomware, but cyber experts are now predicting that ran-somware attacks will decrease while more broad attacks designed to create havoc in the healthcare system will increase. \"To complicate the picture, not only have ransomware attacks been out of con-trol for the last year, but now we have the Russians making cyberattack threats, and pro-grams with zero-click vulner-abilities,\" said Gracey . \"These are really nasty programs, such as SolarWinds and Pegasus, where there is no action needed on the user's part for cyber criminals to enter into their system. \"Layer all of this together, and it shows how vulnerable we have become and how important it is to make sure that the defenses we do have are up and function-ing as fully as possible,\" he added. Gracey advises companies to focus on Cyber Hygiene 101\u2014making sure they have installed effective anti-virus pro-grams with strong passwords, and check-ing that their cybersecurity is updated. \"Many practices install good cyber secu- rity but forget to update the systems,\" he said. \"This is critically important to pro-tecting yourself from cyber criminals.\" As cyber threats continue to rise, so will the cost of insurance coverage. \"Cyber insurance companies are in uncharted territory because there is not enough good actuarial data on cyberat-tacks to be able to make sound forecasts of where the rates should be in order to han-dle the risk exposure,\" said Gracey . \"It's not like we have 50 years of automobile accident data, which makes it easy to determine the monetary risk. In the cyber world, there is no credible data to decide what we're facing and what the rates for coverage should be. \"Five years ago, experts predicted that cyber insurance for healthcare would become more expensive than malpractice insurance,\" he added. \"I'm afraid we're now seeing a march toward that trend.\" For more information, contact Matt Gracey at 800-966-2120 or visit www.dannagracey.com.

When it affects specific communities more than others, those actions must address the issues in order to improve the health of our children. So what disease are we talking about? It's asthma, a chronic illness of the lower airways, which causes the airways to become inflamed and hyperactive, and produce extra mucus, resulting in cough-ing and wheezing as the children try to breathe. Asthma can range in severity and there can be acute exacerbations - sudden acute \"attacks.\" Parents need to be attuned to the early warning signs, which are exercise intol-erance, night-time cough, chronic day cough, tightness in the chest, and lower tolerance for physical activity . Genetics, environment, and diet can all play a role in developing asthma. Asthma Risk Children can be born with a genetic predisposition for asthma. This is partic-ularly apparent in African-American and Puerto Rican communities, which have a higher prevalence in Florida. Environmental and diet issues are also significant risk factors for people living in low-income and inner-city areas. Children in those communities may be exposed to mold and cockroaches, which are strong allergy triggers. Families may not have air conditioning to help clear airborne allergens. Diet-wise, children may not have easy access to healthier food choices or be aware that their diet is exacerbating their breathing problems. Processed foods and products with artifi-cial colors and flavors (which also tend to be cheaper) may worsen respiratory symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma Identifying asthma is not always straight forward. For example, adoles-cents with asthma are often undercount-ed, as are children under five. Adolescents are working on their inde- pendence and may not always recognize or report symptoms to their parents or physician. They also may not be as com-pliant about taking medications. Teens also usually have great lung capacity . Even if they have mild-to-moderate asth-ma, it might not be evident until they have an exacerbation. In preschoolers, diagnosing asthma can be difficult because physicians must rely on symptoms, physical exams, and family history; lung function is difficult to assess in this age group. Usually , asth-ma cannot be diagnosed before age two, although an earlier diagnosis is possible when an infant has signs of food and environmental allergies and recurrent wheezing. School-age children with asthma are the easiest to identify because it is easier to docu-ment their symptoms, do testing, and parents, teach-ers, and other adults involved in their lives can report anything untoward. More Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment There is another possible barrier to diagnosis and treatment, aside from age: access to healthcare. Even if families do have a primary care physician (PCP), they might not be able to get to the doctor's office because of transporta-tion or scheduling issues. When this happens, parents may bring their sick child to an urgent care center, often as symptoms become significantly worse than they would be had they gone earlier to their PCP . Their child will be treated, but usually only with medica-tions to treat the immediate issue, not the underlying problem. This leads to the last barrier to effec- tive treatment: the medications physi-cians are allowed to prescribe. Most asth-ma medications available on Medicaid and some commercial insurance formu-laries only decrease the symptoms. These drugs don't treat the airway hyper responses and inflammation that caused the symptoms. There are very effective medication inhalers that do address the causes, but they aren't covered. And so starts the cycle of symptoms and treat-ment - but not prevention. Multi-Pronged Approaches to Care Unfortunately , little in Florida has changed over the past 20 years when it comes to identifying and treating chil-dren with asthma. The American Lung Association has been working with schools, teaching kids about asthma, and getting parents involved. School nurses do help. The state is working with hospital emergency rooms and urgent care clinics to identify patients who may be \"frequent flyers.\" And since asthma often runs in families, identifying patients can also impact sib-lings or even adults who were never diag-nosed. But this is not enough. The Take-Away Asthma is treatable through the use of preventative medications and by modify-ing risk factors. More efforts are needed to support parents who have children with asthma and provide preventive medicines to help control it. Vaccines against influenza and pneumonia help prevent exacerbations in adults and chil-dren. Asthma isn't curable; it doesn't go away . But good management can reduce the frequency of asthma symptoms for weeks, months, and even years.

Back in college, in addition to a full class schedule and many activities on campus, I had three part time jobs. One job was work-study making copies for minimum wage at the local high school. The second was as a food server at a popular local restaurant. Third was as a hockey referee. All three incentivized me dif-ferently . For the first job, no matter how good a job I did printing out daily assignments for teachers, it paid the same. Ten hours per week times $x.xx per hour. The second job's take home pay was largely based on tips. Depending on how good a job I did taking care of customers determined how much I took home each week. As far as referee, the better you were, the higher the level game you got to officiate, and it would pay more. Therefore, I worked hard to become good enough to do the high school and college games to earn more. So how do you incentivize your people? Do you have folks who spend a ton of time interacting with patients and their families, but are incentivized the same way a 19-year-old gets incen-tivized to run a Xerox copier? Are there opportunities to earn a little extra for taking better care of people, like my time spent as a waiter? Is your organization like the people who assigned us the hockey games, where the ones who are the best at what they do get the best assignments? You get the point. Sometimes when, 'it all pays the same', the same is exactly what you get from your team. Whether it be simple recognition, small bonuses, or a big part of their compensation, look for ways to tie compen-sation to desired results. Coming out of COVID, the organizations who truly reconnect with their patients the quickest will win. Getting your entire team aligned behind that cause will pay huge dividends.

The net result of the bill is to extend the liability protections for about 14 months, from March 29, 2022, to June 1, 2023. Loan Forgiveness for Physicians Practicing in Areas of Critical Need - While the Legislature pursues mecha-nisms to ensure access to care in under-served areas, the state already had the statutory framework to provide loan forgiveness for physicians who serve in those communities. The Legislature provided $10 million in the budget this year to provide loan forgiveness for physicians, nurses, and dentists practic-ing in underserved communities. HB 817 - Emergency Medical Care and Treatment to Minors Without Parental Consent - The bill authorizes physicians licensed under chapters 458 or 459, F .S., to provide emergency med-ical care or treatment to a minor with-out parental consent. This allows physi-cians to provide such care in prehospital settings, similar to EMTs and para-medics, or in hospital settings. SB 312 - Telehealth - Allows a tele- health provider to issue a renewal pre-scription for a controlled substance list-ed in Schedule III, IV , or V of s. 893.03, F .S., through telehealth, within the scope of his or her practice, and in accordance with other state and federal laws. HB 459 - Step-therapy Protocols - The bill defines \"step therapy protocol\" as a protocol or program that establishes the specific sequence in which prescription drugs, medical procedures, or courses of treatment must be used to treat a health condition. The bill requires an insurer or HMO to publish on its web-site, and provide to an insured in writ-ing, a procedure for an insured patient and health care provider to request a protocol exemption. The DCMA also helped discourage the consideration of bills such as wrongful death expansions and scope of practice bills that could be harmful to patients and physicians. While this is a summary of our prior- ity bills, there were a number of other health care bills that passed this session. I invite our members to go to our web-site (www.miamimed) to find more information about our performance during the 2022 Legislative Session. One way we all can continue to advo- cate for the profession is by joining the Dade County Medical Association and the Dade County Medical Association-PAC. This is your seat at the table as we address those issues that impact the patient/physician relationship. We must work together as a critical mass of pro-fessionals concerned with healthcare services in Miami-Dade County . Dr. Jose David Suarez is President, Dade County Medical Association, Inc.

South e available to r og grams ar l pr Depending on which side you ask (i.e., the employer or the individual physician), you may hear two different perspectives on the legitima-cy and necessity of non-competition agreements for physicians. On the employer side, the argument is that the business provides specialized training on its unique method of pro-viding patient care and med-ical services, spends a lot of money on marketing and building an infrastructure to generate leads for new patients, builds relationships with its patients and referral networks, compensates its physicians very well, and because it wants to retain its physicians and deter them from joining competitors. Healthcare business owners understand- ably do not want to spend all the time and money to train physicians and/or to gener-ate patients for the physicians to wind up \"stealing\" the medical practice's business model and/or patients. From a physician's perspective, they want what everyone wants - freedom to do what they want, where they want, and in an unrestricted fashion. Physicians spend countless hours handling challenging patient scenarios in unique settings and would like the flexibility to consider alter-native settings which better suit their indi-vidual goals and interests without jeopard-izing losing their ability to service patients. Regardless of anyone's perspective or opinion, as of today , restrictive covenants for physicians in Florida are still legiti-mate, enforceable, and pret-ty commonplace in the healthcare setting. The key omission from these perspectives is whether these agreements impair patient care? Many physician employ- ment agreements also con-tain non-solicitation provi-sions which typically restrict the physician from \"solicit-ing\" former patients of the practice for a period of time post-employment (i.e., typi- cally between 1-2 years). Some non-solicitation provisions are written in such a way to prevent (or at least deter) the physician from servicing or accepting such patients altogether for an extended period of time. Thus, as a practical matter, if a physician leaves a medical practice, patients of such physician will be left with the option of working with a new physician from the same medical practice or trying to contin-ue receiving service from the departing physician at the risk of the departing physician potentially violating his or her agreement. In Florida, restrictive covenant agree- ments are governed by Florida Statutes (Chapter 542) and can be enforceable so long as the provisions are supported by at least one legitimate business interest (i.e., the protection of trade secrets, valuable confidential information or professional information, substantial relationships with specific patients, patient goodwill associat-ed with an ongoing business or profession-al practice, or extraordinary or specialized training) . While there are sentiments at the federal level to outlaw non-competes altogether and in Florida, Governor DeSantis did pass a law in 2019 (Fla. Stat. 542.336) which prohibits certain forms of restrictive covenants in the healthcare setting (i.e. where there is a medical \"specialty\" involved and an entity that essentially employees all physicians in that specialty within the same county), the vast majority of healthcare settings are not covered by this new statutory limitation. As such, medical practice owners and employers in healthcare can and still enter into restrictive covenant agreements as a regular part of their employment process. Interestingly , for attorneys (in the State of Florida), non-competition agreements are prohibited as the Florida Bar rules have clear prohibitions against restricting a lawyer's right to practice and a client's right to choose its attorney . Notably , Rule 4-5-6 of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar states that a lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: (a) a partnership, shareholders, operat- ing, employment, or other similar type of agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement con-cerning benefits upon retirement; or (b) an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer's right to practice is part of the settlement of a client controversy . In the Comments to this Rule, the Florida Bar also notes that \"an agreement restricting the right of lawyers to practice after leaving a firm not only limits their professional autonomy , but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer\" and that \"severance agreements, on the other hand, that contain punitive clauses, the effect of which are to restrict competition or encroach upon a client's inherent right to select counsel, are prohibited.\" Further, Rule 4.5-8 (b) (which is the rule which governs procedures for lawyers leaving law firms) states that \"Clients have the right to expect that they may choose counsel when legal services are required and, with few exceptions, nothing that lawyers and law firms do affects the exer-cise of that right.\" Thus, the Florida Bar quite clearly takes into account client interests in that pro-hibits agreements which in any manner interfere with the rights of a lawyer to practice and/or which affect client rights to choose counsel when legal services are required. For healthcare, the question becomes why is there a different standard for physi-cians and patients? Are healthcare practitioners overlooking patient care when it comes these agree-ments? Patients will ultimately have to decide what is best for them through their votes and actions. Adam D.

The purpose of these agencies is to increase pub- lic safety by ensuring Medicare-funded healthcare facilities are complying with all fire and life safety codes and concerns. Next to sprinkler systems, Code Compliant, Fire, Smoke and Egress doors are a facility's most crucial fire prevention device. Most fires usually start small and can be limited to the original area - pro-viding that any fire door leading from the room is fire-code compliant. In addition, it is a fact that very few people are hurt or die from flames; it's smoke and fumes that injure and cause death. Therefore, fire doors blocking the spread of fire, smoke, etc., are essential. In addition, a fire door can cut off additional oxygen from enter-ing the fire zone and fueling the blaze, proving it is fully com-pliant with the fire code. \"Fire Safety\" doors have the most potential for failure due to the high frequency of use and sometimes simply the lack of regular maintenance. Because of this reason, a need for strict regulatory compliance has been established by (a) National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), (b) International Code Council (ICC), and (c) Joint Commission, AHCA, and CMS [Healthcare], fire codes which all require the inspection of fire doors at least annually . A complete fire door inspection requires several things. First - you need a completed door schedule listing every fire, smoke, and egress door. Each door must be listed individually and its exact location and other information must be noted. (National FireDoor (NFD) attaches a QR-coded permanent ID label to each door's hinge edge.) Facilities' floor plans are usu-ally beneficial (some use the Fire \"Life Safety Plan's\" for the building). When AHCA or other AHJ (Authorities Having Juris diction) shows up to do a life safety survey , one of the records facilities must keep available is a Fire Door-ITM workbook or report. (ITM stands for - Inspection, Testing and Maintenance.) This report is a permanent record of the ITM for each door and must be available upon demand. An annual inspection of ALL fire, smoke and egress doors is require and a report for EACH door must be made available to AHJ upon request. In addition, your facility can be cited for failing to comply with the Annual Fire Door Inspection (AFDI) Mandate requirements. Never forget, it's facilities management who is held responsible for required safety inspections. You may ask who is authorized to do the AFDI. The NFPA code states that anyone who possesses the proven knowledge of Fire Safety Door Assemblies and Fire Code compliance experience is eligible as an inspector, providing that they are acceptable to the AHJ. Most facilities utilize the services of pro-fessional companies such as National FireDoor, LLC (NFD), one of the fastest-growing companies in the Fire Door inspec-tion field. National FireDoor offers several programs that run from full service (including everything necessary for compliance with the directives required for Annual Fire Door Inspections) to supervision of an in-house program. NFD can ensure your buildings conform to the inspection requirements for your facility. For a no-obligation consultation, contact NFD at (305) 233-1477 or info@Nationalfiredoor.com. We can make your buildings compliant now and in the future. Annual Fire Door Inspections BY DAN ARCE South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com April 2022 11It's no secret that posi- tive relationships with health insurance compa-nies are essential to the well-being of health sys-tems. At Holy Cross Health, our ability to pro-vide high-quality and affordable care to those who need it most across Broward County relies on the collaboration and cooperation of our indus-try partners - the insur-ance companies, or pay-ors, who reimburse us for the patient care we deliver. However, an inevitable game of tug-of- war is played when market pressures on providers become unsustainable. As a result, both parties commonly enter negotiations to modify contracts and business agreements that may no longer be viable. Time and time again, providers are offered negligible increases or even met with unsustainable reductions in compensation that jeopardize our ability to provide the high-quality , essential services that patients deserve and expect. And while we try everything to avoid it, far too often, patients suffer immense-ly when negotiations go awry and cause undesired disruption. Across our nation, participation in employer-sponsored health plans remains significant, with approximately 157 million covered lives according to Kaiser Family Foundation in 2020. This health insurance benefit employers provide can swiftly depreciate as the cost of premiums rise while the volume of quality care providers consid-ered \"in-network\" shrinks. What's more, any purposeful initiative between the health system and employer to identify areas for cost savings, employee utiliza-tion, or benefits education is wasted when the provider and payor cannot reach a mutually agreeable arrangement. The patient no longer has affordable access to trusted primary care providers or specialists. The provider loses revenue that jeopardizes business operations. The health plan fails providers but maintains premiums. Collaboration is essential for the sake of ensuring access to excep-tional care and improving the health of the communi-ties we humbly serve. Holy Cross Health knows this tug-of-war all too well as a not-for-profit health system, but without support from pay-ors, both Holy Cross and our community suffer. We invest wholeheartedly back into the community for every dollar we earn by obtaining new technologies to improve healthcare services, upgrad- ing facilities and ensuring our doors remain open to everyone - regardless of their ability to pay . We pride ourselves on these values because we know they are the foundation of all we do. Still, resist-ance exists. The list of daily and ongoing chal- lenges health systems across the country face is tiring and includes inflation, staffing shortages, continued treatment for COVID-19 patients and investments in the safety of our staff members who provide this care daily . Firm resistance at the negotiating table from our industry peers only increases the economic strain so many of us are facing today , inevitably putting patients and employers at risk of disruption in their care. We are humbled that we have been able to serve our community with high-quality care for over 60 years, and we work every day to strengthen our rela-tionship with payors who help us keep our doors open. I hope that negotiations will no longer be viewed as a tug-of-war between two \"goliaths\" because this per-spective removes what matters - the patient. At Holy Cross Health, we firmly believe that everyone deserves access to the healthcare they know and trust to deliver compassionate care services. We remain committed to working toward a better tomorrow , as should every health system, including a collaborative rela-tionship between the parties who pro-vide and reimburse healthcare.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com April 2022 13nurses, and respiratory therapy staff.\" Fernandez, who was born in Havana, Cuba and has been a resident of South Florida for the past 61 years, has been a healthcare professional for over 45 years in the Tri-County mar-ket. Sixteen years ago he joined Memorial Hospital Miramar as CEO. He was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for the Memorial Healthcare System in 2012 and in 2016 was chosen as President and CEO of Memorial by the South Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners. Prior to joining Memorial Healthcare System, Fernandez spent 11 years in a variety of positions with Tenet Healthcare, including CEO at Hialeah Hospital and Florida Medical Center as well as Executive Director for Tenet Network Management. During the 1990's, Fernandez was CEO of Palm-Med Health Services specializing in physician ventures as well as actively participating in organizing physician hospital organizations. Throughout his 16 years at Memorial, he says the system always had the ability to have the resources to do what's right for the patients. \"Our mission is to be a community provider,\" he explains. \"So in South Florida, not only did we have the safest environ-ment, but the most comprehensive level of services, such as car-diology , neurosciences, and oncology , for patients in pediatrics to adulthood. Very few in our market have the resources neces-sary to deliver that. To me, that was a key differentiator between us and others in the market.\" When asked about his greatest accomplishment, Fernandez says that it was the ability to elevate the organization to its full potential. \"You do that by engaging all the caregivers, support staff and medical staff to understand the mission and why we're here,\" he says. \"We have accomplished that in a variety of ways and they're quantifiable and measurable. To me, that is our biggest accomplishment since I've been here.\" Fernandez says he will miss the people at Memorial the most. \"We have 14,000 employees,\" he says. \"We have the finest executive and administrative team as well as a great employee workforce. There's a culture of collaboration and doing what's right for the patient and creating a safe environment that I have never seen in my career. I'll miss that. I'll also miss the fact that anytime we needed to do a project and went to the board com-missioners to ask for the resources, they were there willing and able to provide us with the resources\u2014not necessarily financial all the time, but in any aspect to augment the workforce and do a variety of other things.\" As he dwells on the future of the healthcare system and where it's headed, Fernandez says that COVID-19 disrupted healthcare in such a way that it will never be the same. \"What we need to take advantage of, at least where Memorial is concerned, is to invest a significant amount of resources, both in capital and personnel, to elevate our telecommunica-tion platform and leverage it to create a much more robust vir-tual environment,\" he says. \"Our numbers, when it comes to virtual visits and telemedicine, have just gone through the roof, but we need to go beyond that. We need to provide the con-sumer with access to healthcare, even when it's not in person, and leverage that technology to do it virtually and therefore improve access. I don't see us going back to the old ways of doing things. I'm a firm believer that we need to reallocate our capital dollars into technology . The more we do that, the more the consumer will have access to our services.\" As for what's next for him? Fernandez plans to rest and take it easy\u2014at least in the short term. \"I know I'm not going to do anything for six months to adjust to a new lifestyle,\" he says. \"But after six months, I will recon-sider what I'm going to be doing. I'm not interested in working full time; but maybe part-time. After 45 years of doing this, I think I've paid my dues!\" For more information, visit www.mhs.net.Cover Story: Aurelio Fernandez Retires as Memorial Healthcare CEO Continued from page 1South Florida's Monthly Healthcare Newspaper PO Phone: (561) FELIX CAROL FELIX Publishers NANCY LAMMIE Editor JUDY GRAMM Editorial Manager & Webmaster JMC GRAPHICS lammienancy@aol.com 412-877-5321 CONTRIBUTING WRITERS Daniel Casciato Barbara Fallon Vanessa Orr Lois Thomson LOOK FOR OUR NEXT ISSUE IN MAY TO REACH US FOR ADVERTISING OR EDITORIAL Call (561) 368-6950 or e-mail carol@southfloridahospitalnews.com SUBSCRIPTIONS One Year $40 T wo Years $60 Three Years $75 T o subscribe, call (561) 368-6950 or subscribe online at southfloridahospitalnews.com. ____________ All rights reserved.

Good Samaritan Medical Center Becomes First Hospital in Palm Beach County to Use the ProACT T echnology Good Samaritan Medical Center is the first hospital in Palm Beach County using the ProACT technology from URO-MEDICA. The ProACT system is implanted within the body to assist protection against acciden-tal urine leakage. This can occur during everyday activities such as coughing, sneezing, or physical activity . Dr. Antonio Beltran, urol-ogist on staff at Good Samaritan Medical Center, is the first physi-cian to use this new system. \"Incontinence can be an issue for men post-surgery from prostate cancer, and some may feel they have no options to control their bladder once they have their prostate removed, said Dr. Beltran. \"The ProACT technology is a simple implan-tation for patients allowing them better control of their bladder so they don't have unwanted accidents throughout the day .\" The ProACT, Adjustable Continence Therapy for Men consists of two small, adjustable silicone balloons each con-nected with tubing to a port. The balloons are placed where the prostate was removed or resected. The fluid-filled balloons apply pressure to and support the bladder neck, which helps prevent accidental leakage of urine. The ports are placed just below the skin in the patients' scrotum allowing the physician to adjust the balloon to meet the patients' individual needs.

Launched recently at a new Conviva center in Miami, the model enables seniors to take greater control of their healthcare by equipping them with current technologies, easy and convenient check-ins, and proactive care programs. \"We understand that today's active seniors, including those new to Medicare, desire a contemporary approach to health care that combines a seamless, comprehensive care experience with modern innovations, amenities and conveniences like expedited patient appointments,\" said Dora Rodriguez-Duran, Market President for Conviva in Miami Dade County . \"The digitally enabled experience that we've created, coupled with access to an outstanding care team, make this new model unique. But at the core is the physician-patient relationship.\" Conviva is introducing this innovative health care model at its new facility located at 13878 SW 56th St. in the popular Miller Square shopping area. Spanning 6,000 square feet, the center offers not only the high-quality , senior-focused clinical care that Conviva patients expect, but also a comprehensive range of additional services, from in-house consultations to educational programs, fitness classes, valet service and much more. Whether new to Medicare or already participating in the federal program, patients will be greeted by an upscale, lounge-like lobby featuring Apple iPad tablets for easy check-ins, three computers for patient use and educational purposes, ample comfort-able seating and plenty of open space for a calm and relaxed healthcare visit. Free Wi-Fi is available for visitors who need internet access. The new Conviva proactive model will make check-ins and scheduling an appoint- ment easy via smartphone or the office kiosk. Patients will get reminders about their upcoming visits via text, which can be scheduled up to three days prior or as late as the morning of the appointment. A patient liaison will be available to answer ques-tions. Additionally , patients will have access for urgent after-hours visits scheduled via telemedicine video chats. A consultation room presents first-time patients with the opportunity to personally meet and become familiar with their assigned physician or nurse practitioner. Separately , each examination room will feature the new concept of a large screen that allows the patient and the doctor/nurse to review test results together and discuss spe-cific areas of concern or discuss healthy lifestyle practices. Concierge-style, monthly-retainer services are also a new available feature, and once a medical visit is complete, patients can text message the valet to have their vehicle ready immediately upon departure. Building on that mission, the site will also offer yoga, Pilates and Zumba fitness classes as well as educational programs on nutrition, physical exercise and healthy liv-ing practices. Other available classes will cover important and relevant topics, includ-ing financial and estate planning and computer/software instruction.Conviva Care Center Unveils New Proactive Healthcare Model for T oday's Active Seniors in Miami (l-r) Dora Rodriguez Duran, Market President of Conviva Care Centers; Victor Lopez from Senator Ana Maria Rodriguez's office; Dr. Elizabeth Fergusson Ramirez of Conviva of Morris Chief Community Services Officer Miami-Dade County; Michael Reed, Conviva Care Centers, Macarena Lanway, of Conviva Proactive Senior Care; and Mari Pantoja Smith South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com April 2022 15 Florida Atlan s Exe ticUniversity' ecutive Master of ends of the tr students to m e A Healthcar Florida Atlan e industry healthcar ent la master the curr Administration (EMH s Exe tic University . y andscape and key epa ogram pr pr HA) ecutive Master of es ar TER OR ELECT LEARN FU REGIS MAXIM VIR T A HYBRID S Y ONLINE Y ULL FLEX R FOR EMHA MIZE OPEN HO AL A R SCHEDULE , ON-CAMPU TU XIBILITY OUSE S .ED U A F DU/EMHA A A SA TURD TER REGIS T 30 A APRIL , , A Y VIR R FOR EMHA 10:00 AM OPEN HO AL A R TU OUSE 561.2 .ED U A A F 297.6000 DU/EMHA 16 April 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News West Boca Medical Center Creates New Look at the Boca Center for Women's Care West Boca Medical Center, part of the Palm Beach Health Network, is making significant upgrades to the patient rooms in its labor and delivery and postpartum units at the Boca Center for Women's Care.

Bond Covenant Violations 42% of healthcare CFOs have defaulted on their bond or loan covenants in the past 12 months. Interestingly , 25% say they have not defaulted but are concerned they will default in the next year. How can you avoid violations? The first step to take is to meet with your financial advisors, espe-cially if you are worried you're going to default on your bond or loan covenants. You want to get their counsel before you default so you can prepare your organiza-tion and mitigate the damage. Ideally , they can help you avoid a default altogether. 4. Supply Chain Strains 84% of healthcare CFOs say supply chain disruption is a risk in 2022. How can you mitigate these risks? Supply chain shortages are a ubiquitous problem across industries right now , but not all of the issues are within your control. Focus on what is, including assessing your supply chain costs and seeing where you can find the same or similar products for lower prices. Identifying alternative suppliers may end up saving you a lot of frustration, especially if your regular suppliers run into disruptions. 5. Increased Cost of Resources 39% of healthcare CFOs are concerned about rising material costs and expect it will pose a significant threat to their sup-ply chain. How can you alleviate these concerns? Price increases for the resources you purchase including medical supplies, drugs, technology and more could deplete your financial reserves and strain your liq-uidity , exacerbating your financial difficul-ties. You may be able to switch from physi-cian-preferred products to other, most cost-effective products for the time being. Switching medical suppliers may even save you money in the long run. 6. Patient Volume 39% of healthcare CFOs are making investments to improve the patient experi-ence. How can you satisfy your patient stakeholders? As hospitals and physician practices get closer to the new normal of care, patients are returning to procedures and check-ins they put off at the height of the pandemic. Patients want a comfortable experience that will keep them coming back, including a safe and clean atmos-phere inside offices. They also want access to frictionless telehealth and patient por-tals for those who don't want to or can't travel to receive care. Make sure your organization meets these requirements. Investments can also go toward improving health equity strategies to ensure everyone across communities is receiving the same level of care.

The hospital's Gift Shop Director Saud Begovic credits Brizendine with helping to keep the shop open. Her dedication to the patients, visitors and caregivers who frequent the shop was most evident during Brizendine's treatment for breast cancer. She continued to donate her time at the hospital gift shop in between her grueling radiation therapy sessions. Brizendine, who became a volunteer in 2014, has logged nearly 2,500 service hours at the hospital. She also served as the South District Director of the Association of Florida Health Care Auxiliary-Volunteers. In that role, she partnered with Child Life at Broward Health Medical Center and Fort Lauderdale Woman's Club, sewing pillowcases and blankets, which the Auxiliary dis-tributed to the Oncology-Hematology Pediatric Clinic and other pediatric departments.Judy Shutowick After moving to Parkland 20 years ago, Judy Shutowick's retirement has been anything but quiet. The former executive director of the New York State Neurological Society has been a volunteer for Broward Health Coral Springs' Auxiliary for 15 years. Shutowick serves as the Auxiliary's secretary , handling all of the computer needs, communications and meeting minutes for the hospital's service organization. Throughout the pandemic, Shutowick has been the vital glue keeping fellow volun- teers engaged and informed as they worked virtually . She stepped up her responsibilities to manage the Auxiliary's Volunteer Reporter software, a pilot program that tracks com-munication and attendance. Her proficiency with the Volunteer Reporter program was indispensable as she pre- pared reports for The Joint Commission and the hospital's Employee Health Department. She went on to train other volunteers throughout the healthcare system on the software and continues to work with the hospital's IT Department to ensure the software remains operational for volunteers.

Las Vegas-based Planet 13 Holdings, a vertically integrated multistate operator, announced its plans to set up a medical dispensary in the town of Orange Park, a suburb on Jacksonville's south side. The planned location is on a busy retail corridor next to a Walmart Superstore and near the scenic St. John's River, a popular destination for tourists and local residents, according to the company . \"We've been heads down working hard on our Florida expansion,\" Planet 13 co-CEO Bob Groesbeck said in a press release. \"We are progressing well on locating and working on both cultivation and retail under a dual track plan to bring both online at the same time. This is the first signed lease of our initial six planned neighborhood style stores all focused on major population centers and heavily trafficked retail locations.\" The move will expand upon Planet 13's Nevada footprint, which includes its Las Vegas dispensary that became the largest in the world at 112,000 square feet when it opened in 2018, and it's 55,000-square-foot retail facility in Orange County , Calif. The company has multiple \"superstores\" in each state as well as cultivation, production and distribution licenses. The pathway to its Florida expansion opened when Planet 13 entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. in September to acquire a license for $55 million to operate as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) in the state. Regulated by the Florida Department of Health, MMTCs are the only busi-nesses authorized to dispense medical cannabis to qualified patients and caregivers in the state. Cresco Labs to Become the New Leader in Cannabis with the Acquisition of Columbia Care Cresco Labs and Columbia Care Inc. announced they have entered into a definitive arrangement agreement pursuant to which Cresco Labs will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Columbia Care. Subject to customary closing conditions and nec-essary regulatory approvals, the Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, shareholders of Columbia Care will receive 0.5579 of a subordinate voting share of Cresco Labs for each Columbia Care common share (or equivalent) held, subject to adjustment representing total consider-ation enterprise value of approximately US$2.0 billion based on the closing price of Cresco Labs Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange as of March 22, 2022. The Transaction provides Columbia Care Shareholders with premiums per Columbia Care Share of approximately 16% based on the closing prices of the Columbia Care Shares and the Cresco Labs Shares, and (ii) 19%, based on the 20-day volume weighted average prices of the Columbia Care Shares and the Cresco Labs Shares, each on the CSE as of March 22, 2022. After giving effect to the Transaction, Columbia Care Shareholders will hold approx- imately 35% of the pro forma Cresco Labs Shares a fully diluted in-the-money , treas-ury method basis). Cresco Labs Celebrates Milestone Opening of 50th Operating Retail Store Cresco Labs Inc. announced the grand opening of a new Sunnyside dispensary in Lady Lake, Florida. The new store marks a milestone in Cresco's nationwide retail expansion, bringing the Company's total retail footprint to 50 locations across seven states and 16 total stores in the state of Florida. \"Our 50th store in Florida marks the achievement of a key goal established in 2021 to expand company-owned retail locations in the state, aiming for 16 dispensaries open by the anniversary of the Bluma acquisition,\" said Charlie Bachtell, CEO & Co-founder at Cresco Labs. \"Over the past year, we've done a good job leveraging our extraordinarily productive Sunnyside banner to grow retail rev-enue, expanding the ways Cresco's brands reach and interact with consumers. Today's opening is an exciting moment in Cresco's history\u2014it's truly incredible to see both how far this organization has come and the outstanding execution from our retail team.\" Trulieve Opening Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Boca Raton, Florida Trulieve Cannabis Corp. announced the opening of a new medical cannabis dispensa- ry in Boca Raton, FL. \"Trulieve is excited to expand access to medical cannabis in the Boca Raton market and build strong relationships in the community ,\" said Kim Rivers, CEO of Trulieve. \"Our company is driven by our commitment to providing tailored, high-quality patient care in a safe and comfortable environment.\" As the state's leading medical cannabis provider, Trulieve's retail employees are trained to provide personalized patient care and support individuals at every stage of their cannabis journey .

I believe that med-ical cannabis is a natural and holistic med-ication for the treatment of many health conditions. I believe it is a better alterna-tive to the \"pills\" that the pharmaceutical companies are supporting. We know that as patients become more informed about medical marijuana, they will appreciate its value in medicine. What field are you in within the cannabis space? I am a medical cannabis physician and owner at Atlantic Coast Cannabis MD in Edgewater. I became certified to qualify patients for their medical cannabis cards in 2018. I am a board-certified Anesthes - iologist and thus have been using \"chemi-cal\" means to treat pain in a controlled environment for more than 30 years. But I always knew there was something more for me to do as a physician. How can people in Florida bene- fit from the company you repre- sent? I believe my 30+ years in Anesthesiology gives me an advantage in making recom-mendations for medical cannabis patients. Anesthesiologists use the titration method of medication administration in their rou-tine approach to treating patients. Titration is the process of determining the medication dosage that reduces one's symptoms to the greatest possible degree while avoiding as many side effects as pos-sible. With medical cannabis, patients get to titrate their own medication and they will continue to do this over the course of their treatment. Patient controlled medica-tion administration is not new to anesthe-siologists. Because of this, I feel qualified to participate, treat and qualify patients for medical cannabis in the state of Florida. I do this through extensive education of my patients and continued support and educa-tion after they have qualified for their card. How did you get started within the cannabis industry? In the late 1980's I chose the field of Anesthesiology due to a strong desire to help patients suffering with all types of pain. After many years as a successful Anesthesiologist, I knew there was some-thing more that I could do to help ease the pain and suffering of patients. When Florida legalized medical cannabis for a broad range of illnesses in 2016, I became intrigued and wanted to become part of this holistic treatment. I felt like this was a natural transition for me, to further my desire to help patients who are suffering from a variety of ailments. My own mother was a chronic pain patient and I knew that I needed to be part of the solution. This desire inspired me to begin researching medical cannabis and to become a quali-fied medical cannabis provider. In 2018, I became certified to qualify patients and in 2019, I opened my practice. I started part time for 2 years and as of July 2021, I was able to transition to a full-time job. I truly feel blessed to be able to work my passion. Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/cannabis and how will that affect your business? I do believe at some point this wonder- ful plant will be made available to all peo-ple on a legal basis. For some people, this will be all that they need. For the vast majority of patients, I believe that they will want to continue to be in the medical pro-grams due to the education that they receive from physicians and the access to discounts and support that we are able to provide them. Our evaluations are com-prehensive and include education about the different types of plant-based medica-tions, the different routes of administra-tion, how it can be beneficial, dispensary instructions and the requirements of the state of Florida for having a medical card. We are also a participating member in an online peer-to-peer portal for medical pro-fessionals to share HIPAA protected info to improve the future of medical marijuana treatments. Through this portal, we are able to evaluate current patient treatments and efficacies and use this info to better treat our patients.

Just one month ago (February 25, 2022) the Committee on Com - petitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports (CSMAS), a component of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), announced a major change in its cannabinoid testing poli-cies. Most specifically the committee increased the threshold for a positive THC test and recommended a reconfigu-ration of the penalty structure for those student athletes that test positive under the new guidelines. The CSMAS announced the new threshold for a positive THC test would be set at 150 nanograms per milliliter. This is a significant increase from the previous level of 35 ng/ml. This does, however, align the NCAA testing levels for THC equal to that of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which current-ly uses 150 ng/ml as a threshold. These changes will take place immediately and also apply to past THC tests from the fall of 2021 with retroactive penalties re moved for those who tests over 35ng/ml but less than 150 ng/ml. In addi-tion, the CSMAS stated that future changes could be reviewed and approved in an effort to respond accordingly to future WADA changes. In addition to the thresh- old level being adjusted, a notable pivot will take place in how a positive THC test is being managed. Prior to this change, a positive test was treated from a punitive perspective. That is, on the first time recorded positive test a penalty equivalent to 50% of a playing season suspension was handed down to a stu-dent athlete. The NCAA has acknowl-edged that a more educational and well-ness intervention approach better suits the needs of the individual, and this will be handled at the institutional level with programs in place to meet the needs of the overall health and well-being of the student athlete. This approach is also consistent with the recommendations of a select group of sports medicine profes-sionals from major colleges and universi-ties and feedback received from NCAA membership school surveys conducted this past fall. The stakeholder recommendations agreed to the lack of evidence of cannabis as a performance enhancing drug but also took note to the importance factual education amidst a changing cultural shift that has seen greater acceptance overall toward cannabis in this country . As a result, an emphasis on education, health and wellness, and open communi-cation will likely become part of adjusted campus cultures. Under the proposed new structure, penalties of loss of eligi-bility will only be implemented if a repeat offender is not compliant with a university-led education and manage-ment plan. It is important to note that 2 important items of relevance remain following this announcement. First, cannabis was not removed from the NCAA 's banned sub-stance list and therefore remains an ille-gal substance for student-athletes to use. The ruling change merely raised the threshold that equates to a positive test. No endorsement of cannabis is being made, and testing will still occur. Furthermore schools may want to estab-lish their own internal policies whereby they adhere to a the same or different threshold levels and address cannabis use as it not only relates to a positive test of greater than 150ng/ml. For example, a school may decide that those testing at 100ng/ml are of a concern in that trend-ing behaviors may want to be addressed. And while cannabis has not been shown to be a performance enhancer in sports, it may very well be a performance inhibitor if taken in inappropriate dosages at the wrong times. The second important item to discuss is that no mention was made of any of the other cannabinoids aside from THC. This is of great interest in that while all cannabinoids are banned, only THC is tested for. Therefore, mixed signals are now being sent to student athletes. In the past, word on the street was that some were nervous about using any forms of CBD for example in fear of having a pos-itive drug test show up. Now , with the threshold levels being raised so high, this fear may be alleviated and lead to a greater use of CBD. In the very near future, this will need to be addressed for clarity purposes. For now , many will appreciate the modern decision-making of the NCAA committee to better align with societal and cultural shifts, as well as the scientif-ic evidence to support the transitions that are occurring. The NCAA should be commended for acting in a timely and relevant manner to its member's input. Dr. Jeff G.

Miami Mango first acquired the Mango Haze strain in 2001, and made it avail-able in the traditional market for the past 21 years. \"We didn't listen to the law back in the day; we were young and care-less but very ambitious,\" said Villegas, adding that the strain has since become a staple in the South Florida market and is very much in demand. \"When Trulieve reached out to see if we were interested in a partnership, they were looking for a strain that commercial companies didn't have access to,\" he added. \"It had been kept very private.\" Trulieve is currently offering Miami Mango's Mango Haze in pre-rolls, oils and concentrates and plans to later add flower. According to Villegas, what sets Mango Haze apart is its flavor. \"It's a very unique strain; the flavor is unmistakable,\" he said. \"When you process the flowers into a concentrate, that's when it really becomes next-level. It not only looks like a mango puree smoothie, but smells just like a fully ripe mango cut from a tree. \"A sativa hybrid, Mango Haze is not overly potent with a high THC content,\" he added. \"It provides a great euphoric feeling and still lets the user function normally , which is why it's great for med-ical reasons. Even though it's a sativa, it's good for people with pain or anxiety; the flavorful aroma of the terpenes is sooth-ing and patients love the flavor and the feeling that it brings them.\" In addition to being a cannabis grower and consultant, Villegas also runs an online worldwide hydroponics store and designs and builds high-end cannabis facilities as well as large custom homes. He is currently in talks with Trulieve about possibly releasing more strains, and plans to release Mango Haze into the California market soon. \"Mango Haze is only going to get big- ger, expanding into other states,\" he said. \"We're not only getting a lot of messages on Instagram from people in other places in Florida wanting it in their Trulieve dispensaries, but from people in Boston asking if it will be available up there any-time soon.\" T o learn more about Miami Mango, visit www.mangotech.store.

CannaMD first served as a recruitment site for UF in 2019. Results were later published in the peer-reviewed journal, Cannabis (see: \"Health Outcomes Among Adults Initiating Medical Marijuana for Chronic Pain: A 3-month Prospective Study Incorporating Ecological Momentary Assessment\"). CannaMD reprised its role in 2020, with a second study on cannabis and PTSD, before recruiting participants for a separate project: the Consortium's Contact Registry . Now , Florida's favorite network of cannabis doctors is proud to serve as a recruitment site for the Medical Marijuana & Me (M3) Cohort Study - facilitating statewide research on medical marijuana outcomes among current and new patients. In addition to advancing scientific literature, CannaMD is passionate about making sure patients understand these new developments - which is why the CannaMD blog is full of research-based articles, tips, and guidance. CannaMD's free e-book is one of the most widely used patient resources in the state - and for good reason. CannaMD's doctors are commit-ted to not only certifying medical marijuana patients, but making sure that every step of the process makes perfect sense. As CannaMD continues to seek out opportunities to advance medical cannabis research, patients are encouraged to capitalize on the network's evidence- based resources by visiting CannaMD.com.

The history of medicine is littered with anecdotes detailing the usefulness of med- ical cannabis for the treatment of patients. It was a commonplace medication pre-scribed by physicians for a vast array of ailments. In the early 1900s cannabis was finally banned in the United States. In the late 1900s, the endocannabinoid system was discovered and the interest in medical cannabis resurged. Unfortunately , people still associate a stigma when discussing cannabis. We are seeing more and more studies that are proving the efficacy of medical cannabis as a treatment alterna-tive to opioids and anxiolytics. These opi-oids and anxiolytics can oftentimes lead to drug addiction, overdose, and death. The horrors of the national opioid epi-demic continue to ravage the lives of patients and their loved ones across the nation. Fortunately , recent medical and scientific advancements into cannabis and the endocannabinoid system have thrust medical marijuana to the forefront of homeopathic treatment. Medical cannabis provides a safe, all natural treatment option. What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis Industry?
