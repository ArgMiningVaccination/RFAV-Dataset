In other news, don't forget to sign up for my [Ayurvedic Spring Cleanse Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ayurvedic-spring-cleanse-workshop-tickets-41028385004) here in Seattle. This cleanse is one I learned from my teacher and have been doing twice a year for the past eight years. It has been transformational for me and I'm excited to share it with you. It includes internal oleation, a week long kitchari cleanse, daily epsom salts baths and self-massage, and herbs and teas to encourage cellular detoxification, healthy digestion, stable blood sugar, and lymph flow. During the workshop we'll cover the basics of Ayurveda, how to make ghee, and go over the cleanse protocol in detail. You'll leave with recipes, resources, and a take home cleanse kit with everything you need to get started. This cleanse is an opportunity to set the stage for optimal health and well-being by adopting a simple diet, nourishing the body and mind, and letting go of old habits and patterns in order to come closer to your true nature.
