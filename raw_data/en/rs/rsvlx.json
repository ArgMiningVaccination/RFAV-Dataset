The yearly celebration of Vaccination Week in the Americas began in 2002 thanks to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Observation of VWA commenced in an effort for countries in the Region of the Americas to respond to a measles outbreak between Colombia and Venezuela. Since its inception, more than one billion people of all ages have been vaccinated. Senator the Hon. Jonathan LaCrette, Minister of Health, Wellness & Religious Affairs, addressed the nation and reminded citizens that Grenada has a history of a successful childhood immunization programme. He warned that in 2021 however, 11,000 children did not receive their full vaccine doses. In Grenada, he said, vaccine coverage had declined from 95 to 65 percent for children ages zero to five years. He therefore deemed it urgent to \"increase vaccine coverage and to eliminate the risk of an impending crisis for those most at risk - the children, our elderly and those living with chronic non communicable diseases.\" Grenada hosted the Community Awareness and Kids Fun Day on April 28th, at the Limes Pasture in Grand Anse. The Awareness Walk for Immunization, a vaccination public awareness walk and wellness fair, was led by Minister LaCrette on April 29th and included a large gathering of citizens in St. Andrew where the event was hosted. Immunization awareness billboards were erected on the island with the slogan Love Them Enough to Protect Them. There was also a panel discussion on The Impact of Vaccination in Disease Prevention and Its Role in Saving Lives. "}
