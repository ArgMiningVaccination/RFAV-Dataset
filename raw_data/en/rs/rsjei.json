Castle Student Research Conference hosted by the University of South Florida. In honor of Dr. Raymond N. Castle, this Conference was created to promote his goals of s cientific collaboration and science education. The Raymond N. Castle Student Research Conference continues to be organized by students for students as an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and graduate chemistry students to share scientific ideas and research progress. Students are encouraged to not only gain presentation experience, but to use the conference as a chance to further their research endeavors by gaining valuable feedback from other members of the chemistry community. It is this interacti on and the sharing of ideas that makes the Raymond N. Castle Student Research Conference a worthwhile experience and a continued success. We are especially proud of the research done by all students in the department, both graduate and undergraduate. With the continued success of the Raymond N. Castle Student Research Conference and to more clearly promote scientific collaboration, we have expanded our invitation for presentation to students in other Natural Science Departments as well as Colleges and Univ ersities in Tampa and the surrounding areas. Today, we have an opportunity to hear from students in chemistry related disciplines from around Florida . Chemistry research will be highlighted with our special guest , Dr. Ingrid Montes . We encourage everyone t o take advantage of this occasion and attend both the poster and oral presentations, especially the Plenary Lecture. We are honored and greatly appreciative that Dr. Montes will be giving a presentation on her exciting research and experience in the field of chemistry.

Castle 1916 - 1999 Raymond N. Castle was born on June 24, 1916 in Boise, Idaho where he attended Boise High School and Boise Junior College. A 1938 graduate in Pharmacy from the University of Idaho, Southern Branch in Pocatello, he completed the M.A. degree in Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1941. Shortly thereafter, he became a Chemistry instructor at the University of Idaho and then in 1943, returned to the University of Colora do in Boulder for a Ph.D. in Chemistry with a minor in Microbiology. After two years as a research chemist at the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, Dr. Castle accepted a position at the University of New Mexico as an Assistant Professor of Che mistry. He served as Chairman of the Chemistry Department from 1963 until 1970 before moving to Brigham Young University as Professor of Chemistry. In 1981, Dr. Castle joined the faculty at University of South Florida as a Distinguished Research Professor . He and his wife, Ada, were a vibrant part of the Chemistry Department and for many years sponsored the Castle Lecture Series, which brought in numerous prominent scientists for lectures at USF. A prolific researcher, Dr. Castle was an internationally re cognized father figure in heterocyclic chemistry, both for his research and his involvement in meetings, symposia, and editorial boards. In 1964, he founded the Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry and served as its editor. He also edited the Lectures in Hete rocyclic Chemistry series, a publication of plenary lectures given at the International Congresses of Heterocyclic Chemistry, and was the American advisory editor for the English translation of the Russian Journal of Heterocyclic Compounds. He lectured at hundreds of institutions worldwide. He was General Chairman of the First International Congress of Heterocyclic Chemistry held in Albuquerque (1967), Secretary of the Second International Congress held in Montpellier, France (1969), and Vice -President of s ubsequent Congresses held in Sendai, Japan, Salt Lake City, Utah, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, and Tehran, Iran. Dr. Castle was also Chairman and Committee Member for the American Chemical Society. In addition, he was cofounder of the International Society of He terocyclic Chemistry, which he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee, and President (1973 -1975). Professor Castle received numerous awards and honors, including the prestigious International Award in Heterocyclic Chemistry (1983) for outstanding co ntributions to the field of heterocyclic chemistry, presented in Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Castle was listed in the first edition of Who's Who in Science and in Who's Who in the World. The Chemistry Department remains deeply indebted to Professor Castle for his m any outstanding contributions to the Department, and to science overall. He would have been a strong supporter of this student symposium, and thus, it is fitting that we dedicate this and future symposia to his memory. 8 Dr. Ingrid Montes Plenary Speaker Ingrid Montes received a B.S. in Chemistry and a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras.

One inhabitant, the vibrant yellow sponge Dendrilla membranosa , is known to inhibit feeding of Antarctic predators such as sea stars and amphipods. A me tabolomics approach was undertaken to identify whether sponges within the amphipod -rich algal canopy adopt different chemical profiles to account for the increased predation pressure. In addition, our group has identifi ed the membranolides from D. membrano sa that possess potent and selective activity against the leishmaniasis -causing parasite Leishmania donovani. The origin of these compounds will be investigated as artifacts from methanolic degradation of aplysulphurin. GT-02 Danielle Ashley Souza3, E. Kyle3, Lindsey N. Shaw3, Bill J.

While classical lab fermentation techniques may not reveal the full chemical potential of these organisms, epigenetic modification can encourage their full biosynthetic capabilities to be re alized. As part of two NIH funded screening projects, mangrove endophytic fungi were grown under control and epigenetically modified conditions, extracted, and submitted for biological ass ay against a panel of the drug resistant and clinically relevant ESK APE pathogens as well as against the tropical disease causing parasite Leishmania donovani. Active extracts were dereplicated, scaled up, and the compounds responsible for the activity were isolated and char acterized. The investigation of one organism iden tified in this way yielded a suite of new, Cylindrols. GT-03 Haifan Wu1, Qiao Qiao, Jianfeng Cai Chemistry, University of South Florida New helical foldamers based on sulfono -gamma -AApeptides Peptidomimetics are synthetic o ligomers that resemble the activities of peptides. Their advantages over peptides include high stability towards proteolysis and enormous chemical diversity. Over the past two decades, there have been extensive efforts to develop peptide mimics, such as beta-peptides, peptoids, D -peptides, etc. The research on peptidomimetics have led to many important applications in both medicinal and material science. Here, we report the structural study of a new type of peptidomimetics, sulfono -gamma -AApeptides, by two -dimentional NMR sulfono -gamma -AApeptides adopt stable helical conformation in methanol, similar to alpha -helix structure. This finding will allow us to rationally design helical mimics that can be used to target protein - protein interfaces. GT-04 Benjamin Eduful1, Catherine Mukta1, James Leahy1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida 2Department of Public Health, University of South Flo rida 3Department of Global Health, University of South Florida Synthesis of Novel Class of Anti -Leishmaniasis Agents Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine Sandfly. It is the 9th g reatest dis ease burden among infectious diseases, but it is also classified as neglected tropical disease (NTD). Prevalent in developing coun tries, the disease presents in three main forms: Cutaneous (most common); Visceral (most severe form) and Mucocutaneous (most destructive form) Leishmaniasis. No vaccine currently exist but Antimony, Amphotericin or Pentamidine are used as treatments for the disease an d none is particularly effective and are also associated with toxicity; hence the need to develop highly effectiv e new drugs. It is known that Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the most abundant proteins in the protozoan parasite that causes Leishmaniasis; being involved i n a variety of morphological processes. Inhibiting Hsp90 is therefore recognized as a pote ntial therapeutic target. To this end, we are currently synthesizing novel Hsp90 inhibitors based on an unprecedented 15 GT-05 Walter Gonzalez1, Jaroslava Miksovska1 1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University Allosteric net work in the neuronal calcium sensor protein DREAM DREAM/KChIP3 is a calcium -sensing protein that coassembles with Kv4 potassium channels in the brain and heart as well as with DNA in the nucleus where it regulates gene expression. The interaction of DREA M/KChIP3 with A -type Kv4 channels and DNA has been shown to regulate excitable cells. Previous results have shown a Ca2+ dependent interaction between DREAM/KChIP3 and Kv4/DNA which involves interactions at the N -terminus. In this work we propose that a hi ghly conserved network of aromatic residues controls protein dynamics and the pathways of signal transduction on DREAM/KChIP3. Molecular dynamics simulations, site -directed mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy provide strong evidence in support of a h ighly dynamics mechanism of signal transduction and regulation.

Pore size control in this family of fsc MOMs was exerted by varying the length of th e ligand, whereas pore chemistry was implem ented using unsaturated metal centers (UMCs) and the use of either organic 1,5 - napthalaenedisfulfonate (NDS) or inorganic SiF 62- (\"SIFSIX\") pillars. For MOMs that were synthesized using NDS, CO 2 sorption studies revealed higher isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) for the material with the smallest pore sizes. In addition, using SIFSIX instead of NDS as a pillar resulted in eclipsed [Cu 2(CO 2R)4] moieties; the space between these moieties allows for a strong CO 2 binding site that can be regarded as an example of a single -molecule trap.

The disease manife sts itself in a short acute phase and a long chronic pha se. Current treatments are effective only in the acute phase and are not used in the chronic phase due to toxicity of the drugs. Hence a new drug discovery approach was chosen for this disease. Cruzain is the major etiologic enz yme involved in the disease and is only present in the parasite. It is also an enzyme expressed by the parasite in both phases. Herein, a novel virtual p eptoid library containing known ketone based inhibitor was constructed and screened against cruzain. The peptoids thus found throug h this drug discovery effort can be used as potential drug candidates against cruzain. Computational techniques will help achieve a high degree of specificity and aid in proposing assays for determining compounds with high activity. GT-11 Ha Thi Hoang Ng uyen1, Stephen A. Miller1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Ferulic acid and p -coumaric acid -based copolymers as biorenewable polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene mimics Our goal is to synthesize polymers from abundant and inexp ensive biorenewable monomers, yielding materials with thermal and mechanical properties which mimic or excel those of commodity polymers. Ferulic acid and p -coumaric acid, both naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acids possessing antioxidant properties, de rive from lignocellulose. They are used as starting materials to synthesize acetylferulic, acetyldihydroferulic, acetylcoumaric, and acetyldihydrocoumaric acid monomers. These monomers, when copolymerized at various feed ratios, produce copolymers with tun able thermal and physical properties. Some copolymers exhibit thermal properties comparable to commercially available non -renewable packaging plastics \u2014particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS). For example, the glass transition tem perature can be tuned from 78 \u00b0C to 177 \u00b0C. With such promising properties, copolyesters from substituted hydroxycinnamic acids could prove to be sustainable replacements for non -biorenewable and non -degradable commodity plastics. GP-12 Khanh Ha1, Alan Ka tritzky1 1Department of Chemistry, University of Florida S to N long -range acyl migrationstrategy for coupling of peptide fragments Native chem. ligation (NCL) , the most common form of chem. ligation, has become a widely used chemoselective technique to synthesize large peptides based on a capture /rearrangem ent concept. NCL has been extensively studied in peptidic compds. bearing a cysteine residue at the N terminus. Modified cysteine scaffolds have also been incorporated for the syntheses of novel peptides and proteins and for surface immobilization. The cla ssical NCL method is limited to peptides possessing an N -terminal cysteine residue. To overcome this requirement of a specifically placed cysteine residue one approach is the use of thiol ligation auxiliaries, but unfortunately, removable cyst eine mimics can sterically hinder ligation and difficulties can arise at the stage of auxiliary removal. We have successfully developed novel approach applying S to N long -range acyl migration to synthesize peptide and peptide analogs and provided mechanistic GT-13 Ning Ma1, Arjan van der Vaart1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida DNA bend and base flip: possible trigger for UVDDB recognition process Ultraviolet light -induced pyrimidine photodimers are repa ired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which is a sequence independent process. This damage introduces a kink and conformational change on DNA, which possibly activates the recognition process. Af ter binding to DNA, the repair protein causes the d amaged base to flip out, however the connection between the recognition of damaged DNA and DNA conformational change remains elusive. Here, we employed enhanced two -dimensional umbrella sampling computational method to uncover the link between the tendency of DNA to bend and flipping out of the damaged base, which may be important in the recognition process. Results indicate that damaged site increases DNA chain flexibility and bending, moreover it lowers the energy barrier for bas e flipping. That is most l ikely why the process like this is not observed for undamaged DNA. GT-14 Ken Kull , Alejandro Rivera , Garrett Craft, Julianne Harmon 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Synthesis and Characterization of novel flexible polyimide contain ing long and short polyetheramine units Polyimides are a class of high temperature resistant thermoplastic polymers that are most frequently used because of their th ermal stability and good mechanical properties. A novel polyimide has been developed to so lve the disadvantage of process -ability. The polyimide is composed of aromatic and aliphatic diamines to obtain the flexibility and rigidity optimal for the original purpose of solid state batter ies. Different compositions of the diamines monomer are creat ed to characterize the polymer and the different properties of it. Rheology, TGA, FTIR, Hardness and Tensile testing have been used to define the properties and characteristics of six different combinations. While the long aliphatic 17 chain reduces the therm al stability of the polymer, all of the compositions are above 98% stable up to 330\u00baC. The different lengths in the aliphatic chains provide a wide range for the manipulation of the Tg.

However, cyclodextrins are not equally abundant and cannot be selectively, chem ically augmented.

The unique structu re of peptoids allows for the introduction of non - natural and diverse side chains, capable of generating extensive compound libraries with applications in drug discovery and m aterial design. However, their successful biomimicry when synthesized in conjunct ion with a prosthetic heme group has yet to be explored. Herein, a comparison of the optical character and catalytic activity via an ABTS assay of the model heme -peptide microperoxidase -11 and its peptoid analogue is examined to ensure the structure and fu nction of the synthetic peptidomimetic system is retained.

GT-28 Adam Hogan1, Brian Space1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Developing the Next Generation of Classical Force Fields for Molecular Simulations Currently there is a pressing need to simulate a wide variety of molecules in the gas phase, the condensed phase, the bulk, i n mixtures and in heterogeneous media. However, limitations in the accuracy, transferability and computational efficiency of curr ent force fields have reduced their usefulness. These shortcomings will be addressed in this work by combining physically meaningful potential forms with h igh accuracy electronic structure calculations and benchmark thermodynamic data. The associated insig hts could have a significant impact in empirical force field modeling throughout science, including fields as diverse as liquids, polymers, solids, biology and soft matter. Arjan van der Vaart1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Enhanced sampling simulations of DNA base pair parameters We are developing an efficient method for the calculations of DNA base pair parameters in molecular dynamic simulations. Thes e six parameters (shear, stretch, stagger, buckle, propeller, and opening) describe the relative geometric orientation of the DNA bases. The m ethod does not use idealized base pairs and uses a reduced representation of DNA, which results in faster calculation of the neede d derivatives. Test calculations on a large DNA data set showed that our simplified method achieves excellent correlation with 3DNA. We expect th e method to be useful in quantifying base pair flexibilities from molecular dynamics free energy simulations. 18 GT-20 Phillip Hudson1, Fiona Kearns2, Gerhard K\u00f6nig3, Stefan Boresch3, H.

However, its usefulness in mitigating radiation induced lung injury (RILI), including radiation induced lung inflammation and fibrosis, has not been tested. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of CDDO -Me on RILI in mice and the underlying me chanisms. Herein, we found that administration of CDDO -Me improved histopathological score, reduced the number of inflammatory cells and concentrations of total protein in bronchoalveolar lava ge fluid (BALF), suppressed secretion and expression of pro -inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growth factor - (TGF -) and interleukin (IL) -6, elevated the expression of anti -inflammatory cytokine IL -10, and down -regulated the mRNA level -fibrotic genes, including Chemistry, Department of Chemistry 2Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida 3Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego Mechanistic Binding Insights for DXS, the Rate -Limiting Enzyme of Isoprenoid Biosynthesis -Causing Protists falciparum and vivax Our vivax and P. falciparum. We set about to elucidate the binding mechanism of this TPP-dependent enzyme using steady -state kinetic analyses, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titration. Both DXS enzymes adhere to a random sequential mechanism with re spect to binding both substrates: pyruvate and D -glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate. This is in contrast to all other TPP -dependent enzymes which utilize a classical ping -pong mechanism. Our research will aid in the development of novel agents that target the non -mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, which will help to treat malaria infection. Sophie Bernad1, and 2Department of Chemistry & Physics, l'Universit \u00e9 Paris -Sud Role of ionic strength and the Bohr effect in modulating thermodynamic profiles associated with CO escape in rice non -symbiotic hemoglobin 1 Rice hemoglobin (rHb1) is a type 1 non -symbiotic hemoglobin belonging to the family of six -coordinated heme p roteins which are found in all plants. Using photoacoustic calorimetry, we have characterized thermodynamic profiles for CO photorelease from wild type rHb1 and a distal histidine mutant. Under stripped conditions at pH 7.0, a temperature dependence of rea ction volume and enthalpy change is observed. CO photo -release from the native protein below 16 \u00b0C is associated with H of 29.3\u00b12.3 kcal mol-1 and V of 4.1 \u00b1 0.3 mL mol-1. Replacement of the distal histidine modifies the rate constant for CO rebinding however the thermodynamic profiles for CO escape are similar to those observed for the native protein. The addition of 500 mM NaCl or adjustment of the pH to 6.0 eliminates the observed temperature dependence. The impacts of electrostriction, Bohr effect, and protein oligomerization on observed values of H and V will be discussed. GP-04 Khoa P ham1, Jaroslava Miksovska1 1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University Identify the binding interface between DREAM and presenilin 1 C -terminal fragment Interactions of downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator ( DREAM) and presenilin -1 (PS1) are involved in several neuropathological processes. However, molecular details on the interaction interface between DREAM and PS1 as well as the imp act of Ca2+/Mg2+ on DREAM -PS1 complex formation remain unknown. Here, a nation has been used to investigate the system. Titration data showed that Ca2+DREAM binds to HL9 with a dissociation constant of 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M and a 10 -fold weaker affinity was determined for helix -7, whereas no interaction was observed for helix -. Time -resolved anisotropy data indicate that Ca2+ DREAM interacts with PS1 -HL9 in a dimeric form. The 20 high activation energy for Ca2+DREA M association to HL9 (15.9 \u00b1 3.1 kcal mol-1) suggests conformational changes with decreased flexibility of the loop in DREAM upon interaction with HL9. The interaction interface between DREAM and PS1 will be discussed.

Of particular interest is their capacity to readily and quantitatively abso rb gases. In this work, using x -ray diffraction data provi ded by experimental groups, charges of atoms in a single unit cell of NOTT -112, a novel copper based bimetallic center rht -MOF, were calculated by means of geometry optimization and charge potential calculations with NWCHEM to analyse the potential sorptio n capacities of the material for multiples gases. Particular attention is given to the nature of the bimetallic centers, whos e copper atoms predictably have varying charges based on the conformation of the MOF structure, and thus different affinities t o gaseous molecules.

Marine fungal endophytes live in harsh environments, producing secondary metabolites as a survival strategy. In the laboratory, production o f secondary metabolites is often down -regulated. Epigenetic modifiers can be used to activate down regulated biosynthetic pathways to access a greater chemical repertoire. Following a high -throughput, epigenetic -based screen of mangrove endophytic fungi, one fungal strain from the Tampa Bay area was identified for its activity against ESKAPE pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. It was grow n in large scale and in epigenetically modified conditions. Its secondary metabolites were extracted, and the fractionation and purification of extracts was guided by NMR. Epigenetic modification of the fungi caused the production of a suite of new and kno wn compounds, with one derivative found only in the modified conditions exhibiting activity against S. aureus. 21 GP-9 Elizabeth Yancey1,2, Renee Fleeman3, Bill J Baker1,2, Les N Shaw4 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida 2Center for Drug Discovery & Innovation, University of South Florida 3Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida Optimization o f Fungal Metabolite Expression Via Epigenetic Modification For Drug Discovery The harsh an d competitive environment in which marine microbes live instigates their production of chemical defenses. When cultured, thes e environmental pressures are not present, leading to the down -regulation of some biosynthetic pathways. Artificial stressors are o ften applied to activate an enhanced metabolic response in the laboratory setting. For example, upon epigenetic modification, endophytic fung i from Floridian mangroves have been found to produce secondary metabolites not observed in untreated cultures, and to increase the number of fungal extracts found to be active in bioassay against virulent pathogens by about 50%. We have begun to study the effects potent, selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to determine what, if any, effect HDAC -specificity has on epigenetic control in coaxing secondary metabolites from cultured fungi. Metabolomics via LC/QToF MS has been employed to quantify the similarity of compound profiles produced b y each modified fungal sample, and activity against the ESKAPE pathogen s assessed.

Ab scisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone involved in seed dormancy, may also play a key role in regulating this parasitic dorman cy. We have detected ABA in the blood stages of P. falciparum and aim to characterize its biosynthesis utilizing 13C labelled metabolic ABA precursor, [13C] geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). In order to accomplish this, we must first carry out the total synthesis of [13C] isoprenol, which will be pyrophosphorylated to yield [13C] isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and enzyme GGPP synt hase. The metabolic label will then be used to determine intermediates on the ABA pathway within the parasite. Our long -term goals will center on elucidating and understanding ABA's role in P. falciparum . Xin Cui1, X.

A novel polyimide has been developed to solve the disadvantage of process -ability. The polyimide is composed of aromatic and aliphatic diamines to obtain the flexibility and rigidity optimal for the original purpose of battery applicatio n. Different compositions of the diamines monomer are created to characterize the polymer and the different properties of it. Rh eology, TGA, FTIR, Hardness and Tensile testing have been used to define the properties and characteristics of six different combinations.

In this study Octolig\u00ae was used in order to remove pharmaceuticals from water, a commercially available material with polyethy ldiamine moieties covalently attached to high -surface area silica gel. The two drugs used were acetaminophen and naproxen; they are commonly used for pain and fever reducing properties. These selected drugs were tested using column chromatography by remova l of ion encapsulation. The effectiveness of this treatment depends on having the appropriate anionic functional group. Most APIs have a high solubility, in accordance with the Biopharmaceutics Classification System and thus form anionic species in waste w ater.

Rhizophora mangl e are routinely affected by oil spills because of their location in coastal areas. In addition to the organic components, oil spills commonly have enriched levels of heavy metals. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been linked to genetic mutations, but the PAHs are only one component of oil spills. A readily visible indicator of genetic mutations in mangroves are propagules exhibiting albinism. The concentrations of two metals: lead and copper, were compared in samples taken from locations of known frequ encies of albinism to determine if a correlation is present. The locations being investigated are War Veterans Park, Simmons Park, Sawyer Key, and Elanore Is land. These locations were chosen because of their documented histories of oil spills (excluding Wa r Veterans Park) and their varying levels of albinism frequencies.

This study sought to compare histone post -translational modifications (PTMs) due to oxidative stress of mouse microglial cells with different levels of eth anol exposure. Analyzing PTMs via mass spectroscopy continues to be a challenge because the protease trypsin cleaves at lysine and arginine sites, and histones are rich in both amino acid residues. Propionylation, or treatment of histones with propionic an hydride, blocks lysine sites from trypsin digestion. This leads to more hydrophillic fragments which are better resolved using reverse -phase HPLC and mass spectra that are simpler to interpret. While propionylation has been utilized on other cell types, th is is the first time it has been used to analyze microglial cells.

It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a specified type of acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We hypothesize that this TKIs acts on other molecular targets in addition to tyrosine kinases that work together to regulate a n umber of important cellular processes. Employing the comprehensive docking method with our establis hed chemical protein interactome (CPI) and 11 FDA - approved TKIs, we have discovered 301 PDB -deposited proteins corresponding.

Cell flow cytometry data showed induced apoptosis from the Florida Assembly mechanism of cochaperone -kinase complexes Cdc37 is a cochaperone that functions as the gatekeeper for kinase entry into the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. It is implicated to cancer initiation and progression due to its association with proto -oncogenic client kinases and their recruitment to Hsp90. Our goal is to study the mechanism behind the selectivity that Cdc37 displays for Hsp90 -depend ent kinases over Hsp90 -independent kinases. Previous structural methods used to resolve the structure of Cdc37 -kinase complexes have been unsuccessful due to the dynamic nature and low conformational stability of the substrates. In order to gain a high res olution insight to the specificity determinants involved in differentiating Hsp90 -dependent and Hsp90 - independent kinases, as well as to be able to further elucidate the structure of Cdc37, we have employed nuclear magnetic res onance spectroscopy (NMR) in combination with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Our studies reveal the specificity determinants embedded within the chaperone that orchestrates sorting and entry of oncogenic substrates into the Hsp90 chaperone cycle.

The focus of our research is to better understand the binding mechanism and structural changes that DREAM undergoes upon bind ing of Ca2+. To this end we empl oyed terbium(III) as a calcium biomimetic and characterized its interaction with DREAM using thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques. Using circular dichroism, temperature stability, fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal calorimet ry we were able to show that terbium(III) bound DREAM forms an intermediate structure that exposes hydrophobic cavities. Terbium(III) binding to CaM and DREAM show identical thermodynamics but the induced structural changes are different. The relevance of these findings not o nly expands the knowledge of the calcium and terbium binding properties of neuronal calcium sensors but also provides insight on how these pr oteins regulate heart pacemaking of South Florida 2Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Florida 3Byrd Alzheimer's Institute, University of South Florida Effect of Cd c37 on the C -terminal TDP43 expressing C. elegans The aggregation of the C -terminal kDa(C25) fragment of Trans -active response DNA binding protein (TDP43), is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal De mentia.

A river's flow regime and water chemistry are important drivers of many ecosystem components. However, few studies explore ho w differences in flow rates and water chemistry among rivers can influence communities of parasites and their hosts. Here, we investigated the impact of flow mechanics and different hydro -chemical components between Alafia and Hillsborough Rivers on the prevalence intensity of natatory -isopod also explored seasonality in parasitism by comparing monthly samples from the two rivers throughout 2005 -2008. We found that anchovies from Alafia River had a significantly higher intensity and prev alence of parasitism than those from Hillsborough; however strong seasonality in the abundance of anchovies in both rivers was also an important predictor of parasitic infections. Our results suggest that the higher flow rate and lower chemical con centrati ons of the Alafia River may provide more opportunities for parasites to infect hosts. 29 BC-09 nt of Science and Technology, Inter American University of Puerto Rico, Ponce Campus, Mercedita, and P.R. 00715. *Research Director, ejferrer@ponce.inter.edu Antimicrobial effect of improved antibiotics combined with Ni and Semi -Green Ag nanoparticles in Klebsiella pneumoniae Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a major problem worldwide. The daily increase of resistant strains can trigge r a variety of infections. Nanotechnology offers possible alternative treatments, improving the antimicrobia l activity of antibiotics, due to the properties of different metals. Our main objective is to develop more effective treatments against these resistant bacterial and nosocomial infections, combining metal nanoparticles with antibiotics. In this study, two different nanoparticles, Ni and Semi Green Ag, were combined with antibiotics. The antibiotics Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Levofloxacin and Vancomycin, were used at two different concentrations against Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC # 13882), the causal agent o f pneumonia and urinary tract infections in humans. Also, it revealed the antimicrobial effects of determined concentrations of antibiotics and nanoparticles, at equal and different proportions, against the bacteria. The results showed that some nanoparti cles mixed with the antibiotics, at specific concentrations, increased the potential activity of the antibiotic against the b acteria, while in others the nanoparticles mixed with the antibiotics decreased the potential activity of the antibiotics. & Technology , Inter American University of Puerto Rico, Ponce Campus , 104 Turpeaux Ind Park, Mercedita PR Indole -3-Acetic Acid with gold nanoparticles synthesized through a double reduction reaction using leaflets' extracts of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Witt.

Gonzalez1, Jaroslava Miksovska1 1Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida International University Insight into the calmodulin and DREAM protein complex interaction, mechanism and function DREAM (Downstream -regulatory -element -antagonistic -modulator) is a neuronal calcium sensor which mo dulates gene expression. We show that association of calcium calmodulin (CaM) with DREAM is mediated by an amino -acid sequence on residues 29 -44 of DREAM. The association of CaM with a peptide DREAM(29 -44) or to native DREAM is calcium dependent (KD of 136 nM and 3.4M, respectively). Thermodynamic/kinetic studies show the decreased affinity of native protein is due to electrostatic interaction between the b asic N -terminus and an acidic surface on DREAM. Fluorescence -anisotropy decay measurements showed rotatio nal-correlation times of 10.8 ns for CaM:DREAM(29 -44), supporting a wraparound -semispherical model. Interactions between IEDANS labeled CaM with DREAM are best modeled as heterotetramers. Calcium CaM:DREAM adopts an elongated conformation (correlation time 45 ns). Additionally, CaM:DREAM association eliminates nonspecific interaction of DREAM with the DRE -dsDNA sequence of human prodynorphin gene.

Laboratory instruction has potential of developing fundamental science practices; however, little evidence supports its realization. Evidence collected, mostly quantitative, focuses on satisfaction and performance, comparing students in different learning environment s. This qualitative inquiry investigates the experience of a cohort exposed to two substantially differen t laboratory environments. The focus on change of laboratory format renders complementary understanding to that from participants who experienced a single format. The first se mester was a traditional expository program. The following semester was a coopera tive, problem -based, multi -week format. Eleven students were interviewed individually after their completion of the sequence. A phenomenology was used for the reduction, analysis, and in terpretation of data. The study identified several vectors of change s erved as lens to analyze the phenomenon. The participants experienced the transition from mindlessness to mindfulness. This experience was independent of participants' approval/disapproval.

Elucidating the reaction mechanism with QM/MM Hydroxyurea (HU) is currently the only FDA approved treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) and it is known to affect symptom relief by interacting with blood borne heme enzymes, like catalase, which convert HU to NO. It is our goal in this work to use computational techniques (molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical) to predict the most likely reaction pathway for the release of NO by catalase. Thus far, a model for catalase compound I has been constru cted using CHARMM, and quantum mechanically optimized geometries have been attained using QChem as well as we have found the reactant complex to be in the doublet spin state.

Overcoming Costly Sampling Limitations using Non-Boltzmann Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method to Generate Potentials of Mean Force The task of accurately conducting free energy simulations is made complicated by two discordant forces: the need for adequate sampling, and the need for accurately descri bing inter - and intra -molecular interactions, which is prohibitive over long simulations. In this work, the recently developed QM -NBB (Quantum Mechanical Non -Boltzmann Bennett) method has been extended to compute potentials of mean force (PMFs). Initially, a simple conformational change has been modeled - the torsional rotation around butane's central dihedral - to validate this novel free energy simulation technique. Using this new approach we were able to arrive at QM quality (e.g., HF/6 -31G*) results usi ng simulations carried out at the molecular mechanical (MM, CHARMM c36ff) and semi -empirical (SCC -DFTB) levels of theory. This new, \"vertical\", QM - NBB method accurately and efficiently calculates perturbations between the underlying MM and QM PMFs. This is accomplished by cleverly assembling the QM end -state ensembles from \"intermediate\" semi -empirical simulations and then re -evaluating simulation data at the desired Hamiltonian under the influence of a biasing potential appropriate to the differences betwe en the two levels of theory. The data presented from this test case illustrates how well suited this new method is for overcoming costly sampling limitations when highly accurate results are desired.

RXR \"subordination\" divides the complexes into \"permissive\" dimers, in which activation is achieved by binding of a RX R agonist or ligand of the binding partner, and \"non -permissive\" dimers, in which activation cannot be achieved by RXR ligands alone. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of corepressor (CoR) bound RAR/RXR, PPAR/RXR and PPAR/RXR complexes in t he presence and absence of RXR agonists to elucidate the link between subordination and CoR release. Structural analyses showed significant differences in CoR binding between permissive and non -permissive complexes, as well as distinct responses to RXR lig and loading.

Tidal flux is vital to the available iron present, by affecting the oxidation state in which it is found. The form of iron is directly related to the availability of aqu eous phosphorus in the system. The amount of oxygen in the sediment helps to keep a balance between the various forms of iron. The site of Sawyer's Basin was selected based on the lack of plant growth and patc hy mangrove distribution on the altered side of Bailey's Bluff Road in comparison to the side with regular tidal flux. A cause for these characteristics of the site could be the road obstructing the pathway of tidal water.

More specifically, the innumerable amount of endophytic fungi growing within mangrove trees provide a valuable library for obtaining secondary metabolites that may sh ow activity against the ESKAPE pathogens. Fungi are a viable source because the harshness of their environment, in some cases, leads to natural antibiotic production. Epigenetic modifier s can help open up new biosynthetic pathways, eliciting maximum expres sion of the metabolites. The protocol includes culturing of the fungi in epigenetic modifiers, extraction and screening against the ESKAPE pathogens. Organisms that produce active compounds will be reisolated and have their active compound(s) ide ntified. The following presentation covers samples screened to date.

The leaves of the Chinese plant, Camellia sinensis, have been used as traditional medicine for thousands of years and the res ulting hot ev ening beverage from its leaves became popular as green tea. The green tea powder, provided by the USF Botanical Gardens is a comple x mixture rich in polyphenol compounds that may effect brain health. In addition to Camellia sinensis, other botanicals that may also effect brain health were boiled and subjected to subtractive chromatographic separation using preparative LC -MS at the Center of Excellence for Drug Discovery and Innovation (CDDI) Chemodiversity Facility. Fractions of selected compounds along wit h the corresponding remaining extracts were produced. These resulting pairs of subtracted chromatographied fractions were submitted to the College of Molecular Medicine and the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair to evaluate the bioactivity con tribution and to examine the anti -inflammatory actions and prevention of reactive oxygen species production.

They are also nutrient rich, and therefore teeming with life. Many of the organisms that life in the Antarctic waters are invertebrates, such as sponges, corals, tunicates, sea stars, and algae. These organisms produce chemistry that commonly acts as feeding deterr ents or antifouling agents within their environment, but have proven to have potential medicinal value. We have begun to extract all available marine invertebrates with intention to screen these extracts for bioactivity in many different assays. Upon ident ification of promising bioactivity, we intend to isolate and identify the bioactive molecules via HPLC and NMR of Chemis try, University of South Florida 2Center for Drug Discovery & Innovation, University of South Florida Isolation and Structure Elucidation of New Meridianins from Antarctic Tunicate Synoicum sp. Marine life in Antarctica is a tremendous resource of novel compounds due to its isolated and unique habitat. A tunicate is a sessile marine organism, which relies on chemical defense to prevent predation and to adapt to the environment. The yellow top tunicate Syno icum sp. was collected off Antarctica and previous ly led to the report of indole alkaloids Meridianin A, B, C, and E from Dr. Baker's group. In this project, our goals are to isolate and to identify both known and potential new compounds from Synoicum sp (coll# NBP13 -9).

NP-06 Shane Clark1 of S outh Florida Antica ncer potential of a marine cyanobacterium Natural products, or secondary metabolites, are low molecular weight compounds that have been found to be beneficial to moder n medicine. This is true for Symploca sp. cyanobacteria, which produces largazole, a pot ent anti -cancer depsipeptide currently in clinical trials. Other secondary metabolites including unique peptides produced by Symploca should be targeted for biological activity. For this pur pose, a large quantity of this cyanobacterium was collected in a r ecent 2014 dive trip in Long Key, FL. The samples genus cannot be taxonomically identified due to morphological similarities between Symloca sp and Lynbya sp. A chemical analysis will be used to identify t he exact genus and species. After exhaustive extrac tions, multiple purification steps including medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to isolate compounds.

In this study, a novel cyclodextrin (CD) -based drug delivery system for the activatable drug delivery was designed and evaluated in vivo. An adamantane -doxorubicin conjugate was synthesized with quenched fluorescence and cytotoxicity, which has been utilized as the activatable drug to be delivered by the folic acid conjugated cyclodextrin vector to folate receptor -positive [FR (+)] cancer cells. Few studies on this topic have been done as an in vitro and in vivo study with nude mice. The novel FA -conjugated -CD based drug complex with targeting and activatable characteristics might be promising as an anti -tumor treatment for FR (+) cancer.

The four main targets of interest are the ESKAPE pathogens, Leish mania donovani , Naegleria fowleri , and a variety of cancer -targets. In order to increase the probability of finding new or novel active compounds, the fungi are epigenetically modified in the culture process. Screening efforts have resulted in many active organisms. The scale -up process is a 37 vital step for compound elucidation and identification. Here, we will discuss the scale -up of an organism having activity against ESKAPE Kyle3, Bill J.

The discovery of novel drugs has decreased, causing a reliance on already circulating dru gs. The aim of our research is to discover new, potential compounds for drug development. Marine fungal endophytes in mangroves endure harsh conditions, producing secondary metabolites for survival. In laboratory, producti on of metabolites is down -regulate d due to lack of stress. Epigenetic modifiers are used to activate the down -regulated biosynthetic pathways in order to access the fungi's greater chemical repertoire. The modifiers used are sodium butyrate and 5 -azacytidine. Mangrove tissues from the field are plated onto growth media. Pure colonies, obtained through successive isolation, are treated with modifiers and inoculat ed onto rice. These are extracted with ethyl acetate, dried down, and resolvated with dimethyl sulfoxide. Extracts are screened aga inst the parasite using an axengic amastigote and an infected macrophage model, and are tested for cytotoxicity. NP-10 Ariel E. Watts1,2, Alexa Pullicin1,2, Matthew N.

Florida mangroves are a reservoir of fungal endophytes and source of chemodiversity. Environmental pressures coax fungi to produce secondary metabolites \u2014an invaluable compounds with antibiotic potential. Due to a marked decrease in secondary metabolite production when grow n under laboratory conditions, epigenetic modification has been utilized to activate silent biosynthetic pathways, allowing for previously unreported compounds to be o bserved in high concentrations. A high -throughput screening project identified a fungal s train active against the ESKAPE pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Isolated in the Tampa Bay area, the fungal strain was scaled -up and epigenetically -modified. Secondary metabolites were extracted and purified NMR was used for fractionation and purification. The fungal strain produced a derivative of a known compound observed in one of the modified -conditions and exhibited activity against methicillin -resistant S.

Ultrasonic conditions improves SNAr reaction between 1 -halo-4-nitrobenzenes and imidazole. K.HITE and J.JONES. Sonochemistry, a widely researched sector of green chemistry, can be used as an alternative method in synthesizing many common organic substances. In using ultrasound, less energy is consumed, less hazardous waste products are created, and less toxic chemicals are needed to drive reactions as compared to reactions run under traditional thermal conditions. Ultrasound has proven suc cessful previously in driving the inorganic base - catalyzed reaction of imidazole with 1 -halo-4-nitrobenzenes to form 1 -(4-nitrophenyl) -imidazole under a nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (SNAr). Using an ultrasonic cleaning bath (40 kHz, 110 W) in place of the traditional probe sonicator system, the SNAr reaction was optimized via the variation of leaving groups, inorganic bases used, and the ratio of imidazole and base to the halobenze ne. It was observed that a larger nucleophile to halobenzene ratio and a 1.62:1 halonitrobenzene to potassium carbonate ratio Husain1, Arthur Maknenko1, Kirpal Bisht1 1Department of Chemistry, of Florida Synthesis of N -Carboxy -Cyclic Anhydrides The synthe sis of polypeptides by ring -opening polymerization is an attractive approach to their synthesis for material science applications.

In the future this scaffold will be used to create a combinatorial library for screening hits to varying targets . The peptoid component of the hybrid compound is advantageous to the overall library diversity due the fact that there are an estimated 500 -1000 times more primary amines than amino acids commercially available. Our main objective in this project was to d evelop new primary amines for incorporation into the scaffold. Several organic synthetic schemes were utilized to identify the best method for the creation of these amines. Efforts were di rected toward a successful route that minimized time and materials. Chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques proved that this efficient route resulted in high yields of pure primary amines scalable to 10 grams of product. 39 OR-05 Amber Hodge1, Yan Shi1, Jianfeng Cai1 1Department of Chemist ry, University of South Flori da The building blocks of the AA -peptide Amino acids are the basic building blocks of peptide chains. The building blocks of AA -peptides are synthesized as a secondary amine that is acylated with various carboxylic acids from the reaction of amino acid e sters with Fmoc -amino ethyl aldehyde. The A A-peptides are a class of mimic peptides that resemble natural -peptides. These peptide mimics are oligomers of N -acylated -N-aminoethyl amino acids. The newly synthesized -AApeptide has a modified framework of the AA -peptide in that it is composed of -substituted -N-acylated -N-amino -ethyl amino acids. There are copious biomedical applications that arise with the use of this peptide mimic. It is resistant to hydrolysis and proteolysis, which makes the synthesis and utilization of the peptide effortless. Th is peptide mimic is used to influence protein -protein interaction as well as cell signaling processes.

The current method for the generation works but there is still room for improvement. This volume of improvement th at is available is what this experiment is aiming to reduce, either by generating a higher percent yield of equal purity or the same yield with a higher purity. To prove the yield the product produced is being tested with numerous tests including (but not limited to) UV/Visible light s pectroscopy, and NMR, and will be compared to the factory produced standard as a control.

It is contracted through the bite of sandflies, which commonly occur in the less developed cou ntries. A form of the chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 plays a critical role in the life cycle of Leishmania donovani , so finding compounds that can selectively inhibit this protein can subsequently hinder the disease by interfering with the growt h of the parasite.

Membranolide A has been shown to possess antimicrobial bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, the relative stereochemistry of membra nolide A is known, however the absolute stereoch emistry is currently unknown.

OR-13 James Khanh Ha1, Flor ida Hydroxyproline Ligation in Coupling of Peptide Fragments The development of chemoselective ligation represents a major interest in synthetic peptide chemistry. The first major breakt hrough in this approach began with the discovery of native chemical ligation. During the last two decades, major research efforts have been focused on applying this approach to other amino acid sites of ligation. Proline reacts at the slowest rate of all natural amino acids i n native chemical ligation, due to non -covalent electronic effects of the unique orientation of amide carbonyls in Xaa -Pro peptidic linkages. To address proline -site ligation, we developed a hydroxyproline ligation strategy, ligation \"capture -rearrangement\" principles, utilizing hydroxylproline's chemoselective bifunctionality. We successfully demonstrated that this approach achieves ligation at difficult proline sites in a generalizable fashion. Additionally, we studied the mechanism of hydroxyproline -site ligat ion to further understand this reaction. We successfully isolated the key bridged bicyclic aminal intermediate which verifies the proposed mechanism. 41 OR-14 Nicholas Clough1 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Enantioselective Aza -Friedel-Crafts Reaction of Phenols with Imines by Chiral Phosphoric Acids Presently, the Friedel -Crafts reaction is a useful tool for the formation of carbon -carbon bonds. In the past twenty years, the employment of chiral organocatalysts in such reactions ha s shown enantioselectivity and high yield for the desired products. As chiral amines are prevalent in medically important compounds, a convenient synthesis is valuable and possible by asymmetric aza -Friedel -Crafts reactions.

In 2010, there we re ~200 million cases and 660,000 deaths due to malaria. The parasitic source of transmission is Apicomplexa of the genus Plasmodium. Human infection occurs through sporo zoites, which move into the liver to mature into merozoites and infect red blood cells . Gametogenesis does not proceed until these cells are ingested by a mosquito to form new sporozoites and restart the cycle. The purpose of this project is to retard the ability of gametocytes t o enter the mosquito vector by forcing their premature differe ntiation and keeping them as merozoites inside the host. Xanthurenic acid is the activating chemical factor responsible for initiating gametogenesis in the mosquito's gut.

OR-20 Angel Gomez1, Garrett Craft 1Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida Drug Delivery via Biocompatible Composites Methacrylate hydrogels synthesized with copper paddlewheel filler material will be assayed for applications in controlled drug r elease. Hydrogels are polymeric materials which can absorb large amounts of water, and coupled with their porosity make them quite similar to human tissue. The filler material along with HEMA will serve to crosslink the polymer chains and is proposed to modulate the diffusive properties of the material. The paddlewheels contain two coppers that coordinate with four carboxylate ligands at near 90 degree angles. The paddlewheel material can form hydrogen bonds via their ligand's hydroxyl groups, serving as crosslinkers between the methacry late pendant groups of the polymer. The aim of this project is to ultimately provide a biocompatible material that intrinsically delivers drugs over prolonged periods of time.

The project involved, first, optimizing the synthetic strategy for the monoacylated PAM monomer of the ligand. Next, the monomer was incorporated into the polypeptide us ing N - Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis tech nique. Finally, a fluorescent dye conjugate was prepared and attached to the N -terminus of the ligand. The ligand was prepared with high yield and purity levels. Future work will characterize the importance of this fluorescent l igand in the imaging of panc reatic , Yassin El Batrawi, Javier Cuevas, John Antilla Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida The Investigation of Ca2+ deregulation in the Treatment of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Farnesyltransferase i nhibitors (FTIs) such as tipifarnib have shown anti -proliferative activity against non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is hypothesized that the FTase inhibitory effect alone is insufficient for anti -cancer activity and that the disruption of Ca2+ homeos tasis within the tumor cells via interaction with the over -expressed Orai3 constituent of the store -operated channel (SOC) is necessary. A benzofuran analogue of tipifarnib previously synthesized by Asoh et al. showing high FTase inhibitory activity but lo w anti -proliferative effect is being used to test this hypothesis. OR-28 Teh, Wei Pin ; Bromfield Lee, Deborah Florida Southern College Studies towards the synthesis of Stachybotrin D. Recently, 7 novel phenylspirodrimanes were isolated from Stachyb otrys Chartarum MXH -X73 by a group from China while in search of bioactive secondary metabolites. Stachybotrin D, has shown inhibitory effects on the reverse transcriptase of HIV. The phenyl spirodrimanes are a class of molecules mainly isolated from Stachy botrys species, which its structure contains three main classes: tetracyclic aromatic sesquiterpenoids, pentacyclic aromatic sesquiterpenoids and pentacyclic moiety including a cis -fused decalin. These compounds have shown diverse bi oactivities, from targeting tyrosine kinase, cholesterol esterase to HIV -1 protease and endothelin, thus making them a class of compounds that are interesting and potentially useful in pharmacology. Overall, with developing a synthetic m ethodology for the phenylspirodrimanes, we will be able to design and synthesize various derivatives of these compounds that could potentially b e promising class of drugs. Our key step in this synthesis is the formation of spirobenzofuran, utilizing an asymmetric Grignard re action and follow by a condensation reaction. "}
