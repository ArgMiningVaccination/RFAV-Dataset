In order to learn how to balance skin pH levels naturally, Health Shots got in touch with beauty industry veteran Dr Blossom Kochhar, Chairperson of Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies. The pH of your skin indicates how acidic or alkaline your skin is. Dr Kochhar says, \"The pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a substance and ranges from 0 to 14. However, the skin's natural pH balance is slightly acidic, typically ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 on the pH scale.\" If it is more than 7, then your skin is alkaline, and if it is less than 7, then your skin is acidic. The skin's slightly acidic pH is important for several reasons such as protection against several skin conditions, and keeping it moisturised and nourished. Maintaining optimal pH levels for your skin offers a range of benefits. Dr Kochhar says, \"The right skin pH level keeps your skin healthy by enhancing the skin's barrier function, preventing moisture loss and protecting against irritants. Balanced pH regulates sebum production, reducing oiliness or dryness. It helps reduce acne breakouts by discouraging bacterial growth.\" Optimal pH calms and soothes the skin, reducing sensitivity and irritation.
