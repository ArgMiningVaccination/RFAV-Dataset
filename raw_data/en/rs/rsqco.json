STUDENT GOVERNMENT 203 a. Constitution of the Medical Dental Student Government (MDSG) 204 Section 1 : Introduction - About the School The University of Connecticut School of Medicine (SOM) is fully accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the national accrediting body for medical schools. The UConn SOM was originally conceived in the early 1960's when there was a national shortage of healthcare providers and such opportunities for careers in medicine were not easily accessible for Connecticut residents. Today, the SOM continues to commit to this vision. The SOM is particularly proud of the many opportunities available to students who want to have a meaningful impact on the various communities in Connecticut and we encourage our students to inve stigate all areas of interest to them: clinical care, scholarly work and research, global health, community service, advocacy, medical education, and the humanities and medicine. The SOM has several affiliated hospitals including John Dempsey Hospital, H artford Healthcare (which includes Hartford Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut), Saint Francis Hospital, and Connecticut Children's Medical Center, and where students will find themselves interacting in the broader Connecticut medical community. Students are supported throughout their medical student career by residents and fellows. We also have hundreds of community physicians who are dedicated to educating students in various clinical settings such as in our Clinical Longitudinal Immersion in the Community (CLIC) program and in our clerkships. Faculty on site and at our affiliated sites have diverse expertise and interests and enjoy teaching, mentoring and working with students in the clinical realm, in research and other projects. Our educational staff is committed to providing support to students in partnership with the faculty. This team approach is carefully role modeled for our students as they advance in a team- oriented clinical environment. The UConn SOM MDelta curriculum promotes self-directed and active learning, early clinical exposure, integration of basic and clinical sciences with inclusion of the behavioral and social sciences and a focus on the healthcare system. The primary pedagogy is team -based learning and there is a fo cus on technology in education throughout the curriculum. Our students will be trained to care for patients of the future and will develop an outstanding basic science foundation with superb clinical skills, with a commitment to scholarship, communities a nd to public health. We have a vast network of support for students. Students who are in need of guidance concerning their medical careers and/or personal issues are advised to speak with the Office of Student Affairs, who can also make referrals to other resources. Our curriculum experts invite student feedback and student participation as facilitators to junior colleagues. Our staff is expert and are always welcoming to students. We have all created an open door climate and foster a great collaborative relationship among students, faculty, residents, and staff. 4 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 1.a. Important Considerations This Academic Policies and Procedures Manual (APP) is subject to review and change . Manual updates are typically done annually but there may be instances where updates are required during the course of the academic year. We recommend check ing the APP to confirm policies and requirements in effect at any given time. In general, new ly updated or implemented policies are effective immediately. There are a few exceptions where a new policy may not apply to all currently enrolled students, i.e. students will be \"grandfathered\" to the old policy. Examples are not limited to but include the following: 1. Creation of new grade desi gnations 2. Graduation requirements 3. Disciplinary procedures followed will be those in place at the time of the complaint. Any policy that may not affect students currently enrolled at the time of the creation of the policy will be indicated as s uch within the policy . 5Section 2: Student Life & Well -Being UConn Health is comprised of the Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, The Graduate School, and Clinical Operations. Students enrolled in the School of Medicine are working towards the MD degree and those in the School of Dental Medicine work towards the DMD. In a unique fashion, medical and dental students are taught in an interprofessional environment with overlap of the first stage of the curriculum. The Graduate School offers Doctoral and Master's level degree programming. Some students pursue joint degrees across the schools at UConn Health as well as the other schools at the University of Connecticut. Clinical Operations includes the Jo hn Dempsey Hospital, UConn Medical Group and University Dentists. UConn Health is located on 180 acres in the Town of Farmington, five miles west of Hartford, the capital city. As Farmington is a residential suburb in the Hartford Metropolitan area that has retained its distinctive character through maintenance of its historic districts and careful land use planning for the future. Several office parks, large retirement communities and condominium developments contribute to an interesting economic and demog raphic mix. UConn Health is an open, non -residential campus. As a leading research center and teaching hospital, many of its buildings are active on a seven- day, twenty -four -hour basis. Policies included in this section: 2.a. Immunization Policy 2.b.

Immunization Policy The Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic at UConn Health must obtain adequate documentation of students' immunity to communicable diseases in order to protect the health of all patients, students, staff and employees for the University of Connecticut School of Medicine/Capital Area Health Consortium. This in accordance with Connecticut State Law - Public Act 89 -90, federal OSHA mandatory standard and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines. Types of documentation required are: Measles (Rubeola) one of the following must be submitted: a. Signed physician's record documenting immunization (2 doses of MMR) at least one month apart ( unle ss contraindicated ) OR b. Laboratory report of immune serum antibody titer Mumps: one of the following must be submitted: a. Signed physician's record documenting immunization (2 doses of MMR) OR b. Laboratory report on immune serum antibody titer Rubella: one of the following must be submitted: a. Signed physician's record documenting immunization ( 2 dose s of MMR) OR b. Laboratory report on immune serum antibody titer Varicella : one of the following must be submitted: a. Signed physician's record documenting immunization (2 doses of Varicella) OR b. Laboratory report on immune serum antibody titer Hepatitis B (HB ): a. Signed physician's record documenting immunization (3 doses of HB) AND b. A positive titer after at least one month from the third vaccine dose OR c. Laboratory report on immune serum antibody titer 7Tuberculosis (TB) Screening requires submission of: a. Two Tuberculin Skin Tests (TST) with negative results, by the Mantoux technique (with purified protein derivative, PPD, 5TU intradermally applied), within the past 12 months OR b. For those with a history of a positive TST or treated TB - Quantiferon testing within the past 12 months AND - Chest xray results from after the most recent positive TST or quantiferon (written report is acceptable for an x -ray obtained in the US, otherwise copy of film from a radiography obtained abroad will be necessary) Tetanus -diphtheria (Td) toxoid is highly recommended by the CDC to be given every 10 years. Td with acellular per tussis (Tdap) is recommended once in the adult life, 2 years from the last Td. Influenza Vaccine As we work in a clinical environment with patients, it is all of our responsibility to maintain good health and not present a vector for disease. All medical students are required to get an annual influenza vaccine and comply with any site requirement for the flu shot unless there is an acceptable exemption. In addition, students must ensure documentation of influenza vaccination or exemption is submitted to Employee Health Services by the annual deadline. COVID Vaccine At the time of this publication, all medical students are required to have received the primary series of COVID vacc ine ( at least 2 doses of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) OR one dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine .) Additional Requirements At times, due to emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS -CoV (COVID -19) an additional vaccination may be requested by the school and/or clinical sites. Students will be expecte d to receive these vaccinations unless an acceptable exemption applies. Documentation All students are required to provide complete immunization doc umentation to be eligible to begin their training program. Students are expected to provide proof of immunization or obtain the required immunizations before the evaluation at Employee Health Services. Various clinical sites have requirements for document ation of student immunization status and health. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that all required documents are received by any clinical site within the timeline requested. Failure to do so will be considered unprofessional behavior. 8 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.b. Health Insurance UConn Health requires all enrolled students to have and maintain health insurance. This insurance must be comparable to the UCHC Student Health Insurance Policy for the entire period as a registered student at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. Students at UConn Health are offered University of Connecticut's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). The SHIP is administered Wellfleet Group, LLC, and ha s contracted with Cigna for the plan's provider network of hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers. Students covered by SHIP also have access to a vision discount program and travel assistance program. Details about these benefits can be found at https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/fees - insurance/ under \"University Insurance Plan\" If under age 26, a student may comply with the health insurance requirement by being on a family plan . Alternately, they can be covered by a significant other 's policy. In both situations the coverage must be comparable to the UCH Student Health Insurance Policy . For additional information, please contact: Student Affairs Attn. Lisa Francini UConn Health AG-0 060 Phone: 9 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.c. Clinical Exposures and Injuries Workplace exposures and injuries (including needlestick injuries) are potential hazards of working in the healthcare setting. All students who experience a workplace exposure or injury, including slips and falls , should seek medical evaluation by occupational medicine at the site of the incident or through UConn Employee Health. Regardless of the initial site of treatment, you shou ld report the incident to UConn Employee Health during normal business hours (see below). Students are required to comply with all institutional and affiliate institutional policies and must undergo yearly bloodborne pathogen training. Students must always be alert to the hazards inherent in the use of sharps (needles, blades, etc.) and are encouraged to provide suggestions to the Office of Research Safety for safety related improvements. Syringes and needles being discarded must be disposed of promptly in a sharps container. Individuals are responsible for always conducting their activities to minimize the risk of needlestick injuries. Safety needles/syringes that will become contaminated with human materials must be used, as feasible, to minimize risks of such needlestick exposures. Capping of used syringes/needles is against Hospital and UConn Health policy because of the increased risk of needlestick injuries. The clipping of needles is also prohibited because of the possible generation of aerosols. S harps containers must be changed frequently enough that they never become overfilled. Exposures to blood and bodily fluids need to be addressed and treated immediately. An exposure may be a percutaneous injury, such as a needlestick, cut with a sharp object or bite, contact of mucous membranes, contact of tissue, or of skin when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis, or the contact is prolonged or involving an extensive area with blood or tissue or body fluids. All needlestick or exposure to bodily fluids must be reported and the student must seek immediate medical attention . In the event of a needlestick or puncture wound: immediately remove gloves and wash the contaminated area with an antimicrobial soap and water; apply an antiseptic, such as hydrogen peroxide and bandage. There are different instructions as to where a student should go depending on the location where the exposure occurred and the availability of services. The key important fact is that students MUS T SEEK IMMEDIATE ATTENTION and MUST always report any exposure to UConn Health's Occupational medicine. If the exposure occurs on the UConn Health campus the student should seek immediate attention from the UConn Health 's Occupational Medicine (860 -679-2893) ; if the exposure occurs outside the hours of 8:00 am - 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, the student should report to the Emergency Department. If the exposure occurs at other affiliated sites, the initial care will be provided at the site but the student must also notify Occupational Medicine and follow up care will be coordinated through Occupational Medicine. The need for immediate attention is based on evidence that 10 appropriate evaluation and intervention can lead to strategies to minimize the exposure risk. Contact information for care related to clinical exposures and injuries at affiliated hospitals are detailed below . The student is responsible for letting the site Emergency Department know that they are a UConn Medical Student at the time of triage in order for appropriate billing to occur .

Policies and procedures are also reviewed and discussed as part of the orientation students receive prior to clinical rotations. Policies and procedures with regards to infectious hazards and needlesticks a re also posted on HuskyCT. Blood -borne pathogen/OSHA training is an annual compliance requirement for all students. Visiting Students: The home institution of each visiting student is required to verify compliance with blood -borne pathogen/OSHA training in compliance with UConn Health policy via VSLO . Visiting students will be registered via VSLO . As part of the application process, students will need to complete an attestation and this will be recorded in the OASIS database. 11Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.c.1. Communicable Disease in the Clinical Learning E nvironment Introduction In the c ourse of their e ducational program, students may pa rticipate i n the c are o f infectious patients. Students m ust be a ware o f the risks s temming from c ontact with the bloo d or secretions of such patients and, if exposure occurs, must follow the SOM's Needlestick and Blood/Body Fluid Exposure Procedure set forth in policy 2.c. Students w ho themselves have a c ommunicable disease have a responsibility t o patients, p eers, staff a nd fa culty to ta ke appropriate s teps to pr event the s pread o f disease. This p olicy is intended to assure that patients in a hospital or clinical setting are n ot at r isk w hen c ared for by students i nfected with communicable diseases. Requi rements f or Students All students a re required to follow pr oper i nfection control pr ocedures, i ncluding u niversal precautions. Training o n universal precautions is provided to students a nn ually. Following current g uidelines o n use o f appropriate p ersonal protective e quipment (PPE) t o mi nimize spread o f communicable d iseases is re quired. A list of communicable d iseases t hat are reportable to the Connecticut D epartment o f Health is available here . S tudents w ho have a Category 1 disease as listed o n the CT DP H website must p romptly report the illn ess t o the As sociate Dean f or Medical St udent Af fairs, w ho is a me mbe r of the SOM's Communicable Disease R eview P ( the \" Review Panel\"). Further a ctions , if necessary, will be determine d by the Associate Dean for Medical S tudent A ffairs. Students are ex pected t o obtain the care of a p hysician who i s qualifie d to treat the di sease and its complications an d s hould identify t hemselv es as m edical students t o the p hysician an d explain their responsibilities for patient c are. A t the time of this writing, students are required to contact the U Conn Health Center's Covid hotline should they have a concern that they may be experiencing symptoms consistent with COV ID19 infection. SOM C ommunicable Disease Review P anel Th e Review Panel w ill consist o f a min imum o f three individuals: the As sociate D ean f or Medical Student Affairs (or their designee if necessary), o ne physician from O ccupational Medicine, and at least one o the r faculty m ember o r senior s taff member w ith e xpertise i n infectious disease and/or infection c ont rol. The R eview P anel may c onsult w ith le gal c ounsel, as it d eems necessary. Upo n receipt of a r eport that a s tudent is i nfected w ith a c ommunicable di se ase, the R eview Panel w ill conduct a confidential review o f the student's condition, t he student's clinical schedule, an d the p ossible imp act t he condition may h ave on the s tudent's patients a nd c linical work, in ac cordance w ith the following procedures: 12 The student will be asked to identify in writing their treating physician, and to notify the Review Panel as to any change in treating physician. The student will be a sked to authorize release of medical information to the Review Panel and to the hospital(s) or other clinical setting(s) where the student will be performing clinical work. The Review Panel will consult with the student's treating physician as part of its review process. The Review Panel will make recommendations on any restrictions that should be placed on the student's clinical activities and/or precautions that must be taken during clinical work. Such restrictions or precautions may include, for example that all Stage 2 or 3 rotations be done at a single hospital. The Review Panel will forward its recommendations to the Dean or his designee. The Dean or his designee may approve the Review Panel's recommendations as -is or with modifications. Following the approval of the Dean or his designee , the Review Panel will document the restrictions and/or precautions to be placed on the student and will notify the student as to the restrictions/precautions in writing. The Review Panel will then take steps to assure that these restrictions/precautions are implemented in arranging the student's clinical work. In its sole discretion, the Review Panel may also conduct a review to determine whether any patients treated by the student were at a significant ri sk of disease exposure. The Review Panel (or its designee) will meet with the student periodically to assure that the student is complying with the restrictions placed on their clinical work, and to discuss any problems the student may be experiencing. A lternatively, the Review Panel may require the student to submit periodic confidential written reports updating the Review Panel on clinical work and any problems the student may be experiencing. The Review Panel also may consult with the student's treating physician to obtain updated information on the student's condition. Each case will be considered on an individualized basis and will be guided by the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Connecticut Department of Public Health, the UConn Health Department of Infectious Diseases, and simila r agencies/organizations with relevant expertise and authority. Appeal Procedure Following a decision of Dean's designee , a student may request reconsideration by submitting to the Review Panel, within five (5) working days of receipt of the decision, a written request for reconsideration. The student may appear before the Review Panel to present information, which the student deems relevant. The Review Panel may affirm its prior recommendations or modify them, and in either case will forward its recommendations following reconsideration to the Dean's designee , who may approve them as -is or with further modifications. The Review Panel will notify the student in writing of the decision following reconsideration. 13If the student wishes to further appeal, the student must submit a written request for an appeal to the Dean of the SOM within five (5) working days of receipt of the reconsideration decision. The student may provide to the Dean information, which the stu dent deems relevant. The decision of the Dean is final. Confidentiality The Review Panel will, to the extent possible, hold in strict confidence all information in its possession relating to a student's disease status. Whenever possible, the Review Panel will not reveal the identity of the student, but instead will discuss the matter anonymously. All records of the Review Panel will be stored confidentially and will not be part of the student's academic file. The Review Panel (or its designee) may disclose information relating to a student's disease status as follows: to the Dean or dean's designee , who must approve (as -is or with modifications) the Review Panel's recommendations under this policy; if applicable, to the Dean of the SOM making a decision on appeal under this policy; if the student violates this policy, to o ther administrators and/or faculty within the SOM in connection with disciplinary action. The Dean of the SOM, Dean's designee, and any other SOM administrators or faculty receiving information about a student's communicable disease under this policy shal l be bound by the same principles of confidentiality that apply to the Review Panel. In addition, the Review Panel (or its designee) may disclose information relating to a student's disease status, to the extent necessary, to the appropriate individual(s) at the hospital(s) or other clinical setting(s) to which the student is assigned, so that the hospital(s) or clinical setting(s) can determine the precautions and restrictions, if any, that should be implemented during the student's clinical work at thos e sites. The Review Panel will advise the hospital(s) or clinical setting(s) on the highly confidential nature of the information disclosed. The student will be notified of any such disclosure. Counseling Students may obtain career counseling regarding their communicable disease status from the Review Panel, or from one or more faculty members or administrators of the SOM if the student wishes to divulge this information to those individuals. Mental health services are also available to students and are discussed in detail in policy 2.d. Disciplinary Action for Policy Violations Students who violate this policy may be referred to the SOM Professionalism Incident Report Triage (PIRT) process for professionalism violations. ( See Se ction 3. Professionalism). Violat ions include failure to report known infection with a communicable disease and failure to follow the restrictions and precautions prescribed by the Review Panel. Violations of this policy may also be reported to the Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs, who may take 14appropriate disciplinary action and/or refer the matter to the Academic Advancement Committee. 15 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.d. Behavioral Health Services, Health Services and Student Wellness Various resources are available to students in need of behavioral health services. Confidential counseling services are provided to students in a private setting, off the main campus, at 195 Farmington Avenue through the Student Behavioral Health Program (see policy 2.e.). The school supports Medical and Psychotherapy Director s of Student Behavioral Health (see below), two APRN mental health medication prescribers and counselor s, several PhD and PsyD clinical psychologist s and additional faculty who do not teach or supervise students in an educational setting . In addition, the Student Behavioral Health Program has a committee structure that provides assistance with behavioral health problems , as well as alcohol and other f orms of substance abuse (see below). Students may directly contact the Directors of Student Behavioral Health or a provider of their choice. Student Affairs is available as well to give direction or guidance . The health professionals at a medical education program who provide psychiatric/psychological counseling or other sensitive health services to a medical student must have no involvement in the academic assessment or promotion of the medical student receiving those services. Any faculty member who finds that they are providing sensitive health services (including mental health or other health services) to a student that they are academically assessing or promoting, MUST request that the student be reassigned and that request must be brought to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. If a student is seeing a faculty member for healthcare services (including mental health or other health services) and they are being supervised and/or academically assessed by that faculty member, the student may request immediate reassignment , if that has not occurred via the faculty member who has the primary responsibility to make sure this transition occurs . Any requests for reassignment should be brought to the attention of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs . Faculty will be required to complete an attestation annually that they are aware of this policy related to a conflict in evaluating students in the educational environment while providing health services. ( See p olicy 5.c.) Conta ct Information for Student Behavioral Health Services : UConn Providers and Contact Info: wellness/individual- counseling/ 16Behavioral Health Committee Mental health, substance abuse and dual diagnosis services are combined for a single portal of entry for all student behavioral health services. The Behavioral Health Committee consisting of faculty and students will oversee Student Behavioral Health. Its voting membership will consist of: the Behavioral Health Medical Director; two faculty members from SOM/UME, one faculty member each from the Graduate School and So DM; one student and one alternate student from each school with the goal of having one student representative from each schoo l available to vote at any given meeting ; the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Program Director; the Director of the Student Wellness Program will be ad hoc member as necessary and as invited, and there could be invited guests for specific topics. The Be havioral Health Medical Director can help orchestrate the agendas and advise the chair of the committee; however, the committee chair should be an individual who does not serve in the role as director. The Chair will be elected annually by the entire memb ership (excluding alternates) and may be any of the four faculty members or the EAP director. This committee's functions should include the following: Oversight of the delivery of behavioral health services in a broad, general fashion. De - identified data such as the unique (or unduplicated) number of students served (in whatever fashion), by broad clinical category, by year, by school; access to care; patient satisfaction; amount of care funded by school(s); ad hoc surveys; Review or development of educational information to be made available to students; linkages with community caregivers; interface with the Student Wellness Program; etc., will be collected, reviewed, forwarded to appropriate school administrators, and stored in a secure fashion; Individu al students' situations could be discussed in an anonymous fashion for the express purpose of brainstorming further beneficial options. Confidentiality will be assured to the extent possible given the size of the community. Contact Information for Student Health Services: Some students grew up close to Farmington, and already have a primary care physician (PCP). Others will want to seek out a new PCP. You can find this within or outside of the UC onn Health system. Multiple offices offering internal medicine, family medicine, or ob -gyn are in the area, and may be affiliated with regional hospitals or with large or small multispecialty or single specialty groups. If you wish to use the UC onn Health sys tem, know that its physicians and mid- level practitioners are very happy to see students, and will often make accommodations to fit them into their patient panels and schedules. Your care at any of these offices will be recorded in the health system's EPIC electronic record, and your insurance company will be billed for services. 17The largest UC onn Health primary care group is Internal Medicine Associates, with offices in Farmington (in the Outpatient Pavilion), East and West Hartford, Canton, Simsbury, Plainville, and further afield.

The effort to promote wellness is engaged on a number of levels: programmatic, administrative, and individual. The School of Medicine has designated faculty to direct its wellness efforts on a progra mmatic level. The 18Director(s) of Student Wellness are responsible for working with student groups to sponsor, orchestrate, and support activities designed to help students integrate the needs of their personal and social lives with academic demands. On an administrative level, the School of Medicine continues to work to foster an institutional environment that encourages a holistic approach to medical education; one that is sensitive to the intellectual and emotional needs of students; one that engages both mind and spirit by promoting early patient exposure, service - learning, and work with underserved populations. Additionally, the School of Medicine supports the efforts of individual students to conduct activities that enrich the culture of the School of Medicine such as yoga and meditation, sports clubs, and organizations that support creative expression in the arts. 19 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.e. Impaired Student Policy 1. Program Access A. Voluntarily Students who identify themselves as needing behavioral health treatment may voluntarily seek it through the Student Behavioral Health Program. B. By Referral Students may be referred to the Student Behavioral Health Program by faculty, staff, peers or family. When a student is referred to the Student Behavioral Health Program, the referring individual must indicate the reasons for that referral. C. By Mandate Senior school officials or the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) may mandate that a student undergo evaluation and treatment for suspected behavioral health problems. These students are generally identified through academic and/or professionalism problems that are thought to be related to behavioral health issues. 2. Services Offered A. Mental Health: The Student Behavioral Health Program provides evaluation, crisis intervention, medication and short -term psychotherapy for mental health issues. Referrals to outside providers can occur when complex medication regimens and/or long -term psychotherapy is deemed necessary. B. Substance Use/Abuse: The Student Behavioral Health Program provides evaluation and referral for treatment for students with alcohol or drug use/abuse problems. 3. Problems/Impairments to be addressed A. Mental Health: T he student who suspects that a mental health problem exists, or has difficulty with the daily activities of life, or is observed to have difficulty or be unable to perform their academic duties, or is a danger to self or others, or is a disruptive influence in the clinical or academic setting, may voluntarily seek, be referred or be required to participate in mental health evaluation and treatment. This may necessitate voluntary or enforced absence from the curriculum until the problem/impairment is resolved. 20B. Substance Use/Abuse: The student who suspects s /he has, or whom others suspect has a substance use/abuse problem, can voluntarily seek, be referred or be required to participate in substance abuse evaluation and treatment. The student who is suspected of or found to be impaired (having difficulty with the daily activities of life, having difficulty or unable to perform their academic duties, or is a danger to self or others, or is a disruptive influence in the clinical or academic setting) due to substance use/abuse must participate in substance use/abuse evaluation and treatment. This may necessitate voluntary or enforced absence from the curriculum until the problem/impairment is resolved. Any student who has a DUI or is arrested for behavioral, drug, or other issues will be required to notify the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and this will necessitate a behavioral health evaluation. 4. Confidentiality and the limits of confidentiality A. Confidentiality is always maintained in every eventuality to the extent possible . Privacy is essential and will always be maintained to the extent possible . The primary mission of the Student Behavioral Health Program is to assist students in achieving their academic objectives. That said, there are times when the appropriate school administrator (generally the Associate Dean for Student Affairs) needs to be informed, usually regarding lack of progress in treatment. Lack of progress is determined by the provider (s) involved. The reasons for this could include, but are not limited to, refusal to participate in treatment; inability (for whatever reason) to address/control those conditions that continue unremitted and preclude successful participation in the curriculum; actions or activities that place self or others at risk; continued disruptive behavior in the academic or clinical setting to the point of seriously or habitually interfering with or jeopardizing the task at hand; and failure to continue in treatment after being returned to the curriculum with continuation in treatment having been stipulated as a condition of reinstatement. The right is reserved that other concerns may be identified that necessitate the need to break confidentiality and inform the appropriate school administrator. These will be addressed on a case -by-case basis. The appropriate disclosures need to be signed by the student. In addition, it is expected that all committee members will respect the privacy of those discussed and must maintain confidentiality and not share information outside of the meeting. 21 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.f. Disability Policy The University of Connecticut School of Medicine conforms to the Disability Policies of the greater University of Connecticut . The University of Connecticut is committed to achieving equal educational opportunity and full participation for persons with disabilities. It is the policy that no qualified person meeting the technical standards with or without reasonable accommodations be excluded from participating in the School of Medicine programs or otherwise be subjected to discrimination with regard to any University program or activity. To request accommo dations, s tudents should contact : Bryanna Anderson Assistant Director Center for Students with Disabilities (860) 486-2020 bryanna.anderson@uconn.edu UConn SOM has an additional policy, known as the Techn ical Standards (next policy 2.g.) and all students must be able to achieve these Technical Standards with or without reasonable accommodations. Accordingly, all students must confirm that they are able meet these standards with or without reasonable accommodations. Students requiring reasonable accommodations will be given direction for both support and to request accommodations and applicable services. 22 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.g. Technical Standards The education of a physician encompasses a preparatory phase in college, a rigorous undergraduate medical professional education leading to the MD degree, postgraduate or residency training and finally, lifelong continuing education after the conclusion of all formal training. The MD degree awarded at the completion of the undergraduate medical educational process certifies that the individual has acquired a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of medicine. Toward this end, the School of Medicine requires that the educational process prepare an individual to be a physician. The educational process at the School of Medicine is structured to allow the student to achieve this general goal and is in accord with the objectives defined by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the established agency in the United States for accreditation of medical schools. Admissions standards of the School of Medicine, therefore, are rigorous and exacting. Candidates for the MD degree must have abilities and skills in five domains: observation, communication, motor, conceptual/integrative and quantitative, behavioral and social. Technological or other accommodations can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. Nevertheless, the candidate must be able to perform a full physical examination, must consis tently, quickly and accurately integrate all information received by whatever sense(s) employed, and must have the intellectual ability to learn, gather information, communicate, and integrate, analyze and synthesize data. Observation : The candidate must be able to observe experiments and demonstrations in the basic sciences including, but not limited to, microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of organisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to o bserve a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation requires the functional use of the senses of hearing, vision and touch. Communication: A candidate should be able to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity and po sture; and perceive nonverbal communications in interactions with patients. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively, professionally, and sensitively with patients. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with all members of the health care team. Motor : Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to perform investigative and di agnostic procedures and read and interpret imaging studies. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physic ians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous 23medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, and the opening of obstructed airways. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities : These abilities include measurement, calculations, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes : Candidates must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to self- regulate and develop appropriate coping strategies when faced with potentially triggering and sensitive topics that are taught/ discussed as part of being a future healthcare provider. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in t he clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admissions and education process. Candidates for the MD degree must gather data from, communicate with, and care for, in a non-judgmental way, persons whose culture, sexual orientation, or spiritual beliefs are different from their own. Throughout the clinical curriculum, students must be able to consistently perform a complete history and physical exam on any patient regardless of the patient's race, color, national origin, marital status, military status, citizenship, disability, genetic predisposition, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, or sexual orientation. Adherence to these technical standards is designed to ensure that the MD degree attests to the basic acquisition of general knowledge in all fields of medicine, as well as the acquisition of the basic skills necessary for medical practice. 24Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.h.

Emai l and Electronic Resource Procedures All students must use their UConn Health -assigned email address ( name@uchc.edu). The use of an outside email address (e.g. Gmail, yahoo) or the forwarding of email from a UC onn Health account to an outside account is not recommended and has, in the past, resulted in students missing important emails concerning courses and grades. The majority of UConn Health -related information is now se nt electronically; therefore, students are expected to check their UC onn Health email account at least once per day. It is considered a violation of professionalism if a student misses critical information regarding a class or event due to not having check ed their email regularly. UConn H ealth provides electronic resources to enable faculty, students and staff to accomplish work that is the mission of UConn Health. UConn Health computing and networking equipment and software are to be used for UConn Heal th business only. Electronic resources are not to be used to conduct private business or commercial activities or any other illegal or prohibited activity such as unlicensed and illegal copying or distribution of software that violates federal or state statues or regulations or are in conflict with UConn Health's status as a public institution. Other University policies concerning email and electronic resources are available at https://health.uconn.edu/policies/policies -specific -areas/specific -area- information - technology/ . 26Academic Procedures Manual 2.j. Security and Public Safety Stude nts are expected to wear their UConn Identification (IDs) at all times while on campus and while visiting affiliated sites. Replacement badges can be obtained through Parking, Trans portation, and Event Services for a fee . Securit y measures are provided within the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, the sponsoring institution, as well as all of the major affiliated hospitals, including UConn Health , Hartford Hospital, St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hospital for Central Connecticut, Connecticut Children's Medical Center and the Veterans' Administration. These include foot and vehicle patrol of the facilities and general response to problems that arise. Security also provides assistance with ambulance security, transportation of patients to and from aircraft sent to the hospital, unlocking doors, escorts to vehicles, and assistance with cars that will not start. Blue emergency phones located throughout the UConn Health campus dial directly into public safety dispatchers. Publ ic Safety Telephone Numbers UConn Health - (860) 679 -2121 or (860) 679- 7777 (emergency) Hartford Hospital - (860) 545 -2147 St. Francis Hospital & Medical Center - (860) 714-4000 Hospital of Central Connecticut - (860) 224- 5011 Connectic Children's Medical Center - (860) 545-2147 UConn H ealth Uniform Campus Crime Report All students are encouraged to read the complete U Conn Annual Security and Fire Report . Additional information and resources on the Clery Act and Clery Compliance is available here . Clery Act: Overview The \"Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998,\" commonly referred to as the \"Clery Act,\" requires institutions of higher education receiving federal financial aid to report specified crime statistics on college campuses and to provide other safety and crime information to members of the campus community. UConn Health provides crime information and statistics to the public in a variety of ways. In addition to the Clery Act, UConn Health provides to the United States Department of Justice crime statistics that are classified pursuant to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the FBI. These statistics are reflected in the annual Crime in Connecticut publication, which is the annual report of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the State of Connecticut, Division of State Police, as well as the FBI Crime in the United States publications. Report ing of Crimes or Emergencies The university has its own emergency telephone number, 7777, which is answered at the Public Safety dispatch center. Emergency help \u2014police, fire or medical \u2014will be immediately 27dispatched. Emergency phones are also located throughout the campus. If you are a victim of a crime or you have witnessed a crime, but there is no immediate danger or emergency, call UConn H ealth Police at 860 -679-2121 (or 2121 from any university phone). Reports may also be made in person at the Police Department, LG 044, or to officers on patrol. Timely Warnings UConn Health Police Department issues Crime Alerts when deemed necessary to keep the campus community informed about security and safety matters. The decision to issue a Crime Alert is made on a case -by-case basis after reviewing all the facts, including the nature of the crime, the continuing threat to the campus community, and the risk of compromising law enforcement efforts. Notification may be made utilizing e -mail, text message, voice mail, and web page. These notifications are disseminated with the goal of notifyi ng as many people as possible, as rapidly as possible. Further information and a registration link can be accessed at http://alert.uconn.edu . Testing is done on an annual basis or more often if needs dictate. Daily C r ime Logs The Police Department maintains a Daily Crime Log that records, by the date the incident was reported, all crimes and other serious incidents that occur within the department's patrol jurisdiction. This log is available for public inspection and includes the nature, date, time, and general location of each crime reported to the department. Poli cy on Alcoholic Beverage and Illegal Drugs Students at UConn Health are expected to become aware of and abide by state laws and University regulations regarding use of alcohol and illegal drugs. The University alcohol beverage policy is designed to be consistent with the laws of the state of Connecticut, which, in general, prohibit the possession, consumption and serving of alcoholic beverages by and to pers ons less than 21 years of age. State law prohibits possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of illegal substance or drug paraphernalia or of any illegal drug or narcotic, including barbiturates, hallucinogens, amphetamines, cocaine, opium, heroin, or any other substance not chemically distinguishable from them except as authorized by medical prescription. Although s tate law allows for the possession and recreational use of marijuana, it prohibits manufacture and distribution. Students must adhere to the University of Connecticut Alcoholic Beverage Sales and Service Policy, which can be found here: UConn Alcoholic Beverage Sales and Service Policy Weapo ns on Campus Possession and/or use of firearms, fireworks, dangerous weapons and hazardous chemicals is strictly prohibited and in many cases violates state law. This applies to students and employees except where authorized to handle weapons or chemicals. Sexua l Assault The UC onn SOM complies with all Title IX requirements. See policies 3.f and 8. g. Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Related In terpersonal Violence 28Title IX Policies Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on the sex (gender) of employees and students of educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX's prohibition of sex discrimination includes prohibition of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature and can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, including rape and sexual assault. The University of Connecticut School of Medicine does not tolerate sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence of any kind. This prohibition is further explained in the University's Title IX Reporting and Resources website . To ensure compliance with Title IX and other federal and state civil rights laws, the University has a designated Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) who is charged with monitoring compliance with Title IX and ensuring that reports of sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence are investigated and addressed by the University . Any student, faculty, or staff member with questions or concerns about the applicable policies or who believes that they have experienced sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual viole nce is encouraged to contact UC onn Health's, Interim Title IX Coordinator, in the Office of Institutional Equity , Sarah Chipman . Filing a Complaint of Sex Discrimination or Sexual Harassment Individuals who believe that they have been discriminated against on the basis of protected qualifications, including sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence may file a complaint with the OIE. Any concerns of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and/or sex discrimination, regardless of the identity of the accused, may be brought to the Title IX Coordinator . Non -Retaliation Policy The SOM encourages individuals to bring forward information and/or complaints about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Retaliation against any individual who, in good faith, reports or participates in the investigation of alleged violations is strictly forbidden and will be enforced by the appropriate members of the SOM's administration. 29 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.j.1. Emergency Notification UConn SOM has the ability to notify students of critical events through the Everbridge Mass Notification System. Students must enroll in the Everbridge system when obtaining their UC onn ID at the beginning of their matriculation at the medical school. In the event of an emergency situation, this system provides notification by both text and automated robo -calls calls to inform students of all campus disasters including serious weather concerns, school shut down, active shooter, or other emergency situations. Students who are on leave of absence or in special programs ( e.g. MD-PhD) will continue to receive these notifications as long as their UC onn ID is active. Visiting students who are rotating at UConn Health are required to obtain a UC onn ID for site access, and must enroll in the Everbridge system. The Office of Student Affairs also sends emails for school shutdowns directly to students . For weather related closings, students can also visit the 'Closings and Cancellations' website http://health.uconn.edu/closing -and-cancellations or can call the UC onn Health operational status hotline 860 -679-2001 which provides an official source of communication regarding delayed openings, class cancellations, or closings of the UC onn Health nonessential service units due to weather or other circumstances. There are 30 dedicated lines operati ng 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the unlikely event that service to UC onn Health Operational Status Hotline is disrupted, a back -up number is available: 860-486-9292. 30 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.k. Dress Code Patients and colleagues expect students to be appropriately and professionally dressed. Appearance should conform to the standards/norms of the setting in which the student is working. The UConn/Institution ID badge sho uld be worn and clearly visible while on campus, and for all clinical encounters. 31 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.l. Work Hours Pre-Clerkship Curriculum: The estimated student workweek in Stage 1 totals 50 -60 hours. The typical week in Stage 1 will not exceed 22 contact hours. The UME Leadership team must review any request for additional contact offerings . CUME has delegated approval for up to 2 hours addition al twice per block at the discretion of the UME team for necessary educational activities or assessment . Attendance is mandatory for all scheduled contact hours in Stage 1. With the transition to a flipped classroom curriculum, we consider the additional 38 hours mandatory curricular time with set objectives, curriculum and required time for completion. Third - and Fourth- Year Clinical Rotations: Students are expected to be involved in the activities of the healthcare team to which they are assigned, carryout assigned patient care activities, and participate in required educational activities. The time needed to adequately meet these responsibilities will vary depending on the clinical rotation, and can include overnight cal l or night shifts . Nevertheless, studen ts are expected to abide by the following duty hour restrictions : 1. Work hours are limited to 80 hours per week , averaged over a 4 -week period . 2. Students must be provided with one day in seven free from all clinical and academic activities averaged over a 4 -week period. 3. At a minimum, students should have a 10 -hour period of rest, and must have an 8 -hour period of rest, between daily duty periods. A student who works 24 consecutive hours, must have a 14 -hour free period. 4. In-house overnight call cannot occur more frequently than every third night. This does not apply to a week of night float or labor and delivery. 5. Continuous on- site duty, including in- house call, must not exceed 24 consecutive hours. However, students may remain on duty for up to four additional hours to participate in required educational activities, and ensure continuity of patient care. 32 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 2.m. Social Networking Policy Social and busin ess netwo rking web sites (i.e., I nstagram, Linke dIn, Faceb ook, Twitter, F lickr, etc.), other internet sites such as YouTube and cell phone texting are increasingly being used for communicat ion by ind ividuals as well as businesses and unive rsities. This section addresses the policy for proper use of these modalities by undergraduate medical education students at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine (U Conn SOM). Patient Inf orm ation Identifia ble protected health infor mation (P HI) should NEVE R be published on the Interne t.

Tuition Refund Policy Students who withdraw from UConn SOM during an academic term will receive a tuition refund based on the institutional schedule. There are three terms: Fall, Spring and Summer that span the calendar year. All students who separate from the School of Medicine are subjected to the School's Refund Policy. Tuition refunds will be calculated based on the date that all requirements are completed to finalize the withdrawal. Tuition Refund Schedule: Withdrawal through first calendar week of the term: 90% Second week of the term: 80% Third week of the term: 70% Fourth week of the term: 60% Fifth week of the term: 50% Sixth week of the term: 40% Seventh week of the term: 30% Eighth week of the term: 20% After eighth week of the term: No Refund Refundable Fees: DESCRIPTION REFUNDABLE Medical School Tuition I/S Yes Medical School Tuition O/S Yes Medical School Tuition NER Yes Medical Professional Fees Yes Medical Student Activity Fee No Medical Laptop No Medical Laptop sales tax No Financial Aid is awarded to students contingent upon completion of the term . Federal financial aid recipients who withdraw prior to completing more than 60% of the term will have unearned aid that, by law, must be returned to the Federal Government. If more than 60% of the term has been completed prior to withdrawing, 100% of the federal aid for that term will have been earned and the financial aid package will remain in place. Federal Direct Unsubsidized and Graduate PLUS Loans will be subjected to a calculation known as the Return of Title IV Funds calculation. This federal requirement determines the amount of federal funds that a student is entitled to by calculating the number of calendar days completed up to the withdraw al date, divided by the total number of calendar days in the term or Title IV eligibility period (less any scheduled breaks that are at least five days long). For example, if a student completes 30% of their payment period, they earn 30% of the assistance they were originally scheduled to receive, meaning that portion would remain credited to the student's 36account . The amount the student is not entitled to (unearned aid) will be returned to the lender. This is required regardless of other grants or scholarships that have been awarded and used to pay for tuition and fees. Students who owe a balance to the school are billed after funds have been returned to the lender. The net amount owed on the student's account after all applicable charges, returns, refunds, and credits will be billed to the student. Other financial aid may be adjusted based on your withdrawal date. For more information, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid Services . Students are advised to carefully consider the above tuition information as withdrawing after the first week of class may create a financial obligation which, if not cleared by the end of the academic year, will be referred to an outside collection agency and subject to State Income Tax Refund offset. In addition, financial obligations which are past due will receive a 'Bursar hold' on the student account, preventing future registration and accessing services such as, obtaining transcripts and diplomas . This hold will remain on the account until the balance is paid in full. The University may decline to issue a certified copy of my academic transcript unless and until any past due balance owed is paid. In certain other instances , including illness, full refunds or cancellations of charges may be made at the discretion of the Dean of the School of Medicine, provided that the interruption or termination of the student's program takes place prior to the start of classes. A student inducted into military service will receive a prorated refund or cancellation of charges based on the student's date of separation. The student in this situation must furnish the Office s of the Registrar and the Bursar with a copy of the orders to active duty, showing this to be the reason for leaving the School of Medicine. Reviewed 5/2022 37Section 3: Professionalism Students are expected to maintain high standards of personal and professional integrity and conduct at all times. The Code of Professionalism Conduct for Medical Students ( see 3 .a.) addres ses appropriate and acceptable behavior expected of medical student s in their role as healthcare professionals. This document was created as a guide to help invoke appropriate behavior in all areas of professional conduct and outlines the expected student competencies in professionalism. This document also explains the process for submitting reports of praise or concern regarding professional behavior and the mechanisms used to investigate any adverse occurrence. Other models for professionalism are found in several UConn Health and School of Medicine documents including the Student Honor Code (3.b.) and the Compact between Faculty and Trainees (3.c.). UConn Health also has rules of conduct which students are expected to uphold. Policie s included in this section: 3.a. C ode of Professionalism Conduct for Medical Students 3.b. Student Honor Code3.c. Compact Between Faculty and Undergraduate and Graduate Medical Trainees3.d. Student Mistreatment and Standard of Conduct3.e. Faculty, Staff and Student Relations3.f. Prohibition of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment, Including Sexual Harassmentand Sexual Assault, Intimate Partner Violence and Stalking 38 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 3.a. Code of Professionalism Conduct for Medical Students Code of Professionalism The Code of Professionalism (\"the Code\") is a guide for appropriate and acceptable behavior and a model to uphold the standards of the healthcare professions. While this c ode cannot fully address every situation that may develop, it shall serve as a model to invoke appropriate behavior in all areas of professional conduct as well as to outline the expected student competencies in professionalism. The codes and policies list ed in the Honor Code ( policy 3.b.) provide additional guidance. The concept of medical professionalism is both an acknowledgement of virtuous values expected in one's role as physician and the implementation of appropriate behavior that embodies these val ues. These values can be categorized as follows: Integrity: Display honesty and integrity with patients, families, the healthcare team, community members, faculty, and others Maintain appropriate professional boundaries and avoid exploitation of patients for any sexual advantage, personal financial gain, or other private purposes Be able to identify potential conflict of interest arising from the influence of marketing and advertising, as well as financial and organizational arrangements Respect: Show res pect for others, including appropriate grooming, punctuality, courtesy, non - derogatory backroom discussions, inclusiveness, and use of acceptable language and humor Recognize and be sensitive to culture, race, disabilities, age, and other differences in order to prevent health care discrimination Altruism: Demonstrate altruism and advocacy by a commitment to promote health care needs of patients and society Improve quality and access to care and a just distribution of finite resources Display compassion an d empathy in words and deeds when dealing with patients, families, peers, the healthcare team, community members, faculty, and others Duty / Responsibility: Avoid engaging in patient care responsibilities if emotionally or physically impaired Complete dut ies in a timely fashion Maintain appropriate confidentiality Accept responsibility for errors and evaluate failures in education and patient care Recognize and accept personal limitations in knowledge, skill, and behavior, seeking guidance and supervision when appropriate Identify and appropriately respond to unprofessional behavior in others Participate in defining, organizing, and evaluating the educational process for current 39 and future students Be willing and capable to work collaboratively and resolve conflicts in a variety of settings to achieve optimal patient care and educational goals of all involved Excellence: Commit to self -improvement, including being open and responsive to feedback, reflection , and self -evaluation, and actively setting and pursuing learning goals and applying knowledge gained Recognize the role of wellness in the practice of medicine Apply legal and ethical principles to patient care, clinical research, and the practice of medicine Professional behavior in students is expected at all times, not just in the role of medical student while at UConn Health and affiliated teaching hospitals. Unprofessional behavior both in the personal and professional setting reflects poorly on the individual, the School of Medicine (SOM), and the U niversity of Connecticut. All reports of unprofessional behavior, including arrests, will be referred to the SOM Professionalism Incident Report Triage (PIRT) Committee regardless of the location where it occurred (see section II and IV below). Reporting Violations of Professionalism Any individual should report misconduct including but not limited to medical and dental students, program directors, deans, faculty, residents and fellows, patients, or public person who has contact with the student. Moreover, it is expected that students will self- report unprofessional behavior. Self -reporting unprofessional behavior will be viewed favorably and can serve as an opportunity for self -reflection and improvement. Students must notify the school in the event they a re arrested or cited for violation of UConn Health rules, or local, state, or federal laws (exceptions being traffic violations not involving impaired driving); failure to do so would be regarded as a professionalism violation. All incidents of professional misconduct should be reported to the PIRT Committee. This is accomplished by completing a 'Professionalism Incident Report Form' - PIRT Form (available at the end of this section and on the \"School of Medicine Professionalism Committee\" under UConn Health Links in HuskyCT ) and submitting the report by any of the following methods: E-mail to PIRT@UCHC.EDU and/or both PIRT Committee Co-chairs (See Professionalism Folder on HuskyCT) UConn Health campus mail to one of the PIRT Committee Co -chairs (MC- 1831) USPS \" (MC- 1831, Office of Academic Educatio nal Affairs, University of Connecticut Medical School, 263 Farmington Ave., Farmington, CT 06030) ; receipt can be confirmed by email from co -chairs, if requested . Directly deliver to the Office of Academic Educational Affairs (AM -045) staff An individual may not wish to personally submit an incident report and may decide to report the incident to a member of the Academic Integrity Board or the Associate Dean of Student Affairs who will then be responsible for completing a 'Professionalism Incident Report.' Although it is recommended that the reporting individual identify themself in case further 40 details are needed, this is not required to submit a report, except in cases where special legal requirements apply which include, but are not limited to, sexual ha rassment, domestic violence, child abuse, and risk of suicide or serious harm to self. These issues are also not protected by confidentiality. 1. Formal Reports may be submitted as one of the following: i. Totally anonymous: the name of the reporter will not be known to the accused or by the members of the PIRT Committee . Anyone wishing to file a PIRT totally anonymously can do so using the USPS address listed above or hav e the PIRT hand -delivered by a third party. ii. Partially anonymous: the name of the reporte r will not be known by the accused, but will be known by the members of the PIRT Committee iii. Non -anonymous: the name of the reporter will be known to both the accused and the members of the PIRT Committee . 2. Totally and partially anonymous complaints are acce pted but may not be triaged into a formal investigation unless the complaint contains sufficient information to justify an investigation. The PIRT Committee will vote as to whether or not they believe that an anonymous submission can be effectively investi gated. Findings of breach by the PRB cannot be based solely on anonymous information contained in the initial anonymous complaint. Partially anonymous reporters may serve as a witness and in that capacity their name may be disclosed to the accused. Repor ting Exemplary Efforts in Professionalism In order to fulfill the competency requirements in professionalism, all students graduating from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine are expected to demonstrate and maintain a high standard of personal and professional integrity as outlined in the University of Connecticut Medical School Code of Professionalism (see policy 3.b.). On some occasions, a student may demonstrate unusually meritorious behavior in professionalism deserving of distinctive prais e. For these incidents of commendation, a report of 'praise' may be filed. Submission of these exemplary accounts can be filed by any individual. It is encouraged that the behavior to be recognized by the PIRT form concern a specific event, or related eve nts, pertaining to professionalism, and not be a list of general praiseworthy traits of the student. Reporting exemplary behavior is accomplished by completing a PIRT Form (see end of section) and submitting the report to Professionalism Incident Report T riage (PIRT) Committee by any of the following methods described above. All Praise PIRTS will be forwarded to the Dean of Student Affairs for their discretion to include in the Dean's Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) letter. Important Forms: Professionalism Incident Report Triage form (PIRT form) This form is at the end of this section, but may also be accessed on HuskyCT by clicking on the School of Medicine Professionalism Committee under UCHC Tools on the main HuskyCT page. 41 Professionalism Incident Report Triage (PIRT) Committee Because of the varied categories of incidents that can occur, having one central depository for professionalism issues is ideal to decrease confusion regarding where to submit reports. The PIRT Committee serves as a central clearing -house for any matter, either positive or negative, concerning professionalism at the University of Connecticut Medical School. Membership The PIRT Committee is composed of 5 individuals chosen for their experience in dealing with matte rs of professionalism. These members are: PIRT Committee Co-Chairperson PIRT Committee Co-Chairperson Associate Dean, Medical Student Affairs Faculty Advisor, Academic Integrity Board Medical Student Chair, Academic Integrity Board or, if the Medical Student Chair is unavailable, another experienced member of the AIB (from either school ) designated by majority vote of the AIB The Co -Chairpersons shall be appointed by the Dean or Dean's designee. These two positions are held for a minimum of a two-year du ration with re -appointments made at the discretion of the Dean or Dean's designee. The appointments will be staggered, with the re -appointment of Co-Chairperson s made on separate year s. The immediate past Co -Chairs can serve as ad hoc consultants to the ne w Co -Chairs. PIRT Reporting and Committee Procedures If the individual submitting the formal incident report is a faculty member, a meeting between that faculty member and the student with the purpose of explaining the reason for the incident report is re quired unless such a meeting would risk causing harm. There may be some instances where a meeting may not be appropriate, and this should be indicated on the submission. The student is expected to sign the PIRT form when meeting with a faculty member. The following will take place once the PIRT Committee Co -Chairperson(s) receive a PIRT Form of a negative nature: A face -to-face meeting between the student and a PIRT Committee Co -Chairperson will be held to ensure the student is aware of both the report an d the process of addressing each report The student will be provided a copy of the Professionalism Section of the School of Medicine Academic Policies and Procedures manual The student will be informed that any additional information offered by them can be shared with other members of PIRT to assist in their decision, and may also be shared with any investigative body depending upon the disposition of the incident report The student will be given the opportunity to offer additional details regarding the circumstances of the incident report 42 For those reports of a positive nature, a face -to-face meeting with the student by the person submitting the report and/or the PIRT Committee Co -Chairperson is encouraged but not required. The PIRT Committee Chair (s), u pon reviewing all reports, shall present these to the other members of the PIRT Committee. A majority consensus - defined as 3 or greater of the 5 PIRT committee members - will determine the final destination of each report. All efforts will be made to complete this process in a timely manner. The PIRT Committee will consider all relevant information including established criteria (i.e. Honor Code, Student Behavioral Health Program referral criteria, etc.) and information contained in a student's PIRT file when making this determination. The destination of each report may vary, but some examples are as follows: PIRT student file Academic Integrity Board Student Behavioral Health Program Associate Dean, Medical Student Affairs Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) Professionalism Review Board (PRB) Local Law Enforcement Course/Clerkship Director Prior to the vote by the PIRT Committee, the designated Co -Chair for the particular case Chair (s) may initiate a preliminary investigation to determine if the repor ted breach of professionalism has merit for further investigation. After the investigation, the Co -Chair will complete PIRT disposition form, which contains the information provided in the submitted PIRT form as well as summaries of the interviews with stu dent, submitter and others, and background status (i.e., under the purview of the AAC, had a prior PIRT). The disposition form will be presented to the PIRT Committee for deliberation and vote. Prior to discussion by the full committee, the PIRT Co -Chair w ill email the name of the student to the committee asking for recusals. If the complaint is determined to be without merit by the PIRT Committee following this preliminary investigation, both the student and the individual submitting the Professionalism Incident Report will be notified of this determination in writing and informed that the process has been concluded. A notation regarding the dismissal of this report will be placed on the PIRT disposition form and placed in the confidential PIRT file. No record or note of the report will be submitted to the student's permanent file in the Office of Registrar. If, after this preliminary investigation, the PIRT Committee determines that the complaint has merit, the PIRT Committee will then complete the incide nt report disposition form, with the decision and rationale. The PIRT Committee has the discretion to refer the PIRT to another body (e.g., AAC, PRB, Academic Integrity Board, Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs), and this decision will be noted on the PIRT disposition form. However, if the student has had a prior PIRT that was determined to be of merit, the PIRT Committee must notify the AAC for review of the student's record and consideration of possible further action. The PIRT disposition form will indicate the number of prior PIRTs. 43 For those instances where the situation only warrants placement in a student's PIRT file, the Co-Chair will use this opportunity to provide insight and education to the student regarding the incident. Once the PIRT is resolved and when appropriate , the PIRT Committee may notify the person /committee that filed the PIRT that it was reviewed and addressed (resolution might include: found without merit; triaged to file ; forwarded to the AAC ; or other disposition, b ut need not be specified ). PIRT Committee Student Files All PIRT Forms that are submitted to the PIRT Committee will remain confidential within the limits of the law. A copy of all negative incident reports submitted to the PIRT Committee will be placed in the PIRT student files. In addition, the student's name and triage decision will be added to an Excel file kept on a SharePoint site for use in future cases to determine if a prior PIRT was submitted. The SharePoint site also will include electronic files of the PIRT forms and other documents related to the incident. When a negative incident report is received, the PIRT student file will be reviewed to see if the report is an isolated event or indicative of a pattern of negative behavior. If the studen t has had a prior PIRT that was determined to be of merit, the PIRT Committee must notify the AAC for review of the student's record and consideration of possible further action. The PIRT student files will include notation of whether and where the PIRT C ommittee made a referral. All positive/exemplary incident reports submitted to the PIRT Committee will be placed in the PIRT student files. All PIRT files will be retained in the office of Academic Educational Affairs and will not be part of any permanent student record. Upon a student's graduation, all related PIRT student files will be archived as permitted by law. Professionalism Review Board (PRB) If a negative professionalism incident is determined to be of a serious and significant nature, but is deemed by PIRT to necessitate investigation beyond the purview or scope of the Academic Integrity Board, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, or other report destinations, then this significant incident will be referred to the Professionalism Review Bo ard (PRB). Membership The PRB shall consist of 5 voting members, one non -voting member, and four alternate members who shall attend each meeting and who may be designated by the PRB Chair to vote in the place of absent member. These 'core members' are: PIRT Co Co -Chair - PRB Case Officer Two (2) Student members (voting) Four (4) Alternate Student member Two (2) Faculty Member (voting) Two (2) Alternate Faculty Member 44 1. PIRT Co -Chairs: The two Co -Chairs shall decide between each other who shall be PRB Chair and who shall act as PRB Case Officer. These roles should be alternated with each respective incident report. 2. Faculty Members: Two members of the faculty will be appointed each year by the PIRT Co - chairpersons, with voting status alternating with each respective incident report. Each faculty member will serve a two -year term. 3. Student Members: The first year class shall elect one student during October; ideally, this student will serve a four -year term. In addition, during A pril of the second year, the second year class shall elect an additional member to begin serving on July 1st of their third year and shall complete their term upon graduation. The students from both the 1st and 2nd year class shall serve as alternates. In regard to the students from the 3rd and the 4th year class, one student from each class will serve as alternate while the other will serve as a voting member; voting status between the two should alternate with each respective incident report. All elected students will serve on the PRB as long as they remain members in good standing in their class. In cases of a student leaving prematurely before the end of their term, supplemental elections will be held as necessary. 4. Additional Members: At the discretion of the PRB Chair, additional ad hoc 'non - core' members may be added to the PRB roster depending on the case being investigated and may be granted either voting or non -voting status. PRB Procedure Any allegation that is brought before the PRB shall be tr eated as confidential by the individual completing the formal Professionalism Incident Report as well as by the members, alternate members, and ad hoc members of the PRB. The PRB Case Officer will be responsible for organizing the collection of material as well as contacting witnesses and other relevant individuals. The PRB Case Officer will be responsible for presenting a list of PRB members to the student for possible Conflicts of Interests (and perception thereof) and the reason for a requested recusal. The PRB Chair will solicit the PRB membership for possible Conflicts of Interests (or perception thereof) and the reason for a requested recusal. The PRB Chair will request self -recusals from the Board Members. Also, upon identification of possible Conflicts of Interest, the PRB Chair will organize a vote on recusal of these individuals from participating in the investigation. Recusal of each individual will occur with a simple majority vote of all PRB members. PRB Investigative Hearing : A quorum to conduc t business shall consist of 5 voting 'core members' of the PRB. The investigative hearing is scheduled by the PRB Chair at which a quorum of the PRB must be present. In the event of an absence of a voting member, the PRB Chair will determine the 45 alternate faculty or alternate student member to serve as a voting member at the meeting. Legal counsel or other external parties will not be present during the hearing. However, the student being investigated may wish to invite a University of Connecticut Medical School medical student, faculty member, or staff member as a personal advisor. This personal advisor must agree to maintain strict confidentiality with regard to all aspects of the proceedings. Although the personal advisor will not be allowed to speak on the student's behalf at the hearing, the student can confer with the advisor at any time during the proceedings. PRB hearings are not recorded, but the student may request the hearing be recorded for good cause(s) shown, and provided that all parties conse nt to the recording. This request must be made 2 business days prior to the proceedings, and provided that the party making or requesting such recording bears the financial responsibility for such recordings. The contrary party is given reasonable opportu nity to obtain a copy of such recording at their own expense, and any such recordings are maintained in strict confidentiality with respect to anyone not a party to the proceedings. The recordings would be stored in the access protected PIRT/PRB SharePoin t. At the hearing, the PRB Case Officer will outline the reasons for the investigation, after which the student under investigation will be allowed to make a statement. The PRB Case Officer will then present any evidence or witnesses deemed integral to the investigation. Following this, the student being investigated will be given an opportunity to present any additional witnesses or evidence relevant to the case. It is the student's responsibility to select and coordinate the appearance of these additiona l witnesses or collect and present additional evidence. Both the student being investigated as well as members of the PRB will be allowed to examine the evidence and ask questions of any witnesses as directed by the Chair. At the end of the meeting, the student under investigation will be allowed to make a closing statement, after which the Chair will then close the hearing. At the discretion of the PRB, a recess may be called at any time during the hearing. The recess may be brief for the members of the PRB to consult in closed session, or it may be to continue the hearing at a later date to allow for further investigation. With the formal closure of the hearing by the Chair, the PRB will meet outside the presence of all parties and witnesses to discuss the investigation and make a final decision. In order to find the student guilty of a breach in professionalism, a majority defined as 3 out of 5 voting members of the PRB must cast votes in favor of such a finding. At the investigation hearing, in order for there to be a finding of guilty, the case against the accused student must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence is defined as that evidence which convinces the PRB that the facts asserted are highly probably true, and t hat the probability they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist. If the evidence suggests that a violation of professionalism has occurred, the PRB Chair will be responsible for informing the stu dent of the Board's final decision both verbally and in writing within seven (7) business days after the final PRB proceedings. Both the PRB Chair and another member of the PRB will be present when the student is verbally informed of this decision. 46 The P RB Chair is also responsible for advising all involved in the case that the PRB investigation proceedings are to be considered confidential. The PRB Chair will then be responsible for composing a synopsis of the investigation proceedings and conclusions and forwarding this document along with any recommended disciplinary actions to the AAC. The AAC will then determine final action. Within seven (7) days after receipt of written notification of the AAC's action, the student may submit an appeal of the decisi on; see 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships and 5.g. Rules Concerning Appeals to AAC and SEARC. If the evidence of the investigation does not indicate a violation of professionalism has occurred, a summary of the investigat ion will be placed in confidence in the student's PIRT file. No record or note of the incident will be submitted to the student's permanent file in the Office of Registrar. The PRB Chair will be responsible for informing the student of the PRB's final decision both verbally and in writing within 7 business days after the final PRB proceedings. Both the PRB Chair and another member of the PRB will be present when the student is verbally informed of this decision. The PRB Chair is also responsible for informing the witnesses and individuals involved that the case has been dismissed and that the PRB investigation proceedings are to be considered confidential. Once the investigation is resolved and when appropriate, the PRB may notify the party(ies) that initia ted the complaint that it was reviewed and addressed PROFESSIONALISM POLICY ISSUES PIRT Committee: PIRT Committee serves both as the primary reporting destination for professionalism complaints as well as the means of delegating how the complaint will be addressed/ investigated. 1. COMPLIANCE ISSUES : Enrolled medical students need to comply with certain basic health requirements (BBP and HIP AA training, and Flu vaccines) as well as specific site requirements (Hep B vaccinations, PPD documentation as well as up to date physical exams). The HOME Office tracks these data through both the administrative officer and program coordinator in Medical Student Affairs and Admissions. Failure to achieve compliance will result in a Professional Incident Report being su bmitted to the PIRT Committee. 2. COMPLIANCE VIOLATION SCALE : The PIRT Committee will take into account 'gradation' of certain compliance violations on the belief that certain compliance violations that put patients at risk (i.e. flu vaccines) are more serio us than others (i.e. up to date student physical exams). The PIRT Committee will determine on a 'case by case' basis if any combination of violations warrant a referral to the AAC. 3. PIRT Committee ACCESS TO AAC FILES: When processing a professionalism incident report, PIRT will be allowed access to limited information in a student's AAC file. The information accessed will be kept in strict confidence by PIRT. 47 4. AAC ACCESS TO PIRT Committee FILES: In general, PIRT Committee files are not accessible to the AAC; An exception to this general practice applies to those students already \"under the purview of the AAC,\" which includes any student or student file previously brought before the AAC for academic, behavioral, or institutional difficulties; The PIRT Committ ee Co -chair who serves on the AAC will inform the AAC of any incident report submitted to PIRT involving a student who is already under the purview of the AAC. 5. PIRT INCIDENT REPORT DECISION TREE : The following decision tree clarifies the options that are available to the PIRT Committee and the AAC when an incident report has been submitted. PIRT/AAC DELEGATION DECISION for ALL INCIDENT REPORTS 1. No merit - notation made and placed in PIRT file 2. Merit - no additional action and placed in PIRT file 3. Merit - not referred to PRB/AAC but to other destination (eg. Academic Integrity Board, Associate Dean Student Affairs, Student Behavioral Health Services, etc.) and placed in PIRT file 4. Merit - referred to PRB i. Investigation: No Merit. Brief summary to AAC and place d in PIRT file ii. Investigation: Merit. Full summary to AAC with or without recommendations and placed in PIRT file 5. Merit - referred directly to AAC (with or without recommendations) and placed in PIRT file with note that it was referred to AAC i. No action by A AC [possible referral to other destination] ii. Student presents before AAC with no notation made in student MSPE iii. Student presents before AAC with notation made in student MSPE and possible sanctions iv. Case sent to PRB for further investigation of facts Profess ionalism Review Board (PRB): This board, along with the Academic Integrity Board, make up the two institutional committees at the UC onn Medical School that investigate student violations in professionalism. 1. PRB FUNCTION/UTILITY : The PRB serves as an indep endent body established as part of the School of Medicine's focus on developing and monitoring professional behavior among students. However, it has a number of different roles that should be acknowledged. 48 a. Investigative Role : The PRB serves as a resource for investigation and review of possible professionalism problems referred via the PIRT process or by the AAC. In that regard, it should be used to investigate a possible professionalism violation that is not deemed suitable for the Academic Integrity Board or other referral destinations. The PRB should also be utilized to further investigate reported professionalism violations that have indeed occurred but require more details to determine the degree of violation. In either role the PRB would use the i nvestigation and hearing procedures described in the PRB policy and then report results of its investigation/hearing to the appropriate authority. The results of the investigation would then be reported to the AAC. OF NOTE: Most PRB investigations are expected to occur after an initial referral and review by the PIRT Committee, but a PRB investigation may also be initiated by a referral made directly from the AAC. This would occur when the AAC encounters a professionalism situation where more information is needed before a final decision is made by the AAC. b. Advisory/Informative Role : the PRB can review questions regarding the functions and actions of the PIRT Committee, PRB, PIRT files, etc., particularly during the overall development of professionalism e ducation and monitoring at UC onn Medical School. It can act as a discussion group for questions on policy, serve as an educational body for both faculty and student members, and also help in the dispersion of information regarding professionalism to the st udent body via its student members. 2. PRB ACCESS TO AAC FILES: Unlike the Academic Integrity Board, the PRB has access to AAC student files when conducting their investigation. Only information that is determined relevant to the investigation by the PRB Co -Chairs will be made available to the PRB. 49 List of Terms PIRT Form = Professionalism Incident Report Triage Form PIRT Committee = Professionalism Incident Report Triage Committee PRB = Professional Review Board AAC = Academic Advancement Committee 50 University of Connecticut School of Medicine Professionalism Incident Report Type of Report (circle one) PRAISE CONCERN Subject of Report (Student Name): Date of Report: Person Submitting Form Date/Time of Incident (include title and/or role): (time period if longitudinal observations): Action Requested (circle one) For File Only Referral to Professional Incident Report Triage (PIRT) I.

Student Honor Code A. The Honor Code Students embarking on careers in medicine and dental medicine are expected to maintain high standards of personal and professional integrity. These standards involve such basic concepts as intellectual honesty and respect for the rights and well-being of others. Matriculation in the School of Medicine or Dental Medicine constitutes an obligation for students to act in a manner consistent with such standards. The primary source of these standards shall be this Honor Code and its application to the conduct of medical and dental students. The primary mechanism for the application and enforcement of these standards shall be the Academic Integrity Board (AIB) . The Honor Code of the University of Connecticut Schools of Me dicine and Dental Medicine comprises the following items: Prohibition of any act of intellectual dishonesty. Examples of intellectual dishonesty include (but are not limited to) : cheating; plagiarism, copying, or any misrepresentation of work other than o ne's own ; fraud in research ; dishonesty in clinical care or documentation; and willful failure to comply with examination and evaluation policies. Prohibition of violations of the rights or well- being of members of the UConn Health community. Examples of such violations range from (but are not limited to): failure to comply with library regulations or intentional interference that denies other students access to educational materials, the wil lful mistreatment of colleagues, and stealing. Requirement of students, staff, and faculty to take positive action when there is a reason to believe that a breach of this Honor Code has taken place. At the beginning of their careers at UConn Health and at the beginning of every subsequent academic year, all medical an d dental students shall be required to sign an attestation of the principles contained in th is Honor Code. The attestation shall be in writing and shall express the student's commitment to act in a manner consistent with the standards of personal and profe ssional integrity represented by th is Honor Code. B.Implementing the Honor Code: The Honor Code Policy Committee The Honor Code Policy Committee's main responsibilities are to provide interpretations of the Honor Code and to develop guidelines for the application of the general principles embodied in the Honor Code and as they apply to our students. The Ho nor Code Policy Committee shall consist of all current and alternate members of the Honor Board and six faculty members appointed by the Deans/designee of the Schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine: three basic science faculty and three clinical faculty. The Deans/designee shall appoint one faculty member to serve as chairperson of the Committee. From time to time, the Honor Code Policy Committee may ap point other non- voting members to participate in committee discussions. 55The Committee also participates in the selection process for the Faculty A dvisor of the Academic Integrity Board (described in detail in Section N of this policy, below) . C. The Acade mic Integrity Board Purpose The primary purpose of the Academic Integrity Board is to consider allegations that the Honor Code has been violated, appropriately triage such allegations, and when indicated to conduct formal investigations into such allegatio ns and to make the decision whether a breach of the Code took place. In cases in which a breach of the Code has been determined, the Academic Integrity Board may choose to make recommendations as to what consequences should result, but such recommendations are no n-binding. The Academic Integrity Board may also work in partnership with Schools to promote professionalism among all students. The le ngth of any Academic Integrity Board investigation will vary based on the nature of the case. Coming to a valid conclusion (i.e. conducting a thorough investigation) is the primary goal. The Academic Integrity Board recognizes the stress that investigations will place on accused students and will strive to conduct its investigations in a time -efficient manner. If and whe n the provisions of this Honor Code differ from those of any policy approved by the School of Dental Medicine Faculty Senate or the School of Medicine Education Council, the provision of the Honor Code will control . Members hip The membership of the Academic Integrity Board shall consist of eight primary members (one medical student and one dental student from each class) and eight alternate members who may attend and participate in each meeting and who may be designated to vote in the place of an absent primary member using the procedure described in the \"Meetings\" section below. Each primary member and alternate shall serve a two -year term for a maximum of two terms as long as they remain a member in good standing in their respective school. If and when a student leaves the Academic Integrity Board , the vacancy will be filled by a special election to take place within one month. If the vacancy is a primary member, the alternate member for that school and class will become the primary member and t he election will be for the vacancy in the alternate member position. If a student is on leave for a length of time that would cause them to not graduate at the same time as the medical or dental class that elected them, then they will be removed from the Board. The Academic Integrity Board is responsible for conducting the election of Academic Integrity Board members according to the following schedule. 56The first year class 1. Elections for one primary member and one alternate will be held for both the medic al and dental school classes. These elections should be conducted sometime in the Fall semester , to align best with other student leadership elections. These students shall serve until June 30th of their second year. The protocol for this election is as fo llows: a. Each student may cast one vote for members in their respective schools. The medical student receiving the highest number of votes and the dental student receiving the highest number of votes will be primary Academic Integrity Board Members. The medical student receiving the second highest number of votes and the dental student receiving the second highest number of votes will both serve as alternates for the first and second years. The second year class In April , but by no later than the second week of June , the medical and dental school classes shall elect Academic Integrity Board members to begin serving on July 1 st of their third year. They shall complete their term upon graduation. Students may serve a maximum of two, two-year terms . If a st udent delays graduation they may not continue for a third year. The protocol for this election is as follows: Each student may cast one vote for members in their respective schools. The medical student receiving the highest number of votes and the dental student receiving the highest number of votes will be primary Academic Integrity Board Members. The medical student receiving the second highest number of votes and the dental student receiving the second highest number of votes will both serve as alternates for the third and fourth years. Chairperson The Academic Integrity Board shall elect a chairperson (chair) annually. To be eligible, the chair must have served on the Academic Integrity Board previously for at least one academic year. The chair can be a voting or an alternate member. At the discretion of the Board, co - chairpersons, one from each school, may be selected by a simple majority . If the chair (or co- chairs) cannot attend a meeting of the Academic Integrity Board , the chair (or co -chairs) may appoint a temporary chair for that meeting. If the chair (or co -chairs) is recused from participating in a case, the Academic Integrity Board shall elect a temporary chair to handle that case. This vote may occur by email. Secretary The chairperson/co -chairs shall designate a secretary at each meeting to write minutes documenting all proceedings regarding a case , or potential case, including Initial Meetings, Case 57Review Meetings, and Evidentiary Hearings . The designated secretary will then email the meet ing minutes to the co -chairs within 24 hours of the meeting. Meetings The Academic Integrity Board, including alternates, shall meet as often as necessary to conduct the business of the Board. Meetings are characterized as those related to 'cases' as well as those held for administrative pur poses. If a primary member cannot be at a meeting, an alternate member will be selected for that meeting and will have the ability to vote at that meeting. Selection of such an alternate will be made in this order of pr iority: (1) The alternate from the same class & school; (2) Then the alternat e from the same class but the other school ; (3) Then an alternate from the same school but a different class (priority given to more senior class) ; (4) Then an alternate from the other school in a different class ( priority given to more senior class) . Case officers and co -case officers (described below) may be primary or alternate members and may not vote on any case they are assigned to. If these officers are primary Board members , an altern ate will be assigned the ability to vote using the selection process described above. This assignment will apply to all votes regarding this case unless this alternat e cannot be present for that meeting the process described above will be followed. A quor um must be present for all meetings. Quorum is defined as 5 voting members , which may be primary or alternate members who were designated as a voting member for that meeting. The Faculty Advisor must be present at all meetings related to a case. D. Repo rting Concerns/Alleged Violations Anyone affiliated with UConn Health , including but not limited to: students, faculty, staff, residents, and attendings, who has a concern regarding a breach of the Honor Code has a duty to take positive action. Positive ac tions include, but are not limited to: 1. Direct discussion with the person whose conduct is questioned and if, after such discussion , the breach is still suspected, the person with the concern must engage in informal discussions with a member of the Academic Integrity Board (as describe d in paragraph D.2 below) or submit a Formal R eport to the Academic Integrity Board ; 2. Informal consultation with a member of the Academic Integrity Board by any member of the UConn Health community who thinks that a breach of the Honor Code may have occurred but is unsure . Upon initial consultation, an Academic Integrity Board member must notify the chair of the Academic Integrity Board before making a recommendation or taking any action in relation to the report . The chair who received the report must 58consult the Faculty Advisor and may consult members and/or alternates regarding how to proceed ; 3.Direct submission of a Formal Report to the Academic Integrity Board ; a.Formal Reports may be submitted as one of the following: i. Total ly anonymous: the name of the reporter will not be known to the accused or by the members of the Academic Integrity Board . ii. Partially anonymous: the name of the report er will not be known by the accused, but will be known by the members of the Academic Inte grity Board iii. Non -anonymous : the name of the reporter will be known to both the accused and the members of the Academic Integrity Board . b. Anonymous and partially anonymous complaints are accepted but may not be triaged into a formal investigation unless the complaint contains sufficient information to justify an investigat ion. The Board will vote as to whether or not they believe that an anonymous submission can be effectively investigated (seethe description of \"Initial meetings\" below.). c.Findings of breach cannot be based solely on anonymous information containedin the initial anonymous complaint. Partially anonymous reporters may serve as a witness and in that capacity their name may be disclosed to the accused. Failure t o take positive action may itse lf be a violation of the Honor Code. Self-reporting of unprofessional behavior will be viewed more favorably than otherwise and can serve as an opportunity for self -reflection and improvement. How to Su bmit a Formal Report Reports of a possible breach of the Honor Code shall be made in writing as soon as possible after the discovery of the alleged violation. To ensure the confidentiality of the investigatory process, it is recommended that such written report be delivered in a sealed envelope or via secure email to any member of the Academic Integrity Board . However, in order to encourage students, faculty, and staff to report concerns, other avenues of reporting are acceptable. If a report is made to a trusted school administrator/faculty/or any person(s) outside of the Academic Integrity Board , the recipient of this report is responsible for: (1) submitting the report to the Academic Integrity Board , to the SOM Professionalism Incident Report Triage Committee, 1 or to the appropriate committee within the So DM;2 and (2) maintaining strict confidentiality regarding the report and the alleged incident. 1 When a concern regarding a violation of the Honor Code involves a medical student, the Chair of the Academic Integrity Board must complete a Professionalism Incident Report (PIR) and submit it to the PIR Triage Committee (PIRT). When possible, reporting of concerns regarding medical students should occur directly to PIRT to facilitate proceedings. Formal Reports concerning medical students may come to the Academic Integrity Board directly from PIRT. 2 When a concern regarding violation of the Honor Code involves a dental student, reports may involve repor ting within the School of Dental Medicine in addition to the Academic Integrity Board. 59E.Initial Meeting(s) Once a Formal Report is made to the Academic Integrity Board , an Initial Meeting is held per the following proceedings: 1.Determination of Conflicts of Interest The name(s), only, of the accused will be disclosed to the Board members present. Any Board member with a possible conflict of interest will be given the opportunity torecuse themselves from all further proceedings regarding the case. Any Board member may identify another Board member as having a potential conflict of interest, in whichcase, the Board will vote on recusal of those individuals if the identified member(s)do/does not self- recuse. Recusal of a Board member by peer initiative requires a simple majority vote. If there are sufficient recusals such that the quorum is lost, the meeting will be suspended until a quorum is achieved. 2.Discl osure of the Contents of the Formal Report The information provided in the Formal Report is disclosed and discussed. 3.Triage The Ac ademic Integrity Board will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to initiate an investigation and/or if the case must be transferred to another body for action. The Board need only find that it is more likely than not that the complaint (anonymous , partially anonymous, or non-anonymous ) can be effectively investigated. The decision to launch a formal investigation following review of the Formal Reportrequires a simple majority vote of the quorum. 4.Appointm e nt of a Case Officer and/or Co -investigator All concerns deemed to fall within the purview of the Academic Integrity Board and worthy of investigation will be investigated by a Case Officer. All members who serve as Case Officers will receive basic traini ng in conducting an investigation from the Office of General Counsel or other UConn Health resources. Case Officers will be responsible for the movement of the case through the process to final disposition. Case Officers can be either primary members or alternates and are selected in the following manner: a.Volunteer ; b.If no member volunteers, a Case Officer is appointed by the chair/ co-chairs . The chair/ co-chair may elect to be a Case Officer if there are no volunteers, but then cannot preside as Chair for an y subsequent meetings concerning the case; c.The Board may choose to appoint a Co- investigator to assist the Case Officer with investigatory duties . 60Case Officer Duties a.Conduct thorough investigation including but not limited to receiving all correspondence , statements, evidence and other materials related to the case, and maintain file and evidence folders ; b.Review all case material; c.Present all case material to the Academic Integrity Board ; d.Be present and participate in the discussion at all meeting s regard ing the case they are assigned ; e.Contact witnesses and the accused in order to schedule an Evidentiary Hearing on the case , if necessary ; f.Develop an agenda for the Case Review Meeting and Evidentiary Hearing and be responsible for the conduct of the m; g.Help the chair/ chairs compose a letter to the appropriate Dean/designee regarding the findings of the Academic Integrity Board . 5.Discus sion on how the case might be investigated F.Case Review Meeting(s) Once the Case Officer has investigated the concern, then the Academic Integrity Board hears the Case Officer's findings in a Case Review Meeting . Case Review Meetings are conducted with only the members of the Academic Integrity Board and the Faculty Advisor present and proceed in the manner listed below. The C ase Review meeting cannot be held until after the case officer(s) interview the accused at which time the accused will be provided a description of the issues that are being investigated, the names of the Academic Integrity Board members that have not alre ady been recused, and the names of the witnesses interviewed so far in the investigation. At the time of this interview or within two calendar days, the accused may request that member(s) of the Academic Integrity Board be recused from this case and must provide a justification for each such request. 1.The Ca se Officer(s) will present any requests and justifications made by the accused to recuse Academic Integrity Board member(s) from the case. The Academic Integrity Board will discuss any such requests and by simpl e majority vote determine if any members will be recused. For each vote, the Academic Integrity Board member under consideration of recusal will not be eligible to vote. 2.The Case Officer and any Co-investigator present the evidence collected. 3. The com mittee discusses the evidence and then votes on one of the following three courses of action by means of a simple majority vote : a.Send the case back to Case Officer for further investigation. b.Determine that the presented evidence is insufficient to decl are an Honor Code breach and that reasonable effort by the Academic Integrity Board would yield no further insight into the case. In such situations, appropriate reporting of thisfinding is performed, as per later section titled, \"Notifications .\" 61c.Determin e that the presented evidence is sufficient to proceed to an Evidentiary Hearing , by finding that it is more likely than not that the complaint (anonymous, partially anonymous, or non -anonymous) can be effectively investigated as per section E.3. G.Evid entiary Hearings Evidentiary hearings are scheduled in order to provide the accused an opportunity to be heard and for the Academic Integrity Board to clarify information that was presented at the Case Review Meeting . Evidentiary Hearings will be led by th e Case Officer and are conducted in the following manner: 1.The Ca se Officer will present the evidence concerning the case. The Case Officer may choose to interview witnesses at this time and in such cases, the members of the Board may then question these w itnesses. a.Any identified witnesses are strongly encouraged to participate in interviews asit enables the Board to come to the most informed decision. However, witnesses have the right to decline involvement in the evidentiary hearing if they so choose. 2.The ac cused may choose to be in attendance during the Case Officer's presentation and will then have an opportunity to address the Academic Integrity Board and to present any witnesses, or evidence; a.The accused may choose not to attend the Evidentiary He aring by sending a written waiver to the Board at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled hearing. In such a case, the accused waives their right to present evidence or witnesses. The accused may submit a written statement to be read at the Evidentiary Heari ng. b.If the accused attends the Evidentiary Hearing , a personal representative ( who may be an attorney) may attend . The accused must notify the Academic Integrity Board at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled hearing if a representative will be present. If the accused has an attorney present, UConn may also have an attorney present. The representative, if present, serves in a purely advisory capacity and is permitted to speak only to the accused. The Academic Integrity Board Chair(s) may dismiss the repres entative if, in their sole discretion, they disrupt the hearing proceedings ; c.The accused and any witnesses presented by the accused may be askedquestions by the members of Board. 3.Followin g dismissal of the accused , any witnesses, and the personal represe ntative of the accused, if any, the Board will discuss the case and then a motion will be made to vote , via simple majority decision, to either: a.Return to the investigation phase of the case, but only if new information not known at the time of the Case Re view Meeting was presented in the Evidentiary Hearing that indicate d need for further investigation. i. In this case, further investigation will be conducted by the Case Officerand Co-investigator, and a new Case Review Meeting and Evidentiary 62Hearing will b e scheduled and conducted, as described in Sections F and G, above. b.Proceed to a formal vote of \"breach\" vs \"insufficient evidence of breach.\" 4.Followin g the decision to proceed to a formal vote regarding breach status, the formal vote will be held via sec ret ballot. A verdict that a breach occurred must pass with a two-thirds majority of the members who are present and voting on that case . 5.Standa rd of proof for finding of breach of the Honor Code : A finding of breach of the Honor Code must be based on clear and convincing evidence of the breach. Each voting member determines whether, based on their weighing of the evidence presented, there was clear and convincing evidence that the accused breached the Honor Code. This standard is higher than a finding by a preponderance of the evidence but does not require a finding of breach \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The Academic Integrity Board shall provide or arrange for training for members on how to assess evidence in terms of the burden of proof. H. The Appea l Process Upon notification that the Academic Integrity Board has reached a verdict of breach, the accused will be given seven calendar days to request the appeal . Such an appeal must be made in writing and be provided to the chair of the Academic Integrity Board . The accused may provide a written waive r of an appeal in ord er to move more quickly to notifications. Requests for an appeal will only be granted based on new evidence, which was not available to the Academic Integrity Board when they made their d ecision or claims that the Academic Integrity Board did not follow the appropriate processes. These two grounds for appeal are further defined below: 1.New evidence is evidence that: a) the accused could not reasonably have been expectedto have obtained that could have been presented at the Evidentiary Hearing; and b) a reasonable person could conclude might have materially impacted the determination ofbreach or insufficient evidence of breach. 2.A claim that the Academic Integrity Board did not follow the appropriate process, as defined by this policy, must demonstrate that a reasonable person could conclude thefailure might have materially impacted the determination of breach or insufficientevidence of breach. If an appeal is requested, the Academic Integrity Board Chair/Co -chair will notify the members of the Appeal Board (s ee below) prior to the hearing. 63Appeal Board 1.The Appeal Board shall consist of five voting members: two students and three faculty members appointed by the appropriate Academic O fficer of either the School of Medicine or School of Dental Medicine. The Appeal Board will elect a Chair for theAppeal. All voting members must be present at any meeting of the Appeals Board. Each school is responsible for ensuring that students and faculty who serve on ad hoc AppealBoards receives sufficient training in the schools' policies and procedures and the application of the concept of \"materiality\" in order to fairly apply them in each individual case (training can be provided by the Office of the General Counsel) . 2.The Aca demic Integrity Board chair/ co-chair will send the request for appeal submitted by the accu sed to the members of the Appeal Board by email. The Appea l Board will decide whether the appeal will be heard or not. If new evide nce is presented in the appeal, the Academic Integrity Board will have an opportunity to comment on such evidence in terms of whether it should have been presented at the time of the Evidentiary Hearing and/or as to whether it is material to the determinat ion made by the Academic Integrity Board of 'breach '/'insufficient evidence of breach. ' The Academic Integrity Board has a total of 7 calendar days to make such comment through the following process : a) the decision to make such comment and the content of such comment are under the sole discretion of the chair/co -chairs ; b) the chair/co -chairs must present the first draft of such comment to the members of the Academic IntegrityBoard in suffici ent time so that they may make recommendations for revisio n (rev iew and revis ions can take place by email); and c) the final comment will be sent to the ad hoc appeal committee and to the members of the Academic Integrity Board. 3.If th e Appeal Board decides to hear the case, either the Academic Integrity Board Chair/Co -Chair or the Faculty Advisor will then attend all sessions of the Appeal Board to observe and answer questions from the Appeal Board. The representative from the AIB will not serve as a voting member of the Appeal Board. 4.The Chair of the Appeal Board and its members will review the evidence presented in support of the appeal. Persons found to be in breach of the Honor Code will have theright to present their own case in front of the Appeal Board and, like the evidentiaryhearing, can elect to bring a personal representative (including an attorney). The personal representative is there for support only and will not be allowed to speak infront of the Appeal Board. If the accused has an attorney present, UConn may also have an attorney present. 5. G round s for overturning an Academic Integrity Board Decision: The ad hoc appeals committee can only overturn the Academic Integrity Board's decision where the error in procedure or discovery of new evidence could have materially impacted the AcademicIntegr ity Board's original finding. Overturning the Honor Board's decision should not be based on a trivial process issue or new evidence that does not seriously undermine theAcademic Integrity Board's finding. The members of the ad hoc appeals committee may 64receive training in the meaning of \"materiality\" from the School and/or the Office of General Counsel. 6. The decision of the Appeal Board will be transmitted to the Academic Integrity Board by email within 1 calendar day. 7. If the Academic Integrity Board's decision is sustained by the ad hoc Appeal Board , the Chair of the Appeal Board will notify the student involved orally and also by email within 1 calendar day. 8. If the Appeal Board overturns the decision of the Academic Integrity Board, in whole or in part, the Appeal Board will notify the student involved orally and also by email within 1 calendar day. The Appeal Board must provide a written justification for their decision to overturn the decision of the AIB to both the AIB and the Dean of their schoo l within 7 calendar days. Any materials transmitted to the Dean at this point must have the names of the accused and the witnesses redacted. I. Notifications b y the Academic Integrity Board 1. At any stage in the process, when a finding of insufficient evidence to make a determination of bre ach is made and the case is not sent for further investigation, the chair of the Board will notify the accused orally and by formal written communication . If the accused is a medical student, this determination will also be sent to the PIRT co - chairs. 2. If a verdict of \"breach\" is reached at the Evidentiary Hearing , the accused will be notified of the result by the chairperson or designee both in -person and by formal written communication; 3. If the decision of \"breach\" made by the Academic Integrity Board is upheld by the Appeal Board, the Dean/designee of the appropriate school will be notified within seven calendar days and presented with a summary statement, inclusive of all informat ion used to reach the decision. 4. When th e Academic Integrity Board concludes its involvement in the case and all the appeals described above are completed, the person submitting the Formal Report will be informed that the Academic Integrity Board has concluded its proceedings. J. Rights and Responsibilities of Accused and Witnesses 1. Notwithstanding the rights of the accused described earlier in this policy, both the accused and any witnesses (including students, faculty, or staff) must cooperate with the processes described above which includes, but is not limited to: a. meeting with the case officer(s) in a timely manner to be interviewed. b. providing honest and complete answers to the case officer(s) questions or questions raised by Academic Integrity Board members asked during Academic 65Integrity Bo ard and/or appeals committee meetings/hearings. Such questions must be relevant to the investigation. c.maintaining confidentiality regarding the nature of the case, the nature of the questions being asked and/or the names of the accused or other witnesses beinginterviewed. d.violations of article J.1 will be considered a breach of professionalism and subjectto appropriate investigation and sanctions. 2.Both the accused and any witness have the option to decline any invitation to attend an Academic Integrity B oard meeting/hearing. If testifying at such hearings, the witnesses have the right to present their testimony and be questioned by the Academic Integrity Board members without the accused being present. 3.Prior to the evidentiary hearing, the accused has th e right to be provided a list of their alleged breaches of the Honor Code , the names of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation , and the names of the members of the Academic Integrity Board who were not recused from the case. At the time the acc used is first interviewed or two calendar days following that interview, the accused has the right to make a request that members of the Academic Integrity Board should be recused from the case and at that time must provide justification for such a request . 4.The ac cused must make all reasonable efforts to obtain and present all evidence in support of their case at the Evidentiary Hearing rather than to obtain and presentevidence after a Hearing in support of an appeal. 5.Retaliat ion against the accused, accusers, witnesses, members of the Academic Integrity Board , or any other persons associated with an Academic Integrity Board action is prohibited. The University's policy on non -retaliation (https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/24/non -retaliation -policy/ ) applies. K.Con fidentiality and Document Retention All specific charges, names, evidence, and testimony are treated as strictly confidential unless otherwise required by law. The integrity of an Honor System depends on confidentiality, and the disclosure of names or other confidential information concerning a report by any person shall itself be considered an Honor Code breach. This applies to all involved parties - including, but not limited to, the accused, witnesses, and Academic Integrity Board members. If the breach involves a protected statute, all efforts to maintain confidentiality will be critical but cannot be guaranteed. However, reports, including the individuals who report, may be part of a more extensive investigation involving the necessary authorities. Every effort to restrict the flow of information to only necessary parties will be of utmost priority and importance. The Faculty Advisor shall be responsible for securely storing a copy of all documents that are material to the case, including but not limited to the case officer's notes, and minutes of meetings, as well as the physical evidence. These documents will be retained as long as required by state record retentio n laws and/or other prevailing laws. 66It is imperative for all members of UConn Health to be aware that any report of concern regarding a \"protected statute\" including but not limited to sexual harassment, domestic violence, elder abuse, child abuse, and threats of self- harm cannot be treated confidentially and must be directed immediately to the Academic Integrity Board Faculty Advisor who can refer it to the appropriate authority. L. Disciplinary Action The Academic Integrity Board is concerned only wit h judging a person(s) as having committed a breach or not of the Honor Code and is not responsible for taking disciplinary action against the person(s) who has breached the Honor Code. Such actions shall be taken by the appropriate Dean/designee. Whether a disciplinary action results from a breach in the Honor Code is up to the respective policies and procedures of the schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine. Reports of a breach of the Honor Code are forwarded to the Deans' designees for the student's schoo l, who will refer the report to the Academic Advancement Committee (SOM) or the Academic Performance Committee (SoDM) for possible disciplinary action. Not all breaches in the Honor Code result in disciplinary action. Sometimes the proce ss of being investi gated by the Academic Integrity Board is the only corrective action and , in itself , can be viewed as an opportunity for professional growth. M. Reports to the Academic Community The Academic Integrity Board and the Faculty Advisor shall be responsible for maintaining a record of the number and types of complaints brought to the Academic Integrity Board each year (and year to year), regardless of whether a breach of the Honor Code was found. These reports shall not contain any identifiable information about the accuser, the accused, or the specifics of the event that would facilitate identification. At least once each academic year, the Academic Integrity Board shall report on its activities to Education Council (for the School of Medicine) a nd Dental Senat e (for the School of Dental Medicine) and to the medical and dental classes. These reports shall discuss , in general terms , the activities of the Board during the year. N. Pro cess for Selecting the Academic Integrity Board Faculty Advisor The process is d ivided into 3 steps, namely: Nomination Preliminary review and vetting Final selection Descriptions of the individual steps are as follows: Nomination The nomination process should be open with nominations being accepted from students and faculty. Studen ts will be invited to nominate faculty. Faculty will be free to either self -nominate or put forward the names of colleagues. The process will begin with a nominations process similar to all nomination processes utilized by both schools. Applicants will be asked to submit a 67one-page personal statement explaining their interest and describing any relevant experience. Nominations go directly to an administrator. Preliminary Review, Vetting, and Interview The Dean's Designee in SOM and that in SoDM will review and vet the nominations with their teams and the Deans. Either administration may veto individual candidates who are unacceptable. The vetting process should remove the fewest candidates possible from consideration. The Honor Code Policy Advisory Committ ee will be told the total number of nominees but will only be sent a list of acceptable nominees. Ideally , the list will include at least 2-3 candidates. The Honor Code Policy Advisory Committee reviews the applicants, conducts interviews , and narrows the list of candidates to at least 2. In the event that there is only 1 candidate deemed suitable then the Honor Code Policy Advisory Committee will meet to discuss and determine if that candidate is acceptable. A unanimous consent is required. If unanimous c onsent is not possible, the nomination process begins again. Final Selection After reviewing the materials submitted by the candidates chosen by the Honor Code Policy Advisory Committee, the students of the Academic Integrity Board will make the final sel ection by a simple majority of the quorum. Term of Appointment The term of service for the faculty advisor to the Academic Integrity Board will be five years with an opportunity to renew for one additional term. The opportunity to renew will be contingent on the approval of the Honor Code Policy Advisory Committee and the Deans' Designees of the Schools. Salary Support To promote the effectiveness of the faculty advisor to the Academic Integrity Board, salary support for educational effort will be decided by the respective Dean 's designees. Additionally, the faculty advisor to the Academic Integrity Board may not serve on any other committees where a conflict of interest might occur (e.g. promotions or disciplinary committees in the SOM or the S oDM).

Compact Between Faculty and Undergraduate and Graduate Medical Trainees Preparation for a career in medicine demands the acquisition of a large fund of knowledge and a host of special skills. It also demands the strengthening of those virtues that embody the doctor/patient relationship and that sustain the profession of medicine as a moral enterprise. This Compact serves both as a pledge and as a reminder to teachers and learners that their conduct in fulfilling their mutual obligations is the medium through which the profession inculcates its ethical values. The Teacher -Learner relationship between faculty and medical learners - students, residents, and fellows - should demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct in all educational settings and be conducted without abuse, humiliation, harassment and exploitation of relationships for personal gain or advantage. COMPACT BETWEEN TRAINEES* AND THEIR TEACHERS (Adopted from the AAMC Compact) *Trainees include medical students, residents/fellows Medical education is an integral component of the formal education of physicians. In order to practice medicine independently, physicians must receive a medical degree and successfully complete a supervised period of residency/ fellowship training in a specialty/subspecialty area. To meet their educational goals, trainees must participate actively in the care of patients and must assume progressively more responsibility for that care as they advance through their training. In supervising trainees faculty must ensure that trainees acquire the knowledge and special skills of their respective disciplines while adhering to the highest standards of quality and safety in the delive ry of patient care services. In addition, faculty members are charged with nurturing those values and behaviors that strengthen the doctor -patient relationship and that sustain the profession of medicine as an ethical pursuit. Core Tenets of Medical Educa tion Excellence in Medical Education Institutional medical education leadership and program faculty must be committed to maintaining high standards of educational quality. Trainees are first and foremost learners. Accordingly, a trainee's educational needs should be the primary determinant of any assigned patient care services. The learning objectives of the program should not be compromised by excessive reliance on trainees to fulfill non -physician service obligations. (Trainees however, must remain mindful of their oath and recognize that their responsibilities to their patients always take priority as the primary part of their educational considerations.) 69Highest Quality Patient Care and Safety Preparing future physicians to meet patients' expecta tions for optimal care requires that they learn in clinical settings epitomizing the highest standards of medical practice. Indeed, the primary obligation of institutions and individuals providing medical education is the provision of high quality, safe pa tient care . Program faculty must ensure that trainees are integrated and actively participate in interdisciplinary clinical quality improvement and patient safety programs. By allowing trainees to participate in the care of their patients, faculty accept s an obligation to ensure high quality medical care in all learning environments. Respect for Trainee Well -Being Fundamental to the ethic of medicine is respect for every individual. Trainees are especially vulnerable and their well- being must be accorded the highest priority. Given the uncommon stresses inherent in fulfilling the demands of their training program, trainees must be allowed sufficient opportunities to meet personal and family obligations, to pursue a balance of work and life activities, and to obtain adequate rest. Commitments of Faculty 1. As role models for our trainees, we will maintain the highest standards of care, respect the needs and expectations of patients, and embrace the contributions of all members of the healthcare team. 2. We pledge our utmost effort to ensure that all components of the educational program for trainees are of high quality, including our own contributions as teachers. 3. In fulfilling our responsibility to nurture both the intellectual and the personal developme nt of trainees, we commit to fostering academic excellence, exemplary professionalism, cultural sensitivity, and a commitment to maintaining competence through life -long learning. 4. We will demonstrate respect for all trainees, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, disability or sexual orientation; and we will cultivate a culture of tolerance among the entire staff. 5. We will do our utmost to ensure that trainees have opportunities to participate in patient care activities of sufficient v ariety and with sufficient frequency to achieve the competencies required to earn their medical degree. We also will do our utmost to ensure that trainees are not assigned excessive clinical responsibilities and are not overburdened with services of little or no educational value. The learning objectives of the educational program will be accomplished through an appropriate blend of supervised patient care responsibilities, clinical teaching, and didactic educational events and will not be compromised by e xcessive reliance on trainees to fulfill non - physician service obligations. 706. In fu lfilling the essential responsibility we have to our patients, we will ensure that trainees receive appropriate supervision for all of the care they provide during their training. In the clinical learning environment, each patient will have an identifiable, appropriately -credentialed and privileged attending physician who is ultimately responsible for that patient's care. We will provide trainees with opportunities to exercise graded, progressive responsibility for the care of patients, so that they can learn how to practice medicine and recognize when, and under what circumstances, they should seek assistance from colleagues. Faculty members functioning as supervising physicians will delegate portions of care to trainees based on the needs of the patient and the skills of the trainee. 7. We will do our utmost to prepare trainees to function effectively as members of healthcare teams. We will provide an environment that maximizes effective communication and the opportunity for trainees to work as members o f effective inter - professional teams that are appropriate to the delivery of patient care. 8. We will evaluate each trainee's performance on a regular basis, provide appropriate verbal and written feedback, and document achievement of the competencies requir ed to meet all educational objectives. 9. We will ensure that trainees have opportunities to partake in required conferences, seminars and other non -patient care learning experiences and that they have sufficient time to pursue the independent, self -directed learning essential for acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors required for entering residency and subsequent independent practice. 10. We will ensure a culture of patient safety and professionalism by educating our faculty members and our trainees' concerning the personal responsibility of physicians to appear for duty appropriately rested and fit so that they may provide the services required by their patients. 11. We will use trainee -centered advising to support trainee s in their career e xplorations and career choice while actively avoiding disparaging comments or inducing pressure upon trainees . 12. We will nurture and support trainees in their role as teachers of more junior trainees when appropriate. Commitments of Trainees 1. We acknowledge our fundamental obligation is to place our patients' welfare uppermost; quality health care and patient safety will always be our prime objectives. 712. We pledge our utmost effort to acquire the knowledge, clinical skills, attitudes and behaviors required to fulfill all objectives of the educational program and to achieve the competencies deemed appropriate for earning a medical degree. 3. We embrace the professional values of honesty, compassion, integrity, and dependability. 4. We will adhere to the highest standards of the medical profession and pledge to conduct ourselves accordingly in all of our interactions. We will demonstrate respect for all patients and members of the health care team without regard to gender, race, natio nal origin, religion, economic status, disability or sexual orientation. 5. As trainees we learn most from being involved in the direct care of patients and from the guidance of faculty and other members of the healthcare team. We understand the need for fac ulty to supervise all of our interactions with patients. 6. We accept our obligation to secure direct assistance from faculty or appropriately experienced residents/fellows whenever we are confronted with high -risk situations or with clinical decisions that exceed our confidence or skill to handle alone. 7. We welcome candid and constructive feedback from faculty and all others who observe our performance, recognizing that objective assessments are indispensable guides to improving our skills as physicians. 8. We also will provide candid and constructive feedback on the performance of our fellow trainees, and of faculty, recognizing our life -long obligation as physicians to participate in peer evaluation and quality improvement. 9. We recognize the rapid pace of change in medical knowledge and the consequent need to prepare ourselves to maintain our expertise and competency throughout our professional lifetimes. 10. We will embrace a culture of patient safety and professionalism by understanding and accepting our personal responsibility to appear for duty appropriately rested and fit so that we may provide the care required by our patients. We believe that the relationship between faculty and trainees should reflect the highest standa rds of ethical conduct in all educational settings. Interactions between faculty and trainees must be conducted without abuse, humiliation, harassment or exploitation of relationships for personal gain or advantage. (Any trainee or faculty member who experiences mistreatment or who bears witness to unprofessional behavior must report such incidents according to the policies and procedures provided by the School of Medicine and the Offic e of Graduate Medical Education. See 3.d for Student Mistreatment, 3.e . for Faculty, Staff and Student Relations, and 3.f. for Prohibition of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault ). 72This compact serves both as a pledge and as a reminder to trainees and their teachers that their conduct in fulfilling their obligations to one another is the medium through which the profession perpetuates its standards and inculcates its ethical values. For more information about the Compact, go to www.aamc.org/residentcompact Approved by Education Council: 2/12/06 Reviewed 2/08, 6/10 Revised 9/11, 1/13, 6/19 73 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 3.d. Student Mistreatment and Standard of Conduct The University of Connecticut (UConn) School of Medicine (SOM) is committed to a learning environment of respect, collegiality, and collaboration. Our faculty commit to making sure each component of the educational program is of the highest quality, serve as role models, support all students and fairly evaluate and provide timely feedback. Behaviors that impede a safe and effective learn ing environment are not tolerated. Across the SOM, we have adopted the Compact Between Faculty and Undergraduate and Gr aduate Medical Trainees ( See p olicy 3.c. ). The follow ing p olicy on Student Mistreatment and Standard of Conduct is an affirmation of the importance of this issue with expectations to respect race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, and other protected classes of individuals along with diversity of opinion, socioeconomic status and unique individuality within our community. The learning environment will be free of belittlement, humiliation, hostility, or personal judgment. This policy is meant to compliment the institutional policy against discrimination, harassment and related interpersonal violence . Definition of Mistreatment The AAMC's Graduation Questionnaire defines mistreatment as follows: \"Mistreatment arises when behavior shows disrespect for the dignity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process. It can take the form of physical punishment, sexual harassment, psychological cruelty, and discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age or sexual orientation .\" Examples of mistreatment may include but are not limited to the following: Threatened with physical harm Physically harmed Sexual Harassment o Subjected to unwanted sexual advances o Asked to exchange sexual favors for grades or other rewards Discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, gender, age, marital status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identi ty, or gender expression and other protected classes Based on protected classes: o Received lower evaluations or grades rather than performance o Denied opportunities for training or rewards o Received lower evaluations/grades Psychological harm of a student by a superior (e.g., public humiliation, threats and intimidation, removal of privileges) o Publicly embarrassed o Publicly humiliated o Being spoken to in a sarcastic or insulting way o Intimidation 74 Grading used to punish a student rather than evaluate objective performance Assigning tasks for punishment rather than to evaluate objective performance Requiring the performance of personal services including babysitting, shopping, etc. Taking credit for another's work Intentional neglect or intenti onally left out of communications without reason Use of offensive remarks or names o Subjected to offensive remarks, names related to sexual orientation o Subjected to racially or ethnically offensive remarks/names o Subjected to offensive, sexist remarks/names o Other similar remarks that are offensive based on other protected classes Resources for Counseling, Advice and Informal Resolution Concerns, problems, issues, questions, or complaints may be discussed without fear of retaliation, with anyone in a supervisory position within the SOM. The assistance provided may include counseling, coaching or direction to others within the SOM including Student Affairs, Student Behavioral Health Services or other resources . Students are encouraged to report any possible concerns about discrimination or harassment based on protected classes (i.e. sexual, racial, or ethnic discrimination, including harassment ), to the Office of Institutional Equity. Students are apprised that disclosure of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and/or stalking requires mandatory reporting by all employed at UC onn Health and although all information will be kept as private as possible, this information cannot be considered confidential as required by law. Distribution Distribution of this policy and of the school's commitment to supporting an inviting learning climate will be done repeatedly across the continuum of the students' experience and will include the following times: 1. At Launch for incoming students; again reinforced as students sign the Honor Code and review the Compact before the White Coat Ceremony 2. At the beginning of Year 2 3. During Kickoff to Stage 2 4. During the Introduction to application for Residency process in Year 4 Educational leadership review s the Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) annually and disseminate s information about this topic annually to all faculty and students. 75Reporting Mistreatment Students may report mistreatment via several avenues in the SOM . All reports related to discrimination and/or harassment based on protected classes will be forwarded to the Office of Institutional Equity for review : Evaluation System Reporting Students evaluate every course and clerkship throughout the curriculum. All post clerkship evaluations include an item which asks students if they experienced mistreatment during the clerkship and includes a free text response. These are received anonymously by the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment. All responses of 1 -2 (of a scale of 1 -5 where 5 is most respectful) are triggered to be sent to: The Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Associate Dean for Clinical Medical E ducation. These are further investigated by reviewing prior evaluatons, providing feedback via the departments and making sure the feedback is directed to the individual , of named . Online Reporting Students may report mistreatment via a form on their Oasis homepage which is submitted anonymously. The Form is triaged by the SOM Compliance Officer and referred to the appropriate Associate Dean who will follow through as indicated. Communication with the submitter is possible, without knowing their identification. Voicemail Reporting Students may report through an anonymous phoneline . The number is 860 -679-3213. When a voicemail is left an email notifies the student affairs staff . In-person Reporting We have identified \"consulting\" faculty who are available to discuss any situation with any student at any time. The volunteers available as a resource in this area are listed below. Students may also opt to report to a peer who may report on their behal f or to any faculty member.

Students may choose to report any mistreatment to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, to the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, to the Associate Dean for Clinical Medical Education or directly to the Dean, either in addition to the procedures outlined above or as the primary reporting mechanism. Students may also access the institutional ombudsman Jim Wohl at wohl@uchc.edu or 860- 486-5143 Process for Investigating and Handling Reports of Mistreatment Upon learning of an allegation of mistreatment, the Associate Dean works with the respecti ve colleague and the Dean, as necessary to investigate the issue by speaking with students, departmental leaders , residents, affiliate site leaders and others as indicated . A group of educational leaders convened to develop guidelines for investigation and handling reports of mistreatment in the educational environment. The following process was agreed upon and endorsed by the 19 chairs at UConn SOM: If a complaint of faculty mistreatment in the Educational environment is received, it will be forwarded to the appropriate Associate Dean associated with the program, to the Dean's Liaison to Academic Educational Affairs, to the Chair and to the Dean. The Dean will discuss with the educational and departmental leadership to determine who will work together to investigate and address the issue. For any issue involving a learner there must be partnership involvement of educational administration in any review and decision related to the issue. The educational leadership as the Dean's designee retains the right to select teachers and will prioritize the fostering of a suitable learning climate. 77Protection from Retaliation Retaliation means any adverse action taken against a person for making a good faith report. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing, coercing or any other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under thi s Policy. University policy strictly prohibits retaliation against any individual who, in good faith, reports or who participates in the investigation of alleged violations of University policies or state and federal laws and regulations. Retaliation c an include, but is not limited to, actions taken by the University, actions taken by one Student against another Student, actions taken by an Employee against another Employee or Student, or actions taken by a Third Party against a Student or Employee. See the University's Non- Retaliation Policy . 78 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 3.e. Faculty, Staff and Student Relations The relationships between faculty, staff, residents, fellows and patients should demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct in all educational settings and be conducted without abuse, humiliation, harassment and exploitation of relationships for personal gain or advantage. Any questions, concerns or breaches in professional relations may result in disciplinary action and should be brought immediately to the attention of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Possible ramifications of violations in standards of ethical conduct include review and subsequent disciplinary action by the Academic Advancement Committee, which could ultimately lead to dismissal. In particular, all faculty and staff, including residents and fellows, must be aware that amorous relationships with students are likely to lead to difficulties and have the potential to place faculty and staff at great personal and professional risk. The power difference inherent in the faculty -student or staff -student relationship means that any amorous relationship between a faculty or staff member and a student is potentially exploitative or could at any time be perceived as exploitative and should be avoided. In the event of a charge of Sexual Harassment arising from such circumstances, th e University will in general be unsympathetic to a defense based upon consent when the facts establish that a faculty -student or staff -student power differential existed within the relationship. Moreover, amorous relationships between supervisors and their subordinate employees often adversely affect decisions, distort judgment, and undermine workplace morale for all employees, including those not directly engaged in the relationship. Any University employee who participates in supervisory or administrativ e decisions concerning an employee with whom they have or had an amorous relationship has a conflict of interest in those situations. Accordingly, the University prohibits all faculty and staff from pursuing or engaging in amorous relationships with undergraduate students; prohibits all faculty and staff from pursuing or engaging in relationships with graduate students under that faculty or staff member's authority; and prohibits all faculty and staff from pursuing or engaging in amorous relationships with employees whom they supervise. UConn's Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Related Interpersonal Violence sets forth the University's conduct expectations regarding amorous relationships in greater detail. See policy 3.f. for additional information . 79 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 3.f. Prohibition of Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment, Including Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault , Intimate Partner Violence and Stalking The University of Connecticut (the \"University\") is committed to maintaining a safe and non-discriminatory learning, living , and working environment for all members of the University community - students, employees, residents, fellows, patients and visitors. Academic and professional excellence can exist only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of safety and mutual respect. All members of the University community are responsible for the maintenance of an environment in which people are free to learn and work without fear of discrimination, discriminatory harassment or interpersonal violence. Discrimination diminishes individual dignity and impedes equal employment and educational opportunities. The University does not unlawfully discriminate in any of its education or employment programs and activities on the basis of an individual's race, color, ethnicity, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, genetic information, physical or mental disability (including learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and past or present history of mental illness), veteran's status, prior conviction of a crime, workplace hazards to the reproductive system, gender identity or expression, or membership in any other protected classes as set forth in state or federal law. To that end, UConn's Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment an d Related Interpersonal Violence, Including Sexual and Gender -Based Harassment, Sexual Assault, Sexual Exploitation, Intimate Partner Violence, Stalking, Complicity, Retaliation and Inappropriate Amorous Relationships (the \"Policy\") prohibits specific forms of behavior that violate state and federal laws, including but not limited to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"), the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (\"VAWA\"), and related state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Such behavior may also require the University to fulfill certain reporting obligations under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the \"Clery Act\"), as amended by VAWA, and Connecticut state law regarding reporting suspected child abuse and neglect. The University prohibits discrimination, as well as discriminatory harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence, stalking, sexual or gender- based harassment, complicity in the commission of any act prohibited by UConn Policy, retaliation against a person for the good faith reporting of any of these forms of conduct or participation in any investigation or proceeding under UConn Policy (collectively, \"Prohibited Conduct\"). These forms of Prohibited Conduct are unlawful and undermine the mission and values of our academic community. In addition, inappropriate amorous relationships with employees in posit ions of authority can undermine the University's mission when those in positions of authority abuse or appear to abuse their authority. See policy 3.e. for more information on a morous relationships prohibitions. 80 UConn's Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Related Interpersonal Violence articulates the University's commitment to: (1) eliminating, prevent ing, and addressing the effects of Prohibited Conduct; (2) fostering a safe and respectful University community; (3) cultivating a climate where all individuals are well -informed and supported in reporting Prohibited Conduct; (4) providing a fair and impar tial process for all parties in the investigation and resolution of such reports; and (5) identifying the standards by which violations of this Policy will be evaluated and disciplinary action may be imposed. In addition, the University conducts ongoing pr evention, awareness, and training programs for employees and students to facilitate the goals of this Policy. A student or employee determined by the University to have committed an act of Prohibited Conduct is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including separation from the University. Third Parties who commit acts of Prohibited Conduct may have their relationships with the University terminated and/or their privileges of being on University premises withdrawn. It is the responsibility of every memb er of the University community to foster an environment free of Prohibited Conduct. All members of the University community are encouraged to take reasonable and prudent actions to prevent or stop an act of Prohibited Conduct. The University will support and assist community members who take such actions. Retaliation against any individual who, in good faith, reports or participates in the reporting, investigation, or adjudication of Prohibited Conduct is strictly forbidden.

Classroom Scheduling 82 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.1. Overview of the Curriculum The School of Medicine curriculum prepares st udents for residency and a lifelong career in medicine . The MDelta curriculum (Making a Difference in Education, Learning , Teaching and Assessment ) began with the graduating class of 2020. Overview of the MDelta Curriculum The MDelta Curriculum highlight s self-directed, individualized, lifelong learning utilizing patient- centered educational experiences. Active learning is a key principle using such pedagogies as team- based learning and problem- based learning. The curriculum is tightly integrated in order to meet the graduation competencies and prepare the graduate for residency training. Scholarship and service are integral to the educational experience. The MDelta curriculum is divided into three stages following a two-week Launch period. Launch provides orientation to both the school and t he curriculum , including a mini- course in history taking and physical examination. Stage 1, the Exploration Stage, is 18 months in length and is composed of five 10 -week blocks each followed by a two -week learning assessment and enhancemen t period (LEAP ). Blocks A -C will occupy the first academic year followed by a twelve -week summer break with Blocks D and E occurring in the second academic year. The curriculum is organized into programs, which are broken into separate courses within the blocks. 83Stage 1: Course Requirements: Stage 1/Year 1 (Blocks ABC): All students must successfully complete blocks A, B, and C to be eligible to advance to Stage 1/ Year 2 . Stage 1 Course s Description EXPL -8111 - Case Oriented Essentials A EXPL -8112 - Case Oriented Essentials B EXPL -8113 - Case Oriented Essentials C EXPL -8114 - Case Oriented Essentials D EXPL -8115 - Case Oriented Essentials E The Case Oriented Essentials (COrE) Program is a set of 5 courses that use Team Based Learning (TBL) as the main pedagogy for curriculum delivery. The program's primary goal is to present the breadth of health and biopsychosocial science topics using a patient -centered approach incorporating the impact of health and disease on both the individual patient, family, and community. The sequence of index cases and virtual patients integrates aspects of foundational health sciences, organ system physiology and pathophysiology, pharmacology, biostatistics and epidemiology, law and ethics, and clinical medicine during each TBL unit. Each course builds on prior content, allowing the student to apply basic science concepts to understand symptom presentation, mechanisms and patterns of health and disease, and the principles behind therapeutic strategies. EXPL -8121 - Fabric of Anatomy & Bio Lab A EXPL -8122 - Fabric of Anatomy & Bio Lab B EXPL -8123 - Fabric of Anatomy & Bio Lab C EXPL -8124 - Fabric of Anatomy & Bio Lab D EXPL -8125 - Fabric of Anatomy & Bio Lab E The laboratory experience includes Gross Anatomy, Virtual Anatomy, Histology, and early exposure to Radiology and Ultrasound in both the Human Anatomy Lab (HAL) and Virtual Anatomy Lab (VAL). The goal of the Laboratory program is to provide students with fundamental knowledge of the anatomy and microanatomy of all clinically relevant regions and structures within the human body. This knowledge will inform physical examination and clinical reasoning skills. Students will learn to correlate state -of- the-art medical images with anatomy and to recognize pathological changes associated with anatomy. Laboratory experiences will also include physiology experiments. EXPL -8131 - Delivery of Clinical Care A EXPL -8132 - Delivery of Clinical Care B EXPL -8133 - Delivery of Clinical Care C EXPL -8134 - Delivery of Clinical Care D EXPL -8135 - Delivery of Clinical Care E In small groups, s tudents will learn the necessary history, exam and communication skills to interact with patients and colleagues in this doctoring course (DoCC). They a re provided individual feedback for ultimate growth as a professional by the triad for each group: physician, allied health professional and senior student. The course will be integrated with the other courses in Stage 1 and students will learn and be assessed in the Clinical Skills Center in exercises with patient instructors. EXPL -8136 - Patient Advocacy in Communities, Teams & Health Systems B EXPL -8137 - Patient Advocacy in Communities, Teams & Health Systems C EXPL -8138 - Patient Advocacy in Communities, Teams & Health Systems D Within the broad framework of Health Systems Science, PACTS uses an experiential and narrative medicine format to allow students to explore both systems thinking and the patient experience within the health care system, with a goal toward eliminating barriers to health. Threads include social determinants of health, population health, health equity, quality and patient safety, cost -conscious care, the economic impact of health care, communication, team-based collaborative care and the patient experience of coping with chronic illness. Students will be introduced to the spectrum of care and care partnerships available in the community, including public health, mental health, addiction and disabilities services, and meet interprofessional care partners in the workpl ace, in the home, in facilities, dialysis centers and hospitals. Throughout the course, professional identity development, team skills, alliance building, and the role of the physician as advocate are emphasized. 84EXPL -8151 - Clinical Longitudinal Immersion in the Community ABC EXPL -8154 - Clinical Longitudinal Immersion in the Community DE EXPL -8155 - Clinical Longitudinal Immersion in the Community, MD /PhD Students are paired with a physician in an outpatient practice for \u00bd day each week , allowing the student to interact with actual patients with a focus on primary care. Within a month of starting medical school, students begin practicing the skills that they learn in DoCC in the authentic offi ce environment. This experience lasts for at least the first three years (may be continued during fourth year on an elective basis), allowing for significant personal and professional growth. In the final 6 months of the third year, students may elect to spend time in a subspecialty site. EXPL -8141 - Vert Integ A EXPL -8142 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning B EXPL -8143 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning C EXPL -8144 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning D EXPL -8145 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning E The Vertically Integrated Teams Aligned in Learning (VITAL) Program prepares students with the skills they need to adapt to emerging issues in medicine/dentistry, public health, and policy that they will encounter in their clinical practice through courses that cover all three stages of the curriculum. The long term goal of VITAL is to make students better practitioners through the use of health system science and other threads that compliment and encompass the practice of medicine and dentistry. These include: law and ethics; evidence- based decision-making; interprofessional education; the social determinants of health and health disparities; the health care system and high value care; public and population health. In VITAL Stage 1, students meet once a week and work in teams or small groups to address real -world problems using the skill sets they are developing. In Stage 2 VITAL course objectives are threaded thro ugh many of the clinical clerkships as well as the Homeweek sessions that occur twice a year. In Stage 3 small teams of students complete a final project based on their analysis of an emerging issue relevant to clinical care. Combined, these courses support students' growth as independent life- long learners and teachers. EXPL -8161 - SCHOLAR: Scholarship & Discovery ABC EXPL -8164 - Scholarship & Discovery Stage 1 The overall goal of the course is to prepare students to embrace the breadth of modern scholarship principles and practices integral to their role as future clinicians. Students will build their skills to formulate relevant research questions, design and implement rigorous approaches, collect and appraise evidence, and develop proficiency in scholarly communication. Students will learn and apply the principles of ethical conduct in research. During Stage 1, all students will become familiar with critical as pects of scholarly work in 7 (including Launch) scheduled workshops. They will prepare a Capstone proposal describing their scholarly project (the Capstone Project) . Students will conduct the Capstone Project in Stage 2 and/or 3 with the exception of Dual Degree Students. LEAP -8001 to 8102 Individual Learning Opportunity (ILO) During LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assessment Period) , students either engage in reinforcement material to support content or participate in an ILO, or Individual Learning Opportunity, thus individualizing their experience. For students who have demonstrated a gap in knowledge, LEAP provides time and faculty support, and in some cases a re- assessmen t focused on their particular gap. If the student is cleared for an ILO, this five-day period allows total immersion in specialized topics designed by faculty to promote a deeper dive into a curricular area, support skill building, and/or career exploratio n. It also allows students the opportunity to have a valuable experience and learn outside of the curriculum, including options in the humanities. EXPL -8174 - Clinical Reasoning The course is designed to provide a bridge between the basic sciences and clinical rotations by encouraging the learner to analyze clinical cases involving multiple organ systems with a problem -based learning pedagogy . The learner will gain experience in oral presentations similar to presenting cases on clini cal rounds. The learner will gain experience with formation of sound assessments and plans for commonly encountered clinical problems. 85Stage 2, Clinical Immersion, begins with flexible time which can be used for board study, electives, scholarship and /or vacation allowing for individualization of each student's experiences. A one -week Stage 2 kickoff prepares students to begin clerkships. The clerkships are broken into four 12 -week Blocks . Rotation PPN includes four weeks each of Ambulatory Pediatrics, Inpatient Pediatrics and of Neurology . Internal Medicine block includes four weeks of Ambulatory Medicine, six weeks of Inpatient Medicine and two weeks that may be taken as an elective or as vacation time. The FMP rotation inc ludes six weeks eac h of Family Medicine and Psychiatry with a longitudinal experience in Geriatrics threaded throughout the block. T he OGS rotation includes six weeks of Obstetrics and Gynecology and six weeks of Surgery. Radiology is taught longitudinally through Stage 2 with the final examination in the spring . There are t wo 'home weeks ' where students come together at the SOM: the fall Homeweek's theme is palliative care, while the spring Homeweek focuses on advanced skills to prepare for Stage 3 . Afte r the second home week there are eight weeks of \"Advanced Clinical\" time which consists of individualized experiences which may include electives, 3rd year clerkships, board study, 4th year required rotations, scholarship and /or vacation. Students will continue with the CLIC course throughout Stage 2. Student Pl acement at Sites: For Stage 2/3, site assignments are made in advance by lottery and/or by availability of suitable sites. When there is a conflict, a student may initiate a request for reassignment for significant personal reasons. Based on the specific circumstance, students may speak first with the clerkship coordinator to see if there is an available slot at an alternate site. If there is no slot available, but the request is based on a significant conflict, then the coordinator can choose to switch another student out of their site to create a spot. If the student has an emergent issue that they do not wish to divulge to the clerkship coordinator, they have the option of speaking with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or to the central course scheduler in Clinical Education, who can reach out to the coordinators on their behalf. Clinical Electives requirem ent: Elect ives Beginning with the Class of 2021, t here is a total elective requirement of 20 week s over Stages 2 and 3 in the MDelta curriculum . Electives are offered in many specialties , including those not represented in required rotations. Some studen ts may decide to do an elective for career exploration while others may wish to gain additional experience in a discipline. Students may also opt to design their own elective in a particular area of interest. Third year/Stage 2 students also have the option to take vacation instead of an elective. In this case, students will need to fulfill the elective requirement during their 4th year. Using the elective time as a vacation in year 3 may leave less flexibility in year 4. Long itudinal teaching electives are available in Stage 3 and enhance flexibility in the schedule. Independen t Study Elective If a student is having academic difficulty, including but not limited to failure of the USMLE Step 861 examination, they may be placed in an alternative elective program by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs with approval by the AAC . The alternative elective program provides time away from the prescribed curriculum in which the student will complete an independent course of study, whi ch if successful, will result in a maximum of four weeks of elective credit. This independent course work must be formally proposed in writing with an outline of the work to be completed to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the project must be approved prior to the student initiating the work in order to receive credit. The student will receive no more than 4 weeks of credit, regardless of the number of weeks spent away from the prescribed curriculum. During the independent study, the student is also expected to be working on remediating the course work or examination that led to this undertaking. This independent study is only to be given in the case of academic difficulty and, should a student feel that they are in need of this program, it sho uld be brought to the attention of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made. Stage 2 Clerkship s Description IMED -8228 Ambulatory Medicine The overarching goals for the ambulatory medicine clerkship are for the students to develop skills and competencies in areas of patient care, medical knowledge, practice- based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-b ased practice. Students must be able to collaborate effectively to provide patient care that is compassionate, appropriate, and effective both for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. They should have the knowledge, skills and atti tudes necessary to allow effective interaction with patients and all members of the healthcare team, provide high quality patient care for their patients within the context of the larger healthcare system and promote the best interest of patients, society and medical profession. They should be able to apply their knowledge to better assess the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, prognosis, treatment, and natural history of common illnesses and evaluate their method of practice and implement strategies for improvement of patient care. The highlight of this clerkship is to help students develop competencies in providing high- quality comprehensive care to patients in an outpatient ambulatory office/clinic. 87PEDS -8233 Ambulatory Pediatrics Overarching goals include the acquisition of basic knowledge of growth and development (physical, physiologic and psychosocial) and of its clinical application from birth through adolescence; acquisition and implementation of the knowledge necessary for the diagnosis and initial management of common pediatric acute and chronic illnesses; acquisition of an understanding of the influence of family, community and society on the child in health and disease; development of communication skills that facilitate the clinical interaction with children, adolescents and their families; development of competence in the physical examination of infants, children and adolescents; development of clinical problem -solving skills and developme nt of strategies for health promotion as well as disease and injury prevention. Students have a one to one-to-one experience (one patient, one student, one preceptor), which allows for significant assessment of individual student status re: knowledge and s kill. FMED -8235 Family Medicine The goal of this rotation is to provide students with myriad experiences in the primary care field of Family Medicine. Students will learn about the role of family medicine doctors in the community. Students will be able to identify the pillars of this specialty: continuity of care, care coordination, comprehensive care, and community service. Students will explore the different scopes of practice and populations' family doctors serve. Students will develop and practice their patient care skills, develop differential diagnosis, preventive care plans for the most common diagnosis seen and managed by family medicine doctors in the community. Students will identify the role of culture in influencing health outcomes and illne ss and demonstrate the ability to provide appropriate resources to patients for prevention and acute care. Students will demonstrate the ability to practice evidence-based medicine by formulating clear clinical questions, find best sources of evidence, eva luate and appraise the evidence for validity and usefulness with respect to particular patients or populations, and determine when and how to integrate new findings into practice. Students will be able to collaborate effectively to provide family -centered, evidence- based patient care that is compassionate, culturally sensitive, and age appropriate and effective, both for health promotion and treatment of medical problems. IMED -8229 Inpatient Medicine Inpatient medicine is an educational experience where s tudents will be part of a team taking care of complex inpatients. Students will experience the challenges of patient care including obtaining history and performing physical exam on patients; appreciate the impact of an illness on the patient and their fam ily; demonstrate effective oral presentations; and assess each problem appropriately by formulating and prioritizing a differential diagnosis using current scientific evidence. PEDS -8234 Inpatient Pediatrics Overarching goals include: Diagnose and provide basic management strategies for common pediatric acute and chronic illnesses; develop communication skills that facilitate clinical interactions with children and their families and ensure that complete and accurate data is obtained; develop competency in the physical examination of infants, children and adolescents; develop clinical problem -solving skills; understand the unique role that different members of the multidisciplinary team have in caring for a hospitalized child. One week of the inpatient clerkship will be in the Emergency Department with experience in the newborn nursery or NICU. All students on inpatient pediatrics will be involved in the multidisciplinary approach to caring for the hospitalized child (rounds include pharmacy, social work, nursing, nutrition team, resp therapy etc.). All students will complete the Aquifer Pediatrics cases by the end of their two pediatric clerkship components. 88NEUR -8236 Neurology Overarching goals include developing excellent history -taking skills related to disorders of the nervous system; developing the skills necessary for performing a proper neurological examination; application of neuroanatomical principles for lesion localization in the nervous system; understand the pathophysiology of common neurological diseases and emergencies, their evaluation, and their treatment. The students are exposed to the acute evaluation and management of patients with stroke during the Neurology rotation. They will also be exposed to the care and management of patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit at UCONN/JDH (and Hartford Hospital). OBGY -8237 Obstetrics & Gynecology Overarching goals include: develop a thorough understanding and comprehensive approach to women's health subjects in the office setti ng including prenatal care, age- appropriate women's health screening and follow up gynecologic problem visits; display an understanding of the basic assessment and management principals of inpatient antepartum high risk pregnancies and women progressing th rough the process of labor and delivery; discuss the fundamental principles of safely bringing women into the operating room for minor and major gynecologic surgical procedures, including the management of complications and routine postoperative follow -up. Curriculum shared with the Surgery clerkship includes a shared emphasis on surgical skills and joint case - based radiology conferences. PSYC -8238 Psychiatry The Psychiatry clerkship will expose students to a wide range of psychopathology in order to facilitate recognition and management of psychiatric disorders encountered in the practice of medicine. Diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic considerations for both hospitalized and non- hospitalized psychiatric patients will be emphasized as well. Students are an integral part of inpatient psychiatry teams. They perform different tasks ranging from obtaining clinical collateral information from family members/ caregivers to aiding in diagnostic assessments by performing rating scales and screening questionnaires with patients. Students are exposed to an ample variety of clinical settings and patient populations i.e., inpatient units in general hospitals and long-t erm state hospitals, day programs, outpatient clinics, general and specialized psychiatry mobile crisis teams, etc. RADS -8260 Radiology - Longitudinal The Diagnostic Radiology Clerkship is a longitudinal clerkship running in parallel, and supplementing, the third- year clinical clerkships. Five one - hour Diagnostic Radiology sessions are scheduled during Kickoff week of Stage 2. These sessions will provid e the students with a greater baseline understanding of key radiology findings and the imaging evaluation of patients as they begin Stage 2. Students are required to take one simulated radiology call over the course of the year. This new clerkship format aims to provide greater clinical context of key radiologic findings as they are presented in concert with patient encounters experienced during the clinical clerkships. Further, it is hoped the students will gain a greater depth of understanding of the pro per imaging evaluation of classic clinical patient presentations through this longitudinal format. SURG -8239 Surgery The Department of Surgery requires its medical students to develop competency in the areas of patient care, medical knowledge and practice-based learning as it applies to the care of the surgical patient. The experience will expose students to pre - and po st-operative care of surgical patients and ensure that they gain competency in diagnosing and managing patients with common surgical problems. The expected level of competency will also include interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice. Students will be trained to work within a surgical team collaboratively with residents, attending and surgical staff while gaining a broad exposure to various aspects of surgical care. 89IMED -8230 Geriatrics Students learn geriatric medicine during a longitudinal experience that is integrated with the family medicine and psychiatry 12 -week block. The overarching goal is to prepare students to provide safe, patient -centered, and evidence- based care of older adults in their residual m edical school experiences and future specialties. Orientation to the geriatric medicine clerkship occurs on the first day of the family medicine or psychiatry segment, whichever comes first. Geriatric medicine clinical assignments are included in the family medicine and psychiatry individual student schedules. Clerkship components include: Weekly half -day sessions working with a geriatrician preceptor seeing older adults; Geriatric Medicine conference; Home visit to an older person; Hazards of hospitaliz ation for older persons simulation; Powerful Aging exercise class; and a final examination. CLIN -8241 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning Stage 2 The Vertically Integrated Teams Aligned in Learning (VITAL) Program prepares students with the skills they need to adapt to emerging issues in medicine/dentistry, public health, and policy that they will encounter in their clinical practice through courses that cover all three stages of the curriculum. The long -term goal of VITAL is to make students bette r practitioners through the use of health system science and other threads that complement and encompass the practice of medicine and dentistry. These include law and ethics; evidence- based decision -making; interprofessional education; the social determina nts of health and health disparities; the health care system and high value care; public and population health. In Stage 2 VITAL course objectives are threaded through many of the clinical clerkships as well as the Homeweek sessions that occur twice a yea r. TRANS -8364 - Scholarship & Discovery Stage 3 Students must register for 8 course credits in Scholarship and Discovery Stage 3 over the course of Stages 2/3, during elective periods and during blocks/pods. Students will register for course or elective c redit (variable) when actively working on their scholarly project. Mentors will complete evaluations and provide the grade in each tracking course as students are registered in multiple weeks that add up to 8. Students enrolled in any UConn dual degree pro gram are exempt from registration for the 8 course credits in Stage 2/3. 90Stage 3, Transformation, includes required 4 -week rotations in Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Advanced Inpatient Experience, 2 weeks of Transition to Residency (TTR) and a tot al of 20 weeks of elective experiences over Stages 2 and 3. At graduation the student will be entrusted with professional activities to allow them to successfully enter residency training and meet the graduation competencies. Students will be expected to meet UConn SOM graduation competencies. Stage 3 - Clerkship s sub -internship is a four -week rotation. The critical care sub -internship may be served in an adult MICU, SICU, CCU/ICU combination or PICU. CCU and cardiology electives do not fulfill this requirement. Critical care units across the affiliated programs serve as teaching sites. The goal of the clerkship is to approach the ICU as an applied physiology laboratory, emphasizing normal human physiology, the pathophysiology of disease, and the scientific underpinnings of diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. The curriculum consists of the following elements: Evaluation and manag ement of critically ill patients with direct patient care responsibility under the supervision of a unit resident and attending physician; Presentation of cases and participation in unit teaching rounds; Attendance at house staff teaching conferences; cent ralized case -based conferences. Prerequisites--successful completion of the following clerkships: Inpatient medicine, surgery and neurology EMED -8339 Emergency Medicine During the first days of the course, students are provided didactic sessions that help facilitate the student's approach to common chief complaints they may encounter when seeing emergency room patients. Students are required to spend 14 clinical shifts in the ED. Overarching objectives include that students will treat a wide variety o f acute outpatient problems, rapidly diagnose and initiate treatment in patients with time-sensitive conditions, recognize and stabilize critically ill patients (resuscitation), maintain care for more than one patient at a time (up to a student's own abili ty) and to become acquainted with certain common ED procedures (suturing, splinting and IV placement) Prerequisite --successful completion of the following clerkships: Surgery, Inpatient medicine, Ambulatory pediatrics, Ambulatory medicine OR Family medici ne, Psychiatry, ObGyn students choose a required four -week advanced inpatient experience (Sub -internship) in either Family Medicine, Surgery, Medicine, or Pediatrics. Students act in the intern role with appropriate supervision. Each of the experiences provides information to the students about the required clinical encounters; call schedule; duty hours; criteria for honors; procedure for mid -point feedback; and goals and objectives. TRANS -8361 Transition to Residency Multimodality educational course required for medical students in the spring of their fourth year. This program will assist students with their transition to internship. The overlying goal is to help with knowledge application and problem solving and give the students a framework to address the clinical challenges they will face. Many of these topics have been discussed/taught during their medical school career previously. This elective will ai d in the transfer and application of knowledge as they transition to the resident physician role. 91TRANS -8341 - Vert Integ Teams Aligned in Learning Stage 3 The Vertically Integrated Teams Aligned in Learning (VITAL) Program prepares students with the skills they need to adapt to emerging issues in medicine/dentistry, public health, and policy that they will encounter in their clinical practice through courses that cover all three stages of the curriculum. The long -term goal of VITAL is to make student s better practitioners through the use of health system science and other threads that complement and encompass the practice of medicine and dentistry. These include law and ethics; evidence- based decision -making; interprofessional education; the social de terminants of health and health disparities; the health care system and high value care; public and population health. In Stage 3 small teams of students complete a final project based on their analysis of an emerging issue relevant to clinical care. Com bined, these courses support students' growth as independent life-long learners and teachers. TRANS -8365 - Scholarship & Discovery Capstone The fundamental goal of the Capstone Scholarly Project (CSP) is to enhance students' abilities to think independently, critically, creatively, synthesize new information, and to be contributing members to their profession - ultimately, to better prepare st udents to practice medicine in the 21st century. The CSP also will enhance residency preparation, substantially, by providing advanced skills for research, a requirement in nearly all residency programs. The CSP is a mentored, longitudinal project, spanning from 1st to the 4th year, based on individual students' interests and aspirations. A CSP can include a broad range of scholarly opportunities, including bench or clinical research, advocacy, the humanities, and medical education, and should encompass at least one of the Scholarship domains as defined by Boyer. These domains include: Discovery (advancing knowledge); Integration (synthesizing & Learning (advancing/applying k nowledge about how to teach, promote, or assess learning). The CSP, a critical part of the \"Pathway to Clinician Scholar\" curriculum, is an essential component of undergraduate medical education at the UConn School of Medicine. The CSP involves three steps that students will complete over the duration of their training. The objective of the CSP requirement is to expose medical students to scholarly investigation; teach them to develop a hypothesis and c ollect, analyze, and interpret data to support or refute the hypothesis; and to encourage students to continue to pursue re search. Scholarly projects that use qualitative or combined qualitative and quantitative research methods or hypothesis -generating approaches may also be deemed acceptable. The Capstone Project will be performed during 8 mandatory but flexibly scheduled weeks in Stage 2/3 under the guidance of a mentor. Students can extend their Capstone Project by 4 additional weeks as an Elective. CLIN -8001 Clinical Electives Students beginning with the Class of 2022 are required to complete 20 total weeks of electives over the course of the third and fourth years. Clinical electives are wide ranging and include rotations in all specialties and subs pecialties. Students may take their electives within the UConn system or at any other LCME -accredited medical school via the VSLO program. Global health experiences may be taken as electives under the auspices of the faculty overseeing the global health cu rriculum. 92 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.2. MD/PhD in the MDelta Curriculum The MD/PhD program is a distinctive academic offering by the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and Graduate School. MD/PhD students matriculate for the first and second years of medical school with MD students. At the end of their 2 nd year, MD/PhD students leave the curriculum to pursue their PhD studies (Graduate Phase) . While working on their PhD theses , they are granted special matriculation in the Medical School giving them the ability to perform clinical activities. Thus, these students have the distinction of being dually enrolled in both the School of Medicine and the Graduate School throughout their entire matriculation at UConn Health . MD/PhD students must complete their PhD thesis before returning to Stage 2 . The average time to completion of the PhD degree is 4 years. The MDelta curriculum as it pertains to the MD/PhD program focuses on creating more clinical education continuity, providing more clinical preparedness when returning to the medical curriculum, and providing this unique set of students' options and choices to personalize and specialize their education. The MD and PhD degrees are granted together when both degrees are completed in this combined program. MDelta Curriculum Stage 1 (18 months): In this first stage of the MDelta curriculum, students in the MD/PhD program are fully integrated into the MD program courses. Because their academic trajectory dif fers from MD- only students and because they also have graduate school obligations, some program requirements have been modified. MD/PhD students are required to complete two summer research rotations (8 weeks each) during the first two years of the curriculum. They are also required to take one or two graduate school courses (each a semester long) and to attend the MD/PhD Research Club, which meets on Monday evenings twice a month. To facilitate these requirements, MD/PhD students will be scheduled accordi ngly on Monday afternoons in Stage 1. The scheduling of these additional graduate program requirements is the responsibility of the MD/PhD Program Director in consultation with the Associate Dean of the Graduate School. Stage 2 (15 months): The next stage of the MDelta Curriculum marks the completion of certain Stage 1 courses, specifically COrE, FAB Lab, D oCC, PACTs , Clinical Reasoning and ILOs. Other courses from Stage 1 will continue into this next phase including CLI C, VITAL /IPE, and Sch olarsh ip & Discovery . For the purposes of logistics and scheduling, S tage 2 for MD/PhD students is divided into 3 phases: o Stage 2: BOARD STUDY, ELECTIVE, SCHOLARSHIP, VACATION o Stage 2: SPECIAL MATRICULATION ; MD REINTEGRATION PERIOD o Stage 2: CONTINUATION PERIOD 93Stage 2: BOARD STUDY, ELECTIVE, SCHOLARSHIP, VACATION (2 months: March/April): This period of Stage 2 allows protected flexible scheduling by students for both vacation time as well as protected study time in preparation for USMLE Step 1. This period includes special considerations for MD/PhD students in regards to certain courses, while other course requirements remain the same as for MD-only students. Stage 2 Kickoff: MD/PhD students are excused from taking this 1week clinical introduction unless they are participating in clinical rotations before beginning their graduate studies. CLIC: MD/PhD students will continue the program mirroring MD- only students and attend 3 half- day sessions within the 2 -month period. Electives: MD/PhD students are not required to participate in any electives during this period. If students do participate in electives, the time will be credited towards their elective requirement for graduation. VITAL/IPE: MD/PhD will continue to attend this program mirroring MD -only students. MD/PhD students will need to finish their community -based project by the end of Stage 1. Scholarship & Discovery : MD/PhD students are excused during this time. Vacation: MD/PhD students can schedule up to 2 weeks of vacation during this 2 month period Board Study Prep: MD/PhD students should plan for sufficient self- study time in preparation for taking the USMLE Step 1 before the end of this 2 month period. All students are expected to take USMLE Step 1 by the end of April. Delays must be granted by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. Students must receive permission from the Associate Dean of Student Affairs to enter special matriculation in the graduate school . For the MD/PhD students, the end of this 2 -month period marks their transition out of the standard MD program into their 'special matriculation' of PhD study unless they elect to participate in the option of a clinical clerkship before beginning the 'special matriculation.' Stage 2: SPECIAL MATRICULATION (typically 3- 4 years) , including the MD REINTEGRATION PERIOD : This time , also called Graduate Phase, is devoted to the completion of a student's PhD thesis . Special permission is required from the graduate program if this period is to exceed 5 years. The MDelta curriculum takes into account the need for continued clinical exposure during this period and has therefore modified the CLIC course to continue dur ing this period in order for MD/PhD students to maintain and enhance their clinical skills. CLIC: Students are expected to continue attending their community longitudinal clinics 1 half day per month until th ey reach a total of 40 sessions . All efforts w ill be made to continue students in their original clinical site from S tage 1. 94MD REINTEGRATION PHASE (4 months: Jan/Feb/Mar/ April ): This reintegration phase will occur as students are finishing up their graduate phase/special matriculation to help them transition back into the MDelta curriculum. Special considerations are made for MD/PhD students in regards to certain courses while ot her course requirements remain the same as for MD-only students. Stage 2 Kickoff: MD/PhD students are required to take this one week clinical introductio n at the end of April. Clinical Skills Refresher: Phase 1 is January - February requiring students to participate in DoCC E final Clinical Skills Assessment as well as other activities as decided upon by the Director of Clinical Skills. Performance is reviewed , identifying strengths and weaknesses to work on during next phase. Phase II from February to A pril is a clinical skills refresher. This course is designed to help strengthen their skills in preparation for clinically intensive rotations (eg. inpatient medicine, inpatient surgery, etc.) Clinical Rotations: MD/PhD students can choose to start clinical rotations at any time after completing Stage 2 Kickoff. It is expected that most MD/PhD students will start their clinical rotations by July, although this entry time is flexible depending upon credit from previous clinical rotations and electives. Entry time must take into consideration timely completion of all graduation requirements. Stage 2 - CONTINUATION PERIOD (11 months): The MD/PhD students join the MD-only students in in the first clinical clerkship year. CLIC: If the total number of sessions during the graduate phase/special matriculation equals or exceeds 40 sessions then the requirements for the Stage 2 CLIC course are considered complete. Those who have not met the 40 session requirement will be required to attend CLIC during their clerkship rotations just as MD -only degree students until the 40 ses sion requirement is met. Students who complete the 40 sessions of CLIC during their special matriculation will be given the option to participate in an independently designed longitudina l clinical elective scheduled through the medical school or a research elective coordinated through the graduate school. VITAL/IPE: MD/PhD will continue this program mirroring MD -only students. Scholarship & Discovery : MD/PhD students are exempt from further requirements. Electives: MD/PhD students will have the same total elective requirements as MD- only students. MD/PhD students may choose to participate in a special research elective involving manuscript completion or dissertation preparation. A maximum of 4 weeks may be granted for this elective . Clinical Rotations: MD/PhD students will have the same expectations as MD- only students. 95Stage 3 (11 months) This is the final stage of the MDelta curriculum and focuses on advanced clinical experiences and transition to residency. The expectations and requirements are the same as those for MD- only students except for the following: VITAL/IPE: MD/PhD will continue this program mirroring MD-only students. Scholarship & Discovery : MD/PhD students are exempt from further requirements. Electives: MD/PhD students will have the same total elective requirements as MD- only students. Clinical Rotations: MD/PhD students will have the same expectations a s MD- only medical students. Approved by Education Council on June 16, 2016 Updated July 20 21 96 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.a. Satisfactory Academic Progres s Satisfactory Academic Progress of students is determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures as described in this policy. Qualitative Measure All students at UConn SOM are expected to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Stage 1 Given the five -part modular structure of Stage 1 of the MDelta curriculum, students who maintain satisfactory academic progress will be allowed to proceed to subsequent blocks in Stage 1. The Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) will evaluate students for compliance with satisfactory academic progress annually. Annually: Students who have passed all the courses and requirements during the academic year (July 1 -July 1) may be assessed as maintaining satisfactory academic progress . Students who have been assigned remediation(s), may be assessed as maintaining satisfactory academic progress if, in the deliberation of the AAC, the cumulative burden of remediat ion(s) does not place the student at significant risk of violation of the quantitative measure. In order to be promoted to Stage 2, students must sit for Step 1 Stages 2 and 3 In Stages 2 and 3 the AAC will assess students for maintenance of satisfactory academic progress yearly. Decisions related to promotion are made at the end of the academic year. To maintain satisfactory academic progress, students should be eligible for promotion. Specifically, to be eligible to advance from Stage 2 to Stage 3, students in Stage 2 must: Complete all Stage 2 clerkships with a minimum grade of pass, Complete all VITAL, CLIC, Certificate and Scholarship requirements, and Complete electives wi th a grade of pass. In some situations, the AAC may grant permission for a student to complete one or more Stage 3 rotations prior to completion of Stage 2 clerkships. In Stages 2 and 3 , students who may not be eligible for promotion may, in the deliberat ion of the AAC, be assessed as maintaining satisfactory academic progress if the balance of the unmet academic requirements does not place the student at significant risk of violation of the quantitative measure. In certain extraordinary circumstances, th e AAC may grant a waiver of the qualitative measure above. 97Quantitative Measure In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress: Students must complete the 4 year medical school curriculum (including leaves of absence) in no more than 6 years. A student may not repeat any year more than once. A student may not repeat two consecutive years of the curriculum. In certain extraordinary circumstances, the AAC may grant a waiver of the quantitative measure above. The Financial Aid SAP Policy may differ from a student's academic standing and is used for financial aid purposes only. For more information on the Financial Aid SAP policy; please review it here: UCH FA SAP Policy 98Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.b. Academic Standing Definition of Good Standing Good standing is a designation that indicates a student is eligible for promotion, to continue participation in the curriculum, and to transfer to another institution. Academic and professionalism issues do not automatically result in revocation of the st atus of good standing. The AAC will examine serious academic and professionalism issues to determine whether such matters impact the standing of the student. Remediation and/or Disciplinary Actions The AAC will determine whether any academic or profess ionalism disciplinary action that may impact a student's eligibility to be promoted or to continue in the curriculum will result in the loss of good standing. Revocation of status of good standing becomes effective only after the student has exhausted all appeals processes. When the terms of the disciplinary action are satisfied, the AAC may restore the status of good standing with the student remaining in academic watch or warning (see below). Remediation is not considered a disciplinary action unless the AAC explicitly deems it as such. Academic Watch or Warning/Academic Probation In ke eping with AAMC guidelines regarding academic probation, UConn School of Medicine has determined two internal categories called: \"academic watch\" and \"academic warning,\" neither of which, in and of itself, result in the loss of good standing. Even while maintaining the designation of good standing, failures within the curriculum may result in the AAC placing the student in a status of \"academic watch\" or \"academic warning.\" Academic watch indicates that a student is potentially at risk of not meeting requirements for promotion as a result of academic failures and/or breaches of professional behavior. A student may be placed on academic watch as a result of multiple exam failures, course failures, professionalism issues, board failure, failure of a clinical skills summative evaluation, or failu re to successfully complete a curriculum component or an administrative requirement. If a student's failures in the first year require that remediation coursework be completed over the summ er, then the student will be placed on academic warning, which in turn will prohibit their ability to participate in summer research . A student may also be placed on academic warning based on failures that indicate that the student is in serious jeopardy of needing to repeat the year. It should be noted that both academic watch and warning are internal designations and will not appear on the transcript, MSPE, or other official document tha t is shared externally. Students will be notified by email or letter documentation that they are on academic watch or warning. Correc tive measures instituted by the AAC to address issues of academic watch or warning may include, but are not limited to, remediation programs (internal or external), repetition of a specific course, or repetition of the curriculum of an entire year. In some cases, 99neuropsychological testing may be recommended. When external remediation programs are prescribed, students will be responsible for attendant financial costs. Additionally, standard tuition and fee charges will apply to any repeated course work. Students in the status of academic watch or warning, with active pending remediations, will be discouraged from participating in any leadership and extracurricular activities. Students in the status of academic watch or warning will be monitored closely by the AAC for one year after successful completion of all remediations and any failure of any component of a course or a clerkship may bring those students' issues back before the AAC. The AAC considers the complete academic and professional history of all students presenting to the committee. Stude nts in the status of academic watch or warning who intend to take a leave of absence must meet with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for direction. For most leaves, students must receive approval of the AAC prior to the leave and must notify the AAC at least 30 days prior to intended return in order to receive direction from the AAC . The Office of Student Affairs may allow a medical leave or a leave for extenuating circumstances in the setting of academic watch or warning without the approval of the AAC, but the AAC must be informed by the Office of Student Affairs and may require such students to appear before the committee prior to school re -entry or receive a \"Fit for Duty\" evaluation . 100Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.c. Withdrawal 1.Voluntary Withdrawal From School A student may voluntarily withdraw from school at any time, with written request to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. A student who voluntarily withdraws may apply for readmission via the Office of Admissions. Students seeking readmission after voluntary withdrawal must complete the AAMC/UConn admissions processes. There is no guarantee of readmission following withdrawal. Students should be aware that a tuition refund policy exists (see 2 .n.). The student's record will note if the withdrawal was in good standing or not in good standing. 2.Administrative Withdrawal From School Unde r certain circumstances, a student may be administratively withdrawn from the school. Examples may include, but are not limite d to: 1.a student who has exceeded a leave. 2.a student who fails to return after a leave without communicating with the Office for Student Affairs. 3.a student who fails to meet the technical standards required for medical e ducation. 4.a student who fails Step I or Step 2 three times. 5.a student who fails to pay tuition, fees, or medical insurance, by the required dates. 3.Required Core Course or Clerkship Withdrawal: Voluntary and Administrative Stude nts may withdraw from a required course or clerkship before any examination has been given or before the mid-p oint evaluation, whichever occurs first, without it appearing on their transcript. Once an examination has been given or a mid-p oint evaluation been completed, students may still withdraw, but a grade of \"WP,\" \"WC,\" or \"WF\" will appear on the transcript. WP: Student withdrawal i n good standing (satisfactory overall performance to date) WC: Student withdrawal with concern (overall performance to date p uts student at risk of failure) WF: Student withdrawal while failing (reserved for students t hat have failed every component of the course to date, or, in the opinion of the course grading committee/clerkship director or departmental grading committee, would not be able to pass regardless of subsequent performance). 1014. Elective Withdrawal Phase/Stage 2 or 3 Elective Students may withdraw from an elective prior to 30 days before the start of the elective without institutional approval and without the withdrawal appearing on their transcript. Requests to withdraw within 30 days of the start of the elec tive require approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Director of Electives, in order to avoid a consequence . Failure to adhere to the notification and approval requirements for withdrawal from courses may result in a professionalism incident report triage form being filed. For students who leave the curriculum for other reasons and must withdraw from the elective administratively, a grade of \"WP,\" \"WC,\" or \"WF\" will appear on their transcripts as described . Longitudinal Elective Longitudinal Electives are a special category of electives that span an entire academic year and require extra planning and preparation. These elective s are often competitive in nature, require training before the ir start -dates , and are critical to the educational mission of the School of Medicine. Students cannot drop these electives without approval from the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, in consultation with the Course Director. Requests to withdraw within 30 days of the start of the elective require approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Director of Electives, in order to avoid a consequence. Failure to adhere to the notification and approval requirements for withdrawal from courses may result in a professionalism incident triage report form being filed. Withdrawals after the start date of such elective s, will result in a grade of \"WP,\" \"WC,\" or \"WF\" appearing on the transcript. 5. Dropping Combined Programs Students in a combined program such as MD/PhD, MD/MPH once admitted may request withdrawal from the combined program. The MSPE will note the academic history and a notation will be on the transcript related to the withdrawal from the program. The MSPE will also not e if in good standing. Students must submit a letter of request to the AAC in order to continue with the MD program alone. The AAC may ask the student to appear. Any financial support for the dual degree will be relinquished when transitioning to a single degree program. 102 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.d. Holds UConn SOM utilizes a system of holds when students fail to meet standard educational obligations. A \"hold\" prevents: 1. The release of a student's academic transcript or any school documentation 2. Students from continuing on to the next term by \"freezing\" a student's registration status. This freeze is in place until the reason for the hold is appropriately addressed by the student. All financial obligations must be satisfied before a student can register for another term and continue their studies and/or research A student who fails to complete the credentialing requirement for a clinical site will be considered ON HOLD. A hold status due to student's lack of compliance with a requirement (e.g. health requirements, financial requirements) will result in an unexcused absence with academic consequences applied. Types of Holds: Academic (pending a remediation completion) Administrative (e.g. pending an outcome of an investigation, incomplete compliance requirements ) Bursar (failure to meet financial obligations) 103 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.e. Leave of Absence Policy Life circumstances such as illness, childbirth, family emergency, etc. may require students to take time off from courses or rotations. Additionally, in recognition of the diversity of aptitudes and learning styles that exist among the student body, the School of Medicine acknowledges the importance of individualization as a central component of the educational experience. Therefore, a number of options ar e offered to provide flexible paths for students to move through the curriculum. These options include excused absences; formal leaves of absence (LOA) that m ay last up to one year; continuous enrollment courses for remediation ; and extended boards study depending on individual circumstances . With appropriate administrative approval, these options can be engaged individually or combined over the course of a given academic year depending on students' needs . Leaves of absence are documented on the transcript and in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) with the appropriate dates of leave. Approval for any leave of absence or change in enrollment status is a requirement for the execution of the request and is facilitated via Student Affairs. Any leave or change in status taken while in poor academic standing, academic watch or warning will require review by the Academic Advancement Committee ( AAC) prior to return and may require a Fit for Duty exam and clearance . Students are also responsible for initiating requests to re -enter the curriculum. Failure to do so could result in an end to the leave with administrative withdrawal. Excused Absence In the pre -clerkship curriculum (Stage 1) a student may be granted an excused absence for up to 2 weeks by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, after which it becomes a leave of absence. Within the 2 week excused absence, coursework may be made up without the need to repeat the block or course. However, for LOAs (i .e., time out >2 weeks) the student may need to repeat the course(s), block(s) or year, depending on the content missed. This will be a discussion and decision between the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Associate Dean of Medical Education and Assessment and Assistant Dean for Pre -Clerkship Curriculum. In the Clerkship curriculum (Stage 2/3) the Associate Dean of Student Affairs may grant up to a 6 week excused absence (or the length of one clerkship rotation) after which it becomes a LOA. Any missed Clerkship will be made up at a later da te, when there is appropriate room in the student schedule and a slot available . In the clinical curriculum, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs may grant up to two days per clerkship as an excused absence. Any absence longer than two days may, at the discretion of the clerkship director, require the student to make up the missed portion of the rotation. Exceptions can be made with special permission, granted by the Clerkship Director in advance, in addition to clearance from the Associate Dean for Student Affairs . An excused absence and leave of absence may affect a student's eligibility to graduate on time. 104Leave of Absence LOA is broadly defined as a period of temporary, non -enrollment in the established four -year curriculum and can be granted for a variety of reasons . Other periods of time away from the regular curriculum might include a dual degree or scholarly project.

Students may petition the AAC for review of what counts toward academic progress. All LOAs or time in another degree program will be documented on the transcript and in the MSPE. Any leave taken during a time of academic struggle will be so noted in the MSPE. Any request for an LOA in the setting of academic watch or warning requires review by the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) and approval prior to return . Taking a leave while on academic difficulty will usually result in that year counting toward the quantitative measure for Satisfactory Academic Progress but students may petition the AAC for a review (see policy 4.a.). All reque sts for LOAs must be granted at least one month in advance or, in the case of medical leaves, at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs. Any adjustment related to extending the duration of the leave is possible via the AAC but must be submitted via writin g at least one month before the designated readmission date. As st ated above, if a student takes a LOA in Stage 1 , they will need to either finish the remaining block work over a summer period /break , or repeat the block or entire year, depending on the amount of work missed. If a block need s to be repeated, the student may need to re-enter the curriculum the following academic year and resume the curriculum at the point in which the LOA began. This will be a discussion and decision between the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Associate Dean of Medical Education and Assessment and Assistant Dean for Pre -Clerkship Curriculum. 105In Stages 2 and 3, students will be allowed to resume their rotations as scheduled upon completion of a leave of absence . Any le ave taken in the setting of academic difficulty , such as academic watch or warning , or with any deficiencies to be addressed must involve the AAC in providing direction and establishing specific requirements. Time Limits on LOA The nature of medical education is progressive and cumulative. As such, each stage of medical school builds from the previous stage. Interruptions in the curriculum can therefore be detrimental to a student's ability to progress successfully through the cu rriculum. A leave of absence greater than one year or multiple leaves of absence that equal greater than one year may negatively affect a student's ability to progress through the curriculum. The AAC has the ability to review a student's progression and decide if the student is not progressing successfully through the curriculum. This may result in a recommendation for dismissal. All returns to the curriculum must be requested with the Office of Student Affairs and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs no later than 30 days before the anticipated return. Students are responsible for initiating requests to re -enter the curriculum . Note: Administrative leave given via the AAC as a disciplinary action is also considered as a leave with no liability coverage, no ability to participate in clinical work , or in extracurricular school - sponsored activities. The categories listed above are limited and may be insufficient to meet the spectrum of educational and personal challenges and opportunities that students encounter during medical school. There are several categories that may allow a student to remain enrolled in the School of Medicine, although in these cases they generally do not participate in the formal curriculum. The categories of leaves of absence include: Scholarly Activity o Allows student to interrupt the regular curriculum of the School of Medicine to pursue a research experience, an experiential project, or to obtain training in a program that does not confer a degree o Requires UConn Student Research and Scholarship Committee approval of a scholarly project o Does NOT count toward Satisfactory Academic Progress ( see policy 4.a. ) o Student MUST sit for any appropriate USMLE examinations before commencing with scholarly work o Student MUST complete any pending remediations before commencing with special matriculation o Student is considered enrolled ; therefore, loans may be deferred o Will be indicated on the transcript and the MS PE 106 Additional Degree o Allows the student to interrupt the regular curriculum of the School of Medicine to pursue a combined or independent degree (e.g. PhD, MPH, MBA) within the University of Connecticut or at an outside institution. Additional degrees from UConn will be indicated on the transcript , additional degrees earned at UConn or an outside institution will be indicated on the MSPE Remediation o Allows students extended time to interrupt the regular curriculum to remediate course work that was previously not successfully completed o Requires approval by AAC and an IEP developed by the Learning Specialist and Student Affairs o Counts toward Satisfactory Ac ademic Progress ( see policy 4.a. ) o Student is still enrolled; therefore, loans may be deferred o Will be indicated on the transcript and the MSPE Financial Implications of LOA To be eligible to receive federal and institutional student aid, the student must meet and maintain the UConn SOM's standards of satisfactory academic progress (please refer to policy 4.a.). The current standards , applied to students entering in 2012 or after, require students to complete the preclinical years (1 st and 2nd years of school) within three years and the clinical years (3rd and 4th years of school) of the curriculum within three years. Students in the graduating class of 2020 and beyond must complete Stage 1 within three years, and Stage 2/3 in four years, but the combined total cannot be more than six years for financial aid purpo ses. No more than a total of six years will be allowed for any student. All other years of school count toward this time , whether or not academically successful. Loans: A leave of absence status greater than 180 days will move students out of their loan deferment status unless they are considered fully enrolled in the School of Medicine as defined above. The last date of attendance before the LOA is the \"Out of School\" date. After 180 days, the grace period ends and all educational, federal loans will go into repayment status . Students are expected to meet with the Bursar and Financial Aid director before an LOA is finalized in order to fully understand the consequences of the LOA on loan repayment. In some cases, a LOA is unexpected and urgent. In this situation, the student should meet with the Bursar and Financial Aid director as soon as possible. UConn may be required to return or adjust financial aid if a student takes a leave of absence during the term and will not return in the same term as they will be considered a withdrawal for financial aid purposes. Other Financial Obligations: Students will be required to pay fees , but not tuition, during scholarly leaves . Students on leaves for remediation will be required to pay prorated tuition and fee s. Liability There is no liability coverage for students who are out of the curriculum of the School of Medicine on medical, parental, personal or administrative LOA. Howe ver, students on special matriculation 107status for remediation, scholarly activity , or an additional degree may be eligible. Students are not permitted to engage in the clinical environment during a leave (or suspension) without the expressed permission of the AAC. LOAs as Part of Graduate School Work Special matriculation status relat ed to joining the Graduate School fall under certain restrictions and require special permissions and considerations. For additional information, please contact the Associate Dean of the Graduate School or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Other Implications Students on leave are not allowed to participate in curricular or school- associated activities unless granted permission by the AAC and Student Affairs. This includes students who are suspended from the school in disciplinary action. Clearan ce to Begin Leave of Absences, Withdraw, Transfer, or Otherwise Leave the School Students who leave the medical school prior to completion of the curriculum (e.g., transfers, withdrawals, leave of absences) must obtain clearance before departure. Students are required to meet with the Office for Student Affairs before filling out the appropriate forms. The student will receive a letter of leave tailored towards their individualized conditions. All students must meet the criteria and confirm, in writing, agreement with the terms of the leave. In addition, students must complete a sign -out form requiring the signatures of a number of offices indicating that there are no outstanding debts or other encumbrances to the student's record and that all medical school property has been returned. When all the signatures are obtained, the student must return the form to the Office for Student Affairs. Return from LOA At the end of the specified LOA or period of special matriculation , the student must notify the School of their intention to return at least 30 days prior to return . If the School is not notified, they may be dismissed, with a notation of administrative withdrawal. This is non -appealable and final. If a student wishes to apply for reinstatement at a later date, a new application for admissions must be completed. 108 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.f. Credentialing Healthcare institutions require safety standards as part of their credentialing process and must be complete prior to working at UConn or its partner and affiliated clinical sites. Each student is responsible for having the required credentials and comple ted forms specific to each clinical site prior to beginning any clinical rotation . All students are required to maintain active current certifications in the following (including but not limited to) : Basic Life Support/CPR Blood borne pathogen training Infection Control training HIPAA training Other requirements as specified by the specific site or SOM, including routine immunizations, influenza vaccine yearly , COVID -19 requirements and T uberculin Skin Testing/Quantiferon testing and others as relevant . Failure to be up to date will be considered unprofessional and may result in a delay in starting clinical rotations and/or being pulled from the clinical environment, triggering unexcused absences and any related consequences. A PIRT will be filed. 109 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.g. Transcripts Transcripts are maintained by the Registrar. Transcripts provide an official record of the accomplishments of a student over the course of their program of study. The transcript includes course grades (required and elective) and clinical honors earned. 1. Standard Official Transcripts : A standard transcript will be generated for st udent upon complet ion of medical school. Grading is described in policy 5.b. Honors earned in the core clinical disciplines will be listed on the transcript if applicable. In any given academic year, all components of a course are listed only once on the official transcript. A component is a course that has a specific topic or focus area that is required and is graded along with other related components under an overarching umbrella course. In the MDelta curriculum, the courses offered with components are Pediatrics: Ambulatory and Inpatient, and Medicine: Ambulatory and Inpatient. For students graduating in May the conferral and completion date will be the day of commencement. 2. Transcripts for Students with a Leave of Absence Courses and/or a leave of absence are reflected on a transcript dependent on the start date of the leave. a. Before the Start of an Academic Year : If a student is granted an authorized leave of absence with an effective start date before the academic year begins, no course work will be reflected on the transcript for that time period. A comment will be added t o the transcript during the Stage the student went on leave, the dates of the leave and the reason for the leave . Upon returning from the leave the date of re -entry will be added to the comment. b. Short Leave Within the Academic Year : If a student is granted an authorized leave of absence for a period within but not extending through the academic year, those courses that were started but not finished will show a grade of W (along with the academic progress), if withdrawn , or Incomplete (I), if the student can complete the course requirements prior to the initiation of the next academic year. Any courses for which the student is registered during the time of the leave that have not started will be removed from the student transcripts. A comment will be added to the transcript at the end of the last term for which a student was registered stating the student went on leave, the dates of the leave and the reason for the leave (i.e., personal, joint degree program, pathology fellowship etc.) . 110Upon returning from the leave the student will be registered for the appropriate course work. Scholarly Study and dual degree study are not considered leaves of absence. Students participating in these will be registered for TRNS 8598, Independent Scholarly Enrichment, or MEDS 6000 for dual degree who are in the Graduate School phase of their curriculum. No comment will be added to the transcript. 3. Transcripts for Students Dismissed or Withdrawing from Combined Program If a student in a combined de gree program is dismissed or voluntarily withdraws from a combined degree program , a notation describing this will be added to the transcript within the term that the action occurred. The matter will be referred to the AAC for any change in dual degree status for information and review. The MSPE will accurately reflect the sequence of all academic issues within the Academic History section. 111 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.h. Attendance policy (illnesses, religious observances, jury duty) Active participation in the medical education program is a critical component of the professional development of a physician. Instructional settings involving small groups of students allow closer faculty/student interaction, an opportunity for more inform al career exploration as well as a source of letters of recommendation for future research or training programs. Lack of attendance for any reason, due to illness or excused absence, does not relieve a student from responsibility for material covered durin g that absence. Professional behavior requires that students notify course/clerkship/small group preceptor about any anticipated or sudden absence, particularly when their presence affects the work of colleagues in laboratory, small group discussions, an d settings involving patient contact. Students should make certain that they have the appropriate phone/email/page numbers to carry out this responsibility. If appropriate, students may be required to receive clearance from a treating physician or Student Mental Health Services before resuming their medical education program. Absences from examinations will only be accommodated under extreme circumstances. Such requests must be made to the course/clerkship director and Associate Dean for Student Affairs. If a decision is made to accommodate the exam request, alternate arrangements will be made with the input of the course/clerkship director . The course/clerkship director or faculty preceptor reserves the right to request that students make up any mandatory academic activity from which they are excused. The timing and circumstance of such activities will be established at the discretion of the course/clerkship director or faculty preceptor. Regarding Illnesses and Healthcare appointments If a student has any concern about their ability to function in a classroom or patient care setting or about the risk that they might transmit an infection to patients because of an illness, the student should contact the course/ clerkship director, and the direct faculty supervisor. Students should not neglect their own health. The Medical School recognize s that medical appointments cannot always be scheduled during non -class or clerkship times. Therefore, students may be excused to go to medical appointments when necessa ry, including behavioral health appointments. Students who anticipate being absent because of a medical appointment should request permission, as early as possible, from their course or clerkship director. If the student does not want to discuss the absence with the course or clerkship director, the Assoc iate Dean of Student Affairs may serve as a liaison and will inform the course or clerkship director that the students is excused without disclosing the reason. Religious Observances The Medical School recognizes that the members of its community, including students, observe a variety of religious faiths and practices. Few of the various religious days of observance are part of the Medical School's holiday calendar. However, the Medical School recognizes and respects the religious beliefs and practices of its students and seeks to accommodate them reasonably within the requirements of the academic schedule. As a result, the Medical School will not penalize a student who must be absent from a class, examina tion, study or work 112requireme nt for r eligious o bservance. S tudents w ho a nticipate be ing a bsent because of religious o bservance must, as early as p ossible, request p ermission f or the absence f rom their course o r clerkship d irector. Whenever feasible, f aculty should a void s cheduling e xaminations a nd assignmen t deadlines on religious holidays. A student with an excused absence from a clas s because o f religious observance shall not be penalized for any c lass, e xamination, o r assig nment deadline mis sed o n that day o r da ys.

Once a disposition is made, the decision will be communicated to the appropriate course director. Requests for approval of absences should contain the following information: o Student Name o Date of Ab sence o Current Course o Name of Course Director o Name of Small Group Leader o Reason for the absence request from the approved list of excused absences Years One and Two Reporting The following will be considered excused absences: Death of a family member or close friend Wedding of an immediate family member (1st degree relative) Attending a wedding in which student is a member of the wedding party Illness of an immediate family member Personal Illness /Urgent medical evaluation Religious observance Jury duty Attending an immediate family member's graduation (1st degree relative) Present work at a local, regional, or national conference Student is a member of a national committee (e.g. AMSA, AMA) with a leadership role and is asked to attend a meeting. Stages 2 and 3 Absence Policy The clinical phase of the curriculum requires a full time commitment by the student in patient care and didactic activities. Students serve as members of the health care team and assume an active role in the care of the patient. Their presence, participation and engagement at the bedside form the cornerstone of learning in the clinical environment. In these clerkship years, students are required to attend all clerkship functions including night, h oliday, and weekend duty as well as participate in all educational activities , including Home Week and any required remediation. Unexcused absences from any of the above may result in referral to the Professionalism Incident Report Triage ( PIRT), or a failing grade and students may be required to make up days missed or the entire clerkship depending on the length of time involved. Students should make requests for excused absences to the appropriate clerkship director. Clerkship directors should report any absences of two days or more or any recurring absences to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. To summarize: Requests for approval of absences may be made to the course/clerkship director Requests for approval of absences of two days or more must be made to the course/clerkship director/small group facilitator and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. 114 Requests for approval of absences should contain the following information o Student Name: o Date of Absence: o Current Course: o Name of Clerkship Director: o Reason for the absence request from the approved list of excused absences Stage 2 and 3 Reporting The following will be considered excused absences: Death of a family member or close friend Wedding of an immediate family member (1st degree relative) Attending a wedding if student is a member of the wedding party Illness of immediate family member Personal Ill ness/ Urgent medical evaluation Religious observance Jury duty Residency intervi ew (see below) Attending an immediate family member's graduation (1st degree relative) Present work at a local, regional, or national conference. Student is a member of a national committee (e.g. AMSA, AMA) with a leadership role and is asked to attend a meeting. Residency Interviews The School of Medicine supports students in their pursuit of their future careers. Students must schedule interviews during Stage 3, and the intent of the following is to clarify this need and provide a framework for work ing with the clerkships. Students are requested to provide advance notification of at least one (1) month to the Clerkship Director(s) and Clerkship Coordinator to ensure that clinical obligations are met. If this is not possible students are expected to a dvise the Directors and Coordinators as soon as an interview date is set. If a student needs to miss three or more days for residency interviews, they will be expected to make up the missed time. The Clerkship Director(s) will determine when and how this happens. As with all absences of two days or more, the student should email the Clerkship Director, Clerkship Coordinator, and copy the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Clerkship directors should notify the Associate Dean for Student Affairs of any recurring absences of two days or more. In general, it is recommended that students avoid scheduling interviews during the following rotations in MDelta : Critical Care, Sub -Internships, TTR, and during the didactics of Emergency Medicine. If unavoidable, the student must make arrangements with the Clerkship Director in advance of the rotation to schedule missed activities. 115Other There may be sign in sheets or other modalities where students are asked to sign in online. Signing into an educational activity without being present is a violation of the Student Honor Code. Similarly asking someone to sign in for you is a violation of the Code for each student involved . Clinical encounters, labs, and small groups and all 22 contact hours in MDelta require active participation of students. Peers rely on each other for teaching, teamwork, and collaboration. For this reason , these important activities are desig nated for mandatory attendance. 116 Academic Polic ies and Procedures Manual 4.i. Examination Administration P rocedures Exam schedules are provided to students before the start of the academic year but may be subject to change in exceptional circumstances (e.g. weather). The expectation is that students will sit for exams as scheduled. All assessments within a course must be completed. There are no waivers of required assessments. Any deviation from the posted schedule is considered an Early Take or Late Take as described below: Early Takes Students may request to take an examination prior to its scheduled date and time for extenuating circumstances (e.g. when they have an anticipated conflict on the scheduled exam day). Sole authority for granting such requests rests with the Course Director. However, the Course Director is not obligated to allow early takes. If a student or students are given permission to take an examination early, the Course Director must make appropriate arrangements. It is expected that students granted the privilege of an early take will abide by the Student Honor Code and not reveal the content of any part of the examination to anyone. Late Takes Arrangements can be mad e for a student to take an examination after the scheduled date and time. Permission for such late takes requires approval of both the Course Director and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In general, late takes are used to accommodate unusual and unplanned events. For example, permission may be granted when the student is unable to take the examination because of illness, death in the family, or other circumstances beyond the student's control. In most cases, absence from class prior to the date o f an examination is not a valid reason for granting a late take. If a student or students are given permission to write an examination late, the Course Director must make appropriate arrangements. In general, students are expected to take the examination the morning of the day they return to class. However, under unusual circumstances, alternative times and dates may be stipulated. In rare extended circumstances there may be the need for an exam to be taken at the end of an academic year rather than temp orally adjacent to the absence. It is expected that students granted the privilege of a late take will abide by the Student Honor Code and not discuss the content of the examination with anyone. Location All examinations must be taken in the location designated by the Course Director. Taking an examination outside of the designated location is a breach of examination protocol and comes under the provisions of the Student Honor Code. Students will be notified of appropriate locations for taking an examination. Time of Examinations The time allotment for each examination will be specified. All work must end at the time limit specified. Working past the designated time, without permission (see Special Allowances) is a breach of examination protocol. Th e Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment , 117together with the Course Director, will typically report this to PIRT to determine what action will be taken regarding scoring of examinations turned in late. Conditions The Course Director will determine the conditions under which the examination will be administered (e.g., paper and pencil, computer -based , in-person or remote ). They will also determine what additional materials may be brought to the examination (e.g., calculators, books). Nothing may be brought into the examination room unless approved by the Course Director. Cell phones are prohibited during examinations and should not be brought into the examination room. Once a student has begun the examination, the examination booklet or packet (in the case of paper and pencil examinations) may not leave the room unless it is being turned in as a completed examination. If a student must leave the room for any reason, the examination booklet or packet (in the case of paper and pencil exami nations) must be placed face down. If a student must leave the room during a computer -based exam, they must ensure that the display on the computer cannot be viewed by other students. There may be examinations or assessments that can be done outside of the school environment. All conditions applied to those examinations related to access to resources and time must be followed. All examination experiences require that all students adhere to the Student Honor Code. Special Allowances In order to accommod ate students with special needs, it may be necessary to modify the examination and/or the manner in which it is administered for these students (e.g., allowing extra time). Students who believe they need accommodations for an examination must present that request in writing to ADA & HR Programs Officer who will review and facilitate all reasonable accommodations . Depending on the requested accommodation, assessment by appropriate professionals may be necessary prior to implementation of the accommodation. If an accommodation is deemed necessary, the Office of Assessment & Evaluation , in consultation with the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment , will make appropriate arrangements. Proctors Depending on the circumstances of the assessment, proctors are typically designated to oversee examination sessions. Occasionally, examinations are taken without room proctors under the provisions of the Student Honor Code. In these circumstances, students will be provided with instructions in the event of questions or technical problems during the examination . Cheating Cheating on an examination is a breach of the Student Honor Code. Any individual who observes a violation of the Student Honor Code during the administration of an examination has the du ty to take positive action such as: 1. Notification of Course Director or designated faculty present during the examination 1182. Consultation with an Honor Board member 3. Referral of the case to the Honor Board or PRB by submitting a PIRT report . The names of the H onor Board members can be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In order to protect the student's rights, ensure due process, and allow the Honor Board investigation to proceed smoothly, the reporting individuals should not d iscuss the incident with any other individual. It is also recommended that if possible, the student be allowed to complete the examination. Disposition of the examination will be determined following action by the Honor Board. Securing Examinations and Challenges to examination questions and answers (Stage One) High -stakes e xaminations are secured and not available for review outside of the course director's discretion . After grading is completed, students may be given an opportunity to review the questions and answers in a secure setting when circumstances permit . If deemed necessary and, at the discretion of the Course Director, a full class review may be scheduled. When students review an examination, they are expected to abide by the provisions of the Student Honor Code. Due to the secure nature of high -stakes examinations, students have limited access to examinations post exam. Students who are required to enhance and/or re -assess will be provided an opportunity to work with the Learning Spec ialist but will not have direct access to the exam. Students may appeal questions or the answers on examinations and should contact the program director for further guidance. Appeals must be submit ted in writing and provide supporting evidence to be considered . When appeals are accepted, the change affects the entire class, and not just the student submitting the challenge. Students required to enhance and/or reassess must adhere to the Block Assessment Review Committee (BARC) decision regardless of challenge outcome. 119 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.j. Examination Grading Stage 1 Examinations The Program Director (e.g. COrE, VITAL, LAB, DoCC, PACTS ) is responsible for establishing a Program Policy Committee (PPC) to set the pass/fail score on examinations with in that Program across all course blocks (A through E) as applicable . The composition of that committee is at the discretion of the Program Dir ector except that it shall include both the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment and the Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs as ex officio, non -voting, members of the committee. The PPC will include student and faculty representation as well. For courses in which dental students are enrolled, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the School of Dental Medicine is also an ex officio , non -voting, member. A Block Assessment Review Commi ttee (BARC ), composed of leadership and faculty representatives from all courses within the Block and chaired by the Stage 1 Director, will meet mid-block (A-E) to build the integrated assessment for LEAP . The Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, the Associate Dean for Stud ent Affairs , the Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs, and the Director of the MD/PhD Program are ad hoc members. This committee will also meet immediately post -assessment within LEAP to review student performance and determine allowable reassessment and enhancement option s for each student. This review will initially be performed without the identity of the students known to the committee. The reassessment and enhancement options from the BARC will then be provided to the student and co ach who will enact the appropriate review and enhancement plans. The individual Course Grading Committees (CGC) will meet at the end of each LEAP and will assign the final grades for each of their respective course s (e.g. COrE, VITAL, LAB, DoCC, PACTS ). For further detail on CGC process, refer to policy 5.c. The Program or Course Director may share the results of the examination with faculty participating in the course. However, revealing individual student performance is not encouraged , and should only be done on a need- to-know basis at the discretion of the Course Director. Examination scores of underrepresented minority students are provided to the Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs. Student Affairs track s the performance of all students in an effort to provide support to students who may be struggling or who may have a history of marginal performances. The students will receive a report of their performance on each examination. In addition to their examination score, they will receive the mean score of the class, and the pass/fail score of the examination. Students receiving a failing score must meet with the Course Director or their designee and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. At that time, a supplemental independent educational plan will be developed. All such plans must be supervised by appropriate faculty. 120As student advocates, coaches will have access to student grades in order to monitor and advise each student. Coaches will have direct access to student mid- and end -block grades, as well as narrative peer evaluations. Additionally, the Learning Specialist will also have access to student grades when developing supplemental educational plans for students with marginal or failing performance. See policy 5.b. for course grading information . Stage 2 Clerkship Examinations In the clinical rotations, the final clerkship exams ( NBME shelf or internally written ) must all be passed prior to successfully completing Stage 2 . A second exam failure in a clerkship will require that the student be removed from the clerkship environment to pursue remediation of the clerkship content and re -examin ation unless otherwise approved by the AAC . In the case of any clerkship exam failure, the AAC is notified and approves an appropriate remediation plan . Please refer to policy 5.c.1 for Clerkship Grading Policy and 5.c.2 . for Exam Grade Remediation in Clerkships. 121 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.k. Policy for Step 1 and Step 2 CK USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK are requirements for graduation. A maximum of three attempts is allowed for each individual exam. Step 1 For students matriculating in 2015 and prior , taking USMLE Step 1 is considered a requirement for promotion to Phase II of the curriculum. Students must successfully complete all Phase I coursework and be promoted to Phase II by the AAC prior to taking Step 1, and Step 1 must be taken prior to beginning Phase II clerkships or before initiating a Scholarly Leave. For students matriculating in 2016, students must successfully complete all Stage I coursework and be promoted to Stage II by the AAC prior to taki ng USMLE Step 1. Students have until September 1 of Stage II to take Step 1 and may begin clinical rotations before taking for the exam. Students may complete up to 2 clinical rotations before taking Step 1. For students matriculating in 2017 and beyond, students must successfully complete all Stage I coursework and be promoted to Stage II by the AAC prior to taking USMLE Step 1. Students will be enrolled in a non- credit Board Preparation Course to maintain full- time status. Students are expected to sit f or Step 1 prior to Stage 2 Kick -Off. Under extenuating circumstances students may request an extension up to the end of the first 12 -week pod, and will require approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or designee, followed by review by the AAC. R equests should be submitted to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or designee. An extension beyond the first 12 week pod may result in a need for a formal review course and an extended leave of absence. The AAC will review the student's individual situation and make a recommendation. If a formal review course (e.g. Kaplan) is recommended, it is the student's responsibility to register for the course. Students who plan to take a scholarly leave or enter a dual degree program must sit for any applicable Board Examination before commencing the leave or program . MD/PhD students should refer to policy 4.2 . Any failure of a Board Examination will trigger a referral to the AAC . Failures USMLE Board examination failures are reported to Student Affairs and the AAC. Upon notification of Step 1 failure, students will be asked to step out of Stage 2 for remediation and may re -enter upon retaking Step 1 . Students will have one calendar year from the date of their first Step 1 test date to complete the second take of the Step 1 exam including any LOAs . Exceptions may be granted by the AAC. Depending on the rotation schedule, students may be allowed to complete the clinical portion of the clerkship, but they may NOT take any clerkship examinations until they have been approved to re -enter the curriculum. A student on Scholarly Leave will be offered the same opportunity to remediate as soon as possible by transitioning the leave to either special matriculation for remediation or personal leave until the examination 122is successfully completed. In any case, the scholarly leave will be terminated and a plan for remediation must be presented to the AAC. A second failure of Step 1 would likely require enrollment in a formal study course and plan for success. A recorded pass on Step 1 would be necessary in order to re -enter the curriculum. A student will appear before the AAC upon a second attempt failure of Step 1 in order to ascertain any additional support needs and to confirm with the student that the exam must be passed on the third and final attempt. Students will have one calendar year from the date of their second Step 1 test date to complete the third take of the Step 1 exam including any LOAs . With failure of the examination on a third attempt, the student may withdraw (not in good academic standing) or otherwise will be administratively withdrawn from school. It is school policy to pass the exam on or before the third attempt. Only extraordinary ex ceptions will be considered by the AAC for appeal. Any circumstances affecting ability to perform well must be considered in advance of sitting for the final attempt. Step 2 CK Students are recommended to take Step 2 CK prior to any scholarly leave after year 3 of the curriculum. There must be a recorded pass for each USMLE exam prior to certification to participate in the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) . In general students are required to complete all re quirements related to the Stage 2 curriculum prior to taking Step 2CK. Students who are not under the purview of the AAC may request permission from the Associate Dean for Student Affairs to take Step 2 CK early. Any student under the AAC's purview must request permission from the AAC. The exams must be passed on or before the third attempt. A recorded pass result for Step 2 CK must be available prior to the deadline for submission for match lists (NRMP). It is recommended for students to have recorded results for early match submissions (e.g. , military, SF match). If the result is unavailable or there is a recorded failure at the time of match list submission , the student will be administratively withdrawn from the match. In exceptional circumstances, the AAC may allow the school to notify every program director that there is a pending graduation requirement. 123 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.l. Conflict of Interest Policy Conflict of Interest Policy for the University of Connecticut School of Medicine: Interaction between Students and Faculty at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and the Pharmaceutical, Commercial, Nutriceutical and Biomedical Industry Purpose of Policy The purpose of this policy is to define the parameters of appropriate interactions between students and faculty in the undergraduate medical education environment at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine with representatives of the pharmaceutica l, nutriceutical, biomedical, and any commercial industry (including publisher, board review entity, etc.). Undergraduate medical education at UConn SOM is conducted in a variety of environments. Across this diverse spectrum of environments there are many opportunities for interactions between students and industry/commercial representatives. While many aspects of such may be positive, others may create a conflict of interest or the perception of a conflict of interest 1 and potentially compromise the educational mission of the School of Medicine. It is crucial that the educational environment fosters the professional development of students in all its aspects. The Liaison Committee of Medical Education requires that medical education programs must have affiliation agreements in place that define the responsibilities of each party related to the educational program for medical students. The UConn SOM, through its affiliation agreements recognizes the important role that both Employed Clinical Faculty and Volu ntary Physicians play in the teaching, training and supervision of medical students. Through the distribution of this policy to all parties involved in the educational process, the UConn SOM is providing guidelines and principles expected in all educationa l settings and requires adherence to this policy as well as all other policies involving students. Policy Statement It is the policy of the UConn SOM that any interaction between any members involved with the undergraduate program and representatives of t he pharmaceutical/biomedical/commercial industry, which are or could be perceived as conflicts of interest must be disclosed and appropriately managed. Specifically, such interactions should support the core principles of professionalism as defined by the AAMC, namely, autonomy, objectivity, and altruism. 1 Herein fore included in the terms \"conflict of interest\" or \"COI\". 124Scope of Policy The policy is inclusive of the following interactions I. Gifts and Meals II. Consulting Relationships III. Industry Sponsored Speakers IV. Disclosure V. Pharmaceutical Samples VI. Purchasing and Formularies VII. Industry Sales Representatives VIII. Attendance at Industry -Sponsored Lectures & Meetings IX. Industry Support for Scholarships & Funds for Trainees X. Disclosure Requirement in the School of Medicine Curriculum XI. Noncompliance I. Gifts and Meals A. Students and SOM faculty may not accept any gift or compensation from industry in any site in which UME occurs, including UConn SOM affiliated sites. Gifts and compensation are defined as anything of value that is provided to an individual, significant other, or a family member f or which nothing of approximate value has been provided in return. Examples of prohibited gifts are as follows include the following: 1. Money, gift certificates, securities 2. Support of travel or accommodations 3. Free or discounted services 4. Meals 5. Free subscription to a commercial course Exceptions to this policy include unrestricted educational grants. However, these can only be provided to SOM administrative offices for educational uses that promote the institutional mission. B. Students and SOM faculty may not accept any gift or compensation for attendance at a presentation/talk by industry or commercial representative C. Students and SOM faculty must actively avoid the influence of industry in clinical care decisions (e.g. choice of drugs or other therapies). D. Student s and faculty should also refer to the State Code of Ethics for further guidance. The following link is available to access this document: http://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/24/guide -to-the-state -code -of-ethics/ II. Consulting Relationships Faculty must comply with the University of Connecticut Health Center polic ies and procedures for faculty consulting that may be found on the site the School of Medicine who are requested to provide a service or enter a contract should consult this policy for guidance and contact the Office of Student Affairs for further direction. III. Industry Sponsored Speakers A. Industry may provide unrestricted educational support for educational sessions and events. However, in doing so industry is prohibited from influencing the choice of speaker or the education content. Participants should be ma de aware of industry sponsorship. The preferred mechanism of providing such support within the School of Medicine is through an unrestricted grant to a Department, Center, or Program Director. B. Faculty may not accept honoraria from industry to speak at SOM functions. C. Students may not book rooms for commercial entities. There can be no meetings or events on site to promote a Board Review course, IT product, or other commercial entity. IV. Disclosure A. Medical students and faculty may not publish under their o wn names articles that are written in whole or material part by Industry employees. B. If students and/or faculty have a financial interest that results in a scholarly publication, that interest must be disclosed in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors . C. Faculty must ensure that their supervision of students is not encumbered by any actual conflict, appearance of, or potential conflict of interest. In the event of a perceived conflict of interest, faculty must appropriately disclose to students and seek input from the educational administration of the SOM to manage the COI. D. Disclosure requirements re quired for Continuing Medical Education (CME) activities are available here . V. Pharmaceutical Samples A. Sample medications cannot be distributed at UC onn School of Medicine. Samples may be distributed at affiliate sites and clinician offices at the discretion of the attending faculty. This decision must include disclosure to any student present, including both B and C below. B. Students and faculty should be aware that distribution of samples potentially encourages patients to use products for which there are often less costly and equally effective alternatives C. Free samples may not be sold or used by students or teaching faculty for themselves or family. VI. Purchasing and Formul aries Any faculty member or student responsible for or participating in making decisions regarding the purchase of equipment or medications must not have any financial 126interest with any company that might profit from the transaction. Indirect ownership through mutual funds is permitted. VII. Industry Sales Representatives Industry representatives may not have access to patient areas, and are only allowed in non-patient areas by appointment. These appointments should generally be restricted to in -service train ing or ongoing support of equipment or devices already purchased, including the evaluation of a new purchase. Medical students are not permitted to meet with sales representatives unless such encounters are supervised by faculty for teaching purposes. VIII. Attendance at Industry -Sponsored Lectures & Meetings A. Programs must be aware of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) Standards for Commercial Support. These Standards are a useful resource for all forms of Industry interac tion; those on campus and off, including events sponsored by the institution and others. The Standards may be found at www.accme.org. B. All education events sponsored by UConn SOM programs must be compliant with ACCME Standards for Commercial Support whether or not CME credit is awarded. 1. Educational grants, particularly unrestricted grants, that are compliant with the ACCME Standards may be received from Industry by the program. A CCME guidelines include the following requirements: a. Financial support by Industry must be disclosed by the meeting sponsor. b. The meeting or lecture content must be dictated by the speaker and not the Industrial sponsor. c. The information presented must be a fair and balanced assessment of therapeutic options and promote objective scientific and educational activities and disc ourse. d. The selection of speakers or educational content by UConn SOM resident/fellow or teaching faculty must not be a condition of the industry sponsor's financial or material support C. Food provided to students/residents/fellows may not be directl y funded by Industry or any commercial entity. Industry is permitted to provide unrestricted educational funds to a Department, Center, Program Director, or designee on behalf of the program that may be used for refreshments at educational sessions. The c ontributing industry(ies) can be credited for contributing an unrestricted educational grant for the session. D. This provision does not apply to meetings of professional societies that may receive partial industry support for professional meetings governed by ACCME Standards. 127On-Campus: Students may not book rooms for commercial entities (see III above). Off-Campus: Students are encouraged to pay particularly heightened attention to the content and organization of such meetings and lectures and to assess the following issues when determining the academic value of any conference, lecture, or meeting: a. Disclosure of support and COI's for all speakers b. Oversight of the content c. Bias and balance d. Compensation, rewards and gifts for attendees IX. Industry Support for Scholarships & Funds for Trainees Any industry sponsored scholarship or trainee funding must be provided directly to the School of Medicine. Such support must be unrestricted and free of oversight by the contributor, and it must be accompanied by a Letter of Agreement that is consistent with ACCME Standards for Commercial Support. The evaluation and selection of recipients of support is the sole responsibility of the UConn School of Medicine. X. Disclosure Requirement in the School of Medicine Curric ulum Faculty must fully disclose any conflicts of interest related to their lectures and materials used in the educational setting. These disclosures must be registered with the Home Office of Medical Education and be fully visible in any audiovisual materials as well as the instructor's syllabus. Where relevant such disclosures must be made at the start of educational sessions with the requirement of a disclosure slide as the first or second slide of any talk. The slide must specify for educational purpos es what the perceived conflict might be. All students must undergo training in Conflict of Interest with Industry. This training developed by the School of Medicine is included in the Launch for incoming students and periodically in the VITAL (Vertically Integrated Teams Aligned in Learning) cours e. XI. Noncompliance Where students are concerned, violation of this policy will be considered a breach of professionalism. Such violations should be reported to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs . Inadvertent violations provide an opportunity to educate the student and reinforce the importance of the policy. Repeated or deliberate violations must be referred to the Academic Advancement Committee for consideration of sanctions and as the school will be developing new processes for professionalism, any breach would follow that newly defined process that could funnel into the Academic Advancement Committee for repeated or egregious infractions. 128Monitoring and potential discipline of faculty who abridge the policy are outlined in the UCHC policy #2006 -01 (updated in 8/2013 ), Individual Financial Conflicts of I nterest in Research . The following resources were used to create this policy: Community and Continuing Medical Education Disclosure Declaration - Conflict of Interest Interaction between University of Connecticut School of Medicine Graduate Medical Residents/Fellows and the Pharmaceutical, Nutriceutical and Biomedical Industries (\"Industry\") Policy The University of Connecticut Health Center Faculty Consulting Polic ies The University of Connecticut Health Center policy #2009-03 , Institutional Conflicts of Interest in Research The University of Connecticut Health Center policy #2006- 01, Individual Financial Conflicts of Interest in Research University of Connecticut Guide to the State Code of Ethics The Pew Charitable Trusts, 200 8, The Prescription Project Toolkit series . Series includes Drug and Medical Device Procurement; Ghostwriting and Speakers Bureaus; Pharmaceutical Samples; Gifts, Meals and Entertainment; Vendor Relations . 129 Academic Policies and Proc edures Manual 4.l.1. Conflict of Interest Policy - Admissions Committee Conflicts of Interest can include personal knowledge of an applicant or their immediate family, a past professional or academic relationship with a colleague who is related to the candidate, or an employment relationship. The Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy of the UC onn SOM Admissions Committee will be reviewed with each new faculty or student member prior to the onset of their service as an Admissions Committee member or as an applicant interviewer. It will also be rev iewed during yearly orientation of applicant interviewers, and when the Admissions Committee meets at the b eginning of each yearly cycle. Because of the vast number of applicants being reviewed, and to ensure committee members remain aware of the need to disclose COI, review of the COI policy will also be made periodically at the start of committee meetings through- out the year. Efforts should be made to identify and declare any perceived COIs , either verbally or in writing, by all Admissions Committee members and applicant interviewers prior to contact with the medical school applicant or the assigned applicant file. All potential COIs will be reported to a member of the Admissions Core Leadership (i.e. the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs, the Director of Admissions, or the Chairperson of the Admissions Committee). This core group will be responsible for determining the presence or absence of a true COI, whether any additional steps should be taken to manage or eliminate potential COI, and reassigning the applicant accordingly. Prior to the beginning of each yearly admission cycle, all faculty and student interviewers and all faculty and student Admission Committee members will be asked to sign an attestation. A copy of the COI policy will be given to each faculty or student to review. The attestation will then be signed, noting that each individual has read and understands this COI policy . Interview and committee participation will only be allowed after this signature has been obtained. When a COI occurs involving an applicant interview assignment, the student or faculty interviewer will immediately contact a member of the Admissions Core Leadership to report the potential COI . If a true COI is determined to exist by the leadership group, the intervie wer will recuse themselves and may be assigned an alternate candidate to interview. COIs may also occur for faculty or student members of the Admissions Committee. If the COI involves an assigned candidate file for review, the committee member will contact a member of the Admissions Core Leadership. The individual will recuse themselves and be assigned an alternate candidate file for review. If the COI involves a candidate being presented at a meeting, the committee member must make the nature of the po tential COI known. The Admissions Core Leadership will determine if the COI is of a professional or personal nature . If the potential COI is of a professional nature ( e.g. committee member who worked with applicant in lab, or on project , etc .), the committee member may participate in the discussion and provide any information related to their professional interaction with the applicant, but will recuse themselves from the vote on the candidate. If the COI is of a personal nature, the admissions committee member should recuse themselves from the discussion and the vote. Discussion and voting will proceed on the candidate with the recusal documented in the final vote prior to the committee member returning to the meeting . 130 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.m. Research and Scholarly Opportunities The School of Medicine prepares all students for their role as future physicians who embrace the breadth of modern scholarship principles and practices. Opportunities to engage in Research and Scholarship are available in the following areas: Biomedical/Translational/Clinical; Community -based (Urban Service, Global Health); Public Health, Health Disparities, Outcomes Research, Health Policy/Advocacy; Health Quality/Quality Improvement/Acceleration of Implementation of Best Practices; Humanities in Medicine; Informatics (Bio or Clinical)/Data-driven medicine; Medical or Patient Education . Eligibility for summer research The curriculum is designed to provide interested students with protected time during the summer between their first and second -year to carry out a research project of 8-10 weeks durati on. Interested students will submit a proposal out lining the research project, including a literature review, methods,and description of their role and responsibilities. Each proposal is merit -reviewed by the Scientific Review Panel and summer research award recipients are announced in late April or early May . Each recipient receive s a $3000 stipend. Additionally, summer research recipients working in a 'wet lab' are eligi ble to apply for an additional $2000 award for supplies. Students r eceiving an unfunded external summer research placement should conta ct the Director of Summer Research to determine if they are eligble for the stipend. To be eligible to participate in the summer research program, s tudents must be in good academic standi ng. Academic eligibility is determined by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs based on the student's performance in all Stage 1 courses. Students may NOT participate in school -sponsored summer research , with or without funding , if they have pending academic requirements in the Stage 1 curriculum, such as coursework with an incomplete, in -progress, or conditional grade . Students requiring academic remediation necessitating greater than 2 weeks to complete successfully prior to the start of summer research will not be awarded stipend support and will not be allowed to participate in the summer research program, even if the Scientific Review Panel approved the proposal . Opportunities and advising in research The Scholarship & Discovery course in Stage 1 provides guidance on selecting mentors for scholarly projects , formulating research questions, proposal writing, research design, data acquisition , data analysis , peer review and all associated ethical principles in conducting research . Students interested in Summer Research should contact po tential men tors as soon as possible. Rapid identification of mentors is critical for Global Health projects; strict deadlines will apply. Students are encouraged to visit: http://core.uconn.edu/ and utilize the \"find faculty expertise\" button to explore their interests in the scholarly work ongoing across the University and at our affiliated institutions. The Director of Medical Student Scholarship and Discovery works with the Director of Global Health and the Scholarship Team to assist students in identifying mentors and summer research 131opportunities, preparing research proposals , serving as a liai son between summer research mentors and the SOM, and coordinating presentations for Medical and Dental Student Research Day . The men tor who accepts the student into their lab, community, academic, or clinical setting will advise the student in data collection, analys es and d issemination of student scholarly work as appropriate for the scholarly community . Students are required to present the ir findings on Medical and Dental Student Research Day , which typically takes place in late February or early March . Abstracts can be submitted beginning in the Fall of the second year . All Stage 1 students are expected to attend the Poster session, Keynote address, and oral presentations . Capstone Scholarly Project The fundamental goal of the Capstone Scholarly Project (CSP) is to enhance students' abilities to think independently, critically, creatively ; synthesize new information ; and to be contributing members to their profession - ultimately, to better prepare students to practice medicine in the 21st century. The CSP will also substanitially enhance residency preparationby providing advanced skills for research, a requirement in nearly all residency programs. The CSP is a mentored, longitudinal project, spanning from the 1st to the 4th year, based on individual students' interests and aspirations. A CSP can include a broad range of scholarly opportunities, including bench or clinical research, advocacy, the humanities, and medical education, and should encompass at least one of the Scholarship domains , as defined by Boyer 1990) These domains include: Discovery (advancing knowledge) Integration (synthesizing knowledge) Application/Service/Engagement (advancing/applying knowledge) Teaching & Learning (advancing/applying knowledge about how to teach, promote, or assess learning). The CSP , a critical part of the \"Pathway to Clinician Scholar\" curriculum, is an essential component of undergraduate medical education at the UConn School of Medicine. The CSP involves three steps that students will complete over the duration of their training. Each of these steps is described in more detail below. The objective s of the CSP requirement are to: expose medical students to scholarly investigation; teach them to develop a hypothesis and collect, analyze, and interpret data to support or refute the hypothesis; and to encourage students to continue to pursue research. Scholarly projects that use qualitative or combined qualitative and quantitative research methods or hypothesis -generating approaches may also be deemed acceptable. The Capstone Project will be performed during 8 mandatory but flexibly scheduled weeks in Stage 2/3 under the guidance of a mentor. Students can extend their Capstone Project by 4 additional weeks as an Elective. 132Step s in the Capstone Process : 1. Proposal Development (Stage 1) 2. Project Execution and Completion (Stage 2/3) 3. Submission of the Scholarly Capstone Project Abstract - the final product endorsed by the mentor. Additionally, a Critical Reflection Summary and proof of, or plan, for Dissemination are required. (Stage 3) Each of the 4 subsections of the Abstract (Background/Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions) will be scored using a 3 -level scale by the Scholarship and Discovery Leadership and the Capstone Directors with the assistance of additional faculty as needed . Points earned based on level of competency achieved for each criterion will be summed resulting in the final score, and a rubric is used to determine passing level, or request for revision . In addition to the Abstract, a mentor assurance and disseminatio n of results are required. The Capstone Scholarly Project is required for graduation, with special circumstances or waiver allowed for dual degree students; e.g., MD/PhD, MD/MPH, MD/MSCTR, or MD/MBA. Scholarly Year Students can apply for acceptance into Scholarly Year program during their 3 rd year/Stage 2. Accepted students will complete required coursework after completion of Stage 2 and prior to the start of Stage 3, which would be the final (fifth) year. Exceptions will be made at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Applications are submitted to the Office of Student Affairs, and are reviewed by a Committee. Membership in the committee includes the Director of Medical Student Scholarship and Discovery, the Stage 2/3 Director of M edical Student Scholarship and Discovery, and additional faculty members designated by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs . The application consists of a written proposal of the academic activity to be pursued during the extra year, and a letter of supp ort from the faculty advisor who will oversee this work. For those students who wish to pursue their academic activity at another institution, letters of support must be submitted from both a UConn faculty advisor, and the off-site advisor who will directly supervise and oversee the proposed activity. Exceptions from these rules are accepted for students admitted to Scholarly Year Programs at Federal Institutions in case federal employees are prohibited from signing mentorship agreements. A midterm and fina l report of students' effort and productivity will be submitted by the students and mentors to the Scholarship and Discovery Program and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, and these will be graded on a pass/fail scale. The Scholarly Year project can b e in lieu of the Capstone Project if it results in comparable deliverables , and should be requested at the time of application. Boyer. (1990).

Awards and Honors Various awards and honors are available to medical students throughout their tenure. In addition, students play a critical role in choosing the winners of faculty awards and course awards. Senior Awards are presented in a special ceremony before commencement. Student Research awards are presented during appropriate ceremon ies depending on class . The Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) honors medical students, residents, role -model physician teachers and other exemplars recognized for \"demonstrated excellence in clinical care, leadership, compassion and ded ication to service.\" Organized to elevate the values of humanism and professionalism within the field of medicine, the Society is fast becoming integrated into the medical educational environment. The GHHS is a steadfast advocate for humanism through acti vities on campus and invo lvement with its membership. The SOM establish ed an Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society chapter. This honor society recognizes scholarship, leadership, professionalism, service and academics. The graduating class of 2019 wa s the first to be eligible for A A membership . While the chapter continue s to confer awards to residents and faculty, the award to medical students was suspended as of the Class of 2021.

Academic and Career Advising The University of Connecticut School of Medicine has an effective advising system for medical students that integrate s the efforts of the following faculty members: The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Faculty Co -directors of Student Affairs are available for all types of advising . The Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs participates in advising and counseling underrepresented minority students. The Director for Career Advising oversees and contributes to the Career Advising program Lead Career Advisors representing each major specialty act as the point of contact for students interested in their specialty throughout the stages of the curriculum and serve as the official advisors for students transitioning to their M4 year. The Assistant Deans of each major clinical site as well as the Course/ Clerkship Directors and Site Directors are available for career counseling, tutorial services, mentoring and advocacy. Co-Directors of the Coaching program are responsible for recruitment and development of faculty coaches , as well as programming for students. The Coaching program provides support for academic advising by reviewing progress at regular intervals, reviewing peer and faculty evaluations with the students , and guiding students through goal setting exercises or action plans . The Learning Specialist is available to students in all three stages of the curriculum and provides support such as time management, study skills, and organizational skills. Course faculty provide content support and access to student tutors. Academic Advising An integrated approach to academic advising provides students support in both curricular and extra -curricular domains. The Offices of Student Affairs and Curricular Affairs work together to support and promote professional identity formation for all students. Faculty in both domains meet with students across the stages of the curriculum to support academic progress, transitions, and individual needs. Upon matriculation, e ach student is assigned a Coach who provide s academic advice, monitors overall performance, and helps students to create and meet professional goals. The student - coach relationship spans the entire 4 years of medical school, providing continuity and stability. In Stage 1, coaches meet with students during each 10-week block and during the 2-week assessment period called LEAP . Data regarding the student's progress through each 10-week block , outcomes of the major assessments and evaluations are provided to the coaches who mentor the student accordingly on a regular basis. In Stages 2 and 3, coaches continue to monitor progress, meet/ communicate with students as needed and meet regularly with students during specific periods (Kickoff, Homeweeks). Coaches participate in additional 136activities to support student growth and transition, such as Book Club, Mock Interviews, and Transition to Residency. Career Advising Students are introduced to Career Advising during the LAUNCH period and through mandatory programming during Stage 1 LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assessment Period) sessions. This programming utilizes information from the AAMC's Careers in Medicine (CiM) website to introduce students to various specialties. Components of the CiM curriculum are provided to students at regular intervals throughout Stages 1 and 2, and students are encouraged to discuss and share their career goals with their coaches. In addition to mandatory programming during Stage 1, students are encouraged to explore specialty options through ILOs (Independent Learning Opportunity), participation in interest groups, participation in research/quality improvement, and clinical shadowing *. During Stage 2, students are provided overviews of specialties at the start of each mandatory clerkship , and advice of what to do if they are interested in that clerkship's specialty. In addition, students have the opportunity for a 2 -week elective in addition to a longitudinal outpatient specialty exposure (CLIC- FLEX). There is a mandatory career fair during fall of their M3 year , which provides detailed specialty specific information from the application process through career options in that specialty . In the spring, the students select a lead career advisor to discuss and plan for Stage 3 rotations . If they are undecided , they are matched directly with the Director for Career Advising for ongoing meetings until they have decided on a specialty . This is in addition to continued optional exploration of specialty options through participation in interest groups, participation in research/quality improvement, and clinical shadowing. During Stage 3, in addition to participation in interest groups and shadowing, students have required sessions to further explore and refine their career interests , they have manda tory 1:1 sessions with Student Affairs. There are a variety of mandatory and optional meetings which cover application preparation, timeline to apply, personal statement and curriculum vitae review, and mock interviews. Durin g the spring of their M4 year, we host a town hall discussion for rank order list preparation, but also offer 1:1 meetings to discuss individual situations. We also host a virtual Q&A specialty -specific session with our alumni prior to the rank order list deadline. *The School of Medicine does not allow for clinical shadowing until after Jan 1 of their M1 year to ensure they have adjusted to the Stage 1 curriculum. Starting in the 2022- 23 academic year this will be shifted earlier - to after students have successfully completed Block A and LEAP A , allowing for additional shadow opportunities. 137 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.p. Residency Application Process The Residency Application Process is managed by the Office for Student Affairs. The process begins in the second half of third -year and continues until Match Day in March of fourth year. Application Residency programs generally provide two types of training experiences, designated as categorical or advanced. Programs that offer categorical experiences provide the entirety of the experience from the first year of graduate medical education to the end of the program. Programs that provide only advanced experiences begin in the second year of graduate medical education; thereby requiring the student apply for a preliminary or transitional year in addition to the advanced experience. Most programs use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) for application processing, including urology . Ophthalmology residency programs ( SF Match Program ) use the Central Application Service (CAS). There is a separate match in Canada. MPSE The MPSE is a document containing the student's academic record and is constructed by the Office for Student Affairs, and is part of each student's residency application. The MSPE may not be sent before October 1 . There are no exceptions , even for early Matches. Match There are several services that match applicants' and programs' preferences for each other to determine residency placements . The NRMP and the other specialty matching p rograms coordinate their timetables accordingly. Students are honor -bound to reject contracts for appointments directly from programs (aka - \"outside\" the match), as it is a violation of the NRMP agreement. Similarly, institutions and program directors are honor- bound not to entice students to accept contracts for appointments prematurely . ALL STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE NRMP TO THE MEDICAL STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE . The Office for Student Affairs and Registrar's office have the ability to make changes in a student's status with the match. A student may not do this directly on their own and must inform our offices so the appropriate notations in the NRMP database ar e made. 138 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.q. Procedures for Evaluation The Office of Assessment & Evaluation (OAE) is responsible for support in all areas of assessment, including evaluation of students, faculty , and courses/ clerkships, as well as examination support. Collection of Data The Office of Assessment & Evaluation collects student feedback on courses, faculty and resident teaching , as well as curricular and non -curricular programs and events . Feedback is solicited through evaluations, surveys, and focus groups. The OAE develops assessment materials with input from Course , Clerkship Directors, and Program Directors and disseminates these tools to students , staff, and faculty . Additionally, this office provides support for examination creation, administration , and reporting. Students are required to complete evaluations for each course in the curriculum. Additional required evaluations such as assessments of faculty, units, or residents are at the discretion of each individual course or clerkship. The Office of Assessment & Evaluation works with course administrators to ensure student participation in and timely completion of all required assessments. Narrative & Midpoint Feedback of Student Performance The OAE facilitates the collection of narrative data on students throughout the curriculum. Narrative evaluation, (both formative and summative) is required in courses and clerkships when feasible. Feasibility is based on extent of faculty contact with students and the usefulness of this feedback. All courses and clerkships in which there is adequate contact time to evaluate a student must implement a process for narrative feedback/comments that must be shared with the student. In addition, all courses/clerkships must conform with LCME guidelines for both formative and summative feedback. Any clerkship that meets for a minimum of four weeks must provide mid -point formative feedback, or shift feedback if applicable. Additional formative feedback may be appropriate at other points during the clerkship. If a student is at risk of failure in a course or clerkship, the Office of Student Affairs must be notified by the Course or Clerkship Director and written documentation must be pr ovided. Student Evaluation of Teaching & Educational Programming It is important that students participate in the evaluation of educational programming. Feedback and evaluation are integral to the process of self -directed learning across the career of a physician. To that end, and in compliance with accreditation standards, all students are required to evaluate all faculty, residents, fellows, and course content in a timely manner, adhering to due dates identified by the course, clerkship, or program. 139Failure to do so may result in any of the following consequences: 1. The course or clerkship director may choose to restrict a student from taking a final course exam until all required evaluations are completed. 2. The course or clerkship director may rest rict student access to grades associated with the course until all required evaluations are completed. 3. The OAE or course / clerkship leadership or administrators may choose to file a PIRT 4. The narrative evaluation may indicate that the student failed to com ply with the administrative requirement of feedback completion If the student fails to submit timely evaluations in a second course or clerkship, the course leadership may forward to PIRT and would typically prompt presentation before the AAC. Anonymity and Dissemination of Data Students are encouraged to complete evaluations with detailed and specific comments regarding the strengths/weaknesses of the course content, resident, or faculty member. Students are encouraged to provide constructive feedback. All data collected in the program is considered confidential unless otherwise specified and is treated as such by all individuals who have access to this information. Evaluation data is stored electronically whenever possible. List of student names: The OAE tracks student completion of evaluations. The office has the ability to track compliance while maintaining anonymity. Overall course assessment : Stage 1 : Overall course assessment data is sent to the Course Director, the Associate Dean for Med ical Education and Assessment, and the Dean. The Course Director, at his or her discretion may share this data with faculty involved in the course. Stage 2 and 3 : Summary evaluations are presented for rotations at their institution during annual site mee tings . Summaries are prepared to review site comparability, as well as strengths and areas for improvement for each clerkship at these sites. Individual faculty assessment: Assessment data of individual faculty members is sent to course directors to review the data, and they may choose to redact any unprofessional student comments. To protect anonymity of students, only evaluation summaries which have at least 3 responses should be disseminated to individual faculty. Faculty hav e the ability to independently access reports of evaluations completed on them once they reach 3 responses within a given course. The OAE provides support in assisting faculty in accessing and interpreting feedback reports. The OAE provides Department Cha irs with annual summaries of feedback for faculty in their department. Similarly, Program Directors are provided feedback for residents in their program twice annually. Department chairs and Residency Program Directors are expected to summarize 140the results and trends in an individual's teaching assessments for the purposes of annual merit reviews, chair's letters supporting promotion and tenure nominations, and in resident program feedback. The Senior Appointments and Promotions Committee (SAPC), Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs must have access to all feedback provided to faculty. The course leadership, chairs, site assistant deans and Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment and the Dean must have access to all evaluations for faculty who report to them. The results of an individual's teaching assessments may not be released for any other purpose without the consent of the resident or faculty member. Feedback is immediately reviewed if a score of \"1\" or \"2\" is recorded on an evaluation. The Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment notifies the Program Director and provides additional data as required. If a Course or Clerkship Director has concerns regarding professiona lism of a resident or faculty member prompted by a student evaluation that he/she feels should be addressed, he/she must first discuss these concerns with the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, the Associate Dean for Clinical Medical Educ ation, and/or the Associate Dean for GME . In egregious cases, the Dean of the School of Medicine will be informed. Department Chairs, Program Directors, and Course and Clerkship Directors may be contacted with individual evaluation data for faculty or res idents on an ad hoc basis when egregious feedback is received, even if there are less than 3 respondents for that individual. In these instances, the OAE will make every effort to work with departments to ensure student anonymity to the greatest extent pos sible while rectifying issues or behaviors requiring immediate response. In all cases, the anonymity of the student is a primary concern and must be respected whenever possible. There must be no disclosure of the author of individual evaluations with only one exception: serious unprofessional comments made by the student as determined by OAE or if there is a concern for the safety and wellbeing of a student, patient or faculty . Students are encouraged to provide constructive feedback. Guidelines on h ow to provide constructive feedback can be provided by the Course Director or Associate Dean for Student Affairs. 141 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.r. Poli cy on Teaching and Eva luation by Medical School Administration Medical School Administrators participate in varying degrees in the education of medical students. Clinical and classroom teaching and thus evaluation by administrators is encouraged. However, t o prevent any conflict of intere st that can occu r when stud ents learn from an d are assessed by memb ers of the med ical s chool a dmin istration, the following policy has been created to provide the necessary framework . Membe rs of the medical sch ool admin istration include, but are not lim ited to: Dean of the Medical School Asso ciate Dean of Student Affairs Associate Dean of Health Career Opportunity Programs Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment Associate Dean for Clinical Medical Student Education Assistant Dean for Pre -clerkship Medical Education Assistant Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs Guidelines : In general, faculty administrators who teach are allowed to evaluate students. However, these faculty must disclose their role and provide students an opportunity to \"opt out\" of small group configurations . Student s may request an \"opt out\" with a clear reason by discussing with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, the Course or Clerkship Director, the Stage 1 or Stage 2/3 Director, or other Associate Dean in the School of Medicine. Faculty who are members of the AAC have privilege to student information beyond that of course and clerkship directors and student advisors. These faculty must use their discretion, as well as recuse themselves from any binding vote of the AAC when they are current direct evalua tors of a particular student in question. The Directo r and physicians o f Student Heal th and the D irector an d physicians of St udent Mental Health Services a dditionally are not allowed to supervise studen ts with whom they have a clinical relationship with during any clinical rotation, not allowe d to te ach these studen ts in any sm all grou p sessions o r act ivities, not allow ed to partici pate in the assessment or ev aluation o f these students' performance and will not be allowed to serve on the AAC. (Also see policy 2.d.) Ad visors, Coaches, Course Directors, and Clerkship Directors may participate in education of students. In general , academic advisors and coaches should not be involved in grading or evaluation of students and will be required to complete an attestation to this effect. In some instances, t here are committee decisions for final determination of all final course grades . If there is a perceived conflict , in any situation, the faculty member must recuse themself from any discussions. 142 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 4.s. Classroom Scheduling The SOM Office of Curricular Affairs oversees the scheduling of School of Medicine educational and academic activities including UME curricular scheduling across all four years of course work, select Graduate school courses , Dental, GME and CME courses or activities that occur in our academic educational space . The academic educational space includes our academic classrooms, the Academic Rotunda, and Massey Auditorium. The SOM Office of Curricular Affairs coordinates scheduling with the Dental School and the Graduate School to ensure all requests are treated equally. The academic classrooms scheduled by the Central Office and the Dental School are delineated below. The priority use of the Academic Rotunda, Massey A uditorium , and classrooms are for the SOM (including the Graduate School) and SoDM undergraduate curricular courses and academic activities . When the academic c lassrooms are not in use for specified course activities , they are utilized as ad hoc student study classrooms. Any Academic Rotunda, Massey A uditorium, or classroom reservation request that is not identified as a SOM, Graduate School or SoDM curricular, educational, or academic activity is subject to approval and referral to Facilities for scheduling and fee structure. Academic Space Scheduling All undergraduate SOM and SoDM curriculum scheduling for course s that would like to utilize the Academic Rotunda, Massey A uditorium, and classrooms are required to request their reservations to the SOM Curricular Affairs Office 6 months prior to the start of classes . This will not guarantee specific classroom or educational space availability and therefore we encourage scheduling as far in advance as possible , however the SOM Curricular Affairs Office will accommodate any and all curriculum requirements based on available space and needs to ensure that all curriculum courses have scheduled rooms . Any request that is submitted after this time will be considered only if classrooms or other educational space are available and the request does not conflict with those submitted on time. The S OM faculty, course /clerkship administrators will work directly with the SOM Curricular Affairs Office to schedule their classroom or educational space needs for any SOM courses or clerkships. The undergraduate SoDM faculty and course administrators will work directly with their central dental curriculum coordinator (860 -679-3211) in SoDM to schedule their educational space needs. The dental curriculum coordinator will reach out to the SOM Curricular Affairs Office on any request that requires the use of additional educational space and will facilitate scheduling of the additional rooms . Graduate School faculty, GME, CME, and students can contact the SOM Curricular Affairs Office directly. 143The SOM Office of Curricular Affairs Contact Information for Reservations The SOM uses institutional software for scheduling of the academic educational space . If a request for educational space is not part of a course schedule or academic event , all educational space requests must be made in writing using our online request form provided below. Questions please email home@uchc.edu . Academic Classroom Online Request Form (excluding Rotunda ) Rotunda ONLY Request Form Academic Rotunda Non- Academic Event Guidelines EMS Room Scheduling Users Guide Room Cancellation Form To view the live schedule , navigate to https://health.uconn.edu/park/room -scheduling/ and click on the link titled Room Scheduling Calendar located in the Room Scheduling menu on the right side of the page. Classroom Conflict Resolution Process Occasionally, a conflict will arise due to limited space. The undergraduate SOM and SoDM course s take precedence over clinical department meetings, clinical department's residency and fellowship activities, and any other outside groups and meetings. In the event that there is a conflict between two undergraduate courses in the medical or dental scho ols, both course/clerkship directors will be contacted. If a resolution becomes difficult, the issue will be reviewed by the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment in the SOM conferring with dental school leadership as necessary , and a decision will be brought to both parties. When a n undergraduate SOM or SoDM course activity is not scheduled and/ or denied it will be entered into a database for tracking including the name of the activity; the school or requester ; date/time of request; actions for resolution; and reason for denial. Academic Classroom Bumping The courses in the undergraduate SOM and SoDM curriculum take precedence over other academic events and non- curricular users. At times, it will be necessary to move previously scheduled activities for unforeseen events and /or for high stakes examinations. The SOM Curricular Affairs Office will contact the classroom requester with adequate notification and suitable relocat ion to be provided. Non -Academic Internal Request (During School Hours and Non- School Hours) A non -academic internal request is any request made by UConn Health person nel to schedule an activity in an academic educational space outside of the undergraduate SOM or SoDM curriculum or academic realm. As stated, undergraduate SOM and SoDM curriculum activities takes precedence along with other academic events ; all non-undergraduate SOM and SoDM requests wi ll be referred to the Director of Parking and Transportation Services with the appropriate forms completed by the requestor and with applicable charges. 144All non-academic activities will be entered into a database for tracking including the name of the activity; the contact person/ requester ; the school or department that the activity is associated with; date/time of request; actions for resolution if applicable; and reason for denial if applicable. External/Community/Outside Classroom Requests (During School Hours and Non- School Hours) An \"outside\" activity is defined as a request that is not part of the University or not sponsored by a department at the University . UConn Health space requests, including classroom space by external requesters will be referred to the Director of Parking and Transportation Services with appropriate forms completed and with applicable charges. Refer to UC HC policy #2002-50 . Event Set up & Parking Needs The event requester or SOM or SoDM course coordinator is responsible to coordinate directly with UConn Health Parking, Transportation and Events Services for additional room set up that is not the standard set up in the academic educational space. The requester will have to submit a request to facilities and will need to provide their coding for any charges associated with additional set up requirements. The requestor must ensure that the room is returned to its original set up following use. Any event that invites participants outside of UConn Health requires advance notice and approval from the Parking, Transportation and Events Office . The event requester or SOM or SoDM course coordinator must obtain approval for parking prior to classrooms being res erved. For more information regarding parking, please contact the parking at: parking.transportation@uchc.edu . AV and Technical Support Audio and Visual support is provided by the institution for all academic educational space. It is the requester's or course administrator's responsi bility to directly make the appropriate arrangements for their audio -visual needs in any academic educational space (this is not the responsibility of the SOM Curricular Affairs Office Room Scheduler) . Questions for AV support can be referred : Academic Space: Academic Information Technology Services Non -Academic Space: Parkin g, Transportation and Events Services Academic Space scheduled by the SOM Office of Curricular Affairs Academic Rotunda (E10 -01) Academic Lobby Human Anatomy Lab (HAL) (AM006) Prosection Room (AM00 7) Learning Center 1, 2, and 3 Special Classroom (AM -046A) Walker Conference Room (AG -070) Testing and Training Computer Center Room 1 (T2C2 -1) - Room # LB044 Testing and Training Computer Center Room 2 (T2C2 -2) - Room # LB042 *Classr ooms A1 and A8 are reserved for priority scheduling for the graduate school courses.

Advancement decisions must be approved by the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC), which monitors student performance across all academic competencies, including professionalism, throughout all stages of the curriculum. The AAC assesses students' satisfactory academic progress periodically (see policy 4.a. ) and evaluates any chan ges to good academic standing (s ee policy 4.b.). The AAC is the only committee that has access to a student's entire academic record and its role includes advocating for the future patients of our students. Students may appeal grading decisions. They may also appeal promotion, remediation, and disciplinary decisions of the AAC. For more information on appeals processes see policies 5.e. and 5.g. Policies included in this Policy 5.c.2.

Course and Section Place Outs 147 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.a. MSPE Procedural Description The Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), formally the Dean's Letter, is a structured, narrative academic summary . All students who enter UConn SOM will have a MSPE, either upon entry to Year 4 (even if not planning residency) or upon withdrawal or dismissal. As such it is not a letter of recommendation, but a compilation of evaluations. The MSPE is a mandatory component of all residency applications. It includes an assessment of a student's academic performance, as well as their professional characteristics. The MSPE is compiled after the end of Stage 2 and, generally , in conjunction with a face -to-face meeting with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Faculty Co -Directors of Student Affairs . The face -to-face meeting provides an opportunity for students to review the overall structure of the MSPE as well as the residency application process, from the application submission process to the Match. Stage 3 evaluation narratives are not included. The structure of the MSPE is prescribed. It includes the following sections: Identifying Information o Student's legal name and year in school o Name and location of the medical school Noteworthy Characteristics o Bulleted list of a maximum of three noteworthy characteristics Academic History o Date of matriculation and expected graduation from medical school o Explanation of any extensions, leaves, gaps, or breaks o Information on dual or combined degree programs o Repeated or remediated coursework o Adverse actions Academic Progress o Summary of performance in the preclinical curriculum o Summaries of narrative evaluations from Stage 2 clinical rotations o Attainment of professional standards o Graphic representations of students' comparative performance Summary o Includes comparative data on each student's performance Medical School Information o Programmatic emphases, strengths, mission, or goals of the medical school o Description of the evaluation sys tem used by the medical school o Statement regarding a student's successful completion of USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 148 As reviewed elsewhere in this document, the grading system in Stage 1 is pass/fail. In Stage 2 and 3 a third assessment of honors is added to the pass/fail structure. The comparative data in the MSPE includes honors from third -year clinical rotations as well as honors awards earned through participation in professional extracurricular activities. The inclusion of professional honors in the assessment of students is consistent with the emphasis placed on volunteerism, service -learning, humanism, and professionalism as necessary components of medical education. At the end of Stage 2 students are invited to submit details of the extracurricular activities in two of the three categories below : Leadership Scholarship Service Decisions on honors awards are made by a committee of faculty . The review of submissions is conducted with set criteria and in an anonymous fashion . Changes to the MSPE: In general once submitted to ERAS in the fall of the fourth year, the MSPE is final. Upon request, the Registrar when sending the MSPE can put a memo with the date of graduation. The MSPE will be changed for any of the following: 1. Significant external awar d 2. Notation of AOA 3. Any disciplinary action or remediation action 4. Any requirement of the AAC All students who enter UConn SOM will have a MSPE, either upon entry to Year 4 (even if not planning residency) or upon withdrawal or dismissal. 149 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.b. Grading Systems Students shall be assigned a grade for each course in the curriculum. The following grades can be assigned: P Pass F Fail C Conditional (additional course work required) C/P Conditional Pass (additional course work completed) F/P Successful Pass after Remediation H Honors E Exempt A Audit IP Course in progress, may span full year - grade to be posted at year end NR No grade reported S Satisfactory I Incomplete U Unsatisfactory W/C Withdrawn with concern W/F Withdrawn while failing W/P Withdrawn while passing See policy 4.c. for Withdrawal Policy Incomplete Grades An incomplete can only be used to signify a break from the curriculum approved by the School of Medicine. If additional work is to be completed, or remediation is required, then a grade of C or F is appropriate. Remedial work completed successfully is repre sented by a \"C/P\" or \"F/P.\" If a student fails and repeats in another academic year, the F will remain and the new grade will appear in the Academic Year taken. Course grade s become part of the student's official transcript. Honors f or Clinical Disciplines In addition to grades in the clerkships of Stage 2, students may receive an honors designation in the following clinical disciplines: Family Medicine Internal Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology Pediatrics Psychiatry Surgery Neurology Radiology 150 Students may also earn an honors designation in each core clerkship in Stage 3. These clerkship s include: Emergency Medicine Critical Care Advanced Inpatient (sub -I) Each discipline/experience shall develop specific criteria for stu dent performance evaluation, and how these criteria will be used to determine the awarding of honors. The criteria must include evaluation of performance across all activities related to the discipline/experience. These criteria shall be made available in writing to all students at the beginning of each clerkship . Honors will be awarded to all students meeting the criteria. Honors will be determined after each rotation and reported within six weeks after the end of the clerkship with the exception of Int ernal Medicine and Pediatrics. These t wo disciplines in Stage 2 require completion of both the ambulatory and inpatient components, and Honors is awarded as discipline Honors. Special Note: During the COVID period, clerkships experiencing suspended clinic al activity or hybrid experiences, will not award Honors. COVID affected courses will be notated on transcripts. 151 Academic Policies and Procedure s Manual 5.c. Course/Clerkship Grading and Grading Committees (CGCs) General Statement about Faculty Evaluating Students Faculty are required to complete an attestation that there is no conflict of interest in evaluating or grading students related to involvement in stude nt's healthcare. See p olicy 2.d . Behavioral Health Services, Health Services and Student Wellness . Additionally, there is policy allowing faculty administrators to evaluate students with disclosure, as well as policy preventing coaches from evaluating students (4.r.). Stage 1 The grading policy within each course will be determined by a program or course policy com mittee. Based on the individual course policy, the Course Grading Committee (CGC) will review student scores after each LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assessment Period) and assign the final grade. Determination of the final grade shall be done without the identity of students being known to the committee. After grades have been assigned, student identity may be revealed to the CGC. Grades are forwarded to the AAC. Grades will be provided to the Program/ Clinical Foundations Director(s), Course Director(s), the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment. Additionally, exam scores and final grades are posted in Oasis and may be accessed by the student's coach. In those courses in which dental students are enrolled, scores will also be provided to the Associate Dean for Education in the Dental School. Stage 1 Grading Committees: The course grading committee (CGC) for each course is provided with all pertinent academic performance assessments, including grade statistics and narratives in a blinded fashion. The CGC recommends courses of action on all issues concerning grading and re mediation. The Course Director is responsible for assigning and submitting a grade recommendation for every student in the course to the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment and the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC). These recommendations are then ratified by the AAC. Any recommendation for a grade of conditional or fail, along with any recommendation for remediation and/or course repeat must also be presented to the AAC, which can endorse the plan or can make it more stringent. The AAC cannot make the recommendation less onerous than that suggested by CGC. If the student accepts the plan, the decision of the AAC will be put into effect (see 5.d. AAC and 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships ). Various rules go vern appeals and the appeals process (see 5.g. Rules Concerning Appeals to AAC and SEARC ). Composition of the CGC The CGC consists of voting and non- voting members. A minimum of 3 voting members (the chair and 2 additional voting members) are required at each meeting, and of the voting members present, a simple majority rules. 152The following individuals will be invited to attend the grading session, and shall constitute the CGC: Voting: o Chair: Course Director (i.e. Stage Director or Course Director as appropriate) o Course and Thread Leaders o Other faculty involved in the course as designated by the Course Director; MDelta curriculum requires two content experts Non -Voting o Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment o Associate Dean for Student Affairs o Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs For those courses in which dental students are enrolled, the appropriate deans from the School of Dental Medicine and/or their designees may also sit on the comm ittee as a non -voting member(s) Grading Procedure Students matriculating in 2016 to present (MDelta ) Students will be assessed at the end of each block during LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assessment Period). The Block Assessment Review Committee (BARC) reviews student performance on the high -stakes assessment as well as course performance and determines options for any student who does not meet passing criteria. If warranted and permitted by BARC, a re -assessment occurs at the end of L EAP. Any course with a marginal or egregious fail not deemed appropriate for immediate re -assessment may be granted a \"C\" Conditional grade or \"F\" Fail grade. If a student is provided the opportunity for re -assessment and is successful, the CGC reviews th e results and may assign a passing grade. If the re -assessment is not successful, the student is assigned a \"C\" or \"F\" for the course. Recommendations for summer remediation or for the repeat of a course will be forwarded from the CGC to the AAC. The polic y committee for each course will determine appropriate rubrics , which may include \"F\" for an egregious fail or for a failure of professionalism. The CGC for each course meets at the conclusion of LEAP. Failure of the Professionalism component of any cours e may result in an overall Failure of the course. Exceptions to this policy that would result in a Conditional grade may be considered by the CGC in exceptional circumstances, including where the violations were minor or when the student did not receive f eedback on the unprofessional behavior. A PIRT should be submitted after discussion with the student. See policy 3.a. Code of Professionalism Conduct for Medical Students. CGC Process: The CGC reviews course results blinded of student identification. After all grades are assigned by the CGC, the students are identified. Following this, the committee may reconsider the grade of any student. A majority vote of the voting membership is required to reconsider a student's grade. After all grades are finalized, the CGC shall recommend remediation programs for all students receiving \"incomplete\" or Conditional or Failing grades. Students who are repeating the year, or returning from a leave of absence are graded separately. The CGC is provided with their in itial and repeating year's course performance, and a grade is assigned by a simple majority vote of the CGC. Awarding of grades to repeating students is not done 153anonymously. The students will be notified in writing with a letter from the Course Director and the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment . All grades AND remediation programs for all students must be reviewed and approved by the AAC prior to initiation of the remediation. The AAC will have access to the entire student record, wh ich is not available to the CGC. The student will have 7 days after being informed of the decision by the AAC (one week from the time the email with the letter is sent, 8 a.m. on the 7 th day) to appeal the decision , see 5.g . Rules Concerning Appeals to AAC or to SEARC . Phase 2/3 (and Stage 2/3) Grading Committees: Oversight of grading policy, including honors criteria sits with the Clerkship Committee, which accepts recommendation s on policy from the individual departmental representatives (Clerkship D irectors and/or Departmental faculty/Chair/ Site Directors). The Clerkship Director is responsible for assigning and submitting a grade recommendation for every student in each rotation into the Oasis system . Any conditional or failing grade is immediately referr ed to the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC). Clerkship Directors in Stage 2 post Honors grades after each rotation, except for Pediatrics and Medicine. In these disciplines, both the ambulatory and inpatient rotation must be completed before a grade is assigned to the discipline. Clerkships must submit final grades, including Honors decisions within 6 weeks of the last day of the rotation. A Departmental Grading Co mmittee (DGC) may be convened if a student has a failing clinical performance, fails or performs poorly on an examination or other non -clinical assessment, or fails the professionalism component of the clerkship to assist the Clerkship Director (CD) in final grade determination . The DGC is chaired by the CD, and may include Site Directors and teaching faculty within the discipline with preferably at least three faculty comprising the DGC . This committee is responsible for remediation recommendations and implementation. The CD may convene the committee to assist in grade determination as necessary. The Clerkship Director may also report any student struggling in the clinical setting and those who perform poorly on an examination to the Clerkship Committe e after consultation with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs according to the process defined in the Forward Feeding Policy (5.h .). The Clerkship Committee may assist in creating recommendations for any necessary remediation. In the event that a grade is in dispute, whether related to passing , honors or professionalism, the student must first discuss the dispute with the Clerkship Director within two weeks of the posting of the grade. If the Clerkship Director upholds the grade , then the student can appeal as delineated in policy 5.e . 154Composition of the D GC The DGC is an ad- hoc committee. The DGC consists of voting and non- voting members. A minimum of 3 voting members (the chair and 2 additional voting members) as well as at least 1 non-voting member are required at each meeting, and of the voting members present, a simple majority rules. The following individuals will be invited to attend the grading session, and shall constitute the DGC: Voting o Chair: Clerkship Director o Site Director and/or faculty representatives At least one of the following n on-voting individuals must attend: o Associate Dean for Student Affairs o Associate Dean for Clinical Medical Education or designee o Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment Professionalism Failure of the Professionalism component of any course or clerkship may result in an overall Failure of the clerkship. A score of \"1\" or \"2\" in a professionalism category on the final evaluation requires the clerkship director to gather additional information from the site , discuss with the student, and then to submit a PIRT. A passing or c onditional grade may be considered by the DGC in circumstances, including where the violations were minor or when the student did not receive feedback on the unprofessional behavior. See policy 3.a. Code of Professionalism Conduct for Medical Students. Remediation Reporting Process (All Stages) Students will receive a letter indicating the decision of the CGC or DGC. Course grade and remediation program recommendations are forwarded to the Academic Advancement Committee. The AAC either accepts or adds additional recommendations or disciplinary ac tions to the CGC /DGC decision; the AAC will not make the decision more lenient. Following remediation decisions of the Academic Advancement Committee, the Chair of AAC and the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs notifies the students, in writing. For students awarded either a U, F, C or I, specific details regarding remediation and/or completing unfinished work are also provided. Dental student grades are forwarded to the Academic Performance Committee in the School of Dental Medicine. Remediation Programs (All Stages) Remediation programs are tailored to meet the specific academic needs of the student. A remediation program may include, but is not limited to: (1) participation in and passing summer course(s) either at UConn or other institutions, (2) independent study and passing an examination(s) covering specific portions and sections of the course (note: remediation examinations are not limited to material covered on course examinations failed by the student) (3) independent study and passing a comprehensive examination or (4) additional clinical time in clerkships . 155The CGC/DGC shall specify the remediation program requirements, the manner in which the requirements shall be met by the student. The student's performance will be reviewed by the AAC in order to determine the final remediation program. The AAC may accept the recommendations of the CGC /DGC or, because of their knowledge of the student's entire academic performance, may require a remediation that is stricter than that recommended by the CGC /DGC or may apply a disciplinary action (e.g. dismissal) . The AAC will determine the deadline for completion of the requirements . In the event the student does not satisfactorily complete the remediation program requirements, the CGC /DGC shall recommend to the Academic Advancement Committee a final course grade, and/or additional requirements. Because the remediation programs are individualized, the CGC /DGC may use criteria to assess student performance in a remediation program, which are different from those used to assign course grades but the goals and objectives of the course remain the same . It is the student's responsibility to ensure that preparation and remediation has occurred prior to completing any assessments and, if there are any issues related to faculty or curricular support, they should be brought to Student Affairs for resolution. 156 Academic Policies and Proced ures Manual 5.c.1. Clerkship Grading and Evaluation Policy Clerkship grading and evaluation is described in policy 5.c. While each clerkship discipline determines policy for evaluating performance, clerkships abide by the following overall framework . Students must receive formative feedback during their rotations. Any student who receives more than one final assessm ent of 1 or 2 in any evaluation (sub -competency or medical knowledge) must have their performance reviewed by the clerkship director . If confirmed , then the student is ineligible to receive an initial passing grade. Rating of a 2 on the final evaluation form in any competency or subcompetency indicates the student is marginal but does NOT meet expectations in that area. Formative feedback is required at any point in a rotation when a deficiency is noted. A grade of C or F grade for clinical performance and/or professionalism must be preceded by formative feedback , as well as a chance for improvement that is documented in writing and forwarded to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Please see rubric on the next page. 157 Clerkship Grading and Evaluation Rubric Student passes exam and received all 3's or better on all evaluation sub -competencies Final Grade = Pass or Honors (if applicable) Student passes exam but receives at least one 1 or 2 on evaluation sub -competencies* Student receives one score of 1 or 2 on evaluation Student meets with Clerkship Director Final Grade = P or CP Student receives more than one score of 1 or 2 on evaluation If confirmed by Clerkship Director, with or without CGC (Course Grading Committee) input, a student receives a C (Conditional) Grade.

NOTE: 1.The AAC may require the student to remediate any exam/shelf failure prior to taking the next exam/shelf. This is typically the case once the AAC is notified of a second exam failure in a different clerkship. 2. The MSPE will always accurately reflect the complete academic history. 159 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.d. Academic Advancement Committee Scope The Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) certifies that the performance of each student is adequate in all Stages of the curriculum and oversees promotion, remediation and disciplinary action. The AAC certifies that students are making satisfactory academic progress and promotes them between Stages of the curriculum once students have successfully completed all requ irements. The AAC certifies students for the match, and, ultimately, certifies students qualified to receive the M.D. degree for graduation. The AAC is the only committee that has access to the student's entire academic record and its role includes advoc ating for the future patients of the student. All decisions related to unsatisfactory performance of a student by the CGC/DGC are forwarded to the AAC. The AAC will review all remediation plans proposed by the CGC/DGC for all C and F grades in light of t he student's entire record and will approve proceeding with remediation or edit the plan based on the student's history. As such, any plans for remediation or repeat course work will be reviewed and finalized by the AAC in the context of the student's ove rall academic record. The AAC is responsible for determining appropriate disciplinary action against students related to all academic graduation competencies, including those related to professionalism. It addresses issues that arise outside of a single course including any actions outside of UConn that would reflect on the UConn Health community or may affect the student's ability to perform as a physician. The AAC reviews the record of and discusses any student at UConn SOM whose performance in the cur riculum or actions outside the curriculum requires a decision regarding whether the student should continue their plan of study. This includes failure to pass any course or clerkship, USMLE failures, referral from one of the professionalism investigative bodies (Honor Board, PRB, or PIRT), request to return from a leave of absence, or notification of law enforcement action. Once a student has been discussed by the AAC, they remain under the purview of the AAC until graduation. The AAC also serves as a h earing body for various appeals within the SOM. Such appeals processes are discussed in policies 5.e and 5.g. When necessary, the AAC will recommend suspension or dismissal from the School of Medicine. 160Membership Voting members of the AAC and its Chair are appointed by the Dean and serve up to two 4 -year terms. Voting: o Chair o 4 Clinical Faculty o 4 Basic Science Faculty Non -Voting: o Director of Academic Educational Affairs (Dean's Liaison) o Associate Dean for Student Affairs o Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment o Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs o Director of the MD/PhD program o Co-Chair of the PRB Information Available to the Committee The AAC is mandated to have comprehensive information on a student's performance in order to fulfill its duties. The following are examples of typical sources of information that can be made available to committee members when reviewing the performance or behavior of a given student. A. Student School of Medicine file (performance evaluations and all appeal information) B. Student Admissions File C. Course Performance D. Fitness for duty evaluation and any administrative evaluations E. Recommendations/investigation from the Honor Board F. Recommendations/investigation from the Professionalism Review Board G. Reports of misconduct H. Academic and administrative files from external educational experiences I. Police reports All information will be made available to the committee members on either a secure site or by secure email prior to the meetings, with the exception of emergency meetings. Committee members must comply with Family Education Rights Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations and use the posted information only to perform duties of the AAC. Committee Decisions Decisions of the AAC are based on a simple majority of the voting members present at the meeting. The AAC makes no decisions unless a majority of the voting members are present. The AAC shall render one of the following decisions: Graduation: The committee shall ce rtify that students have met the requirements to receive the M.D. degree. 161Promotion: The committee shall determine which students have met the requirements to proceed into the next Phase/ Stage of the curriculum. Students who have successfully met all academic competencies for the Phase/ Stage shall be promoted to the next Phase/Stage of the curriculum. Students failing any course cannot be promoted until satisfactory performance is demonstra ted. Satisfactory Academic Progress: To be determined at the end of each academic year as described in the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy (See policy 4.a.). Students who have successfully met all academic competencies for the Phase/ Stage shall be certified to continue in the curriculum. The AAC will also determine good standing, academic warning and academic watch status. (See policy 4.b.) Disciplinary and/or Remedial Action: The committee may take the following actions against students with deficiencies in any academic competency, including the domain of professionalism and will identify the action as disciplinary or remedial. Typically, the first time the AAC assigns a student to remediate for knowledge and skills, the remediation is not consi dered disciplinary. Repeat remediations and/or requirements related to behavior and/or professionalism may result in remedial and/or disciplinary actions: (1) Set specific curriculum requirements and performance criteria; (2) Mandate medical, psychological or other appropriate evaluations; (3) Impose an administrative Leave of Absence (LOA), or other type of LOA; (4) Issue a reprimand or other disciplinary action, such as a disciplinary notation in the MSPE; (5) Place the student on Academic Watch or Academic Warning (both internal designations, see policy 4.b.); (6) Suspend a student; a suspension indicates the student is out of school and ineligible to participate in any course, any clinical activity or any school -sponsored extracurricular activity. A student who is suspended may or may not be able to retain their badge and email, at the discretion of the Dean for Student Affairs and/or the AAC. A suspended student may not represent themself as a current SOM student. It is the student's responsibility to communicate this status change to all auxiliary parties as necessary; (7) Dismiss the student from the school. A dismissed student is one who has been discharged from all affiliation with the SOM. They lose all rights and privileges given to students including but not limited to student email and identification. A dismissed student may not represent themself as a current SOM student. It is the student's responsibility to communicate this status change to all auxiliary parties as necessary. The Office of Academic Affairs notifies the student of the AAC's decision in writing. Student Appeals The student may submit an appeal of the decision of the AAC within seven days of receipt of written notification of the AAC action (see 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships and 5.g. Rules Concerning Appeals to AAC or SEARC). Frivolous appeals could 162result in documentation in the permanent record of unprofessional actions. Students may not appeal to individual faculty within a course or clerkship as that is considered unprofessional and would be referred back to the AAC for further discussion/review. Advancement to Phase/Stage 2: Students matriculating in 2013 -2015: Students who have completed their academic requirements for Phase 1, but have not yet taken their USMLE Step 1 examination, will be conditionally advanced to Phase 2 but cannot begin clinical rotations until sitting for this examination. Students may not sit for Step 1 if they have any conditional (C) or failure (F) grades until successful remediation is confirmed or unless the student requests an exception from the AAC and the AAC approves. Students matriculating in 2016 and beyond: Students who have completed their academic requirements for Stage 1 will be certified to continue into Stage 2. Students may not take Step 1 with pending C or F grades in Stage 1. Transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3 UConn SOM's policy on transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3 is intended to be flexible in order to allow individualization of students' progress through the curriculum. Under certain circumstances, students may opt to take specific Stage 3 rotations or electives or to do an elective at another institution before completing all Stage 2 required clerkships and after having completed appropriate prerequisites for the specific Stage 3 experience. Students who request to make such adjustments are expected to submit a written request to the AAC for approv al at least 30 days in advance of the clerkship/rotation . The Stage 2 & 3 Operational Committee (Clerkship Committee) establishes procedures for identifying required prerequisites for Stage 3 experiences. 163 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships Grading Standardization of Grading Procedures Across the Curriculum Course Grading Committees will determine final grades in Stage 1 . Clerkship Directors determine and post final grades in each clerkship based on defined rubrics. A Departmental Grading Committee is convened in any situation where decision making input is needed for an individual student. Each course/ clerkship must define and publish what each type of grade represents with identification of any thresholds and parameters. Once determined, grades are posted in Oasis. Submission of grades are expected within 14 calendar days but are required no later tha n 35 calendar days after the end of the course/clerkship . The AAC will review all grades other than a Pass or Honor s. Any student receiving a grade other than a P or H via OASIS must await the AAC's ratification by official written notification of the final grade and remediation plan. Once the AAC has ratified the grade, it is possible for the student to appeal An appeal of a P grade (for H) does not require AAC ratification Appeals Appeals Process for Grades Appealing C grade for P Appealing P grade for H Appealing F grade First Level of Appeal - Standing Course and Clerkship Appeals Committee ( SCCAC) Membership Voting (5 of the following 8 will be used for each appeal, the remaining 3 are alternates) o 5 Clinical Faculty (without prominent roles in required clerkships) o 3 Basic Science Faculty (without prominent roles in required courses) o 1 ad -hoc Dental Faculty (if dental student appealing) Non -Voting o Associate Dean for Student Affairs o 1 UME curricular Dean (Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, Assistant Dean for Pre -Clerkship Education, or Ass ociate Dean for Clinical Medical Education) o Associate Dean for the Health Career Opportunity Programs 164Process Before appealing a grade, students must have first discussed the grade with the Course/Clerkship Director (CD) to review the grading process and accuracy of the grade. All students will then have the right to appeal the grade to a five person Standing Course and Clerkship Appeals Committee (SCCAC). The request for an appeal must be su bmitted in writing to the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment within 7 calendar days of the decision by the CD and/or Departmental Grading Committee or notification of AAC (Academic Advancement Committee) ratification of the grade (C, F). The scope of the appeal is limited to the grade alone. Appeals for C and F grades by the SCCAC will be held, as necessary, throughout the year. Appeals for Honors will only be heard twice a year. Any meeting of the SCCAC will have five members invited. A quorum is 3 members, simple majority needed for a passing vote. There must be appropriate distribution for any given appeal as determined by the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. This com mittee will have the authority to grant or deny the appeal. The remediation plan will not be considered by the SCCAC. See policy 5.g for appeals of remediation and/or repeating courses or year. Second Level of Appeal - AAC If the SCCAC denies the appeal, the student has a second and last level of appeal to the AAC. Criteria for this second level of appeal will be to present new information or to contest compliance with published processes and procedures. In this context the AAC will make a decision regarding the grade alone. This appeal request must be submitted to the Director of Academic Educational Affairs (Dean's Liaison) within 7 calendar days of notification of the SCCAC's decision. The requirement for appeal request is for submis sion within 7 days from grade notification , or in the case for Honors appeal , within the timeframe provided at notification, usually to include time to discuss with Clerkship Director before submission. Summary of Grade Appeals Processes: A Standing Appeals Committee (SCCAC) will serve as the first level of appeal for grading issues The AAC would be the second level of appeal for grading issues , which is the final level of appeal for grading issues . Grade awarded by Course/Clerkship Grading Committee (other than a P or H)Grade Ratified by AAC Appeal to SCCAC Appeal to AAC (for reasons of process or new information ONLY) 165 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.f. Student Evaluation and Appeals Review Committee (SEARC) The Student Evaluation and Appeals Review Committee (SEARC) reviews student appeals related to remediation, promotion, dismissal, which have already had an AAC Appeal (see 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships ). There are various rules governing appeals (see 5.g. Rules Concerning Appeals) . The SEARC is advisory to the Dean. SEARC Membership The SEARC is a standing committee appointed by the Dean and meets ad -hoc when an appeal to an AAC decision regarding remediation, promotion or dismissal arises . Quorum is the presence of 7 vo ting members (Chair + 6 voting members) and passing is simple majority. - Voting: o Chair o 5 Clinical Faculty o 5 Basic Science Faculty - Non -voting : o Director of Academic Educational Affairs (Dean's Liaison) o Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment o Associate Dean for Student Affairs o Associate Dean for Health Career Opportunity Programs The Appeal Process Within 7 calendar days after receipt of written notification of the AAC Appeal decision , the student may submit a request for review to the Director of Academic Educational Affairs (Dean's Liaison) . The request must be in writing, must detail specific reasons why the student requests a review of the AAC's decision , must provide supporting documentation of this request , and must include faculty members or others with direct knowledge of the issue that the student will be asking to speak on their behalf. Requests for appeals must meet the following criteria : 1. Presentation of ev idence that was not available to the AAC when they made the initial appeal decision 2. Presentation of evidence that the process was not adhered to Frivolous appeals could result in documentation in a student's permanent record and/or a notation on the MSPE. The Director of Academic Educational Affairs (Dean's Liaison) will t hen either consult with the Chair of AAC or call together a three -person ad hoc review committee who will determine whether or not the appeal will be heard. Participation in the ad hoc review committee will be at the discretion of the Dean . 166If the appea l is allowed to proceed, it will be heard by SEARC. The Director of Academic Educational Affairs shall communicate to the student the names of the SEARC membership. The student then has 48 hours to submit to the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs up to two written challenges -for-cause to the SEARC's membership. The approved members will be provided with copies of the review request, and relevant background material, supplied by the staff in the Office of Academic Educational Affairs . Th e Chair of SEARC shall set a date and place for the review hearing. The Chair of SEARC and at least six (6) members must be able to attend the hearing. The staff in the Office of Academic Educational Affairs shall prepare minutes of the meeting, and issue all correspondence related to the review hearing. It is the student's responsibility to select and coordinate the appearance of witnesses. Legal counsel, or other external parties, will not be present during any SEARC meeting. The conduct of the meet ing shall be determined by the Chair. In general, the meeting shall proceed as follows: In the absence of the student, the SEARC shall review the case, and related background material. At this time the SEARC may meet with and seek additional information from individuals with specific knowledge of the case (e.g., Course Director, Associate Dean for Student Affairs, etc.). The student will be invited to present their request, provide additional relevant information, call witnesses on their behalf, and answe r questions from SEARC members. After all testimony has been heard, the SEARC will consider the evidence, re -call individuals and seek additional information, if necessary, and render a decision. The SEARC shall determine (1) whether proper procedures w ere followed by the Course Grading Committee, the Academic Advancement Committee and/or the Ad Hoc Appeals Committee in rendering their respective decisions; and (2) whether there were reasonable grounds on which the decisions were made. Decisions of the SEARC shall require a simple majority vote. The recommendation of the SEARC shall be communicated in writing to the Dean of the School of Medicine , who will make a final decision . The decision of the Dean cannot be appealed further within the School of Medicine. 167 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.g. Rules Concerning Appeals to AAC or to SEARC As discussed in 5.d. (Academic Advancement Committee), students receive written notification of AAC decisions and actions. Within seven days after receipt of written notification of the AAC action, the student may submit an appeal of the decision. Frivolous appeals could result in documentation in the permanent record of unprofessional actions. Students may not appeal to indiv idual faculty within a course or clerkship as that is considered unprofessional and would lead to discussion by the AAC. Appeals Process related to Academic Remediations, Promotions & Discipline Appealing remediations Appealing repeat of course/clerkship Appealing repeat of year Appealing disciplinary action Appealing non certification for the match First Level of Appeal The first level of appeal will be to the AAC Second level of appeal The second level of appeal will be to SEARC (Student Evaluation and Appeals Review Committee) . Criteria for this second level of appeal will be to present new information or to contest compliance with published processes and procedures. See policy 5.f. For the second level of appeal to SEARC: Within seven calendar days after receipt of written notification of a n appeal decision by the AAC the student may submit an appeal in writing to the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs that gives substantial grounds for an appeal. This appeal should be in the form of an email, or attached to an email, and give at minimum: 1. Evidence that was not available to the AAC when they made the decision 2. Evidence that process was not adhered to by the AAC in coming to a decisio n. Frivolous appeals could result in documentation in a student's permanent record and/or a notation on the MSPE. The Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs will facilitate the appeal to the appropriate party who will decide whether the appeal w ill be heard or denied (see 5.e. Policy for Grading and Grade Appeals in Courses and Clerkships and 5.f. SEARC). Decision about promotion or disciplinary action made by AACAppeal to AACAppeal to SEARC (for reasons of process or new information ONLY) 168The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will guide the student through the process at all levels. The Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs shall facilitate arrange ments for the appeal hearing. It is the student's responsibility to select and coordinate the appearance of witnesses. Legal counsel, or other external parties , will not be present during any appeal . A list of witness es selected by the student will be given in advance to the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs . If a witness is thought to be inappropriate, the Dean's Liaison for Academic Educational Affairs will communicate this information to the student who will have the option of selecting an alternative individual. The student is permitted to bring letters or statements written by external parties that speak to either their character and/or the specifics of the situation. The conduct of the meeting shall be determined by the chair of the committee . The staff in the Office of Academic Educational Affairs shall prepare minutes of the meeting, and issue all correspondence related to the appeal hearing. In general, the meeting shall proceed as follows: In the absence of the student, the committee shall review the case, and related background material. At this time the committee may meet with and seek additional information from individuals with specific knowledge of the case (e.g., Section Leader, Assoc iate Dean for Student Affairs, etc.). The student will then be invited to present the appeal, provide additional relevant information, call witnesses on their behalf, and answer questions from committee members. After all t estimony has been heard, the comm ittee will consider the evidence, recall individuals and seek additional information, if necessary, and render a decision on the appeal. Acceptance of an appeal shall require a simple majority vote. The decision of the committee shall be communicated in writing to the student. Information Available to the Committees SEARC has access to all material included in a student's file. Committee Decisions Decisions of the appeals committees are based on a simple majority of the voting members present at the meeting. These committees make no decision unless a majority of the voting members are present. Grade Documentation Pending Appeals Grades ratified by the AAC may be recorded on the transcript even as the appeals period may be pending. 169Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 5.h. Forward Feeding and Disclosure Policy / Access to Student Rec ords Stude nt records are considered confidential under UConn Health's FERPA Policy . Please visit https://ferpa.uconn.edu/notification/ for details. Althoug h the grading procedure allows identification of students, this does not mean student performance can or should be freely discussed. The sharing of student grades is done only on a need -to-know basis. At the discretion of the Course Director, student performance within or during a course can be shared with Section Leaders and/or other faculty involved in the course. Student performance in one course may also be shared with the Course Director/Section Leader of other courses upon review by the UME deans. It is the discretion of the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment in consultation with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs to determine if sharing of student academic information is of educational benefit to the student within the requirements provided by FERPA (see definition below*) . In instances where feeding of information is deemed appropriate, the student will be notified of the decision by the faculty member responsible for providing the information. The Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) shall be provided access to the student 's entire academic record. See policy 5.d. for the list of information available to the AAC. Acade mic Coach Access Each medical student will be assigned to a pair of Coach es who monitor academic progress through each block by having access to grades, evaluations and other pertinent components of the student record in Oasis, such as schedules and compliance information . Coaches will have access to student final grades and overall assessment, and will use this information to guide the student during LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assessment Period) in creating goals related to academic performance and professional growth . Course Directors may approach the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment to facilitate connection to the academic coach with issues within the appropriate course but shall not receive information from the coach regarding other courses. Coaches are provided FERPA guidelines https://ferpa.uconn.edu/tutorial/ and sign an attestation of understanding each year. Student Ac cess The Registrar is the official keeper of the students' academic records. Students have the right and are welcome to review the contents of their own ac ademic file under supervision. Students may not remove any materials from their academic file. Students who wish to inspect their record must make their request in writing to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, who will facilitate the request to the Office of the Registrar. Registrar's office staff will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. A staff member will be present while the student reviews the file. A student may also request copies of documents but may not rem ove documents from the file. The timing of the review is based on the administrative process necessary to produce the record. Students have 170the right to inspect and review their record within 45 days on the day the University receives the request regarding the student's educational record. In the event a student contests the accuracy or validity of items in their academic record, they may request correction of factual errors. Such requests are made to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs who will then facilitate the request with the Registrar and UConn's Privacy Officer. As part of the process, a hearing may be conducted . The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Body who will hear all testimony, review all evidence presented at the hearing and rend er a decision. The Hearing Body shall be appointed by the Vice President of Student Affairs for the Storrs and Regional Campuses, or by the Dean of Students for each school (Medical and Dental) at UCHC, provided that person(s) does not have a direct inte rest in the outcome; See the last section of the FERPA policy for full details. A student may also place into their academic record documents and/or statements that relate to contested items present in the file, or which are related to their academic performance. Note: Admission materials are maintained but are not considered part of the UConn SOM academic file and are not available for review. Access to Student Records Access to student files is limited to the student and appropriate school officials as defined by FERPA *. Students must give written permission to let others view the contents of their record (e.g., faculty for the purpose of writing letters of recommendation). Students may also request that portions of their records (transcripts, selected evaluations, student status, etc.) be sent out for application purposes for loans, hospital credentialing , etc. Such written requests will be honored as long as the student is in good standing with the Bursar's Office. Release forms are available in the Regist rar's off ice and the Office of the Ass ociate Dean for Student Affairs . At the discretion of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, only limited and pertinent information may be released to appropriate Dean's office staff and faculty having a legitimate educational interest. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs may approve release of only pertinent information to organizations and individuals conducting studies for educational agencies, student aid programs, or educational improvement programs. This information shall be coded to protect student confidentiality. The School may release information from the student's file without a student's written permission only in the following instances: School officials with legitimate educational interest; Other schools to which a student is transferring; Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes; Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student; Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school; Accrediting organizations; 171 To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law. In these instances, the school will make a reasonable effort to notify the student when a request for release of information is received, provided such notification is not prohibited by judicial order. The student shall be provided with the name of the requesting agency or individual, the nature of the request, and the information to be released by the school. Notification shall be made prior to release of the information.

Course and Section Place Outs It is recognized that some students entering the School of Medicine, or repeating a year, may have an adequate knowledge base in some of the topics covered in the educational program. Accordingly, students may \"place out\" of course sections or entire courses. If a student believes that their prior work or experience qualifies them for a Place Out, they can review the matter with the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment . Assessment of an individual's prospects for placing out will include documentation of credentials and experience in the subject area in question. The Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment , along with the appropriate Course Director, will determine if a student is qualified for a Place Out. If the student is in a remediation program and under the purview of the Academic Advancement Committee, the Academic Advancement Committee (AAC) informed by the Course Director's opinion, will stipulate if Place Outs are appropriate for students who are repeating a year. Students are not automatically placed out of a course section because of satisfactory performance in a prior year. Students must request a Pla ce Out in writing. 173Section 6: Me dical School Program Objectives / Graduation Competencies and Degree Programs The University of Connecticut School of Medicine requires its medical students to develop competency in the areas of patient care, medical knowledge, practice -based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, systems -based practice, interprofessional collaboration, and personal and professional d evelopment . The expected level of competency attained must be sufficient to allow these new physicians to be successful in graduate medical education programs, and must also provide them with the attitudes, skills, and values requisite to continually update these co mpetencies over the lifetime of their careers. Students will be broadly trained and prepared to undertake advanced training for careers in patient care, academic medicine, public health, and/or research. Faculty members, as teachers, mentors, and role mode ls, are committed to support the development of these student competencies.

General Promotion/Graduation Requirements UConn School of Medicine ensures that the medical education program has a single standard for the advancement and graduation of medical students and graduation requirements are verified by the Academic Advancement Committee. Students at UC onn School of Medicine have been carefully selected to meet the demands of medical studies and a life committed to the care of patients and advancement of science. At the time of graduation, the University of Connecticut verifies that the student is adequatel y trained to function in a constantly changing environment, is a self- directed learner, and that the public can be assured of the graduate's competence to practice. If a student encounters difficulties during school, the deans and faculty are prepared to deal systematically with appropriate remediation in an environment of support and supervision. Mentoring and learning services (e.g. tutoring) are used whenever possible. No student will be allowed to advance to the next year unless all requirements for the preceding year were completed. Exceptions may be made for continuations of clinical rotations in transition from years 3 to 4. Stage 1 to Stage 2 Decisions related to promotion are made at the end of Block E . Specifically, to be eligible to advance from Stage 1 to Stage 2, students in Stage 1 must: Complete all Stage 1 Courses (COrE, VITAL, FabLab, Clinical Reasoning, CLIC, DoCC, PACTS, Scholarship and Discovery ) with a grade of a pass Stage 2 to Stage 3 Decisions related to promotion are made at the end of the academic year. Specifically, to be eligible to advance from Stage 2 to Stage 3, students in Stage 2 must: Complete all Stage 2 clerkships with a minimum grade of pass Complete all VITAL, CLIC, Certificate requirements Complete any electives with a grade of pass Pass USMLE Step 1 To receive a degree of Doctor of Medicine, candidates must: Complete the fully prescribed course of study * for this degree and must be certified as having successfully met all the criteria required by the school, faculty , and accrediting bodies.

Procedures Required for Graduation Procedures requiring documented competency for graduation All others procedures are optional and require direct supervision Basic procedures: (General supervision appropriate only when competent) Medical students should be directly observed by a qualified supervisor while performing any of the listed procedures until they meet the requirement for general supervision with documented competency . Students will be competent after successfully completing the specific procedure 3 times. Medical students will always be supervised under at least general supervision. A qualified supervisor (attending physician, residents, etc.) must be readily available while these procedures are being performed. Documentation (i.e. 3) must be finalized in order for students to meet graduation requirements. Direct observation is always required for sensitive exams (breast exam, pelvic, and Pap test specimen acquisition) Basic Procedures requiring competency for Graduation Basic procedures - 3 of each required Breast exam (1 required for surgery clerkship and 1 for OBGYN) 3 Finger stick 3 Immunization Administration 3 Throat culture/rapid strep 3 IV placement 3 Phlebotomy/venipuncture 3 Pelvic exam 3-This can be any combination of inspection, speculum exam, bimanual exam, and/or rectovaginal exam. Students must do these exams with direct observation. All four components of the pelvic exam are not specifically required. Specimen acquisition does not have to occur during this exam. PAP 1-Perform Pap test specimen acquisition - students must perform the acquisition of a Pap test specimen once with direct observation. This exam can also count towards the 3 required pelvic exams. Wet prep and KOH 3-Perform wet mount, KOH prep, microscopy - this does not have to inclusive of the patient interview or pelvic exam. For these 3 required encounters the student must do the microscopy with direct observation alone 189 Competencies always requiring direct supervision: Those procedures carrying significant risk include any procedure requiring written consent from the patient as well as other invasive procedures such as central venous line placement, external or internal jugular vein puncture, joint aspiration, arterial line placement , lumbar puncture, thoracentesis, paracentesis, and others . Any student performing one of these procedures must be directly observed by a competent supervisor. The supervisor must be present and must be prepared to take over in the event of any difficulty . 190 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 6.g.2. Extension of Graduation Requirements Circumstances may arise that prevent a student from completing academic requirements in time to be certified for graduation according to the process es and schedule established by the Academic Advancement Committee. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to the illness or death of a family member, personal illness, or a delay in receipt of an evaluation of an educational experience. Given t he fact that many of these occurrences may occur late in the academic year, they may be impossible to anticipate and beyond a given student's control, the Academic Advancement Committee may at its discret ion extend the timeframe of completion of all academic requirements until May 31; thereby qualifying a student for certification to graduate with a May diploma. 191 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 6.h. Degree Programs The standard M.D. program is four years in duration. Students may also apply to the following combined and dual degree programs: MD/PhD: 8-year duration (see policy 4.2.) MD/MPH: 5-year duration (Masters of Public Health) MD/MBA: 5-year duration (Masters of Business Administration) MD/MCTR 5-year duration (Masters in Clinical and Translational Research) MD/JD 7-year duration The M.D. scholarly year program allows students to enrich the standard program with up to a year of full- time academic work, outside of the formal combined and dual degree programs. Students must apply for acceptance into the scholarly year program during their 3 rd year/Stage 2. Accepted students will complete required coursework after completion of Stage 2 and prior to the start of Stage 3, which would be the final (fifth) year . Exceptions will be made at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Applications are submitte d to the Office of Medical Student Scholarship and Research, and are reviewed by a Committee. Membership in the committee includes the Director of Medical Student Scholarship and Research and at least 3 additional faculty members designated by the Associat e Dean for Student Affairs and the Dean. The application consists of a written proposal of the academic activity to be pursued during the extra year, and a letter of support from the faculty advisor who will oversee this work. For those students who wish to pursue their academic activity at another institution, letters of support must be submitted from both a UConn faculty advisor, and the off -site advisor who will directly supervise and oversee the proposed activity. Students admitted into the program wi ll not be charged tuition for the extra year, but must pay all student fees. During this extra year, students will be enrolled full -time in the School of Medicine and will be considered on Special Matriculation for Scholarly Work (see policy 4.e. Leave of Absence), and their transcript will indicate that they participated in an extra year of full-time academic study. If a student chooses to pursue a degree at another institution (or another school within the University of Connecticut), they are not required to apply to the five- year program. These students must request a scholarly Leave of Absence during the time frame as outlined above . 192Section 7: Curriculum Governance The committees and councils of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine (SOM) that pertain to governance in the SOM: Dean's Council Education Council (EC) Committee on Undergraduate Medical Education (CUME) o Curriculum Evaluation Committee (CEC) o Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) Each committee is detailed in the following section including authority, membership, and duties. Policies included in this section: 7.a. Organizational Structure for the Committees and Councils of the School of Medicine 193 Academic Policies and Procedures Manual 7.a. Organizational Structure for the Committees and Councils of the School of Medicine In the School of Medicine, Education Council is the Central Governance body. All committees across the continuum of Medical Education and the Graduate School report to Education Council. Education Council has delegate d policy development and approval to the individual program committees if that policy affects only that school; but for anything t hat affects more than one school or program or anything that can affect the culture of the school, Education Council has direct oversight. The committees that report directly to EC include: CUME, GMEC, CCME , and GPC. Education Council has total oversight of education, provides vision, and oversees reform efforts. Dean's Council as noted below is advisory to the Dean and analyzes and reviews the work of the Councils but does not change policy. Organizational Structure for Curriculum Governance Dean's Council 1 Duties The Dean's Council works with the Dean to determine broad medical school policies and strategic plans. It does this primarily by (a) ensuring that all recommendations regarding policies and strategic plans have been developed with the consideration of how they affect the entire School and not just a single domain, (b) synthesizing, coordinating , and evaluating the initiatives put forward by the Councils into cohesive strategic plans and objectives 1 (c) initiating recommendations regarding policies and priorities in the use of resources, and (d) acting on recommendations from the Oversight Committee. 1 The Dean's Council does not rework or re- think the policy or decision itself. 194These functions will be achieved through the consideration of (a) the overall use and commitment of resources and the availability of resources for newly developed policies and plans; (b) how new policies put forth by a Council fit within the strategic plans/goals/objectives of the school as a whole; (c) possible synergies between new proposals and other school needs and goals; and, importantly , (d) the consequences of policies developed by one Council on the entire faculty and students. Thus, while most policies will be developed in the Councils, the Dean's Council plays a critical integrative function. It bears the final responsibility for evaluating the impact of proposed policies and plans on the SOM and its faculty as a whole. In addition to considering the policies and recommendations sent from the Councils, the Dean's Council may be assigned tasks by the Dean, the Vice President, or the Board of Directors (BOD). The Dean's Council will then delegate tasks to the Councils or, if appropriate, delegate an ad hoc committee to address the task. 2 The Dean's Council will also lead the effort to educate the administration of the SOM and of UCo nn Health about the impact its policy decisions have on the ability of the faculty to do its work and to negotiate ways to streamline the processes. This charge focuses on, for example, the administrative requirements for hiring new faculty members, for spending research dollars, and for implementing approved strategic plans. Authority The Dean's Council advises the Dean regarding strategic planning and resource allocation decisions. When the Dean's Council finds an impediment to the implementation of a decision or recommendation of a Council, it can (a) return the decision or policy to the Council from which it originated with feedback on the flaws or impediments to implementation, (b) send the decision or policy to a different Council to get further information on the consequences and ways to ameliorate those consequences, or (c) reject the recommendation outright. The Dean's Council has authority to overturn a negative decision by SAPC on promotion or tenure only on non- academic grounds. The Dean's Council approves the operating rules and guidelines of all governance committees, and designates departments and centers as either \"basic science\" or \"clinical.\" The Dean's Council will arrange an election, make an appointment, or delegate the appropriate Council to make an appointment when a University, UConn Health , Dental School, Graduate School or other non -SOM committee, or the BOD, desires official representation from the SOM. The Dean's Council holds elections for all SOM governance committees. Elections, to be held annually, must provide the opportunity for faculty to nominate self or others. 2 The latter would be especially appropriate when tasks that do not neatly fit within the domains need to be addressed, such as the development of a new faculty compensation pla n, revisions to the grievance procedures, or revisions to the criteria for promotion to senior rank. 195Membership Dean of SOM ( ex officio, non-voting) Chief Financial Officer of the SOM ( ex officio, non-voting ) The Chief Academic Officers for Education, Research, Clinical Affairs, and Primary Care One (1) each from the Research, Clinical, and Public Issues Councils Two (2) from the Education Council One (1) clinical department chair One (1) basic science department chair One (1) center 3 director Only senior SOM faculty in Professional Categories may serve on the Dean's Council. Terms of elected and appointed faculty members are staggered, and of 3 years duration. No elected member may serve more than two consecutive terms. If an Education, Research, Clinical or Public Issues Council member is unable to attend a meeting, s/he shall be responsible for identifying another member of the Council to a ttend. Decisions are made by a simple majority of those voting. All members are voting members unless otherwise noted. Education Council 4 Duties The Education Council formulates policies and plans for all educational activities sponsored by the SOM, which include but are not limited to, the undergraduate medical curriculum, graduate and postgraduate medical education, continuing medical education, and community education. The Education Council determines the objectives, general form, and content of the educational programs, and assures their quality. It may also request subordinate committees to deal with any issues related to the educational programs. It oversees the integration of the SOM faculty into the Graduate Programs. It considers the roles of off-site faculty, affiliated hospitals, and community faculty in these educational endeavors. It makes recommendations regarding priorities for the use of available resources. EC has decided to delegate policies affecting only one domain to that domain unl ess it could affect the culture of the SOM. Authority The Education Council has authority over all educational activities. As a matter of process, it must submit new strategic plans or major policy revisions to the Dean's Council for review and comment. In addition, decisions that require the allocation of new resources must be considered by the Dean's Council and approved by the Dean. 3 Only directors of approved Type II centers are eligible. 4 Excerpt from the School of Medicine Bylaws V1.

Because the curriculum has transformed to active team and small group formats, some of which involve patients, we do not allow external visitors to attend, audit or matriculate into the classes along with medical and dental students. Our teaching faculty may attend sessions in preparation for their own teaching. We do recognize that there may be circumstances that require an external review of our curriculum to benefit our programs and students. In order to facilitate approval for attendance of a curricular offering, a request to attend any class requires submission of a written request including: date, time, reason for attendance to the Associate Dean for Medical Education and Assessment, highlighting the benefit to the program and our students. Requests will be considered by the UME team on a case -by-case basis with the requirement that external attendees need to attend the class for some potential benefit related to education. In no instance will future applicants thinking about medical school, visiting students in clinical clerkships, family members of students or of faculty, be permitted to attend class. There may be structured visits prepared by the Admissions office for second look applicants that will be considered. 202Section 1 0: Student Government Medical Dental Student Government (MDSG) represents the medical and dental students of the UConn School of Medicine and School of Dental Medicine. MDSG plans activities to help ease the stress of classes, distributes funding to student groups, and advocates for the student body to the academic leaders of both schools. Current students may visit MDSG online here . Questions about the student government may be directed to mdsg@uchc.edu or any current officer. Policies included in this section: 10.a.
