Some over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can raise your blood pressure or keep your blood pressure medicine from working the way it should.

So be sure to read labels carefully to check for sodium content. - Some natural health products. Examples are ephedra, ma huang, and bitter orange. How can you know if it's safe to take an over-the-counter medicine? Always talk with your pharmacist or doctor before you take any new OTC medicine or supplement.
