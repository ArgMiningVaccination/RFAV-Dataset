Our mission is to provide Aboriginal people with a solid grounding in their culture, values and customs. To address the mind, body, and emotional needs of the individual and to develop and increase the role and level of responsibility that Aboriginal communities play in dealing with Aboriginal people who are in conflict with the law. In doing so, the Lodge will assist CSC to meet its own objectives. Background The Prince Albert Grand Council Spiritual Healing Lodge opened a 25-bed facility in 1997 under a tripartite agreement between Correctional Service Canada (CSC) and Saskatchewan Justice. April 1, 2012 the Province of Saskatchewan did not renew their portion of the agreement thus forcing the closure of the Lodge.
