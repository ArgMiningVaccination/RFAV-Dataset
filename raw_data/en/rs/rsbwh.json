Mind, body and spirit are interconnected. Form and function are inter -dependent. The human body has the innate ability to heal itself. What is Osteopathic Medicine? Osteopathic medicine provides all of the benefits of modern medicine including prescription drugs, surgery, and the use of technology to diagnose disease and evaluate injury. It also offers the added benefit of hands -on diagnosis and treatment through a system of therapy known as osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). Osteopathic medicine emphasizes helping each person achieve a high level of wellness by focusing on health promotion and disease prevention. AACOM.org/Become -a-Doctor/ About -OM#AboutOM o s t e o p a t h s c a n b e a l i t t l e The History of Osteopathic Medicine Osteopathic medicine is a distinctive form of medical care developed in 1874 by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, who pioneered the concept of \"wellness\" and recognized the importance of treating illness within the context of the whole body. Andrew Taylor Still was born in Virginia in 1828. After studying medicine and serving an apprenticeship under his physician father, Still became a licensed MD. He went on to serve as a surgeon in the Union Army during the Civil War. After the Civil War and following the death of three of his children from spinal meningitis in 1864, Still concluded that the orthodox medical practices of his day were frequently ineffective, and sometimes harmful. He devoted the next ten years to studying the human body and finding better ways to treat disease. His research and clinical observations led him to believe that the musculoskeletal system played a vital role in health and disease and that the body contained all of the elements needed to maintain health. Still believed that by correcting problems in the body's structure, through the use of manual techniques now known as osteopathic manipulative treatment, the body's ability to function and to heal itself could be greatly improved. He also promoted the idea of preventive medicine and endorsed the philosophy that physicians should focus on treating the whole patient, rather than just the disease. AACOM.org/Become -a-Doctor/About -OM/History Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., D.O. August 1828 - December 1917 Osteopathic Medicine Today Dr. Still's beliefs formed the basis of a new medical approach, osteopathic medicine . Based on this philosophy, Dr. Still opened the first school of osteopathic medicine in Kirksville, Missouri in 1892. Physicians licensed as Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs), like their allopathic counterparts (MDs), must pass a national or state medical board examination in order to obtain a license to practice medicine. DOs provide comprehensive medical care to patients in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, teach in both MD and DO schools, participate in medical missions abroad, and otherwise perform in the same capacities as MDs. Currently, there are more than 70,000DOs practicing in the United States. Reflecting the osteopathic philosophy of treating the whole person, many DOs serve in the primary care areas of family medicine, general internal medicine, and pediatrics, often establishing their practices in medically underserved areas. But many others are found in a wide range of medical specialties including surgery, anesthesiology, sports medicine, geriatrics, and emergency medicine. Still others serve as health care policy leaders at the local, state, and national levels. In addition, an increasing emphasis on biomedical research at several of the osteopathic colleges has expanded opportunities for DOs interested in pursuing careers in medical research.

AACOM.org/Become -a-Doctor/Med -Students/Curriculum -Overview Current Numbers 31 osteopathic colleges at 45 teaching locations in 30 states. 20% of medical students in the US attend DO schools. About 74,000 DOs in practice. By 2020, MD and DO residencies will be accredited by a single system (there are currently separate systems). 2016 Osteopathic Medical College Information Book Application Process Pre-requisite courses are common with MD programs. Students must take MCAT and participate in clinical activities (including spending time with a DO). Service, communication skills, and cultural competency are also emphasized. Some schools require a letter of recommendation from a DO. Students complete the AACOMAS \"common application\" along approximately the same timeline as MD programs. Many students apply to both MD and DO programs in the same application year. Enticed Then Turned off By Medicine, Student DO of the Year Comes Full Circle By Daniel McCann, May 31, 2011 Looking at his long list of medical - and school -related volunteer activities, it's not hard to see why the Council of Osteopathic Student Government Presidents named Brian H. Huggins, DO, its Student DO of the Year. Those same accomplishments, however, obscure the new physician's once -wary attitude toward his chosen field. Five years ago, as a senior at West Liberty University in Wheeling, W .Va., Dr. Huggins sat down with his mentor to explore his career prospects. He was drawn to medicine, but he told his mentor he had seen too many physicians \"whose behavior didn't match my philosophy of how to treat people,\" he recalls. His impression formed during hospital visits to see his ill mother who had died a few years before. \"Many of the doctors were cold,\" Dr. Huggins says. \"They didn't involve the patient in their decision -making. Their attitude seemed to be, 'If you don't like what I have to say, there's the door. ' And to me, that wasn't good patient care .\" Dr. Huggins' mentor saw a bright, outgoing science student who was patient with people, and she encouraged him to look into osteopathic medicine. The undergrad didn't even know what a DO was . read more...
