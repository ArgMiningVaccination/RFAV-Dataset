Before making such a recommendation, real world clinical trials are needed.\" [high-dose influenza vaccine is recommended](http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2014/Pages/som-shows-flu-vaccine-superior-for-eldery-in-long-term-care-facilities.aspx)for adults over age 65 because their immune response to the standard-dose vaccine diminishes with increasing age. However, at almost double the price, it is more expensive than the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. To test the value of conducting large clinical trials of the vaccine in 50- to 64-year-olds with chronic conditions, Raviotta and his colleagues used the [Influenza Decision Analysis](http://www.pittvax.pitt.edu/project/116)model, which was developed by PittVax, to explore the cost-effectiveness of alternate influenza vaccination scenarios. [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/), between 12,000 and 56,000 people die annually in the U.S. from the [flu](http://share.upmc.com/2016/12/influenza-guide/), and up to 35.6 million people are infected. This adds up to an estimated $10.4 billion a year in direct medical expenses and an additional $16.3 billion in lost earnings annually.
