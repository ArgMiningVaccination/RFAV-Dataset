In these new rankings, the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) placed 24th globally and eighth in the United States. In the first ever QS World University Rankings by Subject for dentistry, which were released in April 2015, GSDM placed 30th globally and eighth nationally. The 2016 rankings placed GSDM six positions ahead of the 2015 global ranking and in the same place as the 2015 national ranking. The QS World University Rankings by Subject ranks universities from around the world in 42 fields with a score of 0 to 100. The rankings are designed to be utilized by prospective students hoping to identify top schools in their chosen field. While the QS World University Rankings by Subject have been published annually since 2011, 2015 marked the first time that dentistry was added as a subject. Prior to this, a reputable ranking of world and U.S. dental schools had not existed. While moving up six positions in these rankings in just one year is certainly an impressive feat, I know that you will join me in our efforts to ensure that GSDM keeps improving its reputation on both a global and national stage as we achieve our vision of being the premier institution promoting excellence in dental education, research, oral healthcare, and community service in order to improve the overall health of the global population.I hope the news and achievements in this current issue help illustrate the tremendous energy and enthusiasm of our alumni, faculty, staff, and students as we strive towards this goal. Y ou will find an update on our Group Practice Model which has already changed the clinical and teaching environment in a fundamental way. Y ou will read about several of our most recent graduates in the cover article about the growth of multi- specialty multi-location group practices in the profession. T wo of our alumni have been leaders in this field, and they share their perspective on this, as well as the emerging impact of Millennial dentists entering the profession. The launch of our digital dentistry initiative and collaboration with Sirona Dental, Inc. has already proved to be a transformational milestone in the history of our school. Our most recent graduates joined the workforce with more digital experience than graduates from any other dental school. We are truly at the forefront, and our Millennial graduates will play a pivotal role in this transformation. In closing, I could not be more proud of the work our faculty, staff, students, and alumni are doing around the world to promote oral and overall health. Sincerely, Jeffrey W.

Ever since I became a member of the GSDM Alumni Association upon receiving my DMD in 2003, I have been exposed to the truly paramount role that GSDM's alumni have in the success of the School: our alumni contribute to the Campaign for Boston University, they employ our graduates, they mentor current students and residents, and they promote the alumni community by attending various alumni receptions. Without the tireless support of our alumni, GSDM would not be as strong of an institution as it is today. And GSDM is certainly strong! In fact, in Quacquarelli Symonds second-ever World University Rankings of dental schools, released in March 2016, GSDM placed eighth of 66 dental schools in the United States and 24th in the world. These new rankings further solidify GSDM's role as a leader in modern dental education. I also think I speak for all members of the GSDM community when I say that, while I am very proud of our rank, I am incredibly excited about the possibility of improving upon it as well. I was able to meet many alumni at several fantastic receptions throughout the school year including receptions at the 2016 Boston University Alumni Weekend, the American Dental Association Annual Meeting, and the 41st Annual Yankee Dental Congress. I was especially grateful to be able to witness Dr. Shadi Daher DMD 90 OMFS 94 receive the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine Distinguished Alumni Award for Outstanding Service to the School, Profession and Community, at the GSDM Reception during the 2016 Boston University Alumni Weekend. Shadi is an incredibly deserving recipient of this highly prestigious award. GSDM is lucky to have faculty members like Shadi who perfectly encapsulate the meaning of a 21st century dental educator. I would also like to personally welcome three new members of the Alumni Board: Dr. ENDO 08. Welcome to the Alumni Board! And for all alumni interested in joining our Alumni Board, please do not hesitate to contact me. Finally, I would like to remind all of our alumni that everyone of us has something to contribute to our School and our future fellow alumni, so I encourage you to contact me directly if you are considering volunteering, participating in an event, or making a gift to the campaign. Let us continue to work together to ensure GSDM's position as a world-class dental school! Sincerely yours, Bing Liu DScD 99, DMD 03 President Boston University Henry M.

In addition to her professional skills, Dr. Pla also is fluent in French and Arabic. She and Philippe are currently raising three young boys: Ian, Alex, and Lance.DR. SEPIDEH NOVID 6 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 SPRING 2016 Naveen Verma DMD 04 and Chandan Advani grew up in T oronto and attended GSDM. Thanks to their friendship at GSDM, they now run a very successful multi-specialty office with 11 locations in the T oronto area. And because of the GSDM alumni connection, they met a local alumnus, Dr. Sven Grail DMD 90 MBA 90, CEO of Altima Dental, who has served as a critical mentor and business advisor while they've expanded their practice and gone into other business ventures. \"One of the most positive things that came out of BU during my four years,\" Chandan says, \"was getting to know Naveen, who ended up becoming my business partner. I think the trust we developed in dental school and the loyalty we developed towards each other are foundations for a great partnership,\" Chandan says. Naveen adds, \"BU has always had cutting-edge technology. We were in the first class that had the simulation center. Since then, we've been cutting-edge in what we want to put in our offices.\" Discussing the school's recent launch of a completely seamless digital environment, Naveen notes, \"The more a graduating student knows, the better. The more they're equipped to come into their dental career, which is fast-paced, technology-based and driven, the better.\" Chandan and Naveen display an entrepreneurial zeal as they talk about their dental practice and their future plans. Naveen notes, \"The business part of it comes right from an early age, from my upbringing, and being in a financial family. I knew this is what I wanted to do, and I'm happy I met the right partner to do it with.\" Naveen and Chandan recently announced that they would enter into an exclusive partnership with Walmart of Canada, in which they will open twenty dental clinics in Walmart Supercentres across Canada. Walmart already has fifty medical clinics located within their stores in Canada, and the Walmart vision is to offer full health and wellness services in their locations. Chandan says, \"Y ounger families are able to go to just one place to get everything done\u2014their grocery shopping, their eye care, the things we need in life.\" Of great importance to Walmart, they learned, was having an overseeing group of dentists directing the whole dental model to ensure the highest quality of dental care. Chandan and Naveen will now be the exclusive partners directing all future dental clinics in Walmarts across Canada. While 20 offices are already in the works, Walmart expects eventually to have an even larger number providing convenient care in all regions of the country. According to Chandan, the sole purpose of the Walmart practice will be to ensure that there is access to care provided for every individual across Canada, whether they're in remote areas or in urban centers. \"At the end of the day,\" he says, \"the practices should provide that convenience. We're all impacted by the model of that fast-paced life, where everything's on the cell phone and you have less time, and you want to get more done in that time. We'll have a paging system so a mother could be shopping while the child is getting a cleaning done in one of our clinics. It just uses your time more effectively.\"ALUMNI WORKING TOGETHER IN TORONTO Jerome Stroumza ENDO 91 is originally from Paris where he received his dental training. While working in general practice, he was fortunate to have found a mentor passionate about endodontics, and he discovered he loved doing endodontic procedures. But at that time in France, there was no other specialty training besides orthodontics. Deciding to study in the United States, Jerome first attended a master's program in oral biology at UCLA. It was while at UCLA that he began working on bone regeneration, under Dr. Marshall Urist who discovered the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). Fascinated by bone, Jerome focused on building bone in the leg muscles of mice in the lab. As he says, this was revolutionary at the time. This led him to the realization that a bone lesion in the jaw could be manipulated. Back in Paris, Jerome's mentor urged him to study endodontics with the \"father of modern endodontics,\" Dr. Herbert Schilder at GSDM, and Jerome found Dr. Schilder very supportive of his research. At GSDM, Jerome focused on how best to treat a \"lesion of endodontic origin,\" a term coined by Schilder. \"What I love about Schilder is that he created his own vocabulary,\" Jerome says. Schilder, he adds, had the brain of a true pioneer. \"When you are trained by pioneers, it's easier to forge a new path. And you can bring the venture even further because your starting point is even higher,\" Jerome says. At GSDM, Jerome started on the path to what he considers a new clinical approach: endoimplantology. \"It's really between endodontics and between implantology,\" he notes. \"It's between bone grafting and CT scanning. Suddenly, the name came to me and it was endoimplantology. It was 2 a.m. one night, and I said, this is it. I went to the computer. I typed in endoimplantology and nothing came up.\" Jerome saw that this was the merging of two fields into an entirely new entity. Endoimplantology would include the science and knowledge of endodontics, of implantology, and of three-dimensional radiography. \"Particularly for challenging cases, you now have a thought process,\" he says. \"Y ou have a classification. Y ou have a methodology, along with the newest technologies, such as the CT scan and laser. Y ou have the newest endodontic techniques, new implant techniques, new grafting techniques, new implant design, new restorative techniques, and soft tissue manipulation. This makes the practice of endoimplantology formidable and very exciting.\" Jerome devised a new methodology and classification system for this approach, which he says is important in organizing the thought process around treatment decision-making. T o him, it's very much about comprehensive endodontics. First, there is the need to know if the tooth can be restored. \"If I knew that I could not restore a tooth, even though I could have done the root canal,\" he emphasizes, \"then I would not do the root canal. We should be at the forefront of the decision-making. An endodontist knows how to save teeth. We are the only ones having the experience, going back to Dr. Schilder, of transforming a lesion of endodontic origin.\" The value of newer technology was a critical element, and it wasn't being utilized. Jerome says, \"If I'm going to place an implant, I'm better off knowing exactly where the bone is, so I need to scan.\" He wrote one of the first articles on CT scanning for endodontics, something that is now more common, especially in digital dental practices. In fact, Jerome sees computer-aided software for implant placement as the future: \"I think it's really where things will go.\" \"The only thing missing right now in my view in the world of endodontics,\" he adds, \"is the comprehensiveness of endodontics. We should teach comprehensive endodontics.\" For the last fifteen years, Jerome has been spreading the mission of endoimplantology as a novel approach to the treatment of complex endodontics cases. He continues to lecture about it both nationally and internationally. I think the trust we developed in dental school and the loyalty we developed towards each other are foundations for a great partnership.\" \u2014 CHANDAN ADV ANI SAN FRANCISCO ALUMNUS FORGES ENDODONTICS Jerome Stroumza Naveen Verma and Chandan Advani8 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 9alumni events alumni events AAPD RECEPTION On May 23, 2015, GSDM alumni came together at the 2015 American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's (AAPD) Annual Session in Seattle for a special alumni reception, which took place at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel, and was attended by GSDM alumni as well as current and former faculty members and residents.

ROBERT ALLYN GOLDMAN DMD 71 T ALKS ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK ABOUT THE LIFE OF HIS UNCLE, DR. HENRY MAURICE GOLDMAN Author and Periodontist Dr. Robert Allyn Goldman DMD 71 (nephew of Dr. Henry Maurice Goldman) has written a new book called \"Henry Maurice Goldman Dental Educator and Pioneer.\" It is a 360 page book\u2014published in the spring of 2015\u2014that attempts to detail Dr. Goldman's lifetime of accomplishments and explain why the importance of his legacy still resonates today. Dr. Allyn Goldman, in his own words, explains why his book is a great read for all dentists and all lay people interested in the origins of modern dentistry. By Dr. Robert Goldman Dr. Henry Maurice Goldman's dream to advance dentistry beyond a trade into a biological science materialized because of his foresight and unremitting hard work. His sacrifice was only overshadowed by his dedication and irrefutable energy. As Dr. Goldman's nephew, my insights were developed as one of his students. I followed in his footsteps and trained as an oral pathologist and periodontist. I spent many years training and practicing in these fields, but I was extremely fortunate to reap the benefit of his tutelage. I rendered as objective a story as was possible in \"Henry Maurice Goldman: Dental Educator and Pioneer\" because I wanted to channel his thinking in a manner that would characterize his stream of consciousness. This book is the result of all the thoughts and decisions he possessed to make the dental profession more than it was and to leave it as self-perpetuating with the future advances that would come from the research and teaching programs he initiated. The continuing education and formal training programs today are the end result of so many of the practitioners whose educational development sprung from this source. Dr. Henry Maurice Goldman's story is worth the time for all dentists to read\u2014he was the man who brought dentistry into the modern era. The dental profession's foundation had already been set long before he was born. However, like Arnold Palmer in golf, Albert Einstein in physics and Nicola T esla in electricity and technology, Dr. Goldman coordinated all of the existing intelligence in the dental profession before World War II and gave it relevance. He served as the dental chief of the Armed Services Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C. as an Army captain in the war. During this time, he realized that periodontal health was the foundation to optimal dental health in general. He linked dental and systems medicine, and embodied their mutual dependence in laying the grassroots of specialty education. In the early 1950s, the dean at the University of Pennsylvania asked him to start a graduate periodontal training program, which gradually became one of the premier programs in periodontal prosthesis. In 1958, Dr. Goldman returned to his hometown, Boston, where he started the Department of Stomatology at Boston University. His mindset, however, was concentrated on something that would spring the dental profession into a much more coordinated relationship with all the dental specialties. Thus, after much effort and dedication, he built the first and only dental school for graduate specialty education. In 1963, the Boston University School of Graduate Dentistry opened up with Dr. Goldman serving as its first dean. But, make no mistake - he was the brains and brawn behind its birth and development. As a researcher and practitioner, his own pilot efforts in oral biology, oral medicine, oral pathology and periodontology fields enabled all the then-existing ADA- recognized specialties to come together under one roof for advanced training with its underpinnings based in the biological sciences. The integrative approach to specialty training matured under his leadership, and gradually through his worldwide reputation, dentists came from around the world to train at Boston University. This resulted in a tree of well-trained specialists in all dental fields who in turn initiated their own programs throughout the United States and countries far and wide. Thus, Dr. Goldman took what were mostly apprenticeships and small university training programs, and significantly expanded them under one roof so there was a steady rise in the number of dentists with enhanced training returning to their homes all over the world. The result is that dentists today pretty much owe their education to this growing wave of educators that blossomed from Boston University. T oday, the school is now eponymously named for him as the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University. Dentists and lay people alike can appreciate the coordinated efforts that went into the development and maturation process of dental education with its unique twists and turns as it grew into the monolith that it is today. Reading this book, you can see its origins as Dr. Goldman's ambitions became solidly defined and palpable as Boston University grew and influenced so many countries around the world. T eachers today somehow are linked directly or indirectly to the medical center he grew in prestige and reputation. Reading this book would be beneficial for all dentists and lay people who would like to understand the educational origin of their dentists.Dr. Henry Maurice Goldman Dr. Robert Allyn Goldman22 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 23alumni alumni Pictured above: Carmen Doumit and her fianc\u00e9 Hicham celebrate their engagement on Friday, December 25, 2015 at her parents' house in Lebanon.Pictured left: Zack Kano DMD 96 ENDO 08 finished his term as the president of the MAE Annual Meeting.

He could repair anything and was an integral part of the training and development of all of GSDM's new dental repair technicians. Even though he lived in the Massachusetts area for decades, Bill never lost his southern accent. He also had a very good sense of humor. When students would tell him that a dental chair was not working he would always ask them, \"Is the unit turned on?\" Nine times out of ten it was not turned on and Bill would reply, in his southern style, \"It won't work if it's not turned on.\" The students would laugh and turn the unit on. Bill was born in New Bern, North Carolina. He served in the Navy and retired after twenty years as a veteran of the Korean War. He was laid to rest with military honors at Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne, Massachusetts, at 1430 hours, on Monday, March 14, 2016. Dr. Thomas K. Hawley Dr. Thomas K.

This represents a significant increase thanks to the remarkable legacy of Dr. Oreste Zanni. His $3 Million bequest created an endowed graduate scholarship for a postdoctoral resident enrolled in the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Periodontology. His generosity will be also marked with the naming of the Post-doctoral Periodontic Patient T reatment Center in the proposed new clinical facility in his honor. Currently, GSDM has raised almost $16 Million towards its original $25 Million campaign goal. The GSDM fundraising goal supports the proposed new clinical facility, as well as scholarships and professorships. Just recently, the University announced that the $1 Billion campaign goal was to be raised to $1.5 Billion with a two year extension of the campaign. Six years ago, the DMD Class of 2010 started a Class Gift program. Since then, every graduating class has participated in this fundraising effort. As future alumni, their involvement in our philanthropic mission is critical as we continue to build a culture of giving in the GSDM community. Last year, the participation for the graduating class was second highest among the seventeen schools at the University. Three years ago, the University launched Giving Day. This is a one day fundraising initiative to see how many donors will give to the school in a 24 hour period. During the second year, GSDM ranked in the top five among the seventeen schools at the University. This put GSDM in close company with schools, such as College of Arts and Sciences, with ten times the number of alumni. For the fifth year in a row, the percentage of alumni supporting the school rose again, bucking national trends. Last fiscal year, we were delighted to have a 13.8% alumni participation rate up from 11% the year before.

UDAY REEBYE ACCEPTS APPOINTMENT TO DEAN'S ADVISORY BOARD Dr. David Lustbader, Chair of the GSDM Dean's Advisory Board and Clinical Instructor in the GSDM Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, enthusiastically announced in January 2015, that Dr. Uday Reebye DMD 98 has agreed to serve on the GSDM Dean's Advisory Board. After receiving a DMD from GSDM in 1998, Dr. Reebye went on to complete a medical degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His surgical training includes an Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery internship at Boston Medical Center, General Surgery T raining at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Residency at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Dr. Reebye has an extensive and comprehensive list of appointments and memberships in professional organizations. He is an attending surgeon at Durham Regional Hospital, an adjunct clinical faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Dentistry, and is a member of the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association, the American Association of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, and the International Association of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons. Dr. Reebye understands and embraces the importance of continuing education courses in the dental profession, and is a frequent lecturer and specialist on CBCT guided implant dentistry. He and his staff at T riangle Implant Center also sponsor a series of continuing education courses. He has also authored numerous publications pertaining to his clinical interests, which include CBCT guided implant surgery and distraction osteogenesis. Dr. Reebye and his wife, Laura, live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with their daughters. \"Please join me and the entire GSDM community in welcoming Dr. Uday Reebye to the Dean's Advisory Board,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"Dr. Reebye is certainly a welcome addition to a Board that has proved immensely beneficial to the success and growth of GSDM.\" Dr. Uday ReebyeWhen GSDM student Jobren Dingle DMD 17 was 8 years old, a bunk-bed fell on him one day while he was playing with his cousins, lodging a piece of wood in his two front teeth. The subsequent trips to the dentist he would make in the months following the accident sparked a strong interest in dentistry that would stay with him like a pilot light until he decided, upon entering college, to study dentistry. Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, Jobren was\u2014like most children\u2014interested in a wide variety of things. In fact, in high school he took classes in law, interior design, art, and sociology, but after he began to excel in his science courses, particularly honors biology and physics he knew that he would study the sciences in college. When he enrolled in Winston-Salem State University in the fall of 2007, he declared his major as biology with a minor in chemistry. After declaring his major, Jobren's decision to study dentistry began to solidify during his freshman year, after he saw a flyer for Winston-Salem State University's chapter of the Undergraduate Student National Dental Association (USNDA), which is the undergraduate section of the Student National Dental Association (SNDA). He began to attend the group's meetings. \"The USNDA got me exposed to a career in dentistry,\" said Jobren. \"They had dentists who spoke to us often on the profession and made it fun and interesting.\" At the Winston-Salem State University USNDA meetings, Jobren was able to hear from dental professionals about the realities of life as a dentist and the ins and outs of dental school and applying to dental school. It was during this time that Jobren's general interest in dentistry\u2014 which began with those childhood visits to the dentist\u2014started to evolve into serious considerations about directing his aptitude for the sciences toward a dental education. Jobren also found himself interested in the USNDA's activity in underrepresented minorities in the field of dentistry. While the SNDA is open to all students, of all demographics, the organization was initially founded to support the academic and social environment of minority students, and its core values to this day still center on supporting minority students. Around the time that Jobren had been elected Vice President of Winston-Salem State University's chapter of the USNDA, he had made up his mind: he would become a dentist. During his time at Winston-Salem State University, Jobren was accepted into a biomedical sciences exchange program in which he spent a semester in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, conducting research in periodontal disease, taking intense Portuguese classes, and assisting students in the dental school at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais where he studied while there. Following his graduation in 2011, Jobren enrolled in the two-year Masters in Medical Science Program at Hampton University in With the patients we work with, many of whom come from minority communities, it is important to work toward ensuring that the students here can relate to the people they serve.\"JOBREN DINGLE MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. FELLOWSHIPHampton, Virginia. During these two years, he was able to further hone his interest in dentistry by spending a significant amount of time shadowing a professional dentist. In his second year at Hampton University, he began applying to dental schools across the country, with a strong preference toward attending dental school back in his home state of North Carolina at the East Carolina University School of Dental Medicine. However, he says that when he visited GSDM for his interview there was something unique about the School\u2014 something that the other schools didn't have. When he received his acceptance letter, he quickly responded, \"yes.\" \"For my interview I felt like a fit,\" said Jobren. \"It was just a family atmosphere. Everyone was so friendly and well- rounded.\" When he began his dental education at GSDM in the fall of 2013, Jobren became involved quickly on campus. He joined the GSDM SNDA as a general member during his first year, and he is now president of the organization. His fellow classmates also nominated and voted him into the position of Vice President for the class of 2017\u2014a position he still holds. He also has served as an Admissions Host, and an Orientation Ambassador. One of Jobren's main areas of interest while he has been a student at GSDM is the role that minority students have in dentistry and dental education. This is something he has been able to explore with his position in the GSDM SNDA, which plans several events every year focused on supporting all dental students with an emphasis on minority dental students. Jobren says he enjoys working to make sure that all minority students feel accepted\u2014and that a feeling of acceptance is paramount to an ability to perform well in dental school. Jobren also works to reach out to minority pre-dental students who may be considering dental school, but are unsure about the realities of it. \"It's very important to have diversity in dental school,\" said Jobren. \"Students need to feel welcomed.\" According to Jobren, diversity can have incredible benefits to the relationships between students and the patients they serve in their third and fourth years of dental school in the Patient T reatment Center. \"With the patients we work with, many of whom come from minority communities, it is important to work toward ensuring that the students here can relate to the people they serve,\" said Jobren. Jobren says that his time in the Patient T reatment Center, during his third year at GSDM, has been beneficial and enjoyable\u2014he has appreciated being able to interact with patients, many of whom, he says, are incredibly grateful for the work he does.\"My patients are so amazing; they are always bringing me something,\" said Jobren. \"One patient baked me a sweet potato pie, another brought me a bag of fruit.\" When he graduates in a little more than a year, Jobren says he is planning on participating in a one-year residency, with a goal to eventually establish his own private practice. He says he will stay committed to his work in supporting minority dental students upon graduation, with the hope that more minority students who, like Jobren, have an aptitude for the sciences, will begin to consider dental school as a possible life path.

MAKE YOUR IMPACT THROUGH A PLANNED GIFT. Boston University Planned GivingMore than 20 percent of children surveyed in a 2009 Forbes report said they wanted to become superheroes when they grew up, and another 15 percent said they wanted to become firefighters. When GSDM student Heidi Borenstein DMD 17 was the same age, she wanted to be something else: a dentist. \"I decided pretty early in life that this was the career for me,\" said Heidi. Now, entering her fourth year of dental school after a successful third year in which she gained valuable experiences in the Patient T reatment Center, Heidi is less than a year away from receiving her DMD, at which point she plans to enroll in an orthodontic residency program to become a full-time orthodontist. Growing up in T oronto, Heidi always showed an increased interest in the sciences. Adding to this innate interest was the fact that her father is a nephrologist and her mother is a nurse. But, despite her parent's professions, Heidi says it was her childhood pediatric dentist in T oronto whose caring and compassionate manner made her steer her scientific aspirations toward dentistry\u2014She enjoyed going to the dentist and wanted to grow up to become one. Heidi says her family and friends were always incredibly supportive of her plans for dentistry. \"My dream to become a dentist was totally normal growing up,\" said Heidi. \"My parents were really happy for me.\" At the age of 17, she entered Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, where she would go on to earn a BSc in Health Sciences with a 3.9 GPA and an impressive resume of extracurricular achievements: She worked as a research student at the Centre for Research on Inner City Health (CRICH), and she volunteered at the Hospital for Sick Children in T oronto. It was at CRICH that Heidi completed research that was eventually published, with Heidi as first author, in the Journal of Urban Health in 2013. Her paper is titled, \"Oral health, oral pain, and visits to the dentist: neighborhood influences among a large diverse urban sample of adults.\" Heidi's extracurricular activities were not restricted to research at Wilfrid Laurier University; she also served as a T eaching Assistant in five classes, honing a skill in mentorship that she would come to further refine and utilize while at GSDM. After applying to several dental schools, Heidi accepted her position in the class of 2017 at GSDM on the same day that she received the letter stating that she had been accepted. She said GSDM stuck out to her because she felt that she would fit in, that she would be comfortable at the School for four years. After participating in a first-year orientation program that she describes as \"exciting\" and \"well organized,\" Heidi began her dental education at GSDM in the fall of 2013. Just like she did in her time at Wilfrid Laurier University, she became involved on campus quickly. Heidi's extracurricular involvement at GSDM has largely centered on a theme of serving as a mentor to pre-dental students, something she says she truly enjoys. She has become the Chair of the Pre-Dental Committee of the GSDM chapter of the American Student Dental Association (ASDA), an Admissions Host for pre-dental students going through the interview process at GSDM, and a T eaching Assistant in three pre-clinical courses. She has also served twice as an Orientation Ambassador and currently serves as Co-President of the GSDM chapter of Alpha Omega (AO). \"I like helping people make what I consider to be an important decision,\" said Heidi of her activity on campus working with pre- dental students. She said she particularly enjoys serving as an Admissions Host\u2014a position that allows her to be the student face of GSDM to pre- dental students, many of whom, says Heidi, are visibly anxious and excited about their interviews and their future in dental education. She said she enjoys quelling these students' anxieties and encouraging their excitement\u2014something she finds easy to do, she says, because she has a genuine appreciation for GSDM. \"I like it here at BU,\" said Heidi. \"And I like sharing those feelings with prospective students.\" Heidi, who is in the DMD class of 2017 \"top 10,\" is currently looking forward to her 10-week externship rotation, which she will complete at Holyoke Medical Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in the spring of 2016, before beginning her fourth year at GSDM. After her externship rotation, Heidi says she is planning on applying to Orthodontic Residency programs to eventually become an Orthodontist. She says her reasoning for wanting to become an orthodontist is similar to the reason that her childhood dentist influenced her to become a dentist in the first place. \"People leave the orthodontist happy,\" said Heidi. \"That's why I like it.\"HEIDI BORENSTEIN, RECIPIENT OF 2015 DEAN SPENCER N.

Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) Department of Endodontics donated approximately $52,000 to the department in order to fund the purchase of a much needed piece of equipment, a Sirona ORTHOPHOS XG 3D CBCT imaging machine. Following GSDM's historic transition, in 2014, to seamless digital dentistry for its clinical education and patient care, the Department of Endodontics determined that an ORTHOPHOS XG 3D CBCT machine from Sirona would be an important and beneficial component for the residents and faculty in the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Endodontics in this new all-digital environment. While the current 3D imaging machines at GSDM are top tier, the ORTHOPHOS XG 3D CBCT machine can produce a resolution up to 100 \u00b5m with a field of view of 5 by 5.5 centimeters while also reducing the radiation dose per-scan required; properties beneficial for endodontic imaging. \"We want to train the next generation of endodontists for their future practice. With the level of resolution and detail obtained from smaller areas of the jaw alongside a Metal Artifact Reduction Software (MARS), the ORTHOPHOS XG 3D is precisely tailored to the demands of the Endodontic practice,\" said Dr. Sami Chogle, Associate Professor in the Department of Endodontics and Director of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Endodontics. The fundraising effort began in January 2015 when Dr. Chogle sent out a letter to all of the 502 alumni from the Department of Endodontics at GSDM, in which he updated the alumni on the status of the department and some of its most recent successes. In this letter, Dr. Chogle urged the alumni to consider donating to the fund to purchase the machine, which would be a crucial component of providing twenty-first century education to GSDM's current and future endodontic residents. Just one month after Dr. Chogle's initial letter, Dr. Peter Morgan ENDO 75 and Dr. John West ENDO 75 recognized the importance of the new Sirona machine and the benefit it would have on training the GSDM residents. Dr. Morgan and Dr. West reached out to alumni in order to encourage them to donate. \"I am asking each of you to consider making a special contribution so that the BU Endo Alumni may purchase the Sirona XG3D machine and donate it to the endo department at the school,\" read one letter to alumni sent from Dr. Morgan. In the letter, Dr. Morgan also talked about the importance of the field cone beam imaging technology that the Sirona XG3D CBCT machine provides. \"As many of you have discovered in your practices, focused field cone beam imaging has become a very important addition to the practicing endodontist's diagnostic protocol,\" said Dr. Morgan. \"In many residency programs, this technology is available giving the endo residents experience in the use of 3D imaging for diagnosis and treatment planning.\" After just a few months of fundraising, a total of 60 GSDM alumni of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Endodontics (from years 1964-2014) raised $52,000, enough to purchase the imaging machine with a supplemental donation from GSDM as approved by Dean Jeffrey Hutter. The average donation from the alumni was $1,000. The Sirona XG3D CBCT imaging machine has been stationed on the second floor of 100 East Newton Street since November 2015. GSDM's 29 endodontic residents in the Certificate in Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS) program, the DScD program, and the MSD program have been able to use the machine since that time. \"I would like to say a big 'thank you' to all of the alumni who donated to help bring this Sirona ORTHOPHOS XG 3D CBCT machine to the Department of Endodontics,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"GSDM would certainly not be the institution it is today without the tireless support of our alumni.\" D. Wayne Acheson, 1980 Mey Alhabib, 2014 Danny K.

The White Coat Ceremony started off with a welcome from Assistant Dean of Students Dr. Joseph Calabrese and opening remarks from Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. The keynote address was delivered by District 1 T rustee of The American Dental Association, Dr. Jeffrey Dow. After the keynote address, the two classes were presented to Dean Hutter by Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Dr. Cataldo Leone. Associate Professor in the Department of General Dentistry Dr. Stephen Dulong then called each student's name as they were brought onto the stage to receive their professional coats. Drs. Joseph Calabrese, John Guarente, Cataldo Leone, and Janet Peters assisted the students in donning their coats. Drs. Bing Liu and Tina Valadez served as Marshalls for the Ceremony. When all the students had their coats on, Dean Hutter led the DMD Class of 2017 and AS Class of 2016 in reciting the Professional Oath. Dean Hutter then provided some closing remarks, prior to leading the students and official party out of Metcalf Hall to the loud applause of friends and family. A reception was then held for the students and their families, friends and guests. During the ceremony, several students were also recognized with awards. The recipients of the Spencer N.

The forum was one of five regional forums that preceded the main White House Conference on Aging on July 13, 2015. The goal of all five of these smaller regional forums was to start discussions about issues affecting older Americans, and pass on the notes of these discussions to the main conference. The White House Conference on Aging occurs approximately once a decade in Washington, D.C. The last conference was in 2005. The Boston forum attended by Dr. Boffa took place at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Boston. Dr. Boffa and the other participants of the forum participated in discussions about four topics: healthy aging, long-term services and supports, elder justice, and retirement security. During the forum, Dr. Boffa explained to the other attendees his belief that wellness programs for the elderly must include a strong emphasis on oral health. He found that several other participants agreed with him. \"As the only dentist at the conference I was gratified to see so many other knowledgeable professionals push for the inclusion of oral health,\" said Dr. Boffa. \"In maintaining a healthy life style, proper diet is so important and good oral health is paramount.\" He continued, \"At least the Northeast Conference report will inform the White House and President Obama the need to start including oral health service in any future health aging program.\" Dr. Joseph Boffa(l-r) Dr. Cataldo Leone, Dean Jeffrey W.

The story is about French teenager Pearl Beck, who desperately needed help repairing damage to her jaw after a failed surgery in France. After hearing clicking and feeling pain in her jaw for some time, Beck decided to undergo surgery at the French hospital. While this surgery required Beck to have her jaw wired shut for eight weeks, it left the teenager with extremely complicated oral problems. \"Slowly, over the next few months, her jaw started to grow back into her airway,\" Dr. Mehra is heard explaining during the WCVB news story. After the surgery in France, Beck and her family were looking to GSDM, and Dr. Mehra, to provide her with the world's best oral surgery. They wanted Beck to simply have a healthy jaw again, and they turned to Dr. Mehra to make that happen. Dr. Mehra is shown on camera several times during the WCVB story. At one point he is shown giving viewers a quick lesson with a model jaw and explaining the process of replacing a T emporomandibular joint (TMJ), the procedure that Beck needed.\"This is Pearl's jaw,\" said Dr. Mehra while holding the model. \"And the problems are in the joint, in the lower jaw that's growing back and the teeth that are not touching together.\" Throughout the WCVB story, video shots of Boston Medical Center, and the OMFS facilities at GSDM were shown. \"Dr. Mehra's abilities as an oral and maxillofacial surgeon are certainly world class,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"I am very proud of Dr. Mehra and the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery for rising to the challenge and performing this much needed corrective surgery for Ms. Pearl Beck.\"DR.

The visits were part of an ongoing Global Externship Exchange with three Chinese institutions that began in October 2013. The exchange allows fourth-year DMD students to spend three weeks\u2014guided by a GSDM faculty member\u2014at three Chinese dental schools, gaining clinical and cultural experience as well as course credit. The exchange also allows for students and faculty from the Chinese schools to visit GSDM. These corresponding visits have been taking place each year since 2013. The three groups of Chinese students and faculty that visit GSDM are from Shanghai Jiaotong University College of Stomatology (SJUCS), Peking University School of Stomatology (PKUSS) and the Fourth Military Medical University School of Stomatology (FMMUSS). The visitors from each University were in Boston for 14 days, touring GSDM and the city of Boston, while observing all of GSDM's academic and clinical programs, as well as the school's other various scholarly and research activities. The Chinese visitors participating in this cultural exchange program all specialize in postdoctoral programs, and many of the visiting Chinese students had specific interest in rotations of GSDM's postdoctoral Patient T reatment Centers such as Orthodontics, Endodontics, Periodontology, Prosthodontics, Oral Surgery and Pediatric Dentistry. Therefore, each 14-day schedule was tailored to the interests of the visitors.\"I am delighted to see that this important cultural and academic exchange between GSDM and our partner institutions continues to be both immensely beneficial as well as enjoyable for everyone involved\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"It was a pleasure to get to know all of the visitors from SJUCS, FMMUSS, and PKUSS during their time at GSDM.\" The exchange program is overseen by GSDM's Office of Global & Population Health. Dr. Laisheng Chou, Professor and Director of Oral Medicine and Professor of Biomaterials, and Consultant to the Dean on Far Eastern Programs, serves as the Program Director. The exchange program started with SJUCS and FMMUSS in 2013 and expanded quickly to include PKUSS in 2014. In 2015, the program continued to grow. Both T okyo Medical and Dental University in T okyo, Japan, and Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Dentistry, in Bangkok, Thailand were recently added to the exchange program, with students from GSDM visiting those schools in September 2015, and students from the respective schools in T okyo and Bangkok set to visit GSDM in the summer of 2016. The rapidly growing program is incredibly beneficial to GSDM students. The students who are selected to participate (only eight students can be selected into the program each year from a very competitive pool of applicants) receive fantastic exposure to the workings of international dental schools, while also experiencing different cultures. \"The quantity and variety of the cases our students are exposed to at the dental schools in China, Japan and Thailand are remarkable,\" said Dr. Chou. \"It would certainly be unlikely for the students to experience the same type of cases in their short four-year DMD program in the United States.\" \"I am delighted to see that this important cultural and academic exchange between GSDM and our partner institutions continues to be both immensely beneficial as well as enjoyable for everyone involved.\" \u2014 DEAN HUTTERDean Jeffrey W.

The mission of IADR Networks is to bring together dental researchers from multiple disciplines in order to study a particular scientific topic or idea. The GOHIRN acts as an organized supportive platform for its members, who share the goal of addressing issues related to oral health inequalities on a global scale. Dr. Sohn, who is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Dental Public Health, was elected to the position of Regional North American Councilor. Regional Councilors serve as a point of contact in their region through which information about the implementation of the GOHIRN action plan can be channeled. This appointment will involve interaction with relevant regional and local initiatives on health inequalities and updating the GOHIRN website and social media platforms such as Facebook and T witter. Dr. Singhal, Assistant Professor in Department of Health Policy and Health Services Research, was elected to the position of IADR GOHIRN North American Region Assistant Group Program Chair. In this role, she will be responsible for promoting the activities of GOHIRN and IADR by helping to develop research initiatives on global oral health inequalities. \"I am thrilled that two of our faculty have been elected to fill these important positions within the GOHIRN,\" said Dr. Raul Garcia, Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research, and Director of the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities (CREEDD). \"Their new appointments are yet another strong example of the national and international recognition that the GSDM has attained for the outstanding research on oral health disparities being conducted here.\"TWO GSDM FACULTY ELECTED TO PROMINENT POSITIONS WITHIN IADR SCIENTIFIC NETWORK GSDM FACULTY MEMBER QUOTED IN NA TIONAL NEWS OUTLETS GSDM faculty member Dr. Jonathan Shenkin was quoted, via his role as a Spokesperson for the American Dental Association (ADA), in several news articles about a study done by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan about secondhand smoke and caries. Dr. Shenkin is a Clinical Associate Professor in both the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. The study that Dr. Shenkin was asked about, \"Secondhand smoke and incidence of dental caries in deciduous teeth among children in Japan: population based retrospective cohort study,\" was published on October 21, 2015, in The BMJ. The study evaluated the increase in the risk of caries in children who experience secondhand smoke at home. The researchers found that the risk of caries at age three was 14 percent for children with no smokers in their household, 20 percent for children with smoking in their household (but without any evidence of tobacco smoke), and 27.6 percent for children with at least one tobacco smoker in their household. While Dr. Shenkin did not have a role in the research or publication of the study, he did publish a study in 2004 showing an association between secondhand smoke and dental caries. And, in his role as Spokesperson for the ADA, he is frequently contacted to provide insight into dental matters, specifically matters of pediatric dentistry. Dr. Shenkin, who works in private practice in Augusta, Maine, is quoted in an October 22, 2015, Chicago T ribune article as saying, \"Like the population in this study, exposure to secondhand smoke continues to be a problem in the U.S., suggesting value in additional research.\" In an October 30 Reuters article, Dr. Shenkin said, \"This study simply adds to the body of evidence that associates secondhand smoke and an increased risk of tooth decay among children.\" \"T ooth decay is the most common chronic disease in childhood,\" Dr. Shenkin is quoted as saying in the Reuters article. \"Knowing they can protect their children against pain and suffering will hopefully be a strong motivator to quit smoking.\" \"I would like to thank Dr. Shenkin for serving as a spokesperson for the American Dental Association on such a crucial matter,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"It is important that our faculty members continue to find ways to reach out to the public about the various innovations in dental research and the dental profession.\" GSDM FACULTY MEMBER PRESENTS A T APHA ANNUAL MEETING On Sunday, October 30, 2015, GSDM faculty member Ms. Kathy Lituri spoke about the benefits of community water fluoridation at the Opening General Session of the 2015 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting and Exposition held in Chicago, Illinois. Ms. Lituri's speech carried particular significance, because 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of the implementation of the first community water fluoridation program, which took place in Grand Rapid, Michigan. Ms. Lituri, who is also Immediate Past Chair of the APHA Oral Health Section, addressed the entire assembly of more than 5,500 public health professionals during her speech about the benefits of community water fluoridation. Ms. Lituri's speech marked the first time that a Chair from an APHA Section spoke during the Opening General Session of an APHA Annual Session and Exposition. Ms. Lituri began her remarks at the Opening General Session by acknowledging the city of Chicago, where the Annual Meeting and Exposition was taking place, for being one of the first cities to authorize fluoridation, 61 years ago in 1954. \"Fluoridation gives all of us, including the most high risk populations, a chance for better oral health, a chance for all of us to become part of the healthiest nation in one generation,\" Ms. Lituri said during her speech. \"The CDC recognized it as one of the ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century and it's been a healthy people objective since 1990.\"She continued, \"T oday, more than 210 million people, or 74.6 percent of the US population, on public water supplies live in fluoridated communities.\" The APHA Annual Meeting and Exposition featured more than 1,000 various scientific sessions and hundreds of other events, including social events, film screenings, and special sessions. The Meeting and Exposition also had eight sessions and four poster presentations on the topic of water fluoridation. The theme of the meeting was \"Health in All Policies.\" Ms. Lituri first became interested in the topic of community water fluoridation when the town she lives in, Lincoln, Massachusetts, faced a challenge to its community water fluoridation program. She ended up taking the lead on the effort to ensure that the town maintained its program. \"I made a decision to never be in a reactive position again,\" said Ms. Lituri. \"And that public health professionals\u2014not just oral health care providers\u2014should be poised and ready to defend and promote community water fluoridation.\" Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter praised Ms. Lituri for her advocacy, \"I would like to thank Ms. Lituri on behalf of our GSDM community for both representing GSDM at the APHA Annual Meeting and Exposition and for her tireless work in support of community water fluoridation.\" GSDM FACULTY MEMBER INDUCTED INTO INTERNA TIONAL ACADEMY FOR DENT AL FACIAL ESTHETICS On Monday, November 30, 2015, Boston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) faculty member Dr. Charilaos Asikis was inducted as a fellow into the International Academy for Dental Facial Esthetics at a ceremony that took place at the Harmonie Club in New Y ork. Dr. Asikis is a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of General Dentistry and Practice Leader in the Pre-doctoral Patient T reatment Center. Approximately 45 other dental professionals from around the world were inducted into the IADFE at the ceremony. \"IADFE Fellows are encouraged to develop networking relationships for mutual educational opportunities, effective patient referral, and improved interdisciplinary relationships,\" said Dr. Asikis. The IADFE, which has nearly 1,000 Fellows, is an honorary service organization that seeks to foster interdisciplinary education in the area of facial esthetics. IADFE members come from many associated professions, and all have a desire to create new bridges whereby esthetic patients can be better and more knowledgeably served. After the induction ceremony on Monday, November 30, a dinner took place, at which Dr. Asikis and the other newly inducted fellows were able to get to know each other as well as the many other members of the IADFE community attending the ceremonies. \"I would like to congratulate Dr. Asikis for his induction into the International Academy for Dental Facial Esthetics,\" said Dean Jeffrey W.

Dr. Sohn is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Dental Public Health. This is the fifteenth year that YUCD has coordinated an international dental symposium. At this annual symposium, dental professionals, YUCD alumni, and others from around the world come together to engage in presentations and other activities focused on dental medicine. The 2015 symposium celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of YUCD's founding and the history of modern dentistry in South Korea. The symposium took place over the course of three days in November. Dr. Sohn presented two lectures\u2014on the second and third day of the symposium\u2014entitled \"Role of psychosocial factors in caries disparities\" and \"Preventive dentistry in the 21st Century.\" Dr. Sohn received three degrees from YUCD: his DDS in 1987, MS in 1992, and PhD in 1995. He has been back to YUCD to present on two separate occasions, in 2005 and 2007. At the Y onsei Dentistry Centennial Memorial Symposium, a museum of dental medicine was unveiled and a tape cutting ceremony for a sculpture depicting Dr. Scheifley took place. \"I would like to congratulate Dr. Sohn for being invited to be a guest speaker at such an important event celebrating the history of YUCD and modern dentistry in Korea,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter.GSDM EXPLORES P ARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTERThe Boston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) maintains many international relationships that have helped both students and faculty, and have made GSDM a leader in dental research and education. In 2015, GSDM explored an exciting new research and educational partnership with the University of Manchester (UofM) in the United Kingdom. This new partnership is spearheaded by Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of Behavioral Science Research Dr. Belinda Borrelli. She has held a Visiting Professorship at the University of Manchester for the past three years. Dr. Borrelli chairs a steering committee that has been created to help identify areas of synergy between GSDM and the University of Manchester. Other members of the steering committee include Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter; Professor in the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, and Associate Dean for Research Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska; Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research, and Associate Dean for Global & Population Health Dr. Michelle Henshaw; Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research, and Director of the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities (CREEDD) Dr. Raul Garcia; and Professor and Director of the Division of Oral Medicine Dr. Laisheng Chou. Dean Hutter and Dr. Borrelli visited the University of Manchester on October 5 and 6, 2015, during which time they engaged in a retreat with faculty from the University of Manchester School of Dentistry and with Drs. Henshaw and Kukuruzinska participating via teleconference. Professor Paul Coulthard, Dean of the University of Manchester School Of Dentistry, also provided Dr. Borrelli and Dean Hutter a tour of the entire university, including the School of Dentistry and the Central Manchester University Hospitals. Several other UofM faculty presented on their work, their school, and potential collaboration opportunities. \"Both schools are on the cutting edge of science and innovation; the collaboration between the two has synergistic potential to advance oral health and the state of the science,\" said Dr. Borrelli. \"Potential outputs from this collaboration include student exchanges, visiting professorships, access to a wider pool of research grants, access to cohorts for preliminary data for grant applications, and access to the UK biobank.\" Dean Hutter remarked, \"I was very impressed by both the excellent faculty and the state-of-the-art facilities that we encountered during our visit to the University of Manchester. I am optimistic that we will develop a strong and mutually beneficial research and educational partnership.\" On December 2, 2015, Dr. Stephen Dulong, Associate Professor in the GSDM Department of General Dentistry, was elected Chair of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Dentistry (BORID). Dr. Dulong has served on the BORID since being appointed by former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in May 2012. He assumed the position of Chair on January 1, 2016. The BORID is responsible for licensing dentists and dental hygienists for practice in Massachusetts; establishing rules, regulations, and policies governing the practice of dentistry, dental hygiene and dental assisting; and investigating complaints against licensed \"Both schools are on the cutting edge of science and innovation; the collaboration between the two has synergistic potential to advance oral health and the state of the science.\" \u2014 DR. BORRELLI dental professionals. The BORID was established in 1915, by state law, and is currently made up of 13 volunteers\u2014six dentists, two dental hygienists, one dental assistant, two public voting members, and two non-voting dental assistant advisors. The volunteers are appointed by the governor to five year terms and they meet as a board twelve to fourteen times each year. In his role as Chair, Dr. Dulong will be moderating the monthly meetings of the Board, speaking on behalf of the Board at state and national meetings, and participating in various sub-committee meetings. Chairs of the BORID are elected annually. Dr. David Samuels held the position of Chair from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Prior to that, the position was held by Dr. Mina Paul, a member of the GSDM Dean's Advisory Board. Dr. Dulong is a member of the American Dental Association, the Massachusetts Dental Society, the American Dental Education Association, the American Association of Dental Boards, the American Board of Dental Examiners, the Commission on Dental Competency Assessment, and the Omicron Kappa Upsilon Dental Honor Society. Dr. Dulong has been a member of the GSDM faculty since 1978. He holds a BA from Boston University and a DMD and CAGS in prosthetic dentistry from GSDM. He was a founding member of the Restorative Dental Group of Cambridge from 1979 until his retirement from private practice in October 2011. \"I applaud Dr. Dulong for taking on this excellent leadership opportunity,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"I am confident he will enjoy great success in his new position as Chair, working with the Board to uphold the ethical standards of our profession.\"DR. STEPHEN DULONG ELECTED CHAIR OF MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF REGISTRA TION IN DENTISTRY Dr. Woog SohnDr. Stephen DulongSPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 45 44 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016school news / global GSDM STUDENTS TRA VEL TO VIETNAM FOR APEX PROGRAM GSDM students Tien Do DMD 18 and Jeremy Nguyen DMD 18 traveled around Vietnam for three weeks\u2014from May 22 to June 14, 2015\u2014in an effort to distribute much needed oral health supplies and to educate local health professionals working at schools in the country about oral health education. The trip was part of the student's participation in the Applied Professional Experience (APEX) program, and was overseen by GSDM's Office of Global and Population Health (GPH). Do and Nguyen are the first GSDM students to travel abroad for the APEX program. While fourth year students frequently travel abroad for GPH-sponsored service trips, and student exchange programs are active between GSDM and five international schools, students have always completed the APEX program domestically. Do and Nguyen, who were both born in Vietnam, but spent most of their lives in the United States, came up with the idea to travel to the country for the APEX program, and proposed their idea to Director of Global Initiatives and Assistant Professor in the Department of General Dentistry Ms. Kathleen Held and Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Associate Dean for Global & Population Health Dr. Michelle Henshaw. Do and Nguyen presented lectures for the health professionals that outlined simple lessons about oral health education. These lectures included an open dialogue at the end in which the health professionals and the two GSDM students could learn from each other. The students also say they appreciated the opportunity to reconnect with the country that they were born in. \"Vietnam is a place that is very dear to us because we were both born there and spent some of our childhood there as well,\" Do and Nguyen said. \"However, having spent the majority of our lives in the United States, we have been very detached from the way of life in Vietnam.\" When they arrived in Vietnam, Do and Nguyen were assigned a group leader as well as a translator and technology specialist for the trip, to ensure that all the presentations and other activities could run as smoothly as possible. Upon reflection, the two students say the most important takeaway about the status of oral health education in Vietnam is the fact that health professionals in the country often have no choice, but to stretch resources too thin. \"It was eye opening in the sense that we didn't realize the scale of kids that we were working with,\" said Do. \"In the U.S., you are working with 30 kids at most. In Vietnam each class is like 100 kids and a whole school would be 1000 kids.\" Do and Nguyen spent time on their trip working to create systems and plans that would help with this problem of limited resources. \"The stretching of resources diminished the quality of care, and presented many obstacles in implementing an efficient oral health education program,\" said Do. \"In addition to creating an oral health education plan; we helped create a database to organize patient health charts.\" Do and Nguyen also observed a difference in educational cultures in Vietnam and the U.S. \"The culture in Vietnam in terms of teacher and student is very defined,\" said Do and Nguyen. \"T eachers lecture and students are expected to absorb the knowledge. It was a very foreign concept that lesson plans be interactive.\" The two students, however, said their experience at GSDM has taught them about the benefits of interactive education. As such, they did their best to relay the benefits of interactive teaching to the health professionals they were working with. \"We know from our oral health lessons, that the best way to stress learning is to have student interaction,\" said Do and Nguyen. \"The teachers were very receptive to our way of teaching, but it was still very foreign for them.\" Overall, the two GSDM students say their time in Vietnam was a wonderful experience that proved to be very helpful for their dental education. \"Our work in Vietnam was an experience that broadened our scope of dentistry,\" said Do. \"We learned what it was like to work in an area with limited resources, and recognized the obstacles that arise in such areas. Moving forward, the lessons learned on this trip will provide invaluable insight for developing future preventative health efforts in similar areas.\" GSDM ANNUAL FUND HELPS SEND DMD 16 STUDENT TO ALASKA For nearly two weeks in the middle of August 2015, GSDM DMD 16 student Matt Mara was in 30-degree weather in two isolated towns surrounded by tundra at the tip of Alaska. Mara was in Alaska participating in the Indian Health Service's (IHS) Dental Externship Program, which allows fourth- year dental students from across the country to gain valuable clinical skills by providing oral health care to vulnerable indigenous populations at one of 29 sites in the United States. Mara served at the IHS Dental Externship Program site located in Barrow, Alaska, a town of about 4,000 people that borders the Arctic Ocean. Barrow is the northernmost point in the United States. It is closer to the North Pole than it is to Seattle, Washington. The highest temperature ever recorded in the town is 79 degrees Fahrenheit, while the lowest is negative 56 degrees Fahrenheit. While Barrow is isolated, the opportunity to participate in the IHS Dental Externship Program there is highly sought after by dental students; only 10 dental students from various schools across the country are picked from a large pool of applicants each year. These 10 students all participate in separate, two week, stints. Mara served in the Dental Externship Program in Barrow from August 16 to 29, 2015. \"It was nice to see how a Community Health Center works in a rural setting,\" said Mara about his time in Alaska. \"Regardless of where they were, they were still trying to provide as much care as possible.\"Mara is also not the first GSDM student to participate in the IHS Dental Externship Program in the isolated Alaskan town. In fact, GSDM students have been participating in the program for the past several years. Ryan Pasiewicz DMD 15, Lindzy Goodman DMD 14, and Andrew Jorgensen DMD 13 all participated in the IHS Dental Externship Program in Barrow during their fourth-year at GSDM as well. \"I would like to congratulate Matt Mara on participating in this prestigious Dental Externship Program run by the Indian Health Service,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"I am very pleased to hear that he not only gained real-world clinical experience, but also did so while serving much needed communities in highly isolated areas.\"GSDM Students Tien Do DMD 18 and Jeremy Nguyen DMD 18 in VietnamMatt Mara DMD 16 with a dentist and two dental assistants in Wainwright, Alaskaschool news / globalSPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 47school news / global 46 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016school news / global In November 2015, GSDM student Nick Capezio DMD 17 was in Estel\u00ed, a city of about 130,000 people in Nicaragua, with Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Associate Dean for Global & Population Health Dr. Michelle Henshaw. The two were in Nicaragua as part of ongoing efforts between GSDM, Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC), and local and national governmental agencies in Nicaragua, to implement an oral health program that seeks to improve the long- term oral health of the city's population by providing fluoride varnish treatment to preschool children. The trip to Estel\u00ed, Nicaragua in November was the third\u2014 and most recent\u2014trip that members of the GSDM and BUMC community have taken to the country to implement the program, which seeks to equip teachers at 12 different preschools in Estel\u00ed, with the knowledge and resources to improve oral health and apply fluoride varnish four times a year to more than 800 children under five years old. The 12 different preschools were chosen because they are located in Estel\u00ed, where the Superemos Foundation, an education- based organization, operates. BUMC has a longstanding relationship with the Superemos Foundation. The fluoride varnish program is similar to some existing GSDM programs in that it is designed to stop oral health problems before they begin, by providing consistent fluoride varnish treatment to young children. The program is different than those found in the United States because the people who have been trained to apply the fluoride varnish are not health professionals; they are teachers. The connection between Estel\u00ed, Nicaragua and GSDM started with Dr. Peter Loewinthan, a Pediatrician at Dorchester House Community Health Center. Dr. Loewinthan has a long-standing relationship with Nicaragua's Superemos Foundation. On one of his volunteer trips to donate medical services and care to the residents of Estel\u00ed, he noticed that many of the children he was seeing had poor oral health. Knowing the implications of poor oral health in developing children, he reached out to Dr. Henshaw to explore ways to fight this. The first trip to Estel\u00ed, Nicaragua, took place in February and March 2014. Representatives from each of the three BUMC schools took part in the trip, which marked the first time that all three schools participated in an international mission trip together. From GSDM were DMD students John Paul DMD 14, Kenia Rodriguez DMD 14, Danny Shum DMD 13 AEGD 14, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of School-based Programs Dr. Corinna Culler. Joining the four GSDM representatives on the February 2014 trip were four medical students; three public health students; Associate Professor in the department of Community Health Sciences and Pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) Dr. Emily Feinberg; Dr. Loren Wilson (a practicing dentist); and Dr. Peter Loewinthan. It was determined during this first trip to Estel\u00ed that the most effective treatment plan for the population of students at the 12 Superemos schools would be to provide fluoride varnish treatment to children less than five years old. Many children who were more than five years old had already developed numerous oral health problems, and the GSDM and BUMC group decided that the best plan of action would be to halt the progression of poor oral health before it started. Roughly a year-and-a-half later, with a plan in mind, Dr. Henshaw, Dr. Culler, Nick Capezio DMD 19, and Eleanor Lawrence (an MPH candidate at Boston University School of Public Health) traveled down to Estel\u00ed for a second time, from July 5 to July 23, 2015. The goal of this trip was to collect data to determine the extent of the oral health problem in children less than five years old in Estel\u00ed. They found that 77 percent of children less than five years old had some tooth decay. In fact, only four of the 465 students that the GSDM and SPH group observed had ever received any prior dental restorative treatment. On top of gathering data on the oral health of the children, the GSDM and SPH group did several other things during this July trip: working with school administrators to create an oral health presentation that was specific to Nicaraguan culture and habits, introducing administrators to the practice of fluoride varnishing, and working with various local and federal officials in the country to ensure that the program had adequate support. Finally, the third and most recent trip to Estel\u00ed took place from November 21-28, 2015. Attending this trip were Nick Capezio and Dr. Henshaw. The goal of this trip was to train the teachers who would be administering the fluoride varnish treatment. Nick Capezio and Dr. Henshaw traveled to 11 of the 12 schools (one school was on vacation during the trip) and provided fluoride varnish competency training to 35 teachers. During this training, the first round of fluoride varnish was applied to all the students that will be participating in the program. Dr. Henshaw said she was especially pleased with the energy and commitment the teachers showed during the training process. \"I would like to congratulate Nick Capezio, Dr. Michelle Henshaw, and everyone else in the GSDM and BUMC communities that are working toward making this program a success,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"GSDM's various international programs continue to grow and provide both excellent opportunities for our students and much needed dental care for vulnerable populations.\" GSDM ST ARTS FLUORIDE V ARNISHING PROGRAM IN NICARAGUA GSDM student Nick Capezio DMD 17 conducting a training session in Estel\u00ed, NicaraguaFor five days in October 2015, GSDM DMD 16 students Jennifer Ng and William Nguyen were in San Marcos, a town in rural Honduras, with a team of dental and medical professionals, providing oral health care to members of the local population. Ng and Nguyen's externship to San Marcos was coordinated by GSDM's Office of Global and Population Health (GPH), which helps facilitate multiple externship service missions for fourth-year dental students each year to people in need of care in other countries. In the 2015-2016 school year, more than 40 students participated in externship mission trips. The round-trip airfare for all these externship mission trips is funded with donations to the GSDM Alumni Fund. Ng and Nguyen were partnered with the Massachusetts-based organization, Cape CARES, which provides medical and dental care to Hondurans who lack access to care. GSDM students have partnered with Cape CARES in Honduras several times before. Ng and Nguyen were in Honduras with a 17-person Cape CARES team from October 17 to 24, 2015. The team, which consisted of dental and medical professionals, worked for five days in San Marcos. It took two days to travel from Boston to San Marcos. The volunteers flew from Boston to the capital of Honduras, T egucigalpa, and then drove to a mid-point where they spent a night and, finally, drove to San Marcos. The two GSDM students saw a much higher number of patients each day and were equipped with more limited resources than they were used to. Still, Ng and Nguyen adapted and provided the best care they could. \"At GSDM you have x-rays, but over there we didn't have x-rays, we didn't have suction, it was very primitive,\" said Ng. Despite the high number of patients and limited resources, Ng and Nguyen\u2014as well as the other dental professionals with Cape CARES\u2014were able to perform hundreds of tooth extractions and several other procedures, including cleanings and restorations. \"I learned a lot of technical skills in oral surgery, especially extracting root tips, severely decayed teeth, and suturing,\" said Nguyen. \"Because we had no x-rays, I learned how to clinically diagnose and treat the patient with only information from what I saw clinically and what the patient told me about the history of the tooth.\" The Hondurans receiving care from the Cape CARES team would frequently travel miles on foot for treatment. When they arrived each day, they would wait\u2014sometimes for hours\u2014for their turn. At the end of the five days, Nguyen and Ng had each seen about 40 patients, and they each performed more than 100 extractions and completed several cleanings and even a few restorations. Ng said that while she enjoyed gaining valuable experience, she also enjoyed the people she interacted with. \"I think the best part of the externship was the people that I met,\" said Ng. \"The medical and dental team that we travelled with was a group of selfless, compassionate, and motivated individuals that inspired me both professionally and personally.\" \"Overall, the experience was very humbling,\" said Nguyen. \"It made me more appreciative of being able to be in the position I am in today, to provide a service that has an immediate impact on the community.\" Dean Hutter extended his appreciation to Ng and Nguyen for their service. \"I am thoroughly impressed with the great work done in Honduras by Jennifer Ng and William Nguyen,\" said Dean Hutter. \"By all accounts, Jennifer and William were able to provide crucial oral healthcare care to Hondurans that were in critical need of it\u2014 Well Done!\"GSDM ANNUAL FUND HELPS SEND DMD 16 STUDENTS TO HONDURAS \"The medical and dental team that we travelled with was a group of selfless, compassionate, and motivated individuals that inspired me both professionally and personally.\" \u2014 JENNIFER NG DMD 16Jennifer Ng DMD 16 providing dental care to a patient in Honduras48 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 school news / research SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 49 SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 49 In May 2015, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific, the last stage of its sixth mission to the International Space Station. Inside, it carried a briefcase-sized metallic container of bone cells that belong to Boston University researcher Paola Divieti Pajevic. The cells, which have experienced the extremely low levels of gravity on the space station, could contain clues about better ways to treat osteoporosis and other conditions that cause bone loss, and also ways to support astronauts on longer missions, such as a trip to Mars. \"Everything has worked perfectly well so far,\" says Divieti Pajevic, an associate professor of molecular and cell biology at GSDM. \"Knock wood, we should have plenty of material to study.\" The experiment, which lasted seven days in space, was nearly five years in the making, so she has good reason to invoke a little supportive superstition. One reason for the long lead time is that the cells, called osteocytes, are challenging to study. They live deep inside hard bone, so they are difficult to isolate in a cultured cell line. Also, they turn mechanical signals\u2014physical forces, such as those caused by the weight-bearing exercises doctors recommend to stave off bone loss, and the ever-present force of gravity\u2014into cellular signals that build strong bones. Prodding them in a way that strengthens or weakens those forces isn't so easy. Y ou can't exactly send a petri dish off to Gold's Gym for a workout. But you can send them into space. By doing so, Divieti Pajevic hopes to gain a better understanding of the basic biology of osteocytes. \"Ultimately, we hope to identify novel genes that could someday lead to new therapeutics,\" she says. Space-Worthy Cells In 2009, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was looking for promising space research projects, so Divieti Pajevic, then at Harvard University, proposed sending up osteocytes. In 2014, she moved to GSDM. T eeth and bones have a lot in common biologically and both respond to mechanical forces, she says, so it's a great location for her lab. Osteocytes are of particular interest to NASA since many astronauts have lost bone mass, at a rate of about one percent per month, during space voyages. While it is clear that microgravity causes bone loss, exactly how it affects bone cells at a molecular level isn't yet understood. The NIH's National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases funded the project, called Osteo-4, as did the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space and NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The team's first step was to create an osteocyte cell line suitable for a space journey. Bone researchers had so far developed only two models of cultured osteocyte cells, both derived from mice, but they fell short. For instance, neither reliably produced sclerostin, a protein recently discovered to slow bone formation. T oday, several new drugs are in development to block sclerostin in osteocytes to treat osteoporosis. Divieti Pajevic couldn't very well send cells into space that lacked one of the most interesting new therapeutic leads for bone loss. Her new cell line of osteocytes, also derived from mice, produces sclerostin and several other factors related to bone growth. \"Now there are three cell lines available for the scientific community, all slightly different,\" says Divieti Pajevic. \"And there is still room for more.\" In work published in 2015 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, she validated the cell model by testing it in a NASA-developed microgravity simulator. The simulator, which is about the size of a soda can, slowly spins the cells to put them into a perpetual state of free fall, essentially counterbalancing the force of gravity. Time in simulated microgravity causes the cells to produce sclerostin, confirming that the cell model does, in fact, respond to reduced gravity. \"It is very important to do this same experiment in space so we can have real microgravity, the real unloading of forces on these cells,\" Divieti Pajevic says. T-Minus 2.5 Y ears While development of the new cell model was a giant leap, work was only just beginning. It took another two and a half years to be flight ready. The Osteo-4 team first chose a 3D structure made of polystyrene foam for growing their osteocytes. Cell growth in this scaffold mimics growth inside of bone but also allows experimental analysis later. T o develop trays to hold the bioreactors the cells would live in during the journey, the team worked with CALM T echnologies, in Canada, which designs equipment for space and biomedical projects and had sent other cells into space. They also collaborated with Draper Laboratory, an independent lab in Cambridge, Mass., with a long history of aeronautics and astronautics research, to simulate the Dragon launch to make sure that the few minutes of intense vibration during takeoff wouldn't alter the osteocytes and ruin the experiment. One of the biggest challenges, however, was getting all of the air bubbles out of the bioreactors, because bubbles can scramble cellular signals. They have settled on a process that involves tapping the bioreactor tubes and vials with a rubber mallet to coax the bubbles to the top, and then sucking them out with a syringe. \"We have become experts at de-bubbling,\" says Divieti Pajevic. We Have Liftoff Up in space, Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti carried out the experiment. The Osteo-4 payload contained three trays of osteocyte-filled bioreactors, each connected to a variety of fluids, including liquid nutrients to keep the cells alive. On three scheduled occasions over the course of seven days, Cristoforetti moved a tray-worth of bioreactors into cold storage. She did the work inside a glove box in case of a spill. In an Earth- bound lab, dripped chemicals just puddle on the table, but in space they would float around the ship and could interfere with equipment or become a health hazard. Freezing the cells halts cellular functions and preserves a snapshot of the genetic activity. Divieti Pajevic will measure that activity through gene profiling. She will look at changes in levels of RNA, which is produced when a gene is turned on and provides the instructions for making molecular machinery, such as bone- building or bone-loss proteins. By freezing the cells after three different intervals of microgravity exposure\u2014approximately two, four, and seven days\u2014Divieti Pajevic will be able to see which gene expression levels change with extended exposure. \"Our goal is to find novel genes that change their expression levels in microgravity,\" she says. In summer 2015, analysis began and Divieti Pajevic expects to see a rise in production of sclerostin. But, by looking across the whole genome for changes after time in microgravity, she also hopes to see much more.SP ACE SCIENCE FOR BONE BIOLOGISTS Professor in the GSDM Department of Health Policy and Health Services Research Dr. Belinda Borrelli is first author on a paper titled, \"Prevalence and Frequency of mHealth and eHealth Use Among US and UK Smokers and Differences by Motivation to Quit\" published in the July 2015 Issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Dr. Borrelli, who is also Director of Behavioral Science Research, collaborated on this work with colleagues from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom\u2014where she is a Visiting Professor\u2014as well as a collaborator from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. The paper investigates the use of technology by smokers who are motivated to quit and those who are unmotivated to quit in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is important because, as the paper states, smoking prevalence has plateaued: 18 percent of people in the United States are smokers and 19 percent of people in the United Kingdom are smokers. The investigators raise the issue of how to reach smokers who may not be motivated to stop smoking. Specifically, they collected data on mobile and smartphone ownership, sending and receiving texts, downloading and using apps, using Facebook, and visiting health-related websites. In addition, the study explored the current use, and future willingness to use, electronic (eHealth) and mobile (mHealth) technology to quit smoking. This evaluation of a previously understudied population of smokers yielded interesting results. The study evaluated a cohort of 1,000 smokers, half from the United States and half from the United Kingdom. Dr. Borrelli and her colleagues found that the overall use of these kinds of technologies was high. Although smokers who are not motivated to quit are less likely to use available technology than smokers who are motivated to quit, there was sufficient prevalence to justify exploring the use of eHealth and mHealth interventions to encourage cessation for those who are not motivated to quit. From their findings, the investigators deduced that low effort types of communications such as text messaging may be beneficial for enticing unmotivated smokers to quit. This large scale survey produced valuable data which will help Dr. Borrelli and her colleagues further develop new technological platforms with the goal of helping smokers quit. DR.

Dr. Borrelli is a Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of Behavioral Science Research, and Dr. Garcia is a Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities (CREEDD). Dr. Borrelli was the lead author on a paper published in the special issue of the Journal of Pediatric Dentistry titled: \"Motivational Interviewing for Parent-Child Health Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\" Dr. Erin T ooley from Roger Williams University and Dr. Lori Scott-Sheldon from Brown University were co-authors. Dr. Garcia's paper, published in the same special issue, was titled: \"Progress in Early Childhood Caries and Further Opportunities with Research, Policy, and Clinical Management.\" Dr. Borrelli is also listed as a second author on this paper. The paper that Dr. Borrelli was the lead author on\u2014\"Motivational Interviewing for Parent-Child Health Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\"\u2014analyzed the effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered treatment focused on building intrinsic motivation, in a number of health behavior change studies in which MI was used to improve pediatric health behavior and outcomes. The meta-analysis included 25 studies published between 2001 and 2014 (with 5,130 participants). Relative to comparison groups, MI was associated with significant improvements in health behaviors (e.g., oral health behaviors, diet, physical activity, reduced screen time, smoking cessation, reduced second hand smoke) and reduction in body mass index. Results suggest that MI may also outperform comparison groups in terms of dental caries, but more studies are needed. MI interventions were more successful at improving diets for Caucasians and when the intervention included more MI components. Borrelli et al. concluded that motivational interviewing with parental involvement may be an effective way to improve children's oral health behaviors. Dr. Garcia's paper\u2014\"Progress in Early Childhood Caries and Further Opportunities with Research, Policy, and Clinical Management\" discussed the 2014 Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Conference and further opportunities for treating ECC. The Early Childhood Caries Conference was first held in 1997; since then, there has been extensive progress in understanding, preventing, and managing ECC. Although ECC prevalence in the United States has declined, ECC is still relatively common in some populations. African American children are twice as likely to have ECC as non-Hispanic Caucasian children, and over 50 percent of American Indian children have ECC. There is also limited evidence on effective intervention for ECC for children below the age of six. While significant progress has been made, Dr. Garcia and colleagues identified ways ECC prevention and treatment can continue to improve. T o continue to improve ECC management and hence health care for children, more clinical trials are needed. \"Dr. Borrelli and Dr. Garcia's publications in the special issue of the Journal of Pediatric Dentistry are excellent scientific articles that serve as a testament to their continued commitment to thoughtful innovation in dental research,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"I congratulate both of them for their publications.\" TWO GSDM PROFESSORS PUBLISH P APERS IN SPECIAL ISSUE OF JOURNAL OF PEDIA TRIC DENTISTRYProfessor and Chair of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at GSDM Dr. Athanasios Zavras had two articles published in the summer of 2015, one in Pediatric Dentistry, the official publication of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, and one in The Journal of Oral Diseases. The article in Pediatric Dentistry, \"Cost benefit analysis of the age one dental visit for the Privately Insured,\" was authored with Dr. Kolstad and Dr. Y ook, who work in private practice and at Columbia University Medical Center, respectively. Their research analyzed administrative dental claims from the states of California, T exas, and New Y ork. The researchers analyzed administrative dental claims from the states of California, T exas, and New Y ork. The researchers identified successive birth cohorts of children that had their initial dental visit by age 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. In their analysis, they found there was a cost benefit to establishing dental care by age one. Children who had their first visit by age one received significantly fewer restorative procedures such as stainless steel crowns. Dr. Zavras's second published article, \"Malocclusion characteristics as risk factors for temporomandibular disorders: lessons learned from a Meta-Analysis\" was published in the Journal of Oral Diseases. The paper's other co-authors were Dr. Claudia Cruz and Dr. Kevin Lee, both from the College of Dental Medicine at Columbia University, and Dr. Jae Hyun Park of the Postgraduate Orthodontic Program at Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health and the Graduate School of Dentistry at Kyung Hee University. This paper explored the types of malocclusions that are associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). The authors used meta-analysis to identify what causes TMDs. They concluded that dynamic occlusal factors such as absence of canine guidance, and laterotrusive interferences can be considered as risk factors. They also documented a wide range of variability in definitions and methodology between many published studies that precludes any conclusions. DR. A THANASIOS ZA VRAS PUBLISHED On August 17, 2015, DMD 18 students presented their research to GSDM faculty and fellow students. These presentations were part of the APEX (Applied Professional Experience) rotation. They showcased a wide range of research, including literature reviews and basic science experiments, offering an insightful, nuanced look at many topics related to dental medicine. The APEX program is a unique learning opportunity that integrates classroom learning and hands-on experience, giving dental students the opportunity to engage with practicing dentists and principal investigators in a professional setting. After completing their research training, APEX students present their findings. Some presentations explored a public health or epidemiological angle, such as presentations on child Oral Health Quality of Life and disparities in access to Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery providers in Massachusetts. Others focused on specific pathways or genes, including presentations on the role of N-Glycosylation in immunosuppression, salivary biomarkers in periodontal disease, and tropomyosin as a regulator of intracellular pressure. \"The presentations this year were of an exceptionally high standard and showcased the depth and breadth of research being conducted at the school,\" said Associate Dean for Research and Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska. \"I commend these students for their participation in research and I am grateful to all of the mentors for their dedicated support and guidance.\" The DMD 18 student presenters were Borrelli Dr. Raul Garcia Dr. Athanasios ZavrasAPEX students gather during their presentationsschool news / researchSPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 53 52 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016school news / research 52 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016In 2015, GSDM faculty members Dr. Woosung Sohn and Dr. Athanasios Zavras were awarded a $2.8 million Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grant titled \"T ransformative, T eam-based Dental Care for Vulnerable Children: Integrated T raining and Practice\" where Dr. Sohn is Program Director / Principal Investigator and Dr. Zavras is Co-Program Director / Co-Principal Investigator. Dr. Sohn is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Dental Public Health. Dr. Zavras is a Professor in, and Chair of, the Department of Pediatric Dentistry. This new grant, budgeted at approximately $2.8 million, will allow the two faculty members to put into action the educational framework for a new, integrated, multidisciplinary clinical care model for vulnerable children in which several healthcare professionals across the campus\u2014including those in the Department of Pediatrics, the School of Medicine, the School of Public Health, the School of Social Work, and Sargent College\u2014will participate in patient care and resident training. Over the course of five years\u2014starting in 2015 and ending in 2020\u2014this program will create and evaluate a transformative, multidisciplinary, team-based pediatric dental care model that will address the needs of underserved children and children with special health care needs. Clinical and didactic curricula will be designed to support the vulnerable populations served and to foster a team- based practice. New educational modules that address oral health disparities and population health, as well as cultural competency, will be developed to integrate into existing pediatric dentistry and dental public health curricula. The grant will also support training of nine residents in a pediatric dentistry and dental public health combined specialty training program. The first two years of the combined training program will entail patient-care-focused pediatric dentistry training, with a third year of population-focused dental public health training. Besides the nine primary trainees, a total number of about 70 residents (50 pediatric and 20 dental public health) will be educated by the program. The combined training program will be enriched by the unique team-based healthcare delivery model as well as coherent community-based public health experience with continuity to address the inherent weaknesses of current dental specialty training. The primary focus of the combined program will be training dentists from underrepresented minorities or disadvantaged background. So far, the team has made great inroads in advancing inter- professional education and practice. Among the team's early accomplishments are the development of a core oral health course and its deployment to educate nutrition students, speech pathology students, and pediatricians on issues of oral health; building viable collaborations with Sargent College and Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM); developing new information technology to facilitate remote access to dental information, and many more. The team has also made substantial progresses adding to the clinical and didactic pediatric curriculum and developing new dental public health education modules. One trainee is currently being trained in the program, two will be recruited in 2016-17 cycle. The team is also continuously engaged in recruiting two trainees per year until the 2019 admissions deadline, with particular emphasis on under-represented, minority, and/ or disadvantaged dentists. The ultimate target outcome of the program is the formation of well-trained dentists in both pediatrics and dental public health who become better prepared to practice in a new and emerging model of care. These dentists will fulfill their specialty care responsibilities, and be retained in sites that serve the underserved, disabled and vulnerable. Access to quality dental care is a struggle for children affected by poverty or disability. The dental workforce is not yet fully equipped to meet these children's needs, and this new clinical care program will help remedy that. It will prepare dentists not only in an emerging model of care, but also train them to fulfill their primary care responsibility. Additionally, it will work to improve dentist retention in sites that serve underserved, disabled, and vulnerable populations by providing them with knowledge, skills, and competencies needed to handle disparities in oral health and access to dental care. \"I am pleased to hear of the recent Health Resources and Services Administration grant awarded to Dr. Sohn and Dr. Zavras to fund their innovative multidisciplinary program,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"Dr. Sohn and Dr. Zavras's program is certainly a welcome contribution to the GSDM community and the profession of dentistry.\"DR. WOOSUNG SOHN AND DR. A THANASIOS ZA VRAS A W ARDED $2.8 MILLION HRSA GRANT Third year resident in GSDM's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Dr. Varun Arya received the 2015 Resident Research Award from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) for his manuscript, \"TMJ condylar osteochondroma: Low condylectomy and joint preservation vs. Complete condylectomy and Joint resection.\" Dr. Arya was mentored in this work by Dr. Pushkar Mehra, Professor and Chair of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. This prestigious national award is given annually to just two residents by the AAOMS, a non-profit professional association comprised of over 9,000 surgeons from across the US dedicated to the advancement of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Dr. Arya was recognized for his outstanding research on Condylar Osteochondroma, which is a very rare tumor formation that can develop in the mandible. As part of winning the award, Dr. Arya's manuscript was published in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. He also presented his manuscript and was formally recognized at the annual meeting of American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in October 2015 in Washington D.C. Dr. Arya's mentor, Dr. Mehra, has treated 21 patients with this rare kind of tumor. The standard treatment method for the condition is the complete removal of the temporomandibular joint followed by its reconstruction with an artificial joint prosthesis. While this treatment method has been tested over time, Dr. Mehra has been exploring a new treatment option in which the joint is preserved without requiring the sacrifice of the temporomandibular joint or reconstruction. Dr. Mehra has successfully treated eight out of these 21 patients with this novel procedure.In his paper, Dr. Arya compared the two techniques and evaluated the outcome of the newer procedure. He found that both complete and low condylectomy are viable options for the surgical management of osteochondromas of the mandibular condyle. Low condylectomy, when indicated, permits effective removal of the tumor and has the advantage of eliminating the need for autogenous or alloplastic joint reconstruction. In patients where complete resection is necessary due to extent of the tumor and TMJ reconstruction is required, artificial joint prosthesis provides similar clinical outcomes as compared to autogenous reconstruction, and has the advantages of eliminating donor site morbidity and decreasing operating time. \"I feel very blessed to have received this national award,\" said Dr. Arya. \"I dedicate this award to Dr. Mehra, who has been so supportive of my work and has been a great mentor. I am hoping that this research will help surgeon's make better treatment decisions and stimulate more minds to further investigate management of this rare condylar tumor.\" Dr. Arya also presented this work at the annual meeting of the American Society of T emporo-Mandibular Joint Surgeons held in 2015 where he was awarded best abstract and received a scholarship. \"Congratulations to Dr. Arya on winning this prestigious award,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"He is certainly deserving of this recognition for his dedication to the study of oral and maxillofacial surgery.\"DR.

The Principal Investigators of the two projects are Dr. Belinda Borrelli, Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of Behavioral Science Research; Dr. Michelle Henshaw, Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Associate Dean for Global & Population Health; and Dr. Raul Garcia, Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy & Health Services Research and Director of the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities (CREEDD). The projects were two of just nine projects funded by the NIDCR that are all part of a new consortium with more than $7 million in first year funding that has been established with the goal of reducing disparities in access to, and quality of, oral and dental care in minority and low income children. In March 2015, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that Hispanic/ Latino children and black children are about twice as likely as white children to have untreated tooth decay in primary teeth. \"By establishing this research consortium, NIDCR seeks to lead national efforts in reducing childhood oral health disparities,\" said NIDCR Director Martha J. Somerman in a press release. \"Among the projects awarded are those that test innovative health promotion and disease prevention strategies and evaluate and refine existing programs and policies.\" Dr. Borrelli and Dr. Henshaw's project, \"Integrating Interactive Parent T ext Messaging and Oral Health Guidelines into Pediatric Community Health Centers to Reduce Early Childhood Caries,\" is a randomized clinical trial that will measure the effects of a parent-targeted text message intervention on the oral health of children less than six years old visiting Community Health Centers (CHC) for pediatric wellness visits. The abstract states: \"The benefits of text message interventions include the use of anywhere/ anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time.\" If the project is successful, Dr. Borrelli and Dr. Henshaw believe the research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and with low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the United States that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children less than six years old. Dr. Garcia's project is titled \"Using Social Networks to Improve Oral Health.\" The project's lead co-investigator is Dr. Brenda Heaton, Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy & Health Dr. Belinda Borrelli Dr. Michelle Henshaw Dr. Raul GarciaMembers of the GSDM and Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) community are working together on a 2015-2016 Education Pilot Grant from BUSM to implement a new program that will recruit dental students to train medical students in oral health. The three GSDM and BUSM community members who will be working on the new program are Dr. Annetty Soto, Geriatric Dental Medicine Fellow PGY2; Dr. Laura Kaufman, Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of General Dentistry at GSDM; and Dr. Ryan Chippendale, Clinical Assistant Professor at BUSM. The grant, titled \"Oral Health for older adults: Inter-professional training,\" funds an interprofessional educational (IPE) session for medical and dental students from BUSM and GSDM respectively. The purpose of these sessions is to teach fourth-year medical students oral health for older adults in collaboration with dental students. Case- based and hands-on learning are a hallmark of this session, with an emphasis on student interactions and active modeling of instruction techniques on how to conduct oral health assessments in non- dental settings. Older patients, especially those who are medically compromised or who have disabilities, are at greater risk for oral diseases that may further impair their overall health. The role of the physician is important in identifying older adults who need to be referred for regular oral health care. Previous research has shown that students trained with an IPE approach are more likely to become collaborative healthcare team members. These students are more likely to show respect and positive attitudes towards each other on future interprofessional teams and work together to improve patient outcomes. T o date, ten dental students and more than 25 medical students have participated in the sessions.GSDM AND BUSM WORK TOGETHER ON GERIA TRIC ORAL HEALTH PROJECT Services Research. The project seeks to fight the oral health disparities evident in one to five-year-old children who reside in public housing developments (PHD). The project will use Network Science methods, similar to those used in earlier work by CREEDD, to design and implement a network intervention, guided by diffusion of innovations theory. Dr. Garcia and Dr. Heaton will work together to evaluate their central hypothesis that \"controlled dissemination of information targeting changes in health behaviors through social networks will accelerate the uptake of knowledge, support the adoption of positive behavior change, and improve oral health status of caregivers and their young children.\" Similar approaches based in Network Science have been shown to increase sustainability of behavior change over and above that of individualized efforts. However, this is the first application of network science to address oral health problems. \"I am pleased to hear of the recent National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research grants awarded to Dr. Borrelli, Dr. Henshaw, and Dr. Garcia and Dr. Heaton for their projects that will attempt to lessen inequities in access to care and improve the oral health of minority children,\" said Dean Jeffrey W.

This event, titled 'From Pathways to Therapies,' brought together experts from across the country to present on current research, developments, challenges, and therapies in head and neck cancer. Well over one hundred faculty, clinicians, researchers, residents, and students attended the symposium. Welcoming remarks were delivered by Associate Dean for Research Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska; Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter; Boston University VP for Research Dr. Gloria Waters; and Dr. Robert Haddad, Disease Center Leader for the Head & Neck Oncology Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The symposium consisted of four sessions with presentations and interactive panel discussions: T argeting Pathways and Epidemiology; New T echnologies and Patient Care Delivery; Current and Future Therapies; and Clinical Problems and Challenges. Dr. Lewis C. Cantley, Director of the Cancer Center and Professor of Cancer Biology in Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, gave a stimulating keynote address on T argeting PI 3-Kinase for Cancer Therapy. \"We developed the symposium to bring basic scientists and clinicians together to discuss the latest developments in head and neck Cancer research and therapy,\" said Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska, Associate Dean for Research at the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine. \"It is my belief and hope that the interactions today and the development of new collaborations will expedite the development of new strategies for disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure.\" The symposium also included poster presentations on current head and neck cancer research. T wo winners were selected by a review committee and were presented with a certificate and monetary prize near the end of the event. The runner-up prize was awarded for \"Suppression of cell debris- stimulated head & neck cancer progression,\" presented by Molly Gilligan, a research assistant in Dr. Dipak Panigraphy's laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The first prize was awarded for \"PARP-1 functions during HPV infection and in head and neck carcinogenesis,\" presented by Dr. Andrew Sewell from the Department of Surgery and Otolaryngology, at Yale University. The day's closing remarks were given by Dr. Carter Van Waes of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health. Afterwards, attendees had an opportunity to mingle and network at the closing reception. Feedback from participants has been very positive, and the next Head and Neck Cancer Symposium will be held in 2017. \"This symposium was a wonderful event that brought together preeminent scientists and clinicians working towards a cure for head and neck cancers,\" said Dean Jeffrey W.

Dr. T rackman is a Professor and the Director of Graduate Programs in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology. Dr. Bais is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology. Dr. Ozdener completed his D.Sc. in Oral Biology in Dr. T rackman's lab. The cell uptake work was done by Gokhan Baris Ozdener and the in vivo work in mice was done by Dr. Manish Bais. Based on these findings, the researchers have designed modified forms of LOX-PP, and are working to determine if these new molecules are more effective at inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis than LOX-PP itself. In their study, the researchers were interested in working to develop the lysyl oxidase propeptide or a derivative as a chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. They investigated the pathways by which LOX-PP is taken up into cells, including an oral cancer cell line. More information about how LOX- PP enters cells could enable the researchers to eventually devise a method to alter the structure of LOX-PP to enhance its cell uptake and therefore its effectiveness to block cancer. In addition, this research has shown that that metastatic oral cancer cells that have been engineered to express LOX-PP grow slowly after being injected into mouse tongues, and have very diminished levels of metastasis. \"We think that these cumulative incremental steps have the potential to ultimately result in the development of a therapeutic based on the activity and structure of LOX-PP,\" said Dr. T rackman. \"Because LOX-PP is a natural product our hope is that our molecules will have low toxicity to normal cells.\" Dean Hutter remarked, \"I would like to congratulate Dr. T rackman, Dr. Bais, and Dr. Ozdener for their article published in the journal of Molecular Oncology, the quality of their work reflects the strong commitment to excellence in research that the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine maintains.\" The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) selected an article written by members of the Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC) community as one of the AACR Journals Editors' Picks for 2015. The article, \"A YAP/TAZ-Regulated Molecular Signature is Associated with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma\" was published in Molecular Cancer Research in June, 2015. The paper is the product of a collaboration between investigators at the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and the GSDM as part of the Etiology and Pathogenesis of Oral Cancer (EPOC) Affinity Research Collaborative (ARC), co-funded by the Evans Center for Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research and GSDM. The success of this paper is a testament to the \"team science\" approach embodied by the EPOC ARC, with contributions from multiple departments on campus. The lead author was Dr. Samantha Hiemer, a former PhD student in the Department of Biochemistry at BUSM. Dr. Hiemer completed her research in the laboratory of Dr. Xaralabos Varelas, Assistant Professor in Biochemisty at BUSM and senior author on the paper. Many of the other authors of the article are based in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at GSDM: Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska, Associate Dean for Research and Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology; Dr. Manish Bais, Research Associate Professor of Molecular Biology; Munirah Almershed, GSDM resident; and T revor Packer, former Research Study T echnician. An additional author is Dr. Vicki Noonan, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Oral Surgery in GSDM's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The remaining authors are based in the Section of Computational Biomedicine in BUMC's Department of Medicine: Dr. Stefano Monti, Associate Three GSDM researchers were awarded $20,000 each in Boston University Clinical and T ranslational Science Institute (CTSI) pilot funding. The GSDM researchers are Research Associate Professor Dr. Manish Bais, Research Associate Professor Dr. Ann Marie Egloff, and Professor Dr. John C. Samuelson. All three researchers are in GSDM's Department of Molecular & Cell Biology. The pilot grant competition, led by the Boston University CTSI and financially supported by GSDM, funds innovative translational research intended to obtain preliminary data for federal funding applications. Many outstanding proposals were submitted, and a panel of faculty members reviewed the proposals to decide which to select for funding. Dr. Bais received funding for his project, \"Lysine specific demethylase 1 inhibitor for improved personalized oral cancer therapy.\" In this project, Dr. Bais will investigate two effects of LSD1 on oral cancer. First, this project will determine if LSD1 sensitizes recurrent oral cancer stem cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patient- derived primary cells. Second, it will evaluate if inhibition of LSD1 sensitizes oral squamous cell tumors to radiation therapy in PDOX mouse models. The results of this research have strong translational potential, and could identify LSD1 as a novel drug sensitive target in FDA approved combination therapies. This is the second year that Dr. Bais has been awarded a CTSI grant.Dr. Egloff received funding for her project, \"Improving upon EGFR targeting for head and neck cancer using relevant models.\" This project will investigate the hypothesis that Her2 and ER signaling is vital for HNSCC growth and survival in the presence of the EGFR blockade. By developing and evaluating preclinical models, Dr. Egloff strives to improve assessment of candidate therapies and their potential for translation to the clinic. Dr. Michael Platt and Dr. Scharukh Jalisi, both members of the Department of Otolaryngology, will also be working on this project. Dr. Samuelson received funding for his project, \"Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers to kill oocysts of Cryptosporidium T oxoplasma.\" The coccidian parasites Cryptosporidium and T oxoplasma are important human pathogens, but in many situations hand washing\u2014the most effective way to prevent infection\u2014is not practical. Dr. Samuelson's project will investigate whether alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which have been shown to reduce spread of many pathogens in hospitals and other public places, might be effective against these parasites. \"I would like to congratulate the recipients of the CTSI pilot grant awards,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"While only three projects could be selected, many outstanding projects were submitted, highlighting the breadth and depth of research excellence at the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine.\" P APER PUBLISHED BY BUMC FACULTY , ST AFF AND STUDENTS SELECTED AS AACR Dr. Liye PhD candidate. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common form of cancer, and it is increasing in prevalence worldwide. There are still limited therapeutic strategies available for effective treatment of OSCC, so more understanding of the molecular cues that contribute to OSCC is vital to better treat this disease in the future. In this paper, the researchers showed that the transcriptional regulators YAP (YAP1) and TAZ (WWTR1) drive protumorigenic OSCC. determined that nuclear YAP and TAZ activity drives OSCC cell growth and movement in vitro and is required for OSCC tumor growth and metastatis in vivo. Overall, the study defines the regulation role of YAP/TAZ in OSCC and demonstrates the roles of nuclear YAP/TAZ activity in the onset and progression of OSCC.AACR is a nonprofit dedicated to preventing and curing cancer through research, education, communication, and collaboration. Among other activities, AACR publishes a portfolio of highly ranked peer-reviewed journals on cancer research. AACR's Editors' Picks are selected articles from each journal issue that the AACR editors have identified as a \"must read.\" Dr. Maria Kukuruzinska, Associate Dean for Research and Professor of Molecular & Cell Biology, said, \"I am delighted that this paper has been selected as an AACR Editors' Pick. It is a tribute to the team science approach of the EPOC ARC. This paper is an important contribution to the field of OSCC research, and I look forward to more discoveries from our ongoing collaborations.\" Dean Hutter remarked, \"I would like to extend my congratulation to all the researches at both BUSM and GSDM for the publication of their article in Molecular Cancer Research and for its selection as one of the AACR Journals Editors' Picks for 2015.\" (Pictured left, from top) Dr. Philip Trackman, Dr. Gokhan Baris Ozdener, Dr. Manish Bais Dr. Ann Marie Egloff Dr. John C.

More than 1,200 athletes from the Greater Boston area converged on Harvard University's Athletic Complex to participate in athletic events such as bocce, cycling, fishing, golf, sailing, and softball. Dentists and dental students were on hand at the Special Smiles clinic to offer oral screenings, health education and prevention services, and referrals to athletes who needed follow-up care. They also provided individually-fitted mouth guards to participating athletes. Special Smiles is just one component of the Healthy Athletes Program offered during the Summer Games. Others include Fit Feet (a podiatry clinic), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (including nutrition, bone health, smoking cessation, and sun safety), Healthy Hearing (an audiology clinic), MedFest (sports physicals and general checkups), and Special Olympics-Lions Clubs Opening Eyes (vision). The Special Smiles clinic was staffed by 60 GSDM volunteers who were joined by 60 volunteers from Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene, Harvard University School of Dental Medicine, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Mount Ida College, and T ufts University School of Dental Medicine. Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter said, \"Special Smiles is a fun and important event and I am proud that GSDM has participated in it for the past 12 years.\" He added, \"Thank you to all of the GSDM volunteers, and especially to Director of Alumni Relations & Annual Giving Ms. Stacey McNamee who works extremely hard every year to organize the Special Smiles event.\" Senior Global Clinical Adviser to Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Special Smiles Dr. Steve Perlman PEDO 76 worked with Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver to start the Special Smiles program in 1993. Dr. Perlman's passion to eliminate health care disparities for people with disabilities led to the founding of the Healthy Athletes program.

Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) participated in several events and activities during the 2015 GSDM Orientation Program. New Student Receptions New students were welcomed to the home of Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter and Mrs. Kathleen Hutter for six special new student receptions, which took place during a three-day period of the Orientation Program. Due to the high number of students, six separate receptions took place to accommodate everyone. Four receptions took place for DMD 19 students, two were on July 28 and two were on July 29. T wo receptions took place for AS DMD 17 students, both were on July 30. \"It is an absolute joy to have the incoming students to my home as an important part of their transition to the GSDM community, and I wish them the best of success,\" said Dean Hutter. \"Our students come from diverse and impressive backgrounds and Kathy and I cherish the opportunity to get to know each one of them more closely.\" Ice Cream Social New students marked the end of the first day of the two-week-long orientation program on Monday, July 27, 2015 in a very sweet way with an Ice Cream Social in the Hiebert Lounge. The ice cream social was sponsored for the ninth consecutive year by alumni couple Craig Allen and Nicole Paquette-Allen, both DMD 95, who met at their own GSDM pre-doctoral orientation. Various types of ice cream and toppings were set up on tables in the Hiebert lounge for the new students to make their own ice creams sundaes. Some special guests also attended the Ice Cream Social to mingle with the new students. These guests included: University Overseer and Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Shadi Daher, Assistant Professor in the Department of General Dentistry and President of the GSDM Alumni Association Bing Liu, and\u2014last but not least\u2014Boston University's beloved mascot, Rhett the Boston T errier. After getting their ice cream, the students socialized with each other and learned more about both student groups and resources \"The annual ice cream social offers new students a valuable opportunity to socialize, relax, and learn about student and other organizations before they embark on their orientation process,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"I would like to thank Drs. Craig Allen and Nicole Paquette-Allen for once again generously sponsoring this beneficial event!\" Professional Ceremony New students marked the end of their first week of orientation on Friday, July 31, 2015, at one of the most significant events in their educational careers, the annual Professional Ceremony. The students marched into the ceremony grounds, the T albot Green, and took their seats under a large white tent. Hundreds of friends and family members looked on and cheered as the DMD 19 and AS DMD 17 students participated in the 2015 Professional Ceremony. Assistant Dean of Students Dr. Joseph Calabrese welcomed the crowd under the packed tent. Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter as well as Boston University Medical Campus Provost and Boston University School of Medicine Dean Dr. Karen Antman delivered the opening remarks, while students anxiously anticipated receiving their Boston University pins. The Keynote Address was delivered by Professor in the Department of General Dentistry Dr. Carl McManama. Dr. McManama began his now 39 year dental career at GSDM as a Clinical Instructor in the Department of Operative Dentistry in 1976. He was later promoted to Clinical Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor. He Chaired the Department of Operative Dentistry from 1986 to 1995. After Dr. McManama's speech, Assistant Dean for Admissions and Associate Professor in Health Policy & Health Services Research Catherine Sarkis took to the podium to present the DMD Class of 2019 and AS DMD Class of 2017 to Dean Hutter. Five faculty members then stood on the stage to present the pins to the DMD 19 and AS 17 students. The faculty members were: Dr. Calabrese; Dr. Sarkis; Associate Professor in the Department of General Dentistry Dr. Stephen Dulong; Professor in the Department of Periodontology, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Professor in the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology Dr. Cataldo Leone; and Clinical Professor in the Department of General Dentistry and Faculty Liaison for the Advanced Standing Program Dr. Janet Peters. \"The Professional Ceremony is one of the most important moments in these students' dental educations here at GSDM,\" said Dean Hutter. \"I know that each of the students who received pins today will go on to make me, and everyone else at GSDM, very proud over the next four years.\" South End Scavenger Hunt After completing two weeks of Orientation, DMD 19 and AS DMD 17 students participated in a scavenger hunt around Boston's South End on August 8, 2015. The scavenger hunt was sponsored by the Boston University American Student Dental Association (ASDA). A total of 30 DMD 19 and AS DMD 17 students participated in the scavenger hunt, which was staffed by 21 upper-class volunteers from DMD and AS classes. \"The Scavenger Hunt took incoming students through the South End stopping by restaurants, parks and stores that students often visit,\" said President of the Boston University ASDA Chapter Mike Mayr DMD 16. \"At each stop, teams were given a list of tasks to complete and post to Instagram using the hashtags #buasda, #asdaoweek2015 and #asdanet for which they were awarded points.\" All the new students ended the Scavenger Hunt at Clery's Bar and Restaurant, where ASDA representatives announced the winning teams. The first place team won a coffee and cookie party from Flour Bakery and Caf\u00e9. \"The South End Scavenger Hunt allowed our new students to get to know each other better, while also getting to know the local community,\" said Dean Jeffrey W Hutter. \"I am very appreciative of the commitment that our BU ASDA Chapter has to sponsoring events like the South End Scavenger Hunt that enhance the bonds that hold our GSDM community together.\" Volunteering Across Boston A total of 41 new DMD 19 and AS DMD 17 students at GSDM volunteered at several different community service locations across Boston on August 6 and 7, 2015 during the first ever Orientation community service events. The service events allowed new students to become more acquainted with the local community by serving at three different local nonprofit organizations across Boston helping to complete nine separate projects. The 41 GSDM volunteers logged a total of 102 hours of service at three locations: Haley House, The Boys and Girls Club of Boston, and Pine Street Inn. \"I am very proud of all the DMD 19 and AS DMD 17 students who took time out of their busy schedules to give back to the community in much needed ways,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"It is with service events like these that GSDM solidifies its role as a pillar of the local community.\" It is an absolute joy to have the incoming students to my home as an important part of their transition to the GSDM community, and I wish them the best of success,\" said Dean Hutter. \"Our students come from diverse and impressive backgrounds and Kathy and I cherish the opportunity to get to know each one of them more closely. \u2014 DEAN HUTTER New DMD and AS students at a reception at Dean Jeffrey W.

Goldman Award for Distinguished Service at the 2015 GSDM Winter Faculty and Staff Meeting. Ms. Lebron started her career at GSDM in February of 2005, as a Receptionist in the Department of Oral Diagnosis. In March of 2007, Ms. Lebron took on a new role at GSDM. That position, which she still holds today, is Senior Administrative Secretary in the Department of Restorative Sciences & Biomaterials. Her responsibilities include acting as a primary liaison between the department and GSDM's many offices and departments, answering telephone inquiries, maintaining records, coordinating meetings and events, assisting the program director in monitoring the clinical accomplishments of faculty and residents, as well as many other crucial tasks that work toward ensuring the department runs with the utmost efficiency. Ms. Lebron is currently supervised by Dr. Alexander Bendayan, Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Restorative Sciences & Biomaterials and Clinical Director of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Prosthodontics; as well as Dr. Arthur Sun, Director ad interim of the Advanced Specialty Education Program in Prosthodontics and Clinical Professor of Restorative Sciences & Biomaterials. Speaking about his time working with Ms. Lebron, Dr. Sun said, \"Luz is resourceful and always willing to help residents and faculty. She is an invaluable asset to the Department and a treasured colleague for me personally. We are all fortunate to have the opportunity to work with her on a daily basis.\" Ms. Luz Lebron receiving the 2015 Henry M. Goldman Award for Distinguished Service with Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter British-based company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) released its second annual World University Rankings by Subject for Dentistry on March 22, 2016. In these new rankings, the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine (GSDM) placed 24th globally and eighth in the United States. In the first ever QS World University Rankings by Subject for dentistry, which were released in April 2015, GSDM placed 30th globally and eighth nationally. The 2016 rankings placed GSDM six positions ahead of the 2015 global ranking and in the same place as the 2015 national ranking. The QS World University Rankings by Subject ranks universities from around the world in 42 fields with a score of 0 to 100. The rankings are designed to be utilized by prospective students hoping to identify top schools in their chosen field. While the QS World University Rankings by Subject have been published annually since 2011, 2015 marked the first time that dentistry was added as a subject. Prior to this, a reputable ranking of world and U.S. dental schools had not existed. \"I am pleased to see that GSDM has moved up in the QS World University Rankings,\" said Dean Jeffrey W. Hutter. \"However, while moving up six positions in these rankings in just one year is certainly an impressive feat, we must continue to work hard to ensure that GSDM keeps improving its reputation on both a global and national stage as we achieve our vision of being the premier institution promoting excellence in dental education, research, oral healthcare, and community service in order to improve the overall health of the global population.\" T o create the final 0-100 score, QS averages a 0-100 score for four categories: academic reputation, employer reputation, research citations per paper, and \"h-index\" score.GSDM MOVES UP SIX POSITIONS IN 2016 QS WORLD UNIVERSITY RANKINGS BY SUBJECTBoston Univ ersity Chapter All proceeds will support our amazing students as they become the latest in a long line of distinguished Alumni.Show the world your GSDM pride and support the future of our profession!66 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 group practice SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 67group practice Connected. Diverse. Enthusiastic. Social. Immediate. Millenials are becoming an ever increasing segment of the dental workforce. With more than 90 million born between 1980 and 2000, they are a larger group than the baby boomer generation. And they will have an enormous impact on the field of dentistry. Coming at a time when the American Dental Association considers the profession \"in transition,\" the new generation has already changed the playing field. For starters, this group of young people is digital, and they expect digital in every aspect of their lives. Constantly connected, they embrace new technology and look for it in a work setting. GSDM's recent transition to a completely seamless digital environment fits perfectly with this generation, representing as it does a new model of education and clinical care for students who have always lived in this world. They are social, and could easily have 500-1000 Facebook friends, along with an Instagram feed, and a range of other apps. They are used to sharing all aspects of their lives digitally. Many prefer a closer, more personal relationship with patients, and social media is part of this new equation. In fact in many cases, the millennials are able to serve as a valuable resource for dental offices still not conversant in social media. They are caring and empathetic. GSDM students participate in mission trips to developing countries. Our students have volunteered at a homeless shelter during orientation week, and they sponsor countless volunteer activities during the year. Last year's graduating class raised $100K in just three days through social media for a fellow graduate fighting cancer. They excel in culturally competent care, and the top reason they give for going into dentistry is to help people. They are diverse and care deeply about diversity in their personal and professional lives. Graduating classes at GSDM are now equally divided between male and female. This is a staggering change from 20 or 30 years ago, when the majority of dental students were male. Given this change and then spending four years of dental school together, many graduates meet their spouses at school. It's very common for dual dental professional couples to enter the workforce directly from school. They are collaborative. Growing up playing team sports, educated in an environment of team-based learning, and socializing in the company of others, they like to be in groups. They have a strong commitment to wellness and health. College gyms are impossibly full, student nutrition and wellness clubs are everywhere, and there's a priority attached to healthy lifestyles. Prior generations see a much greater respect for work/life balance. After their schooling, they seek employment that allows them this balance. They have a sense of immediacy. They want to get things done, quickly. They've spent their lives with instant web searches, speedy food deliveries, instantaneous text messaging, and instant banking arranged on their cell phones. They're used to and expect constant communication and feedback from their friends, professors, and work colleagues. They are the new face of dentistry. And increasingly, they are choosing to enter a group practice work environment. As strong testimony, we sought out GSDM graduates now working in group practices. We spoke to four recent graduates from the 2014 and 2015 classes, all working for a large multi- location multispecialty group practice, and asked them about their career choices. We also interviewed Sven Grail DMD 90, MBA 90, co-founder and CEO of Altima Dental, the largest group practice in Canada, as well as Ron Weissman PROS 77, co-founder of Gentle Dental. We also spoke with Geoff Ligibel, CEO of Gentle Dental, the region's largest dental group practice and single largest employer of GSDM graduates. And we asked David Russell, Assistant Dean for Patient Care, to give an update on the school's group practice educational model.

His uncle is Adib Lakkis DMD 93, so he grew up with dentistry in the family. Abe says, \"Every time I'd go into his practice, there was something new, and he was always talking about dental procedures. I myself wanted to do something that had a lot of evolving aspects to it. I shadowed him in college and I liked it, and ever since then I've been interested in dentistry.\" Abe went to GSDM at the urging of his uncle, and he is now an Associate Dentist at a large multispecialty group practice in Braintree, Massachusetts. How would you define your generation? My class was a lot more social than I expected. We were all very friendly. And we all knew that everybody hates to go to the dentist. So we all went to dental school feeling that we could change this a little bit. We wanted people\u2014patients\u2014to understand everything. And we wanted to quell their nerves. T oday, I spend the first 15 minutes of every appointment poking fun at myself in front of the patients just to loosen them up and make them forget that they're here in the first place. And I have five or six good friends who are the same way. We went through four years of dental school, and I feel that we're a lighter-hearted generation. We're more open to change. We connect through a sense of humor. Why did you choose a group practice upon graduating? As a younger generation, we're more sociable. So just being in an office alone, secluded, never sounded very appealing. Some of my best friends are specializing in orthodontics and endodontics. And the fact that we could work together in one place sounded more appealing to me than working solo. Having the orthodontist, the oral surgeon, and the endodontist in one office is very convenient, for us and for the patients. No matter what the patient needs, he or she can get it in one place. And you can consult with your colleagues right there as well. It makes everything easier, for us and for the patient. And you learn so much! I've learned so much from the oral surgeon that I am actually considering going back to school for oral surgery!Adam Robbins DMD 15 grew up loving to go the dentist. He simply couldn't understand why his classmates didn't share this feeling. He always knew he wanted to go into a medical field, with dentistry definitely on the radar. Adam is currently an Associate Dentist at Gentle Dental in Worcester, Massachusetts. How would you define your generation? I think we're the most social generation ever. I also think we're skeptical. I feel that the orthodoxy of how things were done in the past\u2014\"this is how things were done\" and \"recalling the good old days\"\u2014doesn't work for us. We use our smartphones for everything. We're technologically advanced. It may be true for all people now, but certainly with millennials, I read recently that we're outsourcing our memory. We outsource so much through google. We like to have answers now. I think that twenty years ago, if you wanted to know the answer to something, you could look it up in journals or an index and that would be cumbersome. But now, there's so much easier access to sources and information. And it makes you a better practitioner. Why did you choose a group practice upon graduating? When you look at a lot of professions, not just dentistry, you can't just hang up a shingle and start working. Y ou need support, agroup around you. I wasn't going to be comfortable as a solo practitioner; I like being able to ask questions of my colleagues who are nearby. I like being able to work with people. The dental director in my practice is excellent. She's very helpful and knowledgeable. I like being able to just pop into her office and ask a question. Having colleagues as a resource is part of the reason I decided to go into a group practice in the first place. I have probably less student debt than some of my classmates. But it's something that affected my decision about what I'd do after graduation. When you look at the rising cost of tuition and rising student debt, they become an issue if you want to take on another loan to start your own practice. It wasn't the most important reason, but it was important to have technology in an office. I'm really thankful for the opportunities that I had at GSDM to get a digital education. David Ziegler DMD 14 was a research assistant at Brigham and Women's Hospital for four years before attending GSDM. He always knew he wanted to be a dentist. He finds it very rewarding: \"When you're seeing a person who's in pain, and you can alleviate the symptoms right away, that's just very gratifying,\" he says. David is currently an Associate Dentist at a large group multispecialty practice in Attleboro, Massachusetts. How would you define your generation? I think we're a team generation. My class in particular was a very tight-knit group. A lot of our instructors told us that in previous years, there was much more of a competitive environment. But our class was definitely all about the dissemination of information for everyone. We wanted all of us to have the best GPA ever. And I think that sort of mentality, because we are all dentists and are trying to provide good care for people, is the best learning environment. I think that when you can draw from your resources, and talk with a lot of different people, you are better guided onto a multispecialty group practice path. Quite a few of my classmates, many I'm close to, have gone in this direction. Why did you choose a group practice upon graduating? I knew I wanted a full-time position, which can be tough to find fresh out of school. With this group practice, I had the opportunity to be full-time in a single office. Even though this firm has offices all over, I'm able to be in just one location. So, I was very happy with that. I know that to progress you need to see patients, and the ability to see patients for 40 hours a week at the get-go was huge for me. The group practice model, as a whole, was probably the best learning environment for me. It's multispecialty. I can sit down with an oral surgeon or with an endodontist or periodontist regarding a case and that's great. Y ou have the patient right there, and you're able to confer with others and discuss treatment planning for the patient. It's been invaluable. Student debt was definitely a factor for me, and why I didn't choose a specialty at this point in my career. I think that people really need to consider this\u201420 years ago when you graduated and you were in debt, you could still potentially get loans to buy into a practice. Now, I feel that that's not a feasible option. I'm also interested in doing everything in dentistry, in trying everything, and I felt that a multi-specialty group practice was the best way to meet with the specialists and talk with them. I'm able to pick their brains whenever I have questions about things, and I get their years of experience.Andrew Mancini DMD 15 grew up in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, right down the street from where he practices today. He went into dentistry because he loves medicine and wanted to help people. He says he grew up watching medical shows on television, and was hooked. Prior to dental school, he shadowed two medical professionals in Lynnfield. One was a dentist, Dr. Matt Giamarco, in a large multispecialty group practice. Andrew had once been a Little League umpire, and got to know Dr. Giamarco there. Now Andrew works in Dr. Giamarco's office helping the very people he grew up with, and serving his childhood community. He finds it rewarding that many former Little League baseball players are current patients. According to Andrew, \"Dentistry is not a job; it's fun. I have a lot of fun every day. Y ou can make a difference in people's lives, so that's why I became a dentist.\" How would you define your generation? Quick. Everything's got to be immediate. They want it now. Everything's on the phone. It's on the computer - well, it's not even on the computer anymore, because the computer's too big and bulky. T echnology, apps, how you get your news, how you get your food, how you do everything has changed so much since the last generation. Social media is pretty important and that's the number one way to connect with somebody right now. I think that a lot of things have opened up between the older generations and our generation. We grew up with different values, different society than older generations. More things are accepted now, and that's a good thing. Everything's rapidly changing to be more your own person and do what makes you happy. Why did you choose a group practice upon graduating? Group practice is important because everything's in one building. People like simplicity. They like being able to come to the same place and have all their needs taken care of in one area. They don't want to go to 10 different offices for treatment. And dentistry is better that way. We can communicate with each other. We're here every day with each other. We know how each person likes to work, and we know each situation. It's definitely a nice relationship among the doctors here, and that is ultimately going to be a benefit in the treatment of the patient. We're a team, and it's a team effort, and we know how each other operates. That translates into better care in the end. One of the other great things about this particular practice is that I have the opportunity to work for somebody who's been my mentor for a long time, Dr. Giamarco. I can sit down with him and go over things when I need to. SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 71group practice / innovators 70 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016Sven Grail Altima Dental T oronto, Canada Sven Grail DMD 90 MBA 90 is the co-founder of the largest dental group practice in Canada. Currently Altima Dental and Medical groups have over 80 locations across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, with 2,000 employees and one million patient visits. Sven is also a longtime employer of GSDM graduates, with Toronto a popular location for our alumni. There are currently more than 200 alumni living in the metropolitan Toronto area. Sven was the only DMD student to simultaneously earn an MBA from Boston University during his DMD studies. Back in Canada, he earned a Juris Doctorate (J.D.) in Law, making him one of our most educated alumni. Sven Grail Tell about how you started Altima Dental. Altima really evolved over time. I was a healthcare provider with an interest in the business side, but there was no clear- cut model to follow. In 1990, multi-location, multispecialty practices didn't really exist. We started with just one office, and now have offices all across Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia. We've also expanded into medical offices. We recognized at the outset it was critical to hire a team of expert accountants, human resources professionals, and information technology professionals, in order to subscribe to the best practices in each area of administration. Why do you think you've been so successful? We allow our associates to focus on dentistry. We can provide them with security, consistency, and flexibility while freeing them up for dentistry. Many find that they have a great deal more earning potential, as well. Our philosophy is that the happier the patient and staff members and associates are, the more successful the office will be. The multi-site, multispecialty model is one that is growing in many countries. Large group practices (DSO's) are expanding by at least 20 percent annually, which will lead to big changes in the dental environment in the coming decade. Generally, most dental offices don't spend much time asking patients if they are satisfied. At Altima, we run focus groups and surveys\u2014we want to know what the patient experience really is and what patients are looking for. We have found that our patients consistently rate their care at 91 to 94 percent in overall satisfaction. The advantage of being a patient in a larger multi-location group practice is consistency across the network; you know what you can expect from us, regardless of the office you visit. We can provide emergency care at any office, and it is easy to continue care if you move. What advice do you have for current graduates? One of the things I see in the new graduates we hire is a desire to emulate a particular person or style, and my suggestion would be to dig more deeply than that. Make sure that you fully understand who and what you are emulating and be careful before jumping to conclusions. Finding a mentor is very important. The other piece that is critical is continual improvement through continuing education that is so central to dentistry. That commitment to continual improvement in dentistry can open one up to continual improvement in other areas of life.What are the biggest changes in graduates in the last 10 years? I think the current generation of millennials is looking for a larger team of peers when they make a career decision. They are definitely more comfortable in groups, and see the advantage of working in successful groups. I think this is a big difference from prior generations. Dentistry used to be very much about the individual practitioner and doing work on your own. Now, graduates want to work and share their experiences with a team of peers. This mirrors what we're seeing in the patient experience, where everything is shared online through social media. These new graduates are very much a part of that culture. We're also seeing a lot of dual professional couples who want to control the hours they're working. They are looking for more variability in what \"full time\" means. So, work life balance is important to this generation. They are technologically advanced, and expect to use the latest technology. They want to use cone beam, digital x-rays, and CAD/CAM in their practices. These types of technologies are facilitating quicker collaboration and allowing groups to be more supportive. They use technology in every aspect of their lives, and they bring this to their professional environments. We find new grads are not only tech-savvy, they're motivated. They're motivated and they're confident about going out and treating patients. Dentistry used to be very much about the individual practitioner and doing work on your own. Now, graduates want to work and share their experiences with a team of peers.\" 72 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 group practice / innovators SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 73 Ron Weissman Gentle Dental Waltham, Massachusetts Tell a little about how you started your practice. It was about 1978, and I start experimenting with some advertising and marketing. My office was on the fourth floor of a medical arts building, so it was critical to work at bringing patients to my office. If someone was down on the street and needed my services, they would have no way of knowing that I was up on the fourth floor. So, I started doing some marketing. This was after the Federal T rade Commission decision that allowed healthcare providers to advertise. I brought new patients in, and soon grew out of my space and built a second office across the street. I had an associate, and I was just running out of room again. I had been vacationing in Florida and always saw dental offices in shopping plazas. And really, there was nothing like that in Massachusetts. One of my patients owned a shopping plaza, and I decided to rent a space there. Essentially, what happened was I discovered that marketing was very successful at bringing in new patients. However, after you brought them in, you still needed to earn their trust. They still had to like your office. They had to like the way you dealt with them. They had to feel that you were trustworthy, and you had to do good dentistry. T raditional dental practices had initially a narrow referral base, and as people became patients, they referred their friends. We started out one patient at a time. But when you have a greater influx of patients, then you have more missionaries telling people, \"Oh, my dentist is great. I really liked him. He did great work for me.\" So, it accelerates the traditional process of word-of-mouth by bringing in more patients who then become your word-of-mouth referrers. So, once I had discovered that marketing would bring people in and give us a chance to meet them and show them how good we were, then I said, \"OK, we should be able to do this again.\" And we did. So, when did you become a multispecialty organization? We were a multispecialty office almost from the beginning. The first Gentle Dental had an orthodontist and an oral surgeon, and eventually, a periodontist. Multispecialty group dental practices were not the norm back in the '70s and '80s. And I think that aspect of dentistry just makes a lot of sense. No physicians practice by themselves anymore. They're all in groups, and they're all in hospital settings, or in professional buildings attached to hospitals, where right next door are the various specialties. Y ou don't have to go very far, you just have to walk down the hall. And we felt that made sense for dentistry. From an economic point of view, from a convenience point of view, and really, to practice excellence in dentistry, if the general dentist can talk to the specialist\u2014because they're right there and can go over things\u2014then it makes dentistry much better for everyone involved, especially the patients. Why do you think you've been so successful? I think it's because we were dental-owned and operated, and our goal was to earn our living by doing dentistry, whereas a lot of the other group practices at that time were not dental-owned. The early groups were mainly stock market plays. They were trying to build a company quick, and take it public. So most of the dental companies that went public, with the exception of one or two, failed. I think the most important difference for us was that our goal was really to do dentistry. What advice do you have for current graduates? I certainly recommend that anybody who graduates from dental school either take a GPR, or just keep taking continuing education courses. Y ou need to learn things. I used to take courses on weekends, and on Monday, I would try to utilize some of the things that I had learned. So, when people initially come to us, especially out of school, they come in as associates, and it's important to hone their skills. And at some point, if they are happy with the environment, the facility, the patient flow, how they're treated, and the camaraderie, and they are succeeding, then we may offer them a position as a director. And a director has the ability to have an equity position, where they have some ownership, not of the individual practice, but of our whole company. That's another aspect that has led to our success. The fact that our doctors could be owners and equity partners, so then they would have a stake in the success of the business. What are the biggest changes in graduates, in the last 10 years? The thing about students and new graduates today is they're very enthusiastic about the technology. It's exciting to them, and they're tremendous aides to treatment planning and to performing the dentistry. There's great equipment. I love digital X-rays. I love the fact that you can throw them up on the screen and you can blow them up, and you can change the contrast. I think digital impressions are terrific. I think knowing how to use all this new equipment and knowing about the new materials are advantages that the newer students definitely have. And they're all enthusiastic. They're excited about practicing and excited about dentistry, and I think that they have a good compass\u2014 wanting to help people\u2014and do the very best they can. Ron Weissman PROS 77 has always been ahead of the curve. Entrepreneur. Marketing Visionary. Prosthodontist. One of the very first dentists to market directly to patients, Ron had early success that led to the creation of the region's most recognizable group practice, Gentle Dental. His company is the largest single employer of GSDM alumni\u2014since 1982, 200 alumni. Forty GSDM alumni are now practicing in Gentle Dental offices across New England....they're all enthusiastic. They're excited about practicing and excited about dentistry, and I think that they have a good compass...\" 74 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 75group practice / collaboration group practice / collaboration Talk about the relationship with GSDM. Obviously, the foundation of the company was laid by Dr. Weissman, our co-founder. We have 40 BU trained dentists right now. We've recruited a total of 200 BU trained dentists and specialists since Gentle Dental was founded in 1982. BU is obviously a huge part of the success of our organization, and will continue to be. We'll certainly continue to have opportunities in the Boston metropolitan area, but we're growing beyond that and plan to hire a lot more BU alums as we expand. We just get great, great people coming out of BU. We get people that have a real passion for caring for their patients, and people who have been really successful in our model. BU is one of the cornerstones of the organization in terms of our historical success and we plan to build on that going forward. Why do you think that there are more GSDM graduates entering a group practice out of school now? I think one of the predominant reasons is there's a real difference in work-life balance for people working in a DSO (Dental Support Organization) versus owning their own office. I have conversations all the time with people who have their own dental office and I hear, pretty consistently, 'I work really hard as a dentist. I enjoy interacting with my patients. I'm open four days a week or five days a week seeing my patients. And then I'm spending my weekends and evenings making sure that the payroll gets paid and figuring out what kind of an ad I should place in the local newspaper. I'm figuring out how I'm going to hire a new front desk person because my old one left, and figuring out what I need to gather for my accountants so they can do my financials.' I think the next important advantage is the peer network. We believe that having a large group of dentists\u2014we're essentially a partnership of dentists and we get our dentists together often to discuss best practices\u2014is beneficial. And having multiple dentists working in an office allows people to review cases together and really sort of grow, professionally, by working closely with their peers on a daily basis. This seems very attractive to the current generation. I think technology is a huge part of what's driving the dental industry in a good direction. There are so many technologies available today that allow people to provide better dentistry. Y ou have digital images, and there is so much more clarity in those images; you can see what's going on in a patient's mouth, and you can help educate the patient on what's going on in their mouth. Y ou know, these things have gotten much easier; taking advantage of the technology available today makes everybody better, and we've found that BU students are up to speed on these new technologies and are definitely ahead of the curve in that regard. How would you characterize this generation? I think this generation are absolutely leaders in technology. I think they have a real passion and interest to do right by their patients. I think it's always refreshing when you have young dentists coming out of dental school that are very excited to go and actually get to see patients and develop those types of relationships. I think that's a real positive with this generation. Where do you see the DSO environment going in the future? I think you're going to see a lot of growth in the DSO world. We are not alone in being on a fairly aggressive growth trajectory. There are a number of other DSOs throughout the U.S. who've been growing at a very rapid clip. We'll continue to grow by building brand new offices. And we're also doing affiliations with people that have offices and are interested in becoming part of the organization, so then we'll be growing rapidly through that. Ultimately, there is great opportunity for hiring GSDM general dentists and specialists. We value our close relationship with the school and are very excited to hire more graduates.Ultimately, there is great opportunity for hiring GSDM general dentists and specialists.

He was previously a Director in Houlihan Lokey's Healthcare Group. During his career, he has been involved with a range of healthcare providers, including dental groups, physician groups, and hospitals, as well as with companies providing services to healthcare providers, including healthcare IT, outsourcing, and distribution.Back row (l-r): Dr. Wendy Heinstein (DMD 14), Dr. Prachi Sontakke (DMD Dr. Ronald (PROS 77), Payne (DMD 93), Dr. Roua Dr. Christine Dr. Mythili Prakash (DMD 96), Dr. Ibrahim Lakkis (DMD Dr. Ethan Chase (DMD 97), Dr. Mohamad Kamel (DMD 13), Dr. Jonathan Millen (DMD 96), Dr. Adam Robbins (DMD 15), Dr. Andrew Mancini (DMD 15), Dr. David Ziegler 14) Not Mohamed Amer (DMD 14), Dr. Adam Barsoum (DMD 15), Dr. David Buczak (DMD 07), (DMD 06), 07, Prasadini Shetty (DMD 09)76 IMPRESSIONS SPRING 2016 SPRING 2016 IMPRESSIONS 77group practice / update gsdm volunteer leadership In July 2014, GSDM launched a major shift in its clinical care and educational curriculum by incorporating a Group Practice Model into all of its pre-doctoral clinical care. This model is meant to create a sense of continuity of care for our patients within a patient- centered clinical education construct for faculty-guided, student- provided, high-quality oral health care. Dr. David Russell, Assistant Dean for Patient Care, helped design this new teaching model and was responsible for leading its implementation. He shares his thoughts on current students and why the group practice model in their professional practice is becoming more popular as a career path for young graduates. First, talk a little about how the shift to a group practice model is going at GSDM? I speak to students all the time, and our students are very happy with the new model. I feel that we selected wonderful educators and dentists to be the Group Practice Leaders (GPL) and the general supervising faculty. And they give the students the right mix of patients for their clinical education. There are some interesting times in the dental school, and one of them happens in the fall of the senior year. I have never ever been at a school\u2014except for this last year\u2014where there's not an outcry by the students that they don't have enough patients. They actually almost always have enough, but they are just worried that they don't! Another thing that the Group Practice Model has accomplished is that the Group Practice Leaders are the ones screening every single patient who comes into this school. That is an amazing thing. We get somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-70 patients a week here. And patients like the idea that there is somebody in charge of their care, and that's the Group Practice Leader. Group Practice Leaders bring all patients in, and then they're assigned based on need, and that patient feels as though there is a central individual in charge. Whereas in dental education, sometimes \u2014 in years past \u2014 it might not have felt like that. This central person is the Group Practice Leader. How do you find this current generation different than the previous one? They're totally digital. And with GSDM, we're the first dental school to offer a seamlessly digital dental environment, which our students are embracing. We're seeing dental graduates taught CAD/CAM, digital dentistry, milling of crowns, 3D imaging and things like that. And when they look at career choices, they're looking for a practice that has state-of-the art equipment and digital technology. From what I've seen, this new generation doesn't mind working hard. But my sense is, they tend not to enjoy the ancillary 'stuff' that one would be required to do in running a private practice. They don't mind working long hours. But they want to be able to go in and practice and focus on their passion, which is dentistry. There is also a sense of immediacy with this generation. Maybe it's fueled by the fact that they're so wired to the internet and social media. Anything can be looked up in seconds. And perhaps that means that a certain impatience, if you will, is in their DNA. I think that they've become accustomed to group-based learning, and this makes them much more interested in a team environment. I think that for this generation there's a lot of comfort in that. They just seem more social. Social networking has had a large impact - what their friends and peers are doing is important to them. Why do you think we're seeing more alumni join group practices when they graduate? There is a common theme in multispecialty groups, and that is that they're more of a social environment, which means more peers. Y ou can be working with a patient, and explaining a treatment plan, and then all of a sudden\u2014just outside the operatory\u2014the periodontist walks by. Y ou're on a very good first-name basis with that periodontist, so you ask, 'Oh, can you come in and say hello to Mrs. So-and-so?' And suddenly, you've got a collaboration that you couldn't have with a consultant across town. There is an immediacy to that sort of treatment. Y ou can have, in one operatory across the hallway, the oral surgeon. Y ou can have the endodontist. Y ou can have the periodontist. And patients want and like that. There's a lot of camaraderie. There's a lot of fun. There have actually been some studies that have shown that the quality of work improves, because there are so many other people's eyes on it. There's no doubt that economics is also a part of it. I think the graduates are very conscious of student loan repayment which starts quickly after graduation. It's seen as an investment, and there's no question that it's a wonderful job to have, being a dentist. In fact, you know the U.S. News and World Report and a few others have come out saying it's the best job in the in the country right now. If you think about a dental school, it is really a huge multispecialty group practice. The funny thing is, this is the way dental schools have been for 75 years. Then historically, as soon as they graduate, they have wanted to open their own practice. That can feel insular, especially for this generation. I think society has changed and is demanding one-stop shopping. Let's face it, they even sell vegetables at Walmart these days!

I am an alum of both the Post-Graduate Prosthodontics and the Advanced Standing Programs, and I couldn't be more proud of our School and the strides we have made to bring digital technology and the Group Practice Model to our students and patients. As the saying goes, \"Time flies when you are having fun!\" I can't believe that almost fourteen years ago I went to Germany and first learned to work with CEREC technology. It was so much different than it is today. It also seems like a dream come true that in the spring of 2014, Dr. Russell Giordano and I were frantically organizing CEREC training sessions for our clinical and preclinical faculty with minimal numbers of CEREC Bluecams, preparing for the arrival of more than sixty units in the fall of 2014! We have come such a long way since then. Many faculty members are still amazed by what the CAD/ CAM technology can do, but our students take it for granted. As millennials, they are \"digital natives.\" When I asked a DMD2 student a few weeks ago how exciting it must be to be using this technology in his preclinical course, he looked at me a little perturbed and said that he doesn't know any other way to be learning how to cut tooth preparations. It dawned on me that this is their reality. Millennials expect to find ways in which to achieve their goals quickly and efficiently using technology. T exting, Googling, T weeting were not in my vocabulary growing up! Now that CAD/CAM is fully entrenched into the curriculum, and more and more students are choosing to deliver CEREC milled restorations, we have our next challenge: Cone Beam CT (CBCT). Many of our new patients going forward, especially those who will be receiving implants, will have as their primary radiograph a CBCT scan. Faculty and students will have to learn how to read and use the scans for diagnosis and treatment planning of implants. We are currently developing a new preclinical curriculum to teach students how to plan implants using CBCT software and then merging this file with that of an intraoral scan of the patient's arch where the proposed CEREC restoration has been designed. The merging of these files will allow our students to design and mill an accurate surgical guide in our own milling machines. Our DMD students, in the near future, will be placing implants using these milled surgical guides. This is so thrilling for our students! GSDM is truly leading the way with changes in the curriculum for Digital Dentistry and the digital work flow in our T reatment Center. Unlike many other schools that have created small programs where a limited number of students can access this technology, all of our students have the ability to use this on a daily basis. The Group Practice Model, which was initiated at the same time as CAD/CAM at our school in 2014, has been instrumental in keeping our students busy in the T reatment Center. The Group Practice Model includes the post- graduate residents to make up referral bases and a vertically integrated team, much like the description of the group practices that many of our graduates will join. Statistics from our surveys of graduates two years out of school and the American Dental Education Association's surveys of new graduates indicate that increasingly, graduates are joining group practices. There are many practical reasons for this and some of them include financial concerns, social pressures and patient demand for one-stop shopping. I am honored and humbled with the opportunity to serve as Chair of the Department of General Dentistry during this time of innovation and change. This could not happen without the foresight of our Dean, Dr. Jeffrey W. Hutter, and all the collaborative efforts between all my wonderful colleagues here at GSDM, which has been like a second home to me for more than 30 years. Wishing everyone all the best, Celeste V. Kong DMD, CAGS Professor and Chair Department of General DentistryThe Last Word "}
