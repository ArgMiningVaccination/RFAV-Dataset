Someone told me that acupuncture can help her and treat other skin disorders. Should I look more into this for her? Would you recommend it in her case? 36 Answers [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Absolutely. I personally would use a formula I make for topical application called Nourishing Ointment that I learned in school. It works wonders. But acupuncture would be a nice adjunct therapy to that to help calm the immune system and balance the body/mind/spirit system. If you decide to tray acupuncture, make sure you start with a fully trained acupuncturist (not an MD or Chiropractor that did minimal hours of training to get a license). [Ms. Janice Fluellen Campbell](/Expert/977339-Janice-Fluellen-Campbell)Acupuncturist Baltimore, MD Acupuncture can help and it is likely that a practitioner will also prescribe herbs to help as well.

[Jennifer Kolter](/Expert/81226363-Jennifer-Kolter)Acupuncturist Henderson, MN We have seen a few cases of eczema in our office. Most skin issues come from a deeper cause.

[Mr. Michael andrew Chow](/Expert/3559303-Michael-andrew-Chow)Acupuncturist Lake Elsinore, CA Chinese medicine and acupuncture can view skin disorders almost in another dimension. Some conditions of eczema may be more related to seasonal allergies where others may be related to diet. All of which acupuncture can influence for a healthier individual too. I would recommend to see the primary first to rule out any infections, but the acupuncture treatment would most likely incorporate herbal supplements or moxibustion for a synergistic and effective outcome.

There are formulas to help this kind of issue. They may be taken internally and applied topically as well. Acupuncture can be helpful for skin issues, but probably as an adjunct to the herbal medicine, and dietary modifications. Also, consider the use of a Halotherapy (salt) spa, or perhaps epsom salt bath.

[Zen Tuan](/Expert/1857739-Zen-Tuan)Acupuncturist Pasadena, California Acupuncture coupled with herbs can be very effective in treating various skin conditions, including eczema and dry skin.

[Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL I do not know your mothers particular case, but I do know that I have treated many skin disorders with acupuncture or with herbal salves, dietary changes, lifestyle changes, etc. The treatment would depend on the differential diagnosis, so bring your mother in to a Licensed Acupuncturist if she is interested in pursuing this route. Make sure the practitioner is a Licensed Acupuncturist and call a few to find one that you feel is a good fit for your mother. You can check NCCAOM.ORG and search by zip code, then call some in your area and see who you feel you can work with. Good luck. Good luck. [Abe Shahabelmolki](/Expert/81226414-Abe-Shahabelmolki)Acupuncturist Sarasota, FL According to traditional Chinese medicine any rash or redness of skin such as eczema is due to too much internal heat. Acupuncture and hebal medicine can help her condition to cool off her system. Stay away from spicy foods, sugar, alcoholic drinks, sodas. Organic coconut oil helps with dryness. Drink plenty of fresh filtered water. Less stress. Massage, yoga, meditation for relaxation. Thanks [Rosemarie Allen](/Expert/81226282-Rosemarie-Allen)Acupuncturist Jacksonville, FL Yes, Acupuncture can treat skin disorders. However, acupuncture treats these condition indirectly by addressing the internal imbalances that caused the skin disorder in the first place. Skin disorders can be caused by a variety of internal imbalances stemming from the immune system, blood, emotions, heat, stress, toxins and more. I myself, have worked on patients with this type of condition with great success. however treatment may take some time depending on how long your mother in law has had the condition. I would highly recommend using Acupuncture in her case. Find a licensed Acupuncture Physician in your area and help your Mother in law get some relief. "}
