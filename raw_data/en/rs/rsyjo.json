Participants discussed optimal uses of a CMV vaccine, aspects of clinical studydesign, and the value of additional research. A universal childhood CMV vaccine could potentially rapidlyreduce cCMV disease, as infected children are sources of viral transmission to seronegative and seropos-itive mothers. A vaccine administered to adolescents or adult women could also reduce cCMV disease bymaking them immune prior to pregnancy. Clinical trials of CMV vaccines in women should evaluateprotection against cCMV infection, an essential precursor of cCMV disease, which is a more practi-cal and acceptable endpoint for assessing vaccine effects on maternal-fetal transmission. Clinical trialsof vaccines to evaluate prevention of CMV disease in stem cell transplant recipients could use CMVviremia at a level triggering pre-emptive antiviral therapy as an endpoint, because widespread use ofpre-emptive and prophylactic antivirals has rendered CMV-induced disease too rare to be a practicalendpoint for clinical trials. In solid organ transplant patients, CMV-associated disease is sufciently com-mon for use as a primary endpoint. Additional research to advance CMV vaccine development shouldinclude identifying factors that predict fetal loss due to CMV, determining age-specic incidence andtransmission rates, dening the mechanism and relative contributions of maternal reactivation and re-infection to cCMV disease, developing assays that cCMV and identify-ing clinically relevant immune response parameters to CMV (including developing validated assaysthat could assess CMV antibody avidity) that could lead to the establishment of immune correlates ofprotection.

Introduction The development and licensure of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine has long been considered of paramount public healthimportance, as highlighted by CMV's inclusion among high prior-ity targets in Institute of Medicine vaccine prioritization reports[1,2] . In 2000, a U.S. Government-sponsored meeting proposed activities to support CMV vaccine development within the disci-plines of virology, immunology, epidemiology, and clinical trials[3]. Despite signicant progress in these areas and the availability of multiple candidate vaccines in early development, no productis yet under consideration for licensure. On January 10-11, 2012,representatives from government, industry, academia, patientadvocacy groups, and professional societies met to identify andbegin to address challenges to CMV vaccine development. Thismanuscript summarizes available data, considerations, and pro-posals for future research and clinical trials discussed by meetingparticipants. 2. Background and epidemiology Most overt CMV-related disease occurs following transmis- sion during pregnancy, manifesting as congenital CMV (cCMV)disease in children. Annually, cCMV causes an estimated 400deaths and 5000 permanent disabilities among approximately30,000 infected U.S. infants [4-6] . Estimates of the prevalence of cCMV infection among live-born infants range from 0.5 to0.7% in the US, Canada and Western Europe to 1-2% in SouthAmerica, Africa and Asia [7]. Approximately 13% of newborns with cCMV infection are symptomatic, with ndings such as of permanent sequelae in newborns with symptomatic cCMVinfection range from 40 to 50% to >80%, depending on the severityof their disease [4]. Rates of sensorineural hearing loss in children without clinical ndings in the newborn period (asymptomaticcCMV infection), observed at 3-4 years, range from 7.4 to 21% [9,10] , with late-onset hearing loss in some occurring at seven years of ageand older. Overall, an estimated 17-20% of infants develop per-manent sequelae as a result of the infection, including the 13% ofinfants born with cCMV that have symptoms at birth and an addi-tional 4-7% of infected infants who appear asymptomatic at birth[4]. Congenital CMV infection can occur as a result of transplacen- tal transmission of virus in the setting of primary infection (thepregnant woman's rst encounter with CMV) or of non-primaryinfection (either reactivation of a previously established latentinfection or re-infection with a newly acquired virus in a previouslyinfected woman). Non-primary maternal infections may accountfor three-quarters of cCMV infections in the United States [11] , and the proportion of cCMV infections due to non-primary infectionsin countries with higher maternal CMV seroprevalence is proba-bly even higher. A signicant proportion of non-primary infectionsduring pregnancy in Brazil were found to be re-infections [12] . Although rates of measurable hearing loss may not differ substan-tially in children born to mothers with primary vs. non-primaryinfections [13] , primary maternal infection typically results in more severe cCMV disease, including greater neurological damage mani-festing as more severe hearing loss. The relative contributions ofreactivation and re-infection to cCMV disease are not yet clear, andthe role of antibody or cellular immunity in preventing them isunknown. Among women of reproductive age, approximately half are CMV-seropositive in the U.S., Australia, and Western Europe, whilealmost all are CMV-seropositive in South America, Asia, the MiddleEast and Africa [14] . U.S. seroprevalence rates are generally lower among non-Hispanic whites than other ethnic groups [5]. Young maternal age is a risk factor for both primary and non-primaryinfection. In healthy adults and children, CMV infection may cause a mild infectious mononucleosis syndrome, but is usually asymp-tomatic. Despite its generally silent nature, CMV infection hasbeen associated with long-term consequences, including earlierimmunosenescence [15] and increased all-cause mor- tality [16,17] . Additional research is needed to conrm and address potential mechanisms for these outcomes. CMV is commonly spread via saliva and urine, especially from young children who often shed asymptomatically for months, con-tributing to higher CMV exposure among adults exposed to childrenattending day-care. In addition to transplacental transmission lead-ing to congenital infection, CMV is readily transmitted to infantsvia breast milk, but this typically causes disease only in prematureinfants [18] . CMV can also be sexually transmitted. Transmission also may occur via solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplanta-tion and, rarely, by transfusion of blood products from seropositiveindividuals. Persons with immunosuppression, typically associated with transplantation-related medications, highly immunosuppressivecancer chemotherapy, or advanced HIV infection, are at increasedrisk of CMV disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-plant (HSCT) and high risk solid organ transplant (SOT) recipientsoften require treatment with drugs that exhibit signicant tox-icity to prevent potentially fatal CMV disease. CMV-associatedsequelae among HIV-infected individuals have been substan-tially reduced by the availability of highly active antiretroviraltherapy. 3. Virology, immunology, and previous CMV vaccine experience Because natural immunity can reduce the severity of CMV dis- ease [19,20] , development of an effective CMV vaccine is likely to be feasible. Identication of immunological markers that can predictprotection from CMV disease would be useful to evaluate potentialvaccine candidates in preclinical, Phase I, and Phase II studies, toassess the duration of vaccine protection, and to \"bridge\" demon-stration of vaccine effectiveness between populations.6 P.R. Krause et al. / Vaccine 32 (2014) 4-10 Antigens that evoke humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are considered as targets for a vaccine because immuneresponses against these targets are readily detected in naturallyinfected individuals. Antibody is considered more likely to pre-vent or attenuate primary infection, while cell-mediated immunity(CMI), including cytotoxic T cells, is considered more likely to medi-ate life-long control of virus replication once infection has beenestablished. In a non-randomized, uncontrolled clinical study, CMV hyper- immune immunoglobulin administered to pregnant women soonafter detection of primary infection was reported to reduce con-genital transmission of CMV and to provide a therapeutic benetto CMV-infected infants [21] . The results of two ongoing double- blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of immunoglobulinwill provide further insight into the role of humoral immu-nity in preventing transplacental transmission (NCT00881517,NCT01376778). A randomized placebo-controlled trial of a recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine formulated with MF59 (anoil-in-water emulsion adjuvant) showed 50% efcacy in preven-ting of primary CMV infection in young mothers[22] . However, vaccination did not appear to yield long-term protection and the studies were not powered to evaluate pro-tection against transplacental transmission. This vaccine inducesprimarily humoral responses, suggesting a role for anti-gB anti-bodies in reducing acquisition of CMV infection. In a randomizedphase II study of MF59-adjuvanted gB vaccine in CMV-seronegativepatients awaiting SOT, vaccinees who received grafts from CMV-seropositive donors higher titers of gB specic antibodies,shorter duration of viremia and fewer days of antiviral treatmentthan placebo recipients [23] . Thus, anti-gB antibodies alone may also suppress primary CMV infection in SOT recipients. Clinicalstudies showed that this vaccine also boosted pre-existing immuneresponses in seropositive transplant candidates and seroposi-tive women [24] . Another adjuvanted gB-based vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity in clinical trials (NCT01357915). The presence of cytotoxic and helper T cell immunity correlates with protection from CMV disease in HSCT and SOT recipients. Alandmark study performed 20 years ago and several subsequentstudies showed that adoptive T cell immunotherapy benets allo-geneic HSCT recipients [25] . Key cellular immune viral proteins IE1. The latency-decient live-attenuated Towne strain CMV vac- cine, which lacks more than a dozen viral genes, prevented severedisease in renal transplant recipients, but did not prevent infec-tion with natural strains [26] . Anti-CMV neutralizing titers after Towne vaccine were comparable those observed after naturalinfection in one study [27] , but were lower in another [28] . The live-attenuated vaccine also induced CMI, including cytotoxic Tcells. A series of Towne/Toledo strain chimeric candidate vaccines, designed to be more immunogenic than Towne, appeared to beattenuated when administered to CMV-seropositive individuals[29] . These chimeras are currently undergoing Phase I trials in CMV- seronegative individuals. Although Towne virus did not becomelatent and reactivate, owing to its lack of the ULb' region of thegenome, concern over the potential consequences of administer-ing a live virus vaccine that might develop latency and potentiallyreactivate has limited further exploration of this approach to CMVvaccination. A randomized phase II study with a DNA vaccine expressing gB and pp65 showed CMI responses and reduced rate of viremiain CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients. This study was not pow-ered to demonstrate potential effects on CMV disease, which wasalso infrequent in placebo recipients [30] . Other candidate vac- cine approaches under clinical development include CMV antigenicpeptide-based vaccines [31] and vaccine vector approaches reactivate and of new CMV strains to re-infect previously infected individuals suggests that the immu-nity induced by primary infection is insufcient to completelyprevent subsequent infections, although it may be sufcient to pre-vent severe cCMV. Maturation of the immune response, repeatedasymptomatic reactivations, and declining antibody or cellularresponses over time may also influence the level of immunity afterprimary infection. Thus, different candidate vaccines may have dif-ferent abilities to prevent CMV infection, reactivation, or sheddingin seronegative vs. seropositive individuals. Further study of bothviral and host factors, including antibody avidity, that influencetransmission and infection-associated pathology should aid ratio-nal vaccine design. 4. Use of a CMV vaccine in different target populations to prevent cCMV The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and other recommending bodies influence U.S. vaccine usage. Keyfactors considered by ACIP include disease burden, vaccine effec-tiveness and safety, feasibility of additional recommendations inthe context of the existing vaccination schedule, equity of access,and whether or not vaccination is a good use of public funds [34] . Assuming an effective vaccine were available, relative advantagesof potential vaccination strategies targeting adult women, adoles-cent girls, and/or young children to reduce cCMV were consideredby meeting participants in the context of age-specic CMV sero-prevalence rates ( Table 1 ). Determining the likely target population for a vaccine to prevent cCMV would help vaccine manufacturersassess the potential market for a CMV vaccine. A vaccine targeted at women of reproductive age would need to induce protective immune responses before the rst trimester,when cCMV disease risk is greatest. Logistical barriers to achiev-ing high vaccination coverage in women of reproductive age priorto the rst pregnancy would thus need to be addressed. Histori-cally, vaccination coverage for vaccines recommended for adultshave been lower than levels achieved for children or adolescents.Efforts would be needed to ensure awareness among the generalpublic of CMV disease and availability of a CMV vaccine, especiallyconsidering that nearly half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned andmany women do not seek pre-conception counseling. Currently,fewer than 15% of women of reproductive age report having heardof CMV [35] . Potential liability issues are a consideration for a vac- cine strategy targeted at women with childbearing potential. Ofnote, the issue of whether in utero injuries are compensable underthe Vaccine Injury Compensation Act has not been resolved [36] . Challenges in obtaining high adolescent coverage levels with other vaccines, including HPV vaccine, might also apply to a CMVvaccine. U.S. uptake of HPV vaccine has been slow, likely due toa combination of the delayed benet of vaccination, its indicationto prevent a sexually transmitted disease, and the requirement forthree doses (single dose adolescent vaccines have achieved betteruptake). With increased experience and recognition of the impor-tance of adolescent vaccination, these challenges may decline.Ideally, the duration of protection from an adolescent CMV vac-cine would cover most reproductive years, although if necessary,booster immunization could prolong duration of immunity. Use of a CMV vaccine among women or adolescents likely would require assessment of risks and benets both for CMV-seropositiveand seronegative vaccinees. Serological testing before vaccina-tion, if needed, could present logistical challenges in implementingvaccination programs. Because CMV seroprevalence among U.S.P.R.

Thus, a cCMV disease vaccine candidatetargeted at adolescents or women would ideally prevent cCMVinfection among children born both to seronegative and seroposi-tive vaccinees. Universal administration of effective CMV vaccines in early childhood could also reduce cCMV disease rates. Because expo-sure to toddlers, who excrete CMV in their urine and saliva formonths after primary infection, is an important source of bothprimary infection and re-infection in pregnant women, reducinginfections among toddlers would likely reduce CMV transmissionto their seronegative and seropositive mothers during subsequentpregnancies. It could also reduce transmission among children inday-care, indirectly protecting additional families. While a vac-cine given at later ages would likely need to be effective both inseronegative and seropositive vaccinees, a vaccination strategy tar-geting toddlers may not require a vaccine that provides protectionto seropositives in order to substantially reduce cCMV transmis-sion. For rubella vaccine, vaccinating male and female toddlerswas superior to vaccinating only seronegative women in reducingviral circulation and the incidence of congenital disease. Prelim-inary modeling of the effect of various immunization strategiespredicts that even a CMV vaccine with a relatively short durationof efcacy of a few years administered to 12-18 month-olds wouldsubstantially reduce cCMV incidence [37,38] . Although there may be resistance to vaccinating healthy chil- dren who are not at risk for serious CMV disease, the precedentof rubella vaccines, the use of \"cocooning\" (i.e., vaccinating thosewith close contact with newborns) as a strategy to protect infantsagainst pertussis, and interest in developing transmission-blockingmalaria vaccines, demonstrate the acceptability of vaccines thatdo not directly prevent serious illness in recipients. PreventingcCMV in a family could also directly benet vaccinated childrenby reducing the impact on a family of caring for severely affectedsiblings. Recent reports of increased all-cause mortality amongCMV-seropositive adults [16,17] may suggest another potential direct benet of CMV vaccination for both sexes. A CMV immunization program might most rapidly reduce cCMV by vaccinating both toddlers and adolescent girls. Improvedsurveillance to estimate the burden of cCMV disease and population-wide age-specic infection rates would help in furtherpredicting the likely effect of different immunization strategies onpublic health [39,40] and could provide a baseline for population- based studies of vaccine effectiveness. 5. Considerations in clinical development of a vaccine to prevent cCMV disease Pre-licensure studies using prevention of cCMV disease as a clinical endpoint to demonstrate vaccine efcacy are impracticalgiven the complexity, number of participants needed, and years offollow-up needed to detect hearing loss (the most common cCMVmanifestation) and other later sequelae. Resolution of uncertain-ties regarding study endpoints likely to be acceptable to regulatoryagencies could increase the likelihood of investment by manu-facturers in development of CMV vaccines. Meeting participantsdiscussed and identied endpoints for tri-als ( Table 2 ). Prevention of cCMV infection is considered to be the most rele- vant and practically achievable endpoint for Phase III efcacy trialsto support licensure of a vaccine indicated for prevention of cCMVdisease. Virus isolation or real-time PCR assay of urine or salivasamples from newborns are sensitive and specic and would bethe most practical tests for diagnosing cCMV infection. Such sam-ples would need to be taken within 2-3 weeks after birth, sinceCMV may be acquired during delivery or soon after birth [41] . The link between prevention of cCMV infection and prevention of cCMVdisease could be studied separately in post-licensure studies thatdirectly conrmed impact of vaccination on cCMV disease. Prevention of CMV infection in pregnant women was consid- ered a less useful endpoint to support CMV vaccine licensure. Thisis because completely preventing maternal infection may be lessreadily achieved than attenuating transplacental transmission. Avaccine that did not protect mothers against CMV infection couldnonetheless protect against cCMV. Also, reduced maternal infectionrates may not necessarily lead to reduced cCMV disease if vac-cination prevented only the mildest maternal infections. Becausecurrent serological tests cannot readily identify new infections inpreviously seropositive women, the ability of a vaccine to preventthese infections during pregnancy would be difcult to determine.8 P.R. Krause et al. / Vaccine 32 (2014) 4-10 Table 2 Proposed endpoints for CMV vaccine clinical trials in different target populations epidemiological studies. Target population Objectives Endpoint Children <2 yrs of age Prevent maternal and congenital CMV infection by removing an important source of maternalinfectionsPrevent primary CMV infection which may havelong-term deleterious consequences to the hostRate of CMV infection in vaccinees Adolescent girls Prevent infection in future mothers and their children (preventing congenital infection)Prevent primary CMV infection which may havelong-term deleterious consequences to the hostRate of CMV infection in vaccinees Women of childbearing age (women likely to become pregnant)Prevent maternal and congenital CMV infection Rate of CMV infection in vaccinees Rate of cCMV infection in their children Hematopoetic stem cell transplant recipientsPrevent CMV disease by reducing the rate of occurrence of surrogate markersPrevention of CMV viremia (and associated antiviral use) Composite endpoints including CMV disease Solid organ transplant recipients Prevent CMV disease Prevention of CMV-associated disease (including CMV syndrome)Prevention of CMV viremia (and associated antiviral use) A CMV vaccine could be studied in women of reproductive age who are planning pregnancy, although there are a numberof logistical challenges associated with recruitment and follow-up. Women contemplating future pregnancy do not necessarilyroutinely seek pre-conception medical attention, so they could bedifcult to recruit to a vaccine clinical trial. Women recruited at thetime of a delivery, however, have both a high likelihood of subse-quent pregnancy and an increased risk of exposure to CMV from theinfant just delivered (because young children often transmit CMVacquired at day-care to their mothers [42] ), with possible maternal- fetal transmission during those subsequent pregnancies, and thusmay be better vaccine trial candidates. Even in this group, time tosubsequent pregnancy is uncertain and long-term follow-up maybe difcult due to the mobility of young families. Awareness of CMVand advice given to women in a clinical trial about how to avoidacquiring CMV infection may decrease seroconversion rates rela-tive to those observed in the past, potentially increasing the numberof subjects required for the study. Both seronegative and seroposi-tive women should be considered for vaccine trials, depending onthe ability of the candidate vaccine to induce protective immuneresponses in both groups. Adolescents have a high rate of primary CMV infection, but could be a challenging clinical trial population due to the difcultyof long-term follow-up as they move away from their childhoodhomes and to their low incidence of pregnancy. Thus, a vaccineintended for use in adolescents may rst be studied in olderfemales. A correlate of protection could then be used to bridgeevidence of efcacy to adolescent girls. Clinical trials evaluating vaccination of healthy children to pre- vent transmission of CMV to mothers should consider outcomesboth in the immunized child and in household members, poten-tially including the outcome of subsequent pregnancies. Attackrates in mothers with children in day-care can be measured directlyby seroconversion of seronegative mothers, and the relationshipbetween strains of viruses in children and mothers could be inves-tigated. 6. Considerations in development of a CMV vaccine for transplant patients In allogeneic HSCT patients, CMV serological status of donor and recipient is associated with important clinical outcomes includ-ing transplant-related mortality, secondary infections, and overallgraft survival [43] . CMV-seropositive recipients of stem cell trans- plants are at greatest risk [44,45] . Detection of CMV in blood, either or by nucleic acid amplication test-ing (NAAT), useful predictor for of . Pre-emptive therapy of CMV viremia with antivirals, basedon monitoring with quantitative PCR, is the most commonly used strategy to reduce CMV-associated morbidity, and is currently rec-ommended by international guidelines [48-50] . Currently available antivirals with activity against CMV with signi-cant toxicity\u2014the rst-line agents ganciclovir and valganciclovirmay cause bone marrow toxicity, a particularly important adverseevent in HSCT patients requiring repeated or prolonged therapy.Antiviral prophylaxis with currently available antiviral agents isexpensive and risks toxicity and is only partially effective, althoughnew drugs with improved toxicity proles are in clinical develop-ment. A recently performed large randomized phase III trial with the antiviral drug maribavir showed a background incidence of CMVend-organ disease in the placebo group of 4.8% over six monthsfollow-up [51] . Although the study started at donor cell engraft- ment and thus might have missed a few early cases, this low attackrate makes using CMV end-organ disease as a phase III vaccinetrial endpoint in HSCT recipients impractical, due to the numberof patients that would need to be enrolled. Thus, additional end-points that predict the development of CMV-associated end-organdisease should be considered in evaluating CMV vaccines in theHSCT population. CMV DNA detected in blood by quantitative PCR alone or in combination with initiation of antiviral therapy is a more practicalprimary endpoint. A composite endpoint could also include otherpotentially CMV-associated clinical events such as graft-versus-host disease and overall mortality. Even though it is rare, becausesome CMV disease occurs without preceding PCR positivity, CMVdisease should also be included in a primary composite endpoint(Table 2 ). A recently adopted WHO standard could be used to improve standardization of NAAT for viremia [52] . In SOT patients, the CMV serological status of donor and recipient is one of the most important factors predicting devel-opment of symptomatic CMV infections. CMV infections in the so-called CMVsyndrome in the presence of fever and neutropeniaor thrombocytopenia, in the absence of other causes) and indi-rect effects such as graft rejection and secondary infections. InSOT patients, seronegative recipients of organs from seropositivedonors are at greatest risk, because of the signicant amount ofvirus that can be present in a donated organ [20] . Other impor- tant risk-related factors are the type of organ transplanted andthe use of anti-T cell therapy. In SOT, the most commonly usedpractice for CMV prevention is antiviral prophylaxis with val-ganciclovir for 3-6 months after SOT (and one year for lungrecipients), although pre-emptive therapy is also used [53,54] . Current recommendations support both strategies [55] . tive vaccine administered pre-transplant could potentially reduceP.R. Krause et al. / Vaccine 32 (2014) 4-10 9 the toxicity and cost associated with administration of antiviral drugs. Recent studies suggest that the combined frequency of CMV end-organ disease and CMV syndrome is and CMV syndrome to be used as a pri-mary composite endpoint in a phase III study. The donor/recipientserological status and the organ type of SOT patients are importantconsiderations for clinical studies. A vaccination strategy that reduced CMV infection rates in the general population might also reduce CMV-associated morbidityin transplant recipients by reducing the risk for primary infectionsfrom the donor grafts. 7. Summary Due to relatively low public awareness of CMV transmission and disease, work by public health ofcials and advocacy groupsremains critically important for increasing awareness and anunderstanding regarding CMV infections and their impact on publichealth. In addition to using an effective CMV vaccine to immunize ado- lescents, consideration of CMV vaccines as universal childhoodvaccines, which based on modeling might impart the greatestreduction in cCMV disease, was endorsed. Immunization of youngboys and girls could have a signicant and immediate effect oncCMV disease because they are sources of transmission to seronega-tive and seropositive mothers. Additional study could help to betterpredict the potential benets of this strategy. Based on the dis-cussions at the meeting, the most appropriate efcacy endpointsfor phase III vaccine trials to address cCMV and immunization oftransplant recipients are summarized in Table 2 . The ability of a vaccine to prevent CMV transmission within households could bedirectly demonstrated in a study. Efcacy of a vaccine intended toprevent cCMV disease could be inferred by demonstrating preven-tion of cCMV infection at birth. Prevention of CMV viremia (at alevel that triggers prescription of pre-emptive therapy) was con-sidered a useful and feasible study endpoint in stem cell transplantrecipients, likely predicting effect on end-organ disease. In solidorgan transplant recipients, prevention of CMV-associated disease(including CMV syndrome or the need for pre-emptive therapy)was considered the best available study endpoint. Several areas were identied for further study, research, and policy development ( Table 3 ). These included collection of addi- tional epidemiological data, including on fetal loss due to CMVand more detailed age-specic incidence and transmission rates,to improve understanding of the potential effect of vaccination.A standardized case denition for cCMV disease would facili-tate these and other studies. Further study should also denethe relative roles of reactivation and re-infection in involved in pathogenesis and the development of distinguish between reactivation and re-infection inseropositive vaccinees would facilitate evaluation of the full poten-tial of a vaccine. Improved understanding of immune responsesto CMV (including developing validated assays of CMV antibodyavidity that could potentially permit comparison of neutralizingresponses among recipients of different vaccines) could lead tothe development of immunological markers useful to evaluate vac-cine immunogenicity, evaluate duration of protection, and bridgeevidence of efcacy between populations. CMV is an important pathogen for which a vaccine would address a signicant unmet public health and medical need. Dis-cussions and conclusions reached by the experts at the 2012 CMVvaccine meeting likely will reduce barriers to development of CMVTable 3 Areas for further research, study, and policy development.
