A limited number of in-person appointments are available as well. When you schedule, you will be asked your choice of appointment type, and every effort will be made to accommodate your preference. Please note that telepsychiatry is only available for students who are physically in Washington, DC, as our psychiatrist and psychiatric nurse practitioner are not licensed to offer telepsychiatry to students outside of DC. (Maryland and Virginia residents can be seen in-person, but not via telepsychiatry.) When scheduling your appointment, please let the Patient Service Representative know where you are currently located. If you are out of state and have questions for your provider, please send a secure message to your psychiatric provider through the Student Health Portal. For psychiatry appointments, please call: 202-885-3565 or email [shc@american.edu](mailto:shc@american.edu) (Please provide your First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, and AUID Number). Before your scheduled appointment, you will be sent a secure message through the student health portal with instructions on how to connect for your telepsychiatry appointment. You can use any device to connect as long as it has audio and video capabilities. "}
