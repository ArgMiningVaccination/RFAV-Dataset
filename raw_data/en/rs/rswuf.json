It captures the ethos of the Occupy Movement and exemplifies ingenious, effective use of many devices of imaginative literature irony, of course, but also metaphor, simile, oxymoron, allusion, deliberate repetition for effect (like Ginsberg's Howl ), enjambment, etc. The poem uses the devices so appropriately and effectively that readers can read, understand, and appreciate the poem's content with no conscious awareness of these devices as artificial or intrusive. The conclusion is masterful in its climactic effect and hope for real change. Carmine Bell - "}
