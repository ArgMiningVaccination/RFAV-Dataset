If you want to go far, go with others.\" This collaborative principle is very important across every aspect of our UHCOP Vision 20/20 Strategic Plan. In this issue of Interactions, you will see prime examples of how important a collaborative strategy is across all of our teaching, research and service initiatives. Reaching these laudable collaborative strategic goals will allow our College to: 1) produce professional graduates who will help to help create and lead our nation's future healthcare delivery systems; 2) produce translational scientists whose important drug discoveries will help to alleviate disease and suffering; and 3) produce innovative clinical services to help provide critical team-based healthcare services for our patients who are most in need. Our College's Interprofessional Education (IPE) collaborative initiatives continue to gain momentum. We are indeed very fortunate to be located within the Texas Medical Center (TMC), the world's largest medical center. We are building collaborative team-based approaches to health care with our high-quality partners such as the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Women's University's College of Nursing. Our patients will be the beneficiaries of the improvements to healthcare that this team-based approach will produce. Please see the article discussing the fall 2014 Progressive Case Discussion (PCD) centering upon patient safety. Our UHCOP faculty and graduate students continue to establish and advance our important collaborative translational research programs and discoveries. Please see the article discussing a novel approach to the prevention/treatment of space motion sickness by December 2014 Ph.D. graduate Dr. Lei Wu, Pharmaceutics professor Dr. Diana Chow, and NASA Chief Pharmacologist/Technical Manager and UHCOP alumna Dr. Lakshmi Putcha. Our UHCOP faculty continue to apply their laudable clinical skills to create improved healthcare approaches to the treatment of disease. Please see the article discussing a new collaboration between our UHCOP and Texas Children's Health Plan. This initiative led by Dr. Joy Alonzo will also provide a very important managed care pharmacy experiential site that will help train UHCOP pharmacy students to lead our State and National managed care organizations in the future. These strategic UHCOP collaborative initiatives will provide a sound foundation for providing collaborative solutions to problems that have plagued our \"siloed\" U.S. healthcare system for decades. I look forward to providing you with important updates in the near future as we \"endeavor to go very far\" during our journey.

Through several initiatives in collaboration with its fellow Texas Medical Center institutions, UH College of Pharmacy is continuing to integrate interprofessional education into the Pharm.D. curriculum. Interprofessional education (IPE) is one of the 25 key standards used by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education in the certification of Pharm.D. programs nationwide. Although UHCOP has long been a proponent of IPE through such collaborations as the student-run H.O.M.E.S. Clinic with Baylor College of Medicine and The University of Texas School of Medicine at the UT Health Science Center-Houston, the college has been implementing several curriculum-based IPE initiatives. One of the most recent programs was centered on Patient Safety, with second- and third-year UH pharmacy students taking an elective online training component from the Institute College News Congratulations! UHCOP Graduates Post 2nd Consecutive Year of Perfect First-time Pass Rates in 2014100% NAPLEX MPJEfor Healthcare Improvement and culminating in a live, faculty-facilitated progressive case discussion alongside medical students from BCM and nursing students from Texas Woman's University. A total of nearly 300 students participated in the program, marking what's believed to be the largest single interprofessional academic exercise ever held in the Texas Medical Center. University of Houston College of Pharmacy 3Two UH College of Pharmacy alumni national and state pharmacy scene have enthusiastically assumed the leadership of the Dean's Advisory Council at critical crossroad in the college's history, with several advocacy initiatives and the launch of a capital campaign looming large on the 'to-do' list. Lisa Scholz, Pharm.D. ('99), MBA, chief operating officer and senior vice president at 340B Health, and Julie Spier, R.Ph. ('86), director of Pharmacy Operations-Southern and Houston Divisions for Randalls/Tom Thumb/Albertsons, took up the reins of the DAC in October 2014 with the mutual goal of firing up fellow DAC members and alumni alike to bring about overdue recognition and resources for the college. \"We want everyone to know what we know: UH is the best and it deserves the best,\" Spier said. \"This is only going to happen with us all working together and with everyone engaged. I truly believe that we are stewards of our time and resources. It is our responsibility to use these resources so that we can make a difference. \"I feel that by serving on DAC that I am not only giving back to an organization that has given me so much, but I am able to make a difference helping the future of our profession.\" Like their co-chair predecessors Scholz and Spier have extensive experience as advocates for the profession in addition to their diverse background in the pharmacy trenches. Prior to joining 340B Health, Scholz held leadership positions in the Pharmacy Services Support Center collaboration between the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration and the American Pharmacists Association. Scholz's practice portfolio includes nearly 20 years combined in community retail pharmacy management and clinical ambulatory care/health-system pharmacy at one of the nation's largest public health systems. Spier, who has spent her entire pharmacy career with Randalls/ Tom Thumb, is immediate past president of the Texas Federation of Drug Stores following four years as the organization's president-elect and president. MECHANISMS OF ACTION NEW DAC LEADERSHIP ISSUES RALLYING CRY TO ALUMNI 4 University of Houston College of P harmacyphotos by Kris KeheScholz said the leadership and commitment exhibited by alumni such as Spier during her days at UH as well as the college's deliberate steps to transform the curriculum in recent years provided an added incentive for her. \"Being engaged in the Dean's Advisory Council is an important connection to my alma mater, especially when you live over 1,400 miles away in Washington, D.C., and being able to co-chair with Julie was an opportunity I could not refuse,\" Scholz said. \"With the leadership Dean Pritchard has brought to the college, you can't help but want to be part of what he has been building over the last several years. Together, with the Dean's vision, Julie and I bring a collective energy and leadership style that will make us great 'servant leaders' to the students and alumni.\" At their first meeting, Scholz and Spier sought not only to challenge their fellow DAC members but also to get them excited about the opportunities to lead the college to the next level. \"My vision for the DAC is to increase engagement of our current DAC leaders, so that our message can spread to each graduating class, whether the first class or the early careerists graduating in 2014,\" Scholz said. \"The DAC is the start for igniting enthusiasm and pride. I can say that we are thinking about the future of our college \u2014 and we hope you are, too. \"The DAC only meets twice a year in person; the rest of the time we have to fulfill our commitments. Those commitments are connecting with community leaders, finding donors and rekindling Cougar Pride.\" One of their first orders of business was to to develop clear and actionable goals and objectives for not only the DAC body but individual alumni and supporters. The questions posed by Scholz and Spier were: \"The result I am excited about contributing to UHCOP is ... \"; \"The three things that excite me about UHCOP are ... \"; \"The specific result I am committed to delivering over the next six months ... \"; and \"The key near-term actions I am planning to take to generate results are: who will I email, when I will donate to the college, who I will call or follow-up ...\" \"Our questions are to inspire and empower,\" Spier said. \"The other question that I would like all to answer is: 'Where would you be without UH College of Pharmacy? What would you be doing right now?' We are blessed to practice pharmacy.\" Immediate responses to their queries included \"The new building excites me!\" and \"The reputation for excellence enhances the value of my degree.\" Scholz encouraged UHCOP alumni and non-alumni supporters to share their responses with the DAC by sending them to lscholzpharmd@yahoo.com. Ahead of a full day of work aimed at moving the college forward, Dean's Advisory Council members took the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at the oldest craft brewery in Texas, the Saint Arnold Brewing Company near downtown Houston.

Biundo, R.Ph. ('61), and the 2014 Meritorious Service Award to Roger W. Anderson, DrPH, M.S., R.Ph., FASHP. A former independent pharmacy owner/ pharmacist, Biundo has developed an expertise in men's health issues during his nearly two decades as a consulting pharmacist at PCCA. He has served in numerous roles in the Texas Pharmacy Association, Texas Pharmacy Foundation and TPA PharmPAC, earning both the TPA Pharmacist of the Year and the R. Louis Rumsey PharmPAC Member of the Year awards in 2013 and TPA's Education Excellence Award in 2008. Biundo also has served in leadership roles at the local level, including past co-chair of the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council (DAC), past president of the Houston Area Pharmacy Association, and past president of the UH Pharmacy Alumni Association. In 2010, Biundo was recognized as UHCOP's Volunteer of the Year. A member of the college's Mading Society of supporters, Biundo recently accepted the role of chair of the UHCOP Capital Campaign to build a new home for the college. \"I do things that are important to me, so it doesn't seem like it's a big deal, but it's very gratifying to feel like you're making a difference and be recognized in this manner,\" he said. \"There's always something important to be done, but you can't assume that someone else will always do it or can do it alone.\" A fellow UHCOP DAC member, Anderson was honored for his visionary leadership in the evolution of pharmacy from a limited dispensing UNCOMMON SERVICE role to being indispensable members of the patient care team. After earning his B.S. in pharmacy, Anderson completed a master's program in hospital pharmacy and one of the earliest residency programs in the country. In the late 1970s, Anderson arrived in Texas to begin what would be a nearly 30-year career as Vice President/Head of the Pharmacy Division at The University of Texas-MD Anderson Cancer Center. Anderson left MD Anderson in 2004 for executive pharmacy positions with Medco Health and US Oncology before joining the ranks of the semi-retired in 2011. Anderson also served seven years on the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, including a term as president, and has authored more than 60 publications in such journals as the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy and the Journal of Oncology Practice. A Fellow of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), he has been recognized with the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Ohio State University, the Harvey A.K. Whitney Lecture Award from ASHP, the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Ferris State University, The Julie and Ben Rogers Award from MD Anderson and the Distinguished Service Award from UHCOP. \"It's a great honor that I will treasure very much, because the college has been a very important part of my life,\" Anderson said. \"It's so important that we have future pharmacy leaders with the skills, knowledge and motivation to step into these institutions when people like me step down. I believe UH College of Pharmacy is on the cutting-edge of this vision of what pharmacy can be; the students coming out are top notch, and the college is moving forward as dramatically as any other program in the country.\" Dean Lamar Pritchard presents the Alumni Pharmacists of the Year Award to Bruce Biundo, above, and the Meritorious Service Award to Roger Anderson, below.COLLEGE CELEBRATES VISION, TENACITY OF BIUNDO, ANDERSON 6 University of Houston College of P harmacyBarbara Lewis, MA, LPC, R.Ph., clinical assistant professor and assistant dean of Student & Professional Affairs, retired after 20 years in the college. Barbara Lewis Julie Szilagyi, Ph.D., associate professor of Pharmacology and former director of the college's Office of Assessment, joined the college in 1985.Julie Szilagyi UH Department of Public Safety Officer Leon Morgan, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was assigned to the security desk of the college's TMC Campus. Leon R. Morgan Pharmacy UH College of Pharmacy said farewell to three retiring members of the UHCOP family in 2014: Barbara Julie FAHA; and Leon R. Morgan Sr. A UHCOP faculty member and administrator from 1994 to 2014, Lewis served many roles within the college, including director of counseling and advising and later assistant dean of Student & Professional Affairs. Not only was she responsible for student recruiting and academic advising in the Pharm.D. program, but she also was regarded as a source of strength, compassion and encouragement in her role as a licensed professional counselor. Lewis also served as advisor for the UH chapter of Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International and preceptor on several mission trips to the colonias of the Mexico-Texas border region. Following her retirement, Lewis is making plans for traveling internationally, including France and Dubai. Julie Szilagyi, Ph.D., FAHA, retired in September 2014 after nearly 30 years as a faculty member in the Department of Pharmacological & Pharmaceutical Sciences. Former director of the college's Office of Assessment, Szilagyi was a recipient of the UH Research Excellence Award, the UH Alumni Association's Outstanding Faculty Award, two Rho Chi Teaching Excellence Awards, and a Faculty Excellence Proclamation from the City of Houston.

Morgan provided a reassuring presence for the faculty, staff and students at the college's TMC Campus before his retirement. Morgan was a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, including two Purple Hearts, Presidential Unit Citation, Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation. Morgan's retirement plans include spending more time with his grandchildren. farewells University of Houston College of Pharmacy 7Lessons in Leadership: RADM Scott Giberson 8 University of Houston College of P harmacyUH College of Pharmacy was honored to welcome a true champion of pharmacy and public health serving at the highest level of national health policy and practice as the college's 2014 Commencement speaker and a guest lecturer: Rear Admiral Scott Giberson, R.Ph., PhC, NCPS-PP, MPH. Giberson currently serves as director/chief executive officer of the Division of the Commissioned Corps Personnel and Readiness and overall commander of the Commissioned Corps' Ebola Response in West Africa. During his previous posts as acting deputy surgeon general and chief pharmacy officer, Giberson became widely recognized for authoring the landmark 2011 report to the U.S. Surgeon General entitled \"Improving Patient and Health System Outcomes Through Advanced Pharmacy Practice.\" Among the report's notable observations were \"the [physician- pharmacist] collaboration, through extensive performance data, has demonstrated that patient care services delivered by pharmacists can improve patient outcomes, promote patient involvement, increase cost efficiency and reduce demands affecting the healthcare system\" and \"pharmacists may be the only health professionals (who manage disease through medications and provide other patient care services) who are not recognized in national health policy as healthcare providers or practitioners.\" At Commencement, Giberson shook the hands of every graduate, and Giberson engaged in a nearly three-hour roundtable discussion with participants and leaders of the post-graduate M.S./residency program. During the roundtable, Giberson shared his views on effective leadership and the opportunities and barriers for pharmacy at a time when the nation's healthcare system wrestles with strategies to address issues of access, safety, quality and cost. \"Chronic care is post-diagnosis, and who are the most trained post-diagnostic medication therapy experts? Pharmacists,\" Giberson told the forum attendees. \"How often does the average person see the physician? Every 13 months, longer in rural areas. In contrast, patients see pharmacists every 30-60 days. \"We manage the patients when the primary therapy is medication. We're not after the outcomes of the medications; we're after the outcomes of the patient, the disease state. Don't see yourself as a 'pharmacist,' but as a health care leader. No one has the combination of education and accessiblity that you do.\" Giberson encouraged members of the profession to look beyond simply demonstrating capability in achieving desired patient outcomes. \"Instead of only outcomes, we need to show performance: Not proving that we can do it because we already have publication after publication with the data to back it up, but the key to advancing our profession is through the performance-based generation of revenue or reduction of costs,\" Giberson said.

The co-funded appointment of Joy Alonzo, Pharm.D., M.E., as UHCOP clinical assistant professor and TCHP Director of Pharmacy Services provides abundant opportunities for implementing programs that further demonstrate the impact of pharmacists in improving patient health outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. The collaboration will expose Pharm.D. students to careers in managed care with the TCHP serving as an Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiential site beginning in fall 2015. Texas Children's Health Plan was founded in 1996 by Texas Children's Hospital as the nation's first health maintenance organization created just for children. TCHP has more than 400,000 members served through the organization's staff and network providers of more than 2,100. It is the largest combined STAR/CHIP (Texas Medicaid and the Children's Health Plan) Managed Care Organization in the Harris County service area. The organization operates two Houston-area locations of The Center for Children and Women, which offer a range of primary and affiliated patient care at two \"one-stop\" medical home facilities in north and southwest Houston. Services/providers at the centers include pediatricians, advance nurse practitioners, OB/GYNs, certified nurse midwives, optometry, imaging, a laboratory and an onsite pharmacy, with dentistry also available at its north Houston site. \"The size and complexity of TCHP's patient population provides an exciting opportunity to improve outcomes on a macro-scale through research and communicating best practices from a prescribing standpoint,\" Alonzo said. Alonzo's activities includes developing and implementing a range of clinical pharmacy programs for providers, patients and caregivers, such as counseling teenagers with substance abuse issues about the pharmacology of illicit drugs and the mechanisms of addiction and monitoring and managing antimicrobial stewardship guidelines in pediatric populations. \"We put together a behavioral health collaborative with caregivers, case managers, providers and others to provide a forum for managing expectations of the patients' drug regimen, which may involve dose titration or potential adverse effects such as changes in weight or lipid levels,\" Alonzo said. Another major push is aimed to improving health outcomes for MEDICAL HOME UHCOP, TEXAS CHILDREN'S HEALTH PLAN TEAM ON MANAGED CARE FACULTY POST, EXPERIENTIAL SITE Alonzo discusses tips for counseling caregivers of pediatric asthma patients on the proper techniques for using inhalers with Texas Children's Hospital pharmacists Katherine Wang, Pharm.D., and Daniel Pham, Pharm.D. pediatric asthma patients through enhanced caregiver education in medication adherence and other strategies. \"We've also implemented a smoking cessation program to help adult caregivers of pediatric asthma patients to quit smoking, and consequently help reduce the child's exposure to a common trigger of asthma,\" Alonzo said. \"The program is structured as counseling and support sessions, with a pharmacist-managed dose protocol of the nicotine replacement therapy. Instead of more traditional approaches in which smoking is viewed as a 'bad habit,' the counseling treats the tobacco dependency as a disease state.\" With the support of a UH New Faculty Grant, Alonzo also has initiated a retrospective study of the utilization and outcomes associated with palivizumab administered to children considered at high risk of developing complications from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major viral cause of respiratory illness associated with life-threatening complications in pediatric patients between 8 weeks and 30 weeks old (especially among premature infants). The goal of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of those patients who were treated according to the State of Texas' guidelines requiring prior authorization for Medicaid patients versus the more stringent American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines to determine if there is a statistically and clinically significant difference relative to complications and the frequency of RSV-related hospitalizations.

Hu's previous work has led to greater understanding of how flavonoids and analog or metabolite conjugates are recycled not only in the enteric and enterohepatic pathways, but also in what he describes as a novel \"local\" recycling mechanism in the small intestine and colon. His research has shown that these three recycling pathways increase the half-life of flavonoid metabolites, which likely aids in overall health of the gut microbiome but may also present a \"double-edged\" sword with therapeutic drugs to treat cancer, infectious diseases and other ailments. \"We want to more fully understand these processes, particularly between the liver and large intestine, to reduce the amount of drug conjugates excreted through the bile duct, and back into the small intestine,\" Hu said. \"Limiting or controlling local recycling is especially important in the case of many current cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, which destroy not only the fast-growing cancer cells but also the fast-growing gut cells. \"However, these recycling pathways that keep flavonoids and other compounds in the gut may also provide a novel opportunity for treating gastrointestinal cancers, inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases without some of the local or systemic side effects common with conventional therapies, such as damaging the gut microbiome.\" In his latest project, Hu is focusing on the role and mechanisms of efflux transporters in the disposition of flavonoids and other compounds and develop a classification system to identify the flavonoids with the highest potential for bioavailability. \"Efflux transporter proteins \u2014 and their interplay or coupling with metabolizing enzymes \u2014 are highly efficient in moving the parent drug and conjugates or metabolites out of the cell and through the recycling pathways,\" Hu said. \"The net result of inhibited transport can lead to increased concentrations and toxicity, while overexpression of efflux transport may result in suboptimal therapeutic concentration. \"My colleagues and I have tried to 'get out' of these pathways, but for the most part, we haven't been successful. Every step along the way, we're learning to appreciate the robust and redundant systems by which the body efficiently and effectively disposes of flavonoids and other xenobiotic compounds. Based on what we've learned, we're now taking a different approach by seeing if and how we can use these recycling mechanisms to not only improve the bioavailability of flavonoid compounds, but also potentially design drugs that take advantage of those pathways to achieve the desired therapeutic effects in the gut.\"HU SETS SIGHTS ON BIOAVAILABILITY PENALTY Research News University of Houston College of Pharmacy 17In the search for safer, more effective therapeutics, UHCOP Associate Professor Romi Ghose, Ph.D., is taking a genome-wide approach to redefine current knowledge of the known and potentially unknown role players involved in regulating the expression of the Cytochrome P450 gene superfamily of enzymes that metabolize the vast majority of clinically used drugs. The most abundant member of the CYP family in the human liver, CYP450 (specifically, the CYP3A4 enzyme) is responsible for metabolizing approximately 60 percent of known drugs. The pro-inflammatory environment present in cancer, infection and other disease states as well as the activity of drug compounds (or their metabolites/substrates) are believed to contribute to disrupted expression of CYP3A4 through induction or inhibition mechanisms. \"We see a lot of variability in drug responses in individuals, so we're trying to understand the root mechanisms influencing it at the gene level,\" Ghose said. \"Our goal is not only to be able to explain these differences, but also develop sophisticated screening methods to identify patients at-risk or vulnerable to impaired drug metabolism that ultimately can be used to prevent toxicity and improve efficacy.\" Supported by a two-year, $431,155 grant from the National Institutes of Health, Ghose's project includes in vitro and in vivo studies using a humanized mouse model of induced and inhibited CYP34A gene expression as well as in vitro human cell lines with mutations on specific nucleotides to validate the mouse model. \"We know of basal transcription factors and nuclear receptors at the transcription level as well as microRNAs at the post-transcriptional level are involved in the down-regulation of CYP34A expression, but these are not well understood,\" Ghose said. \"We also believe that not all of the factors have been identified, and ultimately CYP34A down-regulation may be a result of the cumulative effect of these various factors.\" FACTORS MODULATING CYP EXPRESSION KEY TO IMPROVING SAFETY DOSING THE FLAMES 18 University of Houston College of P harmacy photo by Kris KehePharm.D. candidates Annilee Miller and Minoosh K.

Wu has been working with a team of public and private sector researchers on the project, including UHCOP Professor and Director of the Institute for Drug Education and Research Diana S-L. Chow, Ph.D., who served as Wu's graduate UHCOP, NASA and private-sector contractor Wyle Laboratories. Their mission has been to develop a pharmacokinetic model for an intranasal gel formulation of the drug scopolamine to provide more effective, predictable drug-delivery system for spaceflight crews. Astronauts previously have used an orally administered form of scopolamine, but the effectiveness of oral medications typically is limited due to poor bioavailability and other factors. Space motion sickness is commonly experienced by astronauts and often requires treatment with medications during the early flight days of space missions. With symptoms that can include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, cold sweats and fatigue, space motion sickness is detrimental to the need for crews to operate at peak performance during their missions. The pharmacokinetic model will be used to predict the relationship between plasma, saliva and urinary scopolamine concentrations. With a validated model, the bioavailability of the drug can be determined by saliva and/or urine data \u2014 instead of the more invasive blood sampling \u2014 in space and other remote environments. Wu, who will continue to work with Chow as a post-doctoral researchers, received the same award in 2012 to present early results of the project.

Tam, Pharm.D., BCPS (AQ-ID), earned the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists' 2014 Pharmacotherapy Paper of the Year Award for his translational research challenging the perception of a \"safer\" choice between two \"last resort\" antimicrobial drugs used to treat multidrug resistant infections. The award recognized Tam's paper entitled \"In Vitro Assessment and Multicenter Cohort Study of Comparative Nephrotoxicity Rates Associated with Colistimethate versus Polymyxin B Therapy,\" which was published in the May 2014 issue of the Journal of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. The results of Tam's project call into question clinicians' use of colistin (also known as polymyxin E) vs. the use of the closely related polymyxin B, presumably due to a perceived benefit of a better safety profile with colistin. \"Colistin is more commonly used, but polymyxin B is pharmacokinetically more reliable and has other dosing advantages,\" Tam said. \"The conversion of colistin from the pro-drug is erratic; in patients with normal kidney function, more than 50 percent of the dose given would be eliminated before conversion, which means it's more difficult to achieve the desired concentration necessary to both inhibit control of the infection while also avoiding damage to the kidney.\" Tam's team conducted both in vitro experiments using mammalian kidney cells exposed to each of the drugs as well as a retrospective analysis of 200 patients who were treated with one of the drugs at hospitals in Houston and New York City. In both the in vitro experiments and the retrospective analysis, the team found no indication that polymyxin B was more toxic than colistin/polymyxin E. \"Our analysis indicated that the prevalence of nephrotoxicity was about 55 percent in colistimethate, compared to about 21 percent with Polymyxin B,\" Tam said. \"Our results are generating inquiries from clinicians across the country who are evaluating the potential of adding polymyxin B into their drug formulary.\" POLYMYXIN MISPERCEPTIONS Bench Notes Diana S-L.

The parasite - a member of the Cryptosporidium species of protozoa - resides in the digestive tract of human and animal hosts, but its developmental stage \"spores\" called oocysts can survive for long periods of time in the soil, water, food and surfaces. Cryptosporidiosis infections cause acute and chronic gastrointestinal pain and diarrhea; the resulting dehydration can be deadly for children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. Such infections are seen not only as a public health concern but its persistence in the environment, threat to vulnerable populations, and ease of dispersal also has generated security concerns as a potential biowarfare/bioterrorism agent. \"If one could access water-treatment facilities or the water supply, it would be easy to introduce, widely distribute and difficult to eradicate,\" Cuny said. \"The ooyctes are resistant to chlorination and not all standard filtration systems are designed to block organisms like Crypto. Although not necessarily lethal in immuno-competent people, it could cause a lot of havoc and significant financial impact.\" Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported worldwide; in the U.S., a 1993 episode in Milwaukee - the largest documented waterborne disease outbreak in U.S. history - sickened up to 400,000 and at least partly contributed to the deaths of more than 100 people. Outside of the U.S., \"Crypto\" is of particular concern in developing nations where such factors as suboptimal water quality/treatment processes, general nutrition and health care can exacerbate an outbreak's scope and severity. For several years, Cuny has been collaborating with colleagues at Brandeis University and Emory University to identify and characterize compounds that inhibit a key intracellular metabolic pathway in Crypto. Their approach centers on inhibiting an enzyme called Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is a key regulator for cell growth and proliferation, to effectively \"starve\" the organism of the biochemical fuel necessary for survival. Cuny received a $697,000 National Institutes of Health grant in 2014 to continue in vitro and in vivo studies aimed at establishing the pharmacokinetic (PK) and acute toxicity properties of the compounds. In addition to his external collaborators, Cuny has recruited UHCOP Professor Ming Hu, Ph.D., to assist with the PK and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies. Cuny conceded success will require clearing some unusual hurdles. \"Developing a cell-infectivity model has been a challenge for the field,\" he said. \"Unlike bacteria, Crypto cannot be continuously cultured, which presents an issue in the development and evaluation of compounds. Normally, one would like to have a predictive cellular assay, which you have in the area of antifungals and antibacterials. In the case of Crypto, it has to go through that life cycle of passing through the animal host, which excretes the oocyte to then infect cells. The animal models also present some challenges, including the fact that rodents tend to clear the infection quite rapidly compared to humans. \"Overall, we hope our work leads to a pharmacophore model - a structural blueprint - of what is required for an IMPDH inhibitor, which increases the likelihood that a compound could advance to clinical trials.\" TROUBLED WATERS CUNY PURSUES ENZYME INHIBITORS AS NOVEL DRUGS TO 'STARVE' PARASITE, STOP WATERBORNE INFECTIONS University of Houston College of Pharmacy 21photo by Kris KeheMAKING THE CASE FOR PHARMACY The continued involvement, dedication and leadership to pharmacy advocacy in Texas by the UH Chapter of the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists garnered the Student Advocacy Award from the Texas Pharmacy Association at the 2014 TPA Conference & Expo.

Giacomini, Ph.D., B.S. (' 74), was honored with the 2014 Distinguished Investigator Award by the American College of Clinical Pharmacology, which noted she \"represents the best of the translational, laboratory-based approach to the discipline of clinical pharmacology.\" Giacomini is a professor and vice chair in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), as well as co-director of the Center of Excellence in Regulatory Sciences and Innovation, a Food and Drug Administration-funded collaborative established in 2014 between UCSF and Stanford University. Giacomini also serves as the principal investigator on the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network's Pharmacogenomics Membrane Transporters Project that has resulted in $45 million in federal funding over since 2000. Giacomini relocated from Colorado to Houston when her husband was accepted into Baylor College of Medicine, a move that would profoundly change her life and career. \"When I transferred to UH, I was on track to work in community pharmacy, but the interaction with the faculty was life-changing because the outstanding teaching and learning environment got me so engaged in the pharmaceutics and the pharmacology behind the medications,\" she said. \"Pharmacist-scientists have made a huge impact on the field of pharmacogenomics, and I've been fortunate to work with some true pioneers.\" After graduating from UH, Giacomini earned a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics from the State University of New York at Buffalo, then completed postdoctoral research at the Stanford University School of Medicine before joining UCSF. Giacomini is recognized as a leader in the field of pharmacogenomics, specifically in the area of membrane transporter genomics and the role of these proteins in drug targeting, disposition and response. A major focus of her work is identifying genetic variation in transporter genes and understanding how those differences can alter drug response. Over the course of her career, Giacomini has helped discover about 50 coding and more than 100 promoter region variants in transporters that alter pharmacological effects in diverse populations. She is applying these findings to investigate the interactions between gene variants and specific drugs, particularly the antidiabetic drug Metformin. With more than 200 publications and continuous NIH funding since 1979, Giacomini has collected an array of honors from such organizations as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences; American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists; American College of Clinical Pharmacy; the International Pharmaceutical Federation; the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics; and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, to name a few.

The award \"recognizes an individual who has demonstrated excellence in consultant pharmacy practice.\" Owner/President of the Sugar Land, Texas-based LLW Consulting Inc., Lott has been working in institutional and long-term care pharmacy, including dispensing, consulting and local, regional and national management responsibilities, for more than 30 years. \"When I received the award for the first time over 20 years ago, I thought to myself, 'Why the heck am I getting this award?' because I'd only been in business a few years,\" Lott said. \"When they told me I was going to be honored with the award again, I thought, 'OK, I feel comfortable with my accomplishments and contributions to my clients and their patients, to accept this recognition.\" A Fellow of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Lott recently served as the inaugural president of the the ASCP's Texas Chapter. His other service activities include terms as president of the Houston Area Pharmacy Association, a member of the Texas Pharmacy Association Board of Directors, chair of TPA's Academy of Consultant Pharmacists, and a trustee of the TPA Foundation. A member of the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council, Lott also has served as president of the UH Pharmacy Alumni Association. He is a longtime supporter/sponsor of the scholarship golf tournament for UHCOP students, member of the Cougar Executives Organization, Cougars football fan and student preceptor. Lott and his wife and fellow UHCOP alum, Angela Andries-Lott, R.Ph., GCP, corporate pharmacy manager at Healix, are members of the UHCOP Mading Society and have established an endowed scholarship for UH Pharm.D. students. In 1998, the Lotts were jointly recognized with the college's \"Distinguished Alumnus Award.\" photo by Joe Gayle 32 University of Houston College of P harmacy DASHBOARD LIGHTS UP CAREER PATH 14), always had her sights set on the intersection of pharmacy, policy, and business administration, it was the glow from a \"340B dashboard\" which illuminated her career path. Karralli's Pharm.D. education included unique experiential rotations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as Cardinal Health, which provided her exposure to pharmaceutical supply chain management. Following graduation, she pursued the concurrent UHCOP M.S./Memorial Hermann Health System PGY1-PGY2 health-system pharmacy administration residency program. During the residency, she had an active role in the 340B program management for seven Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) entities in the system as well as assisting in the preparation and completion of a HRSA audit at one of the sites. Karralli also spent a month in Washington, D.C., at 340B Health (formerly Safety Net Hospitals for Pharmaceutical Access), a membership organization of more than 1,000 U.S. public and private nonprofit hospitals and health systems participating in the 340B drug pricing program. Created in 1992, the federal 304B program allows qualified healthcare organizations such as safety net hospitals and federally qualified health centers to purchase covered outpatient drugs at reduced prices for their patients. Among the projects Karralli tackled during the two-year program was Texas' participation in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative survey and the development of a multi-site pharmacy PGY1 residency program, which is a collaborative resource-sharing model that increased the number of residency positions within Memorial Hermann system. Yet, it was her master's project - the design of a 340B metrics dashboard - that allowed her skills, talents and passion to shine through. The dashboard is a tool used to evaluate four domains - cost savings, the program maintenance costs, compliance and the community benefit - associated with an individual hospital's utilization of the 340B program. \"Given the complex intricacies of 340B implementation, one of the challenges is the need for metrics on how the program is being utilized, the implications of the program on an institution and its patients, and maintenance of program integrity,\" said Karralli, who was honored with the TSHP Research & Education Foundation's Leo F. and Ann Godley Residency Fellowship Award in 2014. \"The 340B program is not a pharmacy program, but an entire organization's responsibility. It is important to have adequate resources in place to support program compliance and measurement of performance. Knowing the effectiveness of one's 340B program implementation is instrumental in continuous program integrity. \"My goal was to capture metrics that allow the macro assessment of program effectiveness at a hospital-centric level\u2014this included financial, charity care and compliance information.\" Her research gathering and presentations at ASHP, TSHP and other venues brought her into contact with Irving, Texas-based Apexus LLC, which is the exclusive prime vendor of the 340B Drug Pricing Program under contract by the federal government. After completing the M.S./residency program, Karralli joined Apexus as Manager of 340B Education and Compliance Support. \"I'm in a field-based role providing education and compliance support to all 340B program stakeholders across the country, ranging from health care organizations, manufacturers, distributors, consultants, etc.,\" she said. \"It is essential that stakeholders utilize validated resources so that program integrity can be maintained in the marketplace. It is rewarding to have a role in providing stakeholders with compliant solutions as they navigate through the program.\" photo by Matt White Physican, researcher, educator, Royal Society fellow, knight, Nobel Laureate. Not a bad r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a lad from the coal fields of Scotland whose primary education was by his own admission largely marked by \"daydreaming.\" From his humble academic beginnings, Sir James W. Black, M.D., FRS, would go on to developing some of the most important advancements of the 20th century in the fields of cardiovascular science and pharmacology: the beta-blocker propanolol for the treatment of angina, hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders and cimetidine for peptic ulcers. In recognition of Black's remarkable career and accomplishments spanning more than 50 years, the Australia-based biotechnology company Invion Ltd. has established an endowed memorial fund in Sir James' name to support UHCOP pharmacology and pharmaceutics graduate students' travel to present their research at international conferences. \"Honoring Sir James Black through this scholarship makes perfect sense for Invion Ltd, reflecting both Dr. Black's seminal contributions and his passion for mentoring and enabling young scientists,\" said Dr. Mitchell Glass, M.D., executive vice president of Research & Development and chief medical officer of Invion. \"James Black's career focused on the practical applications of receptor theory, leading to drugs that affect the beta receptor, and paving the way for beta blockers which save millions of lives per year. \"Sir James Whyte Black was always intrigued by apparently contradictory discoveries, such as finding that blocking a single receptor could effectively reduce blood pressure, a system under complex control.\" Among the therapeutics in the Invion pipeline is INV102 (nadalol), which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of mild, but chronic, asthma as well as being proposed for use in smoking cessation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nadalol was patented for use in asthma by UHCOP Professor Richard A. Bond, Ph.D. ('88), B.S. ('83), a longtime friend and mentee of Sir James. With beta-blockers contraindicated for asthma (much like beta blockers were once contraindicated for congestive heart failure), Bond said Black's work was a pivotal source of inspiration for investigating the potential benefits of a drug currently held to be \"pharma non grata.\" Sir James held several academic positions during his career, including chancellor of Scotland's University of Dundee, but his most important discoveries were made while in the pharmaceutical industry. Although his discoveries would become the best-selling prescription drugs of their time, Black himself gained little in the way of direct financial gain. Sir James was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976, knighted in 1981, awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Americans George H. Hitchings and Gertrude B. Elion) in 1988 and inducted into the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. The University of Dundee also founded the Sir James Black Centre, an interdisciplinary research focused on cancer, diabetes and tropical diseases, in his honor. Sir James focused much of his energy on mentoring the next generation of scientists, and he recognized the unique value of scientific meetings as a means for sharing ideas freed from the constraints of published peer-review research, Glass said. \"Enabling highly qualified scientists early in their research careers to engage and enjoy their peers and mentors is a fitting tribute to this unique individual and his intellectual legacy,\" Glass said.Giving NewsFather of the Beta Blockers Invion Establishes Fund for PPS Student Travel in Memory of Sir James photo reprinted by permission/courtesy of University of Dundee University of Houston College of Pharmacy 33 photo by Matt White UH College of Pharmacy Dean F.

In 1998, membership was extended to corporations and foundations that contribute $25,000 or more in cumulative gifts. The society is named in memory of Cora and Webb Mading, the college's first major benefactors. Upon Mr. Mading's death in 1953, the college was bequeathed $20,000 for a scholarship endowment that has grown to $100,000 in value.

Born and raised in Jacksonville, Texas, Hopson graduated from UH College of Pharmacy in 1965 and went to work at then-Hermann Hospital. After nine years in hospital pharmacy, Hopson said he was \"coaxed\" into becoming an independent community pharmacist in 1973. \"One day I was in May Drug having lunch and the owner, James A. May, pulled me aside and said he wanted to sell his pharmacy to someone,\" Hopson said. \"When I asked if you could make money with it, he showed me his income statement, and that got my attention. I said that I didn't have any money to buy a pharmacy, and he said he'd finance it. I told him that I didn't have any money for a down payment, he said I didn't need one. Then, I told him 'I think you just sold your pharmacy.' \" Hopson went on to operate May Drug for nearly 40 years (longer, in fact, than the pharmacy's namesake), which provided not only for his family - wife, Billie, three children and six grandchildren - but also allowed him to both serve his community and represent his profession in other ways. In addition to terms as president of the Central East Texas Pharmacy Association and the then-Texas Society of Hospital Pharmacists, Hopson served on the Jacksonville City Council, Jacksonville School Board and the governing boards of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Austin Bank, Nan Travis Hospital Foundation and Lon Morris College. Those leadership experiences propelled Hopson to seek higher office, with his election to the Texas House of Representatives in 2001. During his tenure in the Texas Legislature, Hopson became known as \"The Pharmacist\" and his fellow lawmakers routinely sought his advice on the impact of laws and regulations concerning pharmacy issues. \"For 12 years, there weren't any bills about pharmacy that I didn't know about or couldn't talk about,\" said Hopson, who now serves as director of Pharmacy Policy for managed health care company Superior Health Plan whose affiliated Superior HealthPlan Network manages the STAR health program statewide. \"We didn't always have success in pushing through bills on behalf of pharmacy, but I think we managed to defeat a lot of bills that would have hurt pharmacy. \"Politics, like pharmacy, is about relationships. In pharmacy, you build relationships with your patients, the prescribers, your wholesalers and distributors, your fellow pharmacists in the associations, and others. In politics, you build relationships with your constituents, fellow legislators, state employees and agency leaders, members of the business community and the like.\" In recognition of his commitment to building bridges, Hopson was named \"Businessman of the Year\" and \"Citizen of the Year\" by the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, \"Best Elected Official\" by readers of his hometown newspaper and a \"Fighter of Free Enterprise\" by the Texas Association of Business. A member of the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council, Hopson is a past recipient of the college's Distinguished Alumnus Award and the Meritorious Achievement Award as well as serving as the Phi Lambda Sigma James T. McCarty Leadership Lecturer last spring. With the recent creation of The Honorable Charles L. \"Chuck\" Hopson Scholarship Endowment at the college, Hopson said he hopes to not only assist UH students in completing their pharmacy education but also encourage them to serve their community in other capacities. \"I'd like to see more people get interested in politics because decisions are being made every day that affect our profession, schools, children, grandchildren and so many other aspects of our lives,\" Hopson said. \"I sincerely hope there are some in the next generation of pharmacists who recognize that people in Austin really do want to help and, if you work hard, you can make a difference for pharmacy and for Texas. \"It's a big sacrifice, but if you're fortunate enough to have a supportive family like I do, it's one of the greatest experiences one can have: To serve not only your patients, but the people of an entire state.\" Politics, like pharmacy, is about relationships. \u2014 Charles L. \"Chuck\" Hopson, R.Ph.CALLED TO SERVE CHUCK 'THE PHARMACIST' HOPSON STRIVES TO INSPIRE PUBLIC SERVICE BEYOND PROFESSION University of Houston College of Pharmacy 37photo by Kris KeheAlbertsons Sav-on/Albertsons - Ciara Will Alton and Sandra Kanak Endowed Scholarship - Omaida Hernandez-RayAmgen Foundation - Lang Nguyen Anant Ram Gupta Presidential Endowed Scholarship - Jensen IdiculaAndrea L.
