Often called meditation in motion, Tai Chi has its roots in Chinese martial arts. Over the years, Tai Chi has evolved into a graceful form of exercise that is now used for its health benefits and stress reduction. The movements are practiced slowly and smoothly. Each movement, or posture, flows into the next ensuring that your body is always in motion. As your body becomes used to the movements, your muscles and mind relax with the continuous motion and patterns. Tai Chi differs from other types of exercise in several respects: - Muscles are relaxed rather than tensed. - The movements are usually circular and never forced. - Joints are not fully extended or bent.
