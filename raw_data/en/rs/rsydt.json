TECHNICAL REPORT Catalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hes itancy 1 Introduction Vaccines and immuni sation programmes have prevented major epidemics of life threatening diseases since the beginning of their widespread use in the 1900s . For this reason , vaccinatio n is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20 th century [1]. The history of public concerns about and questioning of vaccines , however, is as old as vaccines themselves. As the widespread use of vaccines has grown, so have anxiet ies about vaccine safety and their regulation [2]. Modern day communication capacities have provided many new platforms for speeding up the spread of these anxieties. Current ly, most countries in Europe and many globally, are dealing with pockets of people who are reluctant or refuse recommended vaccination (s), or who chose to delay some vaccines. This phenomenon is defined as vaccine hesitancy (to be further described below). This catalogue developed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Va ccine Confidence Project is part of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's activities aimed to provide tools and information resources to support EU/EEA countries in addressing the challenging issue of vaccine hesitancy. The project was d eveloped in the context of ECDC's support to EU/EEA Member States in prevention and control of vaccine\u00adpreventable diseases, including effective communication to promote immunisation. Vaccine hesitancy is defined as 'a behaviour, influenced by a number of factors including issues of confidence (level of trust in vaccine or provider), complacency (do not perceive a need for a vaccine, do not value the vaccine), and convenience (access). Vaccine -hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group that are indecis ive in varying degrees about specific vaccines or vaccination in general. Vaccine -hesitant individuals may accept all vaccines but remain concerned about vaccines, some may refuse or delay some vaccines, but accept others, and some individuals may refuse a ll vaccines ' [3]. Due to the diversity of situations in which vaccine hesitancy can arise , interventions have to be contact specific (depending on the public involved) and problem specific (depending on the type of concern). This catalogue provides examp les of practices that can serve as a bank of ideas for other countries. It takes in to consideration the importan ce of identifying the underlying issues that generat e vaccine hesitancy in order to appropriately address them. Hence, the catalogue is divided into two parts: first, interventions to diagnose the hesitancy (metric tools and assessment instruments) ; and secondly, interventions to address the issue once defined (what to do at the individual and community level to tackle the problem). The current project will further complement the work done by ECDC in the area of supporting countries when addressing vaccine hesitan cy to effective ly promote vaccination uptake , by providing supplementary data and practical resources that countries can use and adapt according to their national and local approaches and needs . Aim The aim of this catalogue it to provide a practical tool for public health organisations and immunisation stakeholders in the EU/EEA to address the challenging problem of vaccine hesitancy. T he catalogue offers a collection of interventions developed in EU/EEA countries as well as in other regions to measure and address vaccine hesitancy, and showcases examples of practices that can be adapted according to national and local needs and strategi es. Methods The interventions included in this catalogue were identified through four different routes: review of ECDC's technical reports on understanding vaccine hesitancy [4, 5] review of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization report on strategies to address vaccine hesitancy [6, 7] web search and review of the lit erature on strategies to address vaccine hesitancy published since the completion of the above two reviews consultations with relevant experts . Catalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy TECHNICAL REPORT 2 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of interventions The catalogue includes interventions and strategies that directly and specifically address vaccine hesitancy by focusing on specific issues and specific sub -populations which are vaccine hesitant, have shown concerns about vaccines, or are resistant to vaccination. Interventions were therefore ex cluded if they focused on improving vaccine uptake more generally , attitudes to vaccination more generally , or knowledge in the general population without referring to vaccine hesitancy. All population groups within hesitant populations were included: pare nts, teenagers and children, healthcare workers, vaccine providers, adults, religious communities, etc. Interventions were included if they focused on any human vaccines and regardless of the nature of the drivers of hesitancy, settings, approaches, or geo graphical location. The catalogue includes interventions that meet these criteria from any country or region of the world. Both evaluated and non -evaluated interventions showing promising practi ce were included in the catalogue . The catalogue includes int erventions described in reports or scientific literature but excludes guidelines and interventions that are only suggested or recommended without having been put in practice . 2. Review of the ECDC and WHO SAGE reports on understanding and addressing vacci ne hesitancy Three prominent reports on vaccine hesitancy were reviewed to identify relevant interventions for the catalogue: ECDC's two technical reports on understanding vaccine hesitancy [4, 5] and the WHO SAGE report on strategies to address vaccine hesitancy [6]. One of ECDC's technical reports is a rapid literature review of determinants of vaccine hesitancy in Europe and strategies addressing these determinants. The other report is a more in depth study looking at vaccine hesitancy among vaccine providers in Europe. The WHO SAGE report is a global systematic literature review of strategies addressing vaccine hesitancy conducted in 2014 . The interventions described and analysed in these three report s were identified and reviewed for inclusion in the catalogue based on the inclusion criteria described above. A total of 212 unique interventions were identified after duplicates were removed . The selected interventions included 149 identified through the SAGE systematic literature review and 63 through ECDC's technical reports. After full text appraisal, 16 interventions ( eight identified through SAGE and eight through the ECDC reports ) were included in the catalogue as they specifically address vaccine h esitancy. 3. Additional web search and review of the literature In order to identify the most recent interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy, an additional web search and a literature review were performed. The literature search was performed in Febr uary 2016, in MEDLINE, and used the following keywords and search strategy: (strateg* or intervent* or campaign* or immuniz*) AND (hesitan* or confiden*). The search was conducted in English for articles published since 2014 (the year the SAGE systematic review was performed ). The search yielded 555 unique articles, which were screened by title and abstract. A total of 36 articles were selected for full text appraisal and 13 of these were inc luded in the catalogue based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described above. A rapid web search was conducted on Google in March 2016 to complement the literature search and identify grey literature. The search was conducted up to page five and u sed the following keywords: vaccine hesitancy strategy (207k results), vaccine hesitancy intervention (168k results), vaccine hesitancy strategy WHO (164k results), vaccine hesitancy intervention WHO (128k results), vaccine hesitancy strategy ECDC (8,960 r esults), and vaccine hesitancy intervention ECDC (6,220 results). No additional relevant reports were identified for full text appraisal and inclusion in the catalogue. TECHNICAL REPORT Catalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy 3 4. Consultations with experts A first draft of the catalogue was sent to seven expert s on vaccine hesitancy to enquire about any additional interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy. Experts from different European countries and with varied background were identified through relevant literature on vaccine hesitancy: Name Institution Count ry Adriana Baban Babes -Bolyai University Romania Agoritsa Baka Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Greece Liesbeth Mollema National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) the Netherlands Pierluigi Lopalco University of Pisa Italy Pierre Van Damme University of Antwerp Belgium Pierre Verger National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) France Xavier Bosch Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) Spain Experts were contacted by email in March 2016. A further nine interventions were included in the catalogue based on their feedback . An additional two interventions were added following discussions with in ECDC and the final version of the catalogue was produced. The latest update of the information was done in Octo ber 2016. 5. Structure of the catalogue and standardised description of interventions Extensive research on vaccine hesitancy has shown that the first step in responding to vaccine hesitancy should consist of identifying determinants of vaccine hesitancy and concerns raised by hesitant populations. Therefore, the first section of the catalogue lists relevant interventions that focus on developing tools to measure the scope and scale of vaccine hesitancy in various populations. These diagnostic tools can t hen be used by public health professionals to inform the development of targeted interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. The second section of the catalogue focuses on interventions designed to address or respond to vaccine hesitancy. It is subdivided into three categories: individual -level interventions focusing on parents ; individual -level interventions focusing on improving healthcare workers' confidence and communication skills to respond to hesitant patients ; and interventions focusing on respondi ng to hesitancy at a community level. Each intervention included in the catalogue addressing vaccine hesitancy is described in a standardised way: aim determinants of hesitancy targeted ( safety issues, trust, religious and philosophical views, misinformat ion, mandates, perceived benefits, and general vaccine hesitancy ). country of intervention setting target population organisation/individuals administering the intervention particular vaccine(s) of focus type of intervention ( dialogue -based, incentive -based, reminder -recall based, diagnostic tool, advocacy campaign ) funding main components of the intervention evaluation links to relevant publications or resources The different determinants of hesitancy were chosen to reflect the most important drivers of vaccine hesitancy present in Europe (identified in ECDC's technical report on understanding vaccine hesitancy [5]) and were based on the SAGE determinants of vaccine hesitancy. The types of intervention were also informed by the SAGE categories of interve ntions addressing vaccine hesitancy. Finally, a summary of practical tips and lessons learnt is provided at the end of the catalogue in order to support countries with the adaptation of interventions, making them context specific and culturally appropriat e.

Global vaccine confidence index Intervention details Aim The aim of the Global Vaccine Confidence Index is to measure vaccine hesitancy and provide information about hesitan t populations and the nature of their concerns Country Global/All countries Setting N/A (varies by country, see description of the intervention) Target population Vaccine -hesitant populations Administrator Core Confidence index is administered globally through a joint collaboration between Gallup International and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Vaccine Confidence Project. Additional local level surveys using the index are administered by national immunisation programmes and research institutions Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Not specified Main components The intervention consists of a survey which was designed by the Vaccine Confidence Project and administered in collaboration with Gallup Int ernational's Global Public Health Polling Network. The survey was administered face-to-face ( Nigeria, Pakistan , Georgia ), online (UK), and with computer -assisted telephone (India). The questions in the survey varied slightly by country but included the fol lowing: in general, how much confidence do you have in immunisation/vaccines? In family planning services/contraceptives? In emergency services? In government healthcare facilities? In community health workers? have you ever hesitated/been reluctant to hav e your youngest child vaccinated? (If yes, for which vaccine? Did you eventually have him/her vaccinated or missed that vaccine?) why were you reluctant or refused to get your youngest child immuni sed? (Did not think it was needed, too far away, timing inc onvenient, not possible to leave work, did not think the vaccine was effective, did not think the vaccine was safe, religious reasons, other beliefs/traditional medicine, had a bad experience or reaction with previous vaccination, had a bad experience with previous vaccinator/health clinic, someone else told me they/their child had a bad reaction, someone else told me that the vaccine was not safe, can't say, other) in your opinion, how many people in your community get their children immunised? Evaluatio n No evaluation. The survey was piloted in five countries (Nigeria, UK, Georgia, Pakistan, and India) , and showed that all countries faced confidence gaps and are addressing these confidence challenges with differing levels of success.

Guide to Tailoring Immunisation Programmes (TIP) Intervention details Aim The Guide to Tailoring Immunisation Programmes (TIP) aims to provide support to national immunisation programmes in desig ning strategies to increase vaccination uptake. It also includes tools to identify vaccine - hesitant population, identify barriers and enablers of vaccination in these populations, and develop adapted responses and strategies that are setting - and context -specific Country WHO Europe an Region Setting National immunisation programmes Target population Susceptible population groups Administrator National immunisation programme managers, together with WHO Europe technical officers Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Not specified Main components TIP is a diagnostic tool, which can be used to define and diagnose vaccine hesitancy and offer appropriate interventions. Evaluation An evaluation of the TIP tool was done in 201 6. TIP has been applied successfully in a few countries (Bulgaria, Lithuania, Montenegro, Sweden, and the UK) to improve the under standing of concerns in vaccine - hesitant populations and develop targeted strategies . Other countries have initiated applicati on of TIP and the process is ongoing. Relevant resources Butler R, MacDonald NE, SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy .

Joint Reporting Form on immunisation Intervention details Aim The Joint Reporting Form (JRF) on Immunisation was developed to collect information on vaccination in all WHO member states. A section on 'vaccine hesitancy ' allows WHO to identify hesitant populations and assess the nature of their concerns. Country Global Setting Online reporting form Target population Vaccine -hesitant populat ions Administrator National immunisation programme managers, WHO/UNICEF Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Not specified Main components The JRF is a tool developed by WHO and UNICEF to collect information in a standa rdised manner about vaccines in WHO Member States, including the scope and nature of vaccine hesitancy. Every year, national immunisation programme managers are asked to complete the JRF, which includes the following four questions on vaccine hesitancy: What are the top three reasons for not accepting vaccines according to the national schedule? Is this response based on or supported by some type of assessment or is it an opinion based on your knowledge and expertise? Has there been some assessment of vac cine hesitancy or refusal among the public at national or sub - national level? If yes, please provide assessment title(s) and reference(s) to any publication/report Evaluation No evaluation. The questions on vaccine hesitancy included in the JRF were pilot ed and revised according to the results. The pilot revealed that only 14% of countries completed the questions on vaccine hesitancy in 2012 and 69% in 2013 (question 1).

The P arent Atti tudes About Childhood Vaccines Survey Intervention details Aim The aim of the Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey is to identify vaccine -hesitant parents, and assess their behaviour and concerns around childhood vaccines Country United St ates Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Parents Administrator Vaccine providers Vaccine(s) Childhood vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool, dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components The PACV survey is a short self -administered survey designed to identify vaccine -hesitant parents and to measure their attitudes and beliefs about immunisation. The survey contains 15 items under three domains: behaviour, safety and efficacy, and general attitudes. A 'PACV score' is calcula ted for each parent by assigning points for hesitant responses. The survey is administered to parents before appointments with health supervision visits, which allows healthcare providers to be immediately informed of the possible hesitancy of parents and to tailor and adapt their messages and communication strategies for each patient. Evaluation A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the predictive validity and test -retest reliability of the PACV among 220 participants. The evaluation confir med the success of the intervention, which found that parents of two-months old children with an increase in scores of at least 50 predicted a significant and incremental increase in under immunisation at 19 -months of age. The evaluation concluded that the PACV survey is a robust measure of parental immunisation attitudes and beliefs. The estimated mean scoring time was one minute. In 2015, the PACV survey was once again evaluated in relation to acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccine in a paediatric emerg ency department setting. The survey was found to be a successful tool to identify vaccine -hesitant parents. Relevant resources Opel DJ, Mangione -Smith R, Taylor JA, Korfiatis C, Wiese C, Cat z S et al..

The Vaccine Confidence Scale Intervention details Aim The aim of the Vaccine Confidence Scale is to measure and assess parental beliefs and confidence in adolescent vaccination across diverse population groups Country United States Setting Telephone surveys Target population Parents (of 13 - to 17- year old adolescents) Administrator Researchers Vaccine(s) Adolescent vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Not specified Main components The Vaccine Confidence Scale can be used to assess parental beliefs about the vaccination of teenagers on a scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (st rongly agree). It has been developed based on the Health Belief Model and asks parents to evaluate the following statements about the perceived benefits of and/or barriers to vaccination, as well as their trust in healthcare providers: Vaccines are necess ary to protect the health of teenagers Vaccines do a good job in preventing the diseases they are intended to prevent Vaccines are safe If I do not vaccinate my teenager, he/she may get a disease such as meningitis and cause other teenagers or adults also to get the disease Teenagers receive too many vaccines If I vaccinate my teenager, he/she may have serious side effects In general, medical professionals in charge of vaccinations have my teenager's best interest at heart I have a good relationship with my teenager's healthcare provider Evaluation An exploratory factor analysis was used amongst a sample of parents to evaluate and refine the Vaccine Confidence Scale. The scale was found to be consistent and to maintain a good fit across different demographi c subgroups of parents. It is a brief and efficient measure of parental beliefs about adolescent vaccination. The scale can also be used to identify which clusters of beliefs (trust, perceived benefits or perceived barriers) contribute to confidence in dif ferent populations.

The Vaccine Sentimeter Intervention details Aim The aim of the Vaccine Sentimeter is to monitor mainstream and social media for content on vaccination Country Globa l Setting Online Target population Online users Administrator Online tool Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Free-to-use online tool Main components The vaccine Sentimeter is a web -based tool which can be used to c ollect media articles from over 100 000 online sources every hour, in English, Spanish, and French. The Vaccine Sentimeter was developed by Epidemico, ProMEd -mail, and Sanofi Pasteur. Keywords used by the tool to search mainstream media include names of va ccines, ingredients, vaccine -preventable diseases, as well as colloquial terms for vaccines. Social media posts are collected through the Twitter Application Program Interface, a publicly available interface, by searching for English vaccine -specific taxon omy. Data processing is automatically done using HealthMap technology and tagging date, source, vaccine type, and location. Automated tagging is then followed by human curation of each article to control the tags and assign sentiments to the articles (posi tive, negative, or neutral). The tool offers the possibility for analysis of data by displaying articles geographically, by percentage of negative sentiment in each countries, dates, article title, vaccine, category, sentiment and location. The tool is ava ilable online and is open -access. Evaluation The tool was tested on two cases of low vaccine confidence. The settings were polio vaccination in Pakistan after a news story about a Central Intelligence Agency vaccination nurse and subsequent attacks on healthcare workers, and a controversial episode in a television program about adverse events following human papillomavirus vaccination. Data was collected between October 2012 and November 2014. The tests confirmed that the Vaccine Sentimeter can be used to monitor real -time sentiments about vaccination and identify trends in misinformation.

Tools for the measurement of vaccine hesitancy Intervention details Aim Different tools were developed to facilitate the measurement of vaccine hesitancy, identification of hesitant popula tions, and assessment of the nature and scope of concerns in hesitant populations Country Global Setting Not specified Target population Vaccine hesitant populations Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Diagnostic tool Funding Not specified Main components A set of three different research tools were developed to facilitate the measurement of vaccine hesitancy, identification of hesitant population, and assessment of the nature and scope of concerns in hesitant populations. These are based on a comprehensive literature search. The set of survey questions were developed following an initial review of existing vaccine hesitancy surveys, and consultations within the SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Working Group as well as wit h SAGE members. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy questions were piloted in the annual WHO -UNICEF joint reporting form, completed by National Immuni sation Managers globally. Three types of research tools are described: two surveys and one open -ended qualitat ive questionnaire. These tools can be used, modified and developed further by researchers. They constitute a help for anyone wanting to do research to measure vaccine hesitancy .

Addressing the problem 2.1 Individual -level interventions focusing on parents 2.1A. Behavioural intervention to increase HPV vaccination acceptability Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim This educational intervention aims to decrease mothers' concerns about vaccination by giving them information about risks in different formats Country United States Setting Online Target population Mothers Administrator Online Vaccine(s) HPV Type of intervention Dialogue-based Funding Not specified Main components This is an online educational intervention, which starts by asking mothers two rhetorical questions: Do you want to protect your daughter from cancer? If there was a vaccine to protect your daughter agains t cancer, would you have her get it? These questions are asked to provoke high levels of agreement and ensure mothers' commitment to general principles. Then, mothers are either provided with textual information developed by the US Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC) on various risks (basic non -statistical information about cervical cancer, HPV, and the HPV vaccine) or numerical information on the risks of cervical cancer and HPV vaccination efficacy. The numerical information is complemented b y graphics to facilitate visualisation of girls who would get cervical cancer with and without vaccination (using a stadium graphic and contrasting colours). Evaluation The intervention was evaluated and it was found that mothers who viewed graphics repre sentations of HPV vaccination risks and benefits had significantly stronger intentions to vaccinate their daughters. The use of rhetorical questions also had a significant positive impact on mothers' intention to vaccinate. However, each intervention was f ound to be stronger in the absence of the other.

The brochure, entitle d 'Why vaccinate your child ', answers the following questions: Should I vaccinate my child? What is in a v accine? Do children still get these diseases? Are these diseases really serious? How are vaccines tested? Are there long -term effects of vaccines? What about autism? What about mercury in vaccines? Can vaccines \"overload my child's immune system? Would my child get a disease if not vaccinated? Reference Evaluation The brochure was evaluated during focus groups with parents questioning immunisations as well as through a mailed survey. The evaluation showed no significant impact on attitudes about vaccinatio n. Parents reported positive impressions of the brochure, trust in the (new) information provided, and improved opinions of the CDC. Their suggestions for an improved brochure included being direct and honest, adding more information, and a better balance between the risks and benefits of vaccination.

Parents' responses are then used to offer parents access to tailored web pages. The websites are tailored in four d ifferent ways: Image tailoring: pictures on the website match the self -reported race of parents Content tailoring: the information provided on the website addresses the specific concerns parents reported in the survey Experiential tailoring: messages are a dapted to parents' past experiences with the vaccine Name tailoring: the website uses the child's name into the content Evaluation The intervention was evaluated using a randomised pilot study involving vaccine -hesitant parents, guardians and primary car etakers. It was found that parents' intention to vaccinate increased significantly in both arms of the study but would be more pronounced in the tailored messaging group (not statistically significant). The most important changes were found in parents that were unsure or neutral before the intervention. Untailored information was found to result in a worsening of parental intentions.

Messages to inform parents about MMR vaccination Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Messages about MMR vaccination are sent to parents with the aim of addressing misinformation and improving their intention to vaccinate Country United States Setting Online Target population Parents Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) MMR Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components The first element of the intervention consists of assessing parental attitudes to wards vaccination. Then, four different types of messages with text adapted from CDC materials can be administered: Messages correcting misinformation, for instance by providing scientific evidence showing that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism Messages on the risks of measles, mumps and rubella, including symptoms and complications Messages using dramatic narratives such as a mother sharing her experience of her infant's hospitalisation for measles Messages with visuals showing the risks of measles, mumps, and rubella (i.e. children suffering from these diseases) Evaluation Three outcomes were assessed in an evaluation of this intervention: misperceptions about vaccines causing autism, perceptions of side effects, and intention to vaccin ate their children. Corrective messages were successful in correcting misperceptions about MMR but also reduced vaccination intent in parents that were identified as having the least favourable vaccine attitudes. Messages using dramatic narratives and visu als were found to increase misperceptions about MMR. Finally, no message increased intention to vaccinate in parents' with the least favourable attitudes towards vaccines, while those with more favourable attitudes were found to be extremely likely to vacc inate.

Specialist immunisation clinics Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim This intervention aims to increase vaccination uptake amongst vaccine hesitant parents by referring them to specialist immunisation clinics Country Australia Setting Healthcare facilities ( specialist immunisation clinics (SICs)) Target population Parents (vaccine -hesitant) Administrator Vaccine providers (in SIC) Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Fundin g SICs are publicly funded Main components Specialist immunisation clinics are used for four different purposes: to assist children after the report of an adverse event following immunisation to work on catch -up immunisation of children who have recent ly migrated to Australia , to develop immunisation plans for people with special r isk medical conditions, and to provide advice to vaccine hesitant parents. Hesitant parents are identified by primary care providers, paediatricians, and/or emergency physic ians as parents with concerns about vaccination but that have given all vaccines to their children, parents that have delayed all or most vaccines, or parents that have refused all vaccines. These parents are referred to SICs for 30-minute initial consulta tions with paediatricians, potentially followed by 15 -minute review appointments. These consultations offer paediatricians a chance to understand parents' concerns about vaccines and to address those concerns with specific and balanced information on the r isks and benefits of vaccination using surveillance data, fact sheets, decision aids, videos and websites. Evaluation Retrospective audits (1990 -1992, 2006 -2007, and 2012 -2013) have shown that SIC consultations led to a small increase in vaccination uptak e amongst children of vaccine hesitant parents. The latest evaluation showed that 26% of all vaccine -hesitant parents fully vaccinated their children and 42% of all vaccine -hesitant parents selectively vaccinated their children 14.5 months after their SIC consultation. The intervention was more successful in parents that have concerns about vaccination but still vaccinate than in parents who delay all or most vaccines. All refusers remained unimmunised.

Vaccine information pamphlets Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Changing mothers' attitudes and beliefs about vaccine safety by giving vaccine information materials Country United States Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Mothers (concerns about vaccination) Administrator Vaccine providers Vaccine(s) Childhood vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components This intervention consists of two-sided colour pamphlets presenting basic information about the need and safety of all vaccines given during the first year of life. It also includes information about the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) vaccine licensing procedure and about the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System's role in vaccine safety monitoring. Finally, it describes potential serious adverse events following the DTaP, MMR, measles, hepatitis B, and rubella vac cines and answers the following questions: Why do children need so many vaccines? Why does my child have to receive so many vaccines in one visit? Why give my child combination vaccines? Why does my child have to get so many doses of the same vaccine? Why does my child have to receive different vaccines at different ages? When should my child not receive a vaccine? Is there some kind of natural immunity I could get for my child instead of vaccines? How can I pay for all the vaccines? Evaluation The pamphle t was developed and piloted by focus group discussions with mothers, who mostly liked the brochures but believed it did not provide sufficient information. Another study showed that mothers believed the pamphlet was more visually pleasing and easier to und erstand than the typical Vaccine Information Statements provided by CDC. They viewed the pamphlet as a good tool to facilitate discussions with providers. The intervention was also found to increase mothers' confidence in vaccination. More specifically, it had an impact on the belief that multiple vaccines overload the immune system but it did not decrease the fear of side effects in mothers. Finally another study looked at the timing of the distribution of the pamphlet and found no clear benefit of providi ng study materials earlier (except from mothers' reported preference). Repeated provision of vaccine -information materials had a positive impact on attitudes and beliefs but did not have a significant impact on fear of side effects.

Vaccine risk communication messages Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Impro ve mother's attitudes and beliefs towards vaccine safety by providing an educational intervention containing vaccine risk assessment and/or consequences of reduced vaccination coverage. Country United States Setting Not specified Target population Mothers (concerns about vaccination) Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) Childhood vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components The intervention consists of three different written educational messages : A risk comp arison message: 'There are many things parents do to prevent their kids from getting sick or hurt. Sometimes, these things have risks as well as benefits, and doing them means taking on that risk of harm. For example, seatbelts and car seats help protect k ids in car crashes but can cause harm if not used the right way. Vaccine s help keep kids safe from serious diseases like measles, but also have an extremely small risk of serious side effects. It's true that we don't know when or if these things will ever happen. Parents take these steps because the risks of disease or injury are far higher than the risks of taking preventive action .' A reduced coverage message: 'Last year, 93% of children in the United States got their MMR shot on time. Only 56 people got measles last year in the whole country. This could change if too many parents chose not to have their child get the MMR shot. If only 73% of people had their MMR shot, many more people would get measles. For example, in a town of 50,000 people, about 1,900 would get measles. About 380 of those people would be sick enough to have to go to the hospital '. Both a risk comparison and a reduced coverage message . Evaluation The intervention was designed after formative research with women. Then, it was evaluate d using a randomi sed pre - and post -test control group survey design. Mother's opinions of childhood vaccines improved after all interventions (1,2,3) but there were no significant changes in specific vaccine related attitudes. The reduced coverage message was remembered easily and well received by respondents. There was a preference for the use of numbers instead of more subjective terms. The risk comparison message did not result in a large proportion of mothers reporting a positive opinion of vaccines (on ly if paired with reduced coverage).

Countering anti -vaccination attitudes Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim This intervention aims to measure parents' attitudes towards vaccination and alter such attitudes by drawing attention to the consequences of not vaccinating their children. Country United States Setting Online Target population Parents and general public Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) All va ccines Type of intervention Dialogue based Funding Not specified Main components Pre-test of attitudes towards vaccines: a five-item vaccine attitude scale was developed to measure people's general attitudes towards vaccines. Exposure to information a bout consequences of not vaccinating: r espondents were invited for a second phase in which they would be randomly assigned to read information contained in disease risk, autism correction, or control interventions. Post-test of attitudes towards vaccines : participants were asked questions about their past vaccine behaviours and their intentions to vaccinate their children in the future. The authors created a vaccination attitude change score, which was computed as the difference between participants' post - test and pre -test vaccination attitude scores. Evaluation The evaluation of this intervention found that information about disease risk led to larger changes in vaccination attitudes. Attitude change scores were also more positive when informed about dis ease risk rather than when informed about autism correction. In fact, the autism correction had no greater effect on people's vaccination attitude than did the control condition. Presenting participants with evidence that there is no link of autism between vaccinations and autism did not meaningfully alter, neither positively nor negatively, people's existing attitudes about vaccination. Findings hold equal for both parents and non -parents.

Ask: physicians should encourage parents to ask questions and share their concerns Acknowled ge: physicians should show respect and empathy for parents' concerns, thereby creating a trusting environment Advise: physicians should advise and recommend vaccination by discussing the benefits and risks of vaccines and vaccine -preventable diseases . Consultations should end with a mutually agreed action such as vaccination or another meeting to discuss concerns further Physicians are trained in these three steps in a 45 -minute course administered by a paediatrician immunisation expert and a health educat or. The training consists of a didactic presentation of data on vaccine hesitancy, the importance of trust and the role and influence of vaccine providers. Physicians are provided with printed materials explaining the framework and receive monthly email ne wsletters, a link to the study website, and technical assistance. Evaluation An initial evaluation showed that the strategy is feasible and has been well received. A cluster -randomi sed trial showed that the intervention had no effect on maternal vaccine hesitancy, nor on physician self -efficacy.

Becoming a vaccine champion Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim The aim of this intervention is to improve vaccination uptake in the general population by focusing on vaccine -hesitant parents Country United States Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Parents (vaccine hesitant) Administrator Vaccine providers Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components This interve ntion aims to improve vaccine uptake in the general population but also focuses on parents which are part of the 'philosophical group ', or in other words, parents who are opposed to vaccinati on. It consists of the following elements, to be administered every visit: Parents opposed to vaccination are told that doctors will work with them and their children regardless of their beliefs and decision to vaccinate. This step is important to prevent parents from feeling marginalised. Vaccine providers then explain to parents that they strongly believe in vaccines and that they are not in a position to force parents to vaccinate but they are there to share their knowledge and experience, talk about th e benefits, risks and consequences of vaccination and allow parents to decide after balancing the pros and cons. This step serves to improve trust between parents and vaccine providers. Vaccine providers ask hesitant parents the following questions: 'Why a re you opposed to vaccination? What are your specific concerns? ' These are questions that can be addressed easily, and will allow providers to show that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks, thereby reassuring parents. The intervention should be similar for vaccine refusers, except that these discussions should not take place during every visit but every 2-3 visits to avoid being perceived as too persistent. Parents will also need to sign an exemption form, which also explains the benefits and ri sks of vaccination. Evaluation No evaluation Relevant resources Temoka E.

It is a strategy to help vaccine providers communicate with vaccine -hesitant parents. It consists of the following steps: Corroborate: physicians corroborate with their patients' the concerns and try to understand their questions, find common ground for discussion. They could say the follo wing: 'Tell me what is bothering you'; 'I can see why you might worry about that, a number of my patients' parents have raised that same concern '; 'You and I both want your teen to be protected against things that might harm her ' About me: physicians discu ss what they have done to understand and to improve their knowledge of the topics that cause concerns for parents or adolescents: 'As a result of my own questions, I've read the studies and attended lectures on the topic .' Science: physicians summarise fac ts and scientific evidence related to the concerns raised by parents or adolescents: 'studies now involving hundreds of thousands of teens demonstrate the vaccine's safety with no development of injury or disease .' Explain/advise: physicians advise patient s by framing their explanation according to the concerns parents or adolescents have raised. This involves persuasion as well as informing: 'I really recommend that you get them today. In my experience, my patients your age handle the pain of that shot eas ily. If I were in your shoes, I would get the shot. ' Evaluation Not evaluated Relevant resources Jacobson RM.

Electronic medical record linked clinical decision support Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Improve vaccination rates by educating clinici ans about parental concerns Country United States Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Parents (concerns about vaccination) Administrator Vaccine providers Vaccine(s) HPV Type of intervention Reminder -recall Funding Not specified Main co mponents Vaccine providers are provided with a tool linked to electronic medical records (EMR) supporting their clinical decisions and providing educational content, reminders and feedback reports. Educational content: vaccine providers are offered a train ing, offered online and in live sessions to help them feel more comfortable discussing HPV vaccination. They are also educated on addressing concerns and motivating timely vaccination. The content of the course includes a review of published guidelines abo ut vaccination, epidemiology of VPD, vaccine efficacy and safety information, and data on local HPV vaccination rates. Reminders: vaccine providers are alerted when a patient eligible for HPV vaccination visits them. Patients identified through the EMR are also contacted by phone and reminded to schedule a visit for the vaccine. They are also provided with a reference to online vaccine education materials. Feedback reports: vaccine providers are sent quarterly reports with information on vaccination rates to compare their results with those of other physicians. Evaluation A nested cohort study involving telephone interviews was conducted to evaluate the intervention. The family - focused decision support was acceptable to families and encouraged seeking out information, discussing the vaccine with others, or giving through to their decision. A third of parents who remembered the call reported behaviour change. None of the families visited the website.

Framework for communicating with vaccine hesitant parents Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim The aim of the framework is to improve communication between clinicians and va ccine-hesitant parents Country Australia Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Parents (concerns about vaccination) Administrator Vaccine providers Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main com ponents This intervention aims to develop communication strategies for all types of vaccine -hesitant parents that focus on helping clinicians tailor their conversations with patients and avoid confrontational arguments. It uses the principles of motivation al interviewing, thereby guiding patients rather than directing them and focusing on developing an empathic relationship. This respectful, non -judgemental approach which can be supported by factsheets, pictorial representation of risk, and information abou t the number of cases of VPD aims to build trust between vaccine providers and their patients. The intervention has two different communication approaches for different types of vaccine -hesitant parents. For vaccin e-hesitant or delaying parents: Spend ade quate time with child/parents Ask permission to discuss concerns Carefully elicit concerns and try to address each one specifically Accept concerns and try not to minimise or dismiss them Use a guiding style Discuss disease and vaccine risks as well as vac cine benefits Communicate risks with words and numbers or even simple graphics Support discussions with downloadable resources Avoid trying to overwhelm with detailed scientific information Offer another appointment if needed or attendance at a specialist immunisation clinic . For refusing parents: Ask permission to discuss refusal Aim to keep discussion brief but leaving the door open Check importance of vaccines and confidence Don't dismiss concerns, acknowledge them Don't overstate vaccine safety Challeng ing firmly held philosophical, religious or scientific beliefs is unhelpful Avoid overt confrontation and scientific ping pong Provide links to resources if wanted Explore receptivity to a tailored schedule to get them started, and explain the risks Offer another appointment when ready or attendance at a specialist immunisation clinic .

PROMOVAC: motivational interviewing session at birth increases vaccination acceptance and uptake Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim To provide an early strategy for avoiding delays in firs t vaccines using a motivational interviewing method and not just providing information alone. Country Canada Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Healthcare providers Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of interventi on Dialogue based Funding Not specified Main components Motivational interviewing techniques are conducted in nurseries, identified as a place for an early strategy of promoting vaccination. This motivational interviewing is an adaptation to vaccine prom otion of the Miller and Rollnick model and the trans -theoretical model of Prochaska. Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, goal - oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen person al motivation for and commitment to a specific goal, by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change (solving their own ambivalence) within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. The motivational interview emerges at the intersection of collaboration, acceptance, evocation and compassion. The Prochaska model defines stages: pre -contemplation (not ready), contemplation (getting ready), preparation (ready), action (ready). Each step requires a different strategy to increase vaccine accepta nce and reduce/mitigate hesitancy. Evaluation Parents knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and vaccination intention were evaluated before and after motivational interviewing by means of a questionnaire (based on the Health Belief Model) administered to all par ticipants. A significant increase in vaccination intention was observed in each centre after intervention, with global increase of 12%.

SARAH: an approach to vaccine communication in primary care - strategies to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim To support and offer resources, communicating adequately, to assist parents with vaccination. Country Australia Setting Healthcare facilities Target population Healthcare providers Administrator Not specified Vaccine(s) All vacc ines Type of intervention Dialogue based Funding Not specified Main components This intervention aims to give providers the capacity to communicate appropriately and offer the resources for hesitant parents to choose to vaccinate. A presumptive or pater nalistic style of communication does not meet the needs of the very he sitant and can backfire with t hose that decline . A participatory approach is associated with increased rates of a highly rated experience by parents. There are different pathways to foll ow depending on where in the vaccine hesitancy spectrum the parents find themselves: accepting, hesitant or declining. The intervention suggests five knowledge tools for the hesitant, available at http://www.ncirs.edu.au/research/social -\u00adresearch/sarah -\u00adproject/ . If parents are declining, the best approach is to have open questions designed to focus the conversation, using moderate language. Providers are advised to explore th e parents' decision to not vaccinate, reflecting on it and clarifying their views, sharing your views and adequately closing the conversation.

The entire community is invited to a community event which starts with an opening prayer, a welcome speech from the village head, an introduction by the team leader, and a drama on the consequences of polio. Participants are also shown a PowerPoint presentation and a computer simulation model which discuss es polio transmission, signs, symptoms and complications. Then, participants watch different films for 1 -2 hours, which focus on misconceptions about the cause of polio and other negative attitudes towards vaccination. Emotional movies of victims of polio and their relatives show their frustrations, experiences and disabilities. This is followed by a discussion with the community. Evaluation The intervention was evaluat ed by monitoring the number of children who received polio vaccination. There was a relative increase in children vaccinated of 310% after the campaign and a net reduction of 29% of never vaccinated children. This represents an absolute increase of 73% in vaccinated children (96% coverage). Relevant resources Nasiru H, Nasidi A, El -Kamary SS.

Community members with alternative lifestyles took part in t he development of the campaign by writing a 300 -word testimonial explaining why they vaccinate and how it is also part of their alternative lifestyle. These testimonials are published on a website with pictures of the community members. Posters were also c reated based on the testimonials with the following information: first name, age, number of children, two other core lifestyle attributes, a picture and the words 'I Immunise '. Posters were displayed on billboards, on public buildings, in healthcare facili ties, and also featured in newspapers and published on Facebook. Evaluation An evaluation of the campaign revealed that 59.2% of individuals involved in the study (with no difference between those with alternative and non -alternative lifestyles ) felt the campaign had a positive impact, 16.8% a nega tive impact and 24% no impact .

Interactive social media tool for parents with concerns about vaccines Determinant s targeted Intervention details Aim Use a theory -driven social media intervention tool to reduce parental concerns about childhood vaccination Country United States Setting Online Target population Parents Administrator Experts in vaccination, resea rchers Vaccine(s) Childhood vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components This intervention consists of an interactive online tool that provides evidence -based information and a platform for parents to discuss their concerns with each other and with vaccine experts. The intervention is based on a 'multidirectional communication model ', which represents a social marketing strategy where both developers and users can create information and contribute messages. Parents become active participants in the communication process which establishes trust and credibility in an open and empathetic conversational tone. The tool consists of a blog (text, multimedia posts, photos, videos, and audio), a discussion forum, a chatroom ( topics scheduled in advance), a newsletter, and a portal for parents to ask questions to experts. The tool is regularly updated, with quick responses to questions (monitored twice a day and weekly searches on the internet and scientific databases to update content). Parents are treated as experts, and a respectful tone is used by experts when responding to their questions and acknowledging their potential concerns. Activity is monitored on a daily basis, to identify and filter abuse (language, bullying, and disclosure of personal identifying health information). Evaluation The intervention was first piloted among parents who accepted, delayed or refused vaccination for their children to assess their trust in and their use of the tool. Parents reported they would use it to ask questions and to find vaccine information, but also to review vaccination schedules and discuss their experiences and concerns. They asked for more balanced information, transparency, moderation and diversity in the content provided. Relevant resources Shoup, J. A., Wagner, N. M., Kraus, C. R., Narwaney, K. J., Goddard, K.

Individuals are also told that it is not possible to contract flu from the flu vaccine (whether injection or nasal spray). Evaluation The evaluation consisted of comparing the impact of the intervention to the one of delivering a pro - vaccination information message (for instance about the risks posed by influenza) and to the impact of not giving any additional information. Corrective information was found to be effective at reducing misperceptions but the effect on intention to vaccinate was found to vary depending on original concerns about side effects. It had no effect on intention to vaccinate among respondents with low side effects concern but it significant ly decreased the likelihood of receiving a flu vaccine among those with side effect concerns. Pro -vaccination messages had no significant effect on misperceptions or intentions to vaccinate. Relevant resources Nyhan, B. & Reifler, J. 2015. Does correcting myths about the flu vaccine work?

Web -based MMR decision aid Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Empoweri ng parents to make informed decisions about MMR Country United Kingdom, Australia Setting Online Target population Parents Administrator Online Vaccine(s) MMR Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding Not specified Main components The interventi on consists of a decision aid, comprised of nine sections. It was adapted from an original version developed in Australia (modified presentation of information, content adapted to the UK). 1. Introduction: overview of who the decision aid is for and how paren ts can use the decision aid for help (In the UK version, it was adapted to be consistent with the UK vaccination schedule) . 2. How to use this site: instructions for navigating the decision aid, terms of use and an 'initial thoughts ' question on whether the u ser is currently leaning away from MMR vaccination, undecided, or leaning towards MMR vaccination . 3. Frequently asked questions: frequently asked questions and answers such as: what are measles, mumps and rubella, how common are these diseases, what is the M MR vaccine, is there any proof of a link between autism, inflammatory bowel disease, and the MMR vaccine? (In the UK, questions were adapted to the UK context) . 4. How to compare the risks: numerical and graphic data comparing the potential risks of the MMR v accine with the potential risks of measles, mumps and rubella (In the UK, it was adapted with relevant data and changes were made to formatting and graphical data) . 5. What are my options? Current options available to the user. For example: I could vaccinate my child at 12 months and again at 4 years of age. I could delay vaccination until my child is older (Adapted to the UK national vaccination schedule) . 6. Making a decision: a clarifying values exercise where the user reviews the importance they place on the advantages and disadvantages of choosing the MMR vaccination (i.e. my child will be better protected from the potentially serious complications of these diseases; if my child experiences a severe complication I may feel guilty or responsible for getting th em vaccinated). Users review their information needs (i.e. do you know what options are available to you? Yes, no, unsure). Users are then asked again whether they are leaning away from MMR vaccination, undecided, or leaning towards MMR vaccination. 7. Useful websites: relevant websites are provided (adapted to the UK) . 8. References: users a provided with a list of references used in the decision aid (adapted to UK) . 9. Contact us: contact details for the decision aid developers (adapted to UK) . Evaluation The int ervention was evaluated both in the UK and in Australia. In the UK, the evaluation was done through a questionnaire and semi -structure d telephone interviews. Parents found the decision aid acceptable and useful in supporting their informed decision -making for MMR. However, they also felt the aid was slanted towards MMR. It may increase knowledge about MMR, measles, mumps and rubella, and reduce decisional conflict to a level where parents can make an informed decision about MMR. In Australia, the evaluation revealed that more parents were leaning towards vaccination after using the aid (statistically significant).

Perspectives provided include A parent and carer perspective: match own actions to recommendations; teach parents about risks of non -vaccination (for their children and others); tell stories as well as sharing scientific facts; take time to listen to concerns about possible side effects and risks; make vaccination easier to access and less stressful; recognise some individuals will need more time to make a decision; help enhance understanding of vaccinations. A social marketer, hea lth promoter and media specialist perspective: focus on behaviour and its determinants - not just in the message; develop accessible, friendly and adapted places for vaccination services ; make the discussion about ' being protected' rather than about vaccin e safety; make those who accept vaccination more visible; show that being unprotected is socially unacceptable; ensure any decision to remain unprotected is an active one; guide patients to reliable sources of information. A vaccination expert and provider (peer) perspective: keep your immuni sation knowledge current ; strengthen your communication skills; use the team and other settings to provide information and address concerns; maintain your skills to ensure safe vaccine administration .

WHO Best Practice Guidance: How to re spond to vocal vaccine deniers in public Determinants targeted Intervention details Aim Guidance document providing basic broad principles to respond to vocal vaccine deniers Country WHO - Global Setting Media Target population Health and immunisatio n spokespersons Administrator Health authorities Vaccine(s) All vaccines Type of intervention Dialogue -based Funding No funding Main components Guidance providing basic, broad principles for spokespersons of health authorities on how to behave when confronted by vocal vaccine deniers (VVD), and how to respond to them. VVDs are defined as individuals who 'do not accept recommended vaccines, are not open to a change of mind no matter what the scientific evidence says '. The document offers strategies that address the three main elements of successful communication: the audience, the speaker, and the argument. Two main rules serve as guidance principles: the general public is the target audience, not the vaccine deniers; aim to correct the content AND unm ask the techniques that vocal vaccine deniers use. The goal of communication should be to make the public audience more resilient against anti -vaccine statements and support those who are vaccine -hesitant in their vaccine acceptance decision (not to chang e the mind of vaccine deniers). The guidance provides advice on whether or not to participate in a discussion/public audience with VVDs, who the spokesperson should be (charismatic speakers, being a good listener, participation in media training), do's and don'ts of verbal communication (prepare three key messages, keep messages simple, repeat key messages, do not repeat anti -vaccine arguments, emphasise high safety instead of low risk, use inclusive terms, do not question the deniers' motivation, tell th e truth, communicate what has been achieved, avoid humour, underline scientific consensus, emphasise social benefit of vaccines), and do's and don'ts of nonverbal communication (keep eye contact, stay calm, wear suitable clothing, be interviewed in sitting position). The document also provides three steps recommended for responding to vaccine denial in a public discussion: disentangle core points and address each separately ; identify the technique the denier is using to misinform the public ; respond wit h key messages . The document then provides keys messages that correct the content of the vaccine deniers' main criticism (about threat of disease, alternatives, effectiveness, trust, and safety), and examples of techniques used by vaccine deniers' (fake ex perts, selectivity, misrepresentation and false logic, impossible expectations, conspiracies). It also discusses how to behave in a passionate discussion (remaining patient) and how to protect oneself in rare circumstances where one's personal safety would be compromised.

Summary of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy A total of 40 interventions have been included in the catalogue of interventions, strategies and tools addressing vaccine hesitancy. Ten of these are diagnostic tools, developed to measure or monitor vaccine hesitancy. The majority (27/40) o f interventions responding to vaccine hesitancy are based on dialogue, communication or information tools for parents or healthcare workers. Only one intervention is based on an advocacy campaign, another one on a reminder -recall system (using varied tools to remind patients or healthcare workers about vaccination), and finally one on a multi -component approach, using both reminder -recall tools and dialogue - based tools. No incentive -based intervention addressing vaccine hesitancy, financial or non -financial , was identified. The majority of these interventions focus on two determinants of vaccine hesitancy: misinformation (23 interventions) and/or safety issues (20 interventions). Some also target issues around trust ( nine interventions), religious and philos ophical views ( eight interventions), and perceived benefits of or need for vaccination ( five interventions). Finally, fourteen interventions aim to improve vaccine hesitancy in general, without targeting specific determinants. Almost all of the interventi ons identified for inclusion in this catalogue were developed and evaluated outside of Europe. Two diagnostic tools were developed for use globally, two response tools were developed in the US, one in Canada, one in Australia, and one was adapted from Aust ralia to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, most interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy were developed to take place in healthcare facilities (15/40) and to be delivered by vaccine providers. Some interventions are also delivered online (9/40). Finally, several interventions included in this catalogue focus on parents, including mothers ( 21/40 ) and on either all vaccines ( 19/40 ) or childhood vaccines ( 8/40). A few interventions are vaccine -specific (HPV, influenza, MMR, Polio, etc.). The table below prov ides an overview of the interventions included in the catalogue. Table 1.

Practical tips and lessons learnt 4.1 Diagnostic tools In recent years, different types of tools have been developed to measure, assess or monitor vaccine hesitancy. Some of these aim to measure hesitancy at an individual level, identifying hesitan t parents or adults and detecting their concerns and worries about vaccination. Interventions that have been evaluated showed that such tools are effective to measure vaccine hesitancy and that they can also be useful predictors of vaccine uptake or serve as comparative tools to assess hesitancy in different populations of the world. Other tools are used to measure vaccine hesitancy at a country level, by gathering information from national immunisation programme managers. These tools have not been evaluate d yet but have been implemented successfully in various countries. Finally, a tool was also developed to monitor vaccine hesitancy through mass and social media and was found to be effective in identifying concerns and sentiments about vaccination online. Measurement and/or monitoring of concerns about vaccination is an important first step of any intervention aiming to address vaccine hesitancy. All countries should have a system in place to regularly listen to concerns and worries the population might ha ve about vaccines. The tools described in this catalogue have been implemented in different countries and can be used and adapted to different contexts, vaccines or populations. They can serve as a basis for either reactive or proactive interventions aimin g to reduce vaccine hesitancy. 4.2 Individual -level interventions focusing on parents Table 2 .

Th ese types of interventions use a dialogue -based approach and provide information or educational material to parents during consultations with healthcare workers, in wri tten hand -outs such as pamphlets or brochures, or online. The use of written materials has had varied effects on hesitancy and vaccination rates depending on the type of strategy, content and material used. Brochures with simple, general educational infor mation about vaccination did not have a significant impact on attitudes about vaccination, even though parents reported positive impressions. Similarly, pamphlets providing educational information did not decrease concerns about side effects but showed a reduction in the belief that multiple vaccines overload the immune system and an increase in mothers' confidence in vaccination. Mailed information comparing the different risks associated with vaccination or non -vaccination and information addressing the i mpact of reduced vaccination coverage on disease prevalence did not significantly improve parents' opinions about vaccines either. Finally, handouts providing educational material, supplemented by videos with emotional content such as reports of children s uffering from vaccine -preventable diseases showed an improvement in vaccine confidence but did not significantly increase vaccination rates. Dialogue -based online interventions also had varied effects on parental vaccine hesitancy. Tailored messages, adapted to individual parents' concerns were found to increase intentions to vaccination, although this increase was not statistically significant. On the other hand, untailored messages had a negative effect and worsened parental intentions to vaccinate. The use of graphical educational information and rhetorical questions had a positive impact on intentions to vaccinate when used separately. Using corrective information to respond to specific concerns corrected misperceptions but did not increase intentions t o vaccinate , and even reduced intentions in some groups of parents. Emotional, dramatic messages did not have any effect on misperceptions or on intentions to vaccinate. Only one intervention referred parents for a consultation with healthcare workers in specialist vaccine hesitancy clinics. These consultations provided tailored educational information and time for parents to discuss their concerns with a physician. It was found to increase vaccine uptake in vaccine -hesitant parents but did not have any im pact in vaccine refusers. Interventions that directly target vaccine -hesitant parents have not been entirely successful in increasing intentions to vaccinate, decreasing concerns, or improving vaccination rates. Some of these interventions were also count erproductive, worsening parental concerns or intentions to vaccinate. Furthermore, a higher impact was almost always observed in parents who have concerns about vaccination but still vaccinate , than in parents who delay vaccination, with no impact at all i n parents who refuse vaccination.

Summary of practical tips by evaluation outcome for individual -level interventions focusing on improving healthcare workers' confidence and communication skills to respond to hesitant patients (evaluated interventions) Improved vaccine hesitancy or vaccine uptake No impact Worsened vaccine hesitancy or vaccine uptake Training HCWs in communication skills: parents ask questions, doctors acknowledge concerns, doctors advise vaccination by discussion risks/benefits (intervention 2.2A ) Positive impressions No impact on hesitancy or physician self - efficacy Training HCWs in c ommunication skills (CD-ROM): what are common concerns and how to address them (intervention 2.2D ) Improves general knowledge, knowledge of adverse events Changes attitudes towards patients who oppose vaccination Training HCWs in communication skills (online): how to address vaccine hesitancy (and reminder system for parents/HCWs) (intervention 2.2E) Positive impressions Parental behaviour change Many interventions aim to address vaccine hesitancy by improving communication between healthcare workers and their patients, as well as by training healthcare workers to improve their confidence in responding to hesitancy. Different communication guides have been suggested to structure consultations with vaccine -hesitant patients, offering different steps and topics to address. The training offered to healthcare workers aim s to improve their knowledge of vaccine hesitancy, parental concerns, but also vaccination in general. Interventions that focus on allowing parents to ask questions, acknowledging their conc erns and recommending vaccination by discussing the risks and benefits of vaccines were well received but did not have any effect on patient hesitancy, nor on healthcare worker confidence. However, interventions that focus on training healthcare workers ab out parental concerns using tailored information and discussions improved healthcare workers' knowledge about vaccine hesitancy and their attitudes towards hesitant patients. Interventions that complemented such trainings with vaccination reminders sent to both parents and healthcare workers were successful in improving patient behaviour and acceptability of the intervention. Although it is important to improve communication between healthcare workers and patients, most interventions did not have a signific ant impact on improving vaccine confidence or vaccine uptake. Combining discourse -based interventions with reminder -recall tools seems to be more successful than interventions that only focus on improving healthcare workers' communication skills. Finally, although many interventions focused on improving healthcare workers' confidence in responding to hesitancy, none addressed potential vaccine hesitancy amongst healthcare workers themselves.

Summary of practical tips by evaluation outcome for community -level interventions (evaluated interventions) Improved vaccine hesitancy or vaccine uptake No impact Worsened vaccine hesitancy or vaccine uptake Community educational and promotional activities supported by relig ious leaders (talks, videos, posters) (intervention 2.3A ) Decrease in dropout rates Community educational and emotional activities supported by community gatekeepers (talks, videos, presentations, discussions) (intervention 2.3B ) Increase in vaccinated children and reduction of never vaccinated children Advocacy campaign supported by community members with alternative lifestyles (intervention 2.3C ) Positive impact for some participants Negative impact on vaccine hesitant individuals Educational hous e visits by medical interns, social workers, local influential people (intervention 2.3F) High vaccination after intervention Online platform for discussion, information, parental engagement (intervention 2.3D ) Positive impressions Online platform u sing corrective messages (intervention 2.3E) Reduces misperceptions No impact on intention to vaccinate among individuals with low side effects concerns Decreases intention to vaccinate among respondents with side effect concerns Online platform using pro -vaccination messages (intervention 2.3E) No significant impact on misperceptions or intentions to vaccinate Online decision -aid for parents and educational information (intervention 2.3H ) Positive impressions Increases intentions to vaccinate Comm unity-level interventions were found to either target the online community of vaccine -hesitant populations or to improve community confidence in vaccination by the engagement of local figures and leaders. Many of these interventions were vaccine -specific, and/or developed in low -income settings. All of them followed a dialogue - based approach, apart from an advocacy campaign. Most of the community -level interventions supported by community leaders and local figures had a positive impact on vaccine hesitancy . Some community educational activities backed by religious leaders and other community gatekeepers promoted vaccination and the sharing of information about vaccines (including emotional and informative talks, videos, presentations and posters). They led to a decrease in overall dropout rates and an increase in vaccination rates. Similarly, health education activities provided through house visits from medical interns, social workers and other local influential people led to an increase in vaccination rate s. The advocacy campaign which made use of community members of a local group with alternative lifestyles had a positive impact for some participants but a negative one amongst vaccine -hesitant participants. Different types of online tools can be used to improve vaccination confidence in some communities. A platform was developed to share information about vaccination but more importantly to engage parents in discussions and to allow them to share their concerns with other parents and vaccination experts. The platform was positively reviewed by parents, but the impact on hesitancy or coverage rates was not evaluated. Another intervention used corrective information in educational online messages. It was successful in reducing misperception but decreased intentions to vaccinate amongst hesitant individuals. Similarly, the use of pro -vaccination messages was found to have no significant effect on misperceptions or intentions to vaccinate. Finally, a decision -aid for parents, supported by educational informatio n, was found to be acceptable and to improve parents' intention to vaccinate. Catalogue of interventions addressing vaccine hes itancy TECHNICAL REPORT 64 5. Adapting the interventions The overall goal of this catalogue is to compile interventions designed specifically to address vaccine hesitancy so that health professionals else where can use them as an inspiration to deal with challenges they face. However, they are not sufficiently explicitly tailored to address hesitancy in specific contexts. Added to this, most vaccine hesitancy interventions presented took place in non -Europe an countries. This highlights the need for more European research on the topic, in particular focusing on interventions and evaluating different strategies in different European contexts, as interventions need to be context specific and address ing countrie s' specific issues . Therefore, in order to use these interventions as a set of best practices in Europe and elsewhere, it is of key importance to take in consideration that adaptations need to be made. For this purpose, the following approaches need to be considered: 5.1 Listen, evaluate, categori se Active listening can help identify hesitancy. Not only is it important to let the population express their concerns, but it is also important to understand the reasons that underlie these concerns. The reasons why a population is hesitant can vary drastically from one situation to another and listening is the first step to understanding their reasons. These determinants can fall under different categories, they can be contextual (historic, social, cultural, environmental, economic, political and institutional determinants), individual, be group influence d and be vaccination specific issues [8]. The more specific knowledg e you have about the situation you are confronted with, the more likely this catalogue will be useful as a set of best practices. 5.2 Engage accordingly Once there is more information available about what is motivating vaccine hesitancy, it is important t o contextualise design, format and content of the interventions. Match these interventions to the determinants of hesitancy. Most effective interventions are tailored to specific populations and addressing specific concerns pointing to the importance of un derstanding the drivers of vaccine hesitancy to inform the interventions [7]. Communication is key; improve methods to connect with the targeted group. Find creat ive ways to get the dialogue going; find means to make sure people know they are not being brushed away. Also be transparent: ensure all information on vaccination is publically available. Maintain an overall spirit of sensitivity to local group or individ ual behavioural traits. Openness is necessary to understand local realities and practices embedded in the lives of those refusing or hesitating about vaccines. 5.3 'Country specific' case for vaccination To be 'country specific' means taking in to consider ation a nation's circumstances to engage accordingly with vaccine hesitancy. While interventions can focus on education or informing about vaccine safety, other national elements such as public confidence in health systems might be playing a role in vaccin e hesitancy. A general lack of trust in health authorities and government can undermine vaccine trust, as well as other state -related issues. National campaign programmes should have the capacity to identify determinants of social, cultural, political and/ or economic nature.
