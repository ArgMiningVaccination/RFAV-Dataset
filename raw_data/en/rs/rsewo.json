The trend seems to be worsening as new measures are introduced, then mandated, then enforced in an effort to stop this latest respiratory virus around the globe. The latest controversy surrounds mandatory vaccinations or vaccine passports. Division continues to rage within the broader church along (mostly) the same lines as last winter's restrictions on the gathering of the church. One of those topics of controversy is whether there is a valid religious objection to taking the COVID vaccine. One pastor, writing for the Gospel Coalition Canada has [stated](https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/how-ontarios-vaccine-passport-system-is-likely-to-impact-churches/), \"It is not at all clear on what religious basis a person would be considered exempt from taking this vaccine. There may be a good number of health exemptions and a variety of other valid hesitations, but none of them is identifiably theological in nature.\" He also [quotes another author](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/its-time-to-stop-rationalizing-christian) which argues that it may in fact be harmful to frame this as a issue of religious liberty. Is it true that there is no valid religious objection to taking this latest treatment for COVID-19? I want to consider at least four areas where some Christians may disagree with taking the vaccine on theological grounds. 1) Informed Consent to Medical Procedures Just a short time ago (pre-March, 2020), it would be hard to imagine arguments that would propose a mandatory medical procedure to keep your job, travel, or access areas of society or the economy. We've gone from two weeks to flatten the curve to two jabs to keep your job and relatively few are objecting. However, the idea of consenting to medical procedures has a long history in our country and is protected by law. What you may not realize is that this idea of consent is rooted in a Christian worldview. That is, it has religious underpinnings. The law of God protects personal autonomy by forbidding murder, rape, kidnapping, assault, bearing false witness, and so forth. The law of God also protects personal property by forbidding theft, coveting, moving land markers, and things like these. However, in our day, when the government has grown to take control or regulate every area of our lives, they will also believe they can control what goes on or in our body. This is clearly an anti-Christian idea that should be resisted whether or not you choose to take this latest treatment for COVID-19. Bodily autonomy and consenting to what goes on or in your body is a Christian (i.e., religious) idea that is simply not afforded in other nations without the light of God's revelation. One way to love our neighbor is to oppose passports or discrimination based on this issue. 2) The Sanctity of Life for the Unborn Abortion is framed today as an issue of women's rights. The same bodily autonomy that I've argued for above is used to argue for the right to kill a child in the womb if it is not wanted by the mother. It should be clear that these issues are similar but not the same. The Scriptures give no right to a mother to take her child's life if the child is unwanted. Rather, that's called murder. This is a plain and simple issue. Abortion continues to be acceptable in our society along with the sale of the body parts of murdered babies. Many Christians have a difficult time using products that were derived from or tested with fetal cell lines from aborted babies. It is no secret that the latest COVID-19 vaccines were either derived from or tested with fetal cell lines from aborted children. Some have no issue with this since the cells used today are derived from but not physically from an aborted child\u2014and it is said to save lives today. However, some Christians have a religious objection\u2014a moral objection\u2014to taking this COVID-19 vaccine because they do think abortion is a great evil and this would, in some way, be giving approval to it. 3) The Body as a Temple The Scriptures are clear that we are made in God's image and are to treat our bodies with dignity and respect as God's image bearers. We're also told that our bodies are a temple of the Holy Spirit. We were bought with a price, and we should glorify God in our bodies (1 Cor 6:19-20). That is, we are stewards of our bodies to the glory of God. Some Christians, as they weigh the risk of COVID-19 to the risk of taking the vaccine, decide that being a good steward of their body prevents them from taking the vaccine. Maybe they've already had COVID and have a natural immunity. Maybe they are young and in little danger of serious consequences from the disease. Maybe they have other health complications that pose a higher risk of harm if they get the vaccine. In these cases, their assessment of risk and possible harm has a religious underpinning as their bodies belong to God and they act as stewards over their body. Why would taking this vaccine be an issue of bodily stewardship? - According to statistics provided by AHS, 1440 have had an [adverse event following immunization](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#vaccinations). Most of those events include allergic reaction, severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, or rash. But there has also been anaphylaxis, Bell's Palsy, anesthesia or paraesthesia lasting more than 24 hours, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or thrombocytopenia. These are more serious side effects that have affected 164 Albertans. There are also 150 cases of an \" [Adverse Event of Special Interest](https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/4d885a4c-f9b3-4434-bf5a-5accb63e22a1/resource/7f22f534-f2f1-44ea-9823-6326b99470e4/download/health-aip-aefi-covid-19-20201-02.pdf)\" which are other (sometimes serious) side effects not reported in Alberta. - There have been [reports of blood clots](https://globalnews.ca/news/8012329/ontario-researchers-covid-19-vaccines-blood-clots/)which even caused one vaccine to be pulled in many parts of the world but is still [approved in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/astrazeneca.html)(with the side effect listed). - For those who've already had the disease, natural immunity [has been shown](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1)to be better and longer lasting than immunity via vaccines. - The long term side effects are unknown. Treatments in the past have been adopted before long term effects have been made aware. See [DES](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/des-fact-sheet), and [thalidomide](https://thalidomide.ca/en/what-is-thalidomide/)as examples of great tragedies in our recent past. - This vaccine is a new technology and has [received emergency approval](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained), but has not gone through the same procedures and testing as other vaccines available today. In addition, vaccine manufacturers are [free from any liability](https://globalnews.ca/news/7521148/coronavirus-vaccine-safety-liability-government-anand-pfizer/)in regard to the shots. Arguments can be marshaled on either side (risk vs. reward) and it's important for Christians to understand their stewardship over their body and health that God has given to them. In this regard, some may choose to forgo taking the vaccine (or be hesitant) as a stewardship to God to best care for their body and for others around them. Others may choose to take the vaccine for the same reason, as a stewardship to God. \"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 10:31). 4) The Conscience No one can point to a single text in Scripture and say, \"Vaccines are sinful,\" or, \"Vaccines are necessary.\" That is, this kind of medical treatment is neither prohibited or commanded. As such, it falls into the area of conscience where we can have differences of opinion and yet unity in love and understanding for one another. Romans 14 contains an extended discussion on this topic. What is clear is that kings (or pastors) are not lords over the conscience of others. Rather it is the Lord Jesus who judges the hearts and intentions of men, and he is the Lord of the conscience. No government, school, or employer should seek to rule the conscience. Yet, we are living in times where people are being coerced to go against conscience. This is a religious issue, one informed by biblical revelation, and a foundation for a healthy society. As our [Premier once said](https://www.convivium.ca/articles/conscience-versus-the-spirit-of-the-age/), \"One does not need to be a Christian or a person of faith to recognize that trampling on the rights of conscience can open a path to the abuse of power. We Canadians have been blessed to have been spared those consequences because our tradition of the limited State recognizes that the rights of conscience must be respected. Indeed, the first liberty listed in our Charter is found in section 2(a), freedom of conscience and religion, which is an echo of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion...'\" While one does not need to be a Christian to recognize the importance of conscience, it is a thoroughly Christian idea, a religious idea, that is ignored to the peril of our society. Conclusion At this point, I trust it is clear that there are valid religious reasons for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I'm not arguing that it is sinful to get the vaccine but there are legitimate grounds for which some may object. Each should be convinced in their own mind. We should not divide the world or the church into the vaccinated and unvaccinated. May God give you grace as you wrestle through this issue and seek to love him and your neighbor. For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ "}
