Atkinson, President The University of California (UC) was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the Uni\u00ad versity's development was strongly influenced by leading educa\u00ad tors and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes 10 campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and Merced, which is scheduled to open its doors to students in 2004. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, a school of veterinary medicine, and professional schools of business administration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The collections of the more than 100 UC libraries are surpassed in size on the American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. The University is one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements and includes 23 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sciences membership numbers 327, greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 loca\u00ad tions throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban pop\u00ad ulations, and a broad program of continuing education. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, the University operates the Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National Laboratories. Other major research facilities include the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory, Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. This title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized internationally as scholars and teach\u00ad ers. A University Professor may visit several UC campuses during the academic year, holding conferences and presenting lectures. Governance. Under the State constitution, governance of the Uni\u00ad versity is entrusted to The Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, the officers of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which consists of faculty and certain administra\u00ad tive officers. The Academic Senate determines academic policy for the University as a whole, sets conditions for admission and the granting of degrees, authorizes and supervises courses and curric\u00ad ula, and advises the University administration on faculty appoint\u00ad ments; promotions, and budgets. Additionally, each campus has a divisional Academic Senate. The President is executive head of the total institution. Each cam\u00ad pus has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. Students participate in policy-making at both the campus and University\u00ad wide levels. The names of University Professors, Regents, Officers, and Chan\u00ad cellors are presented in the Appendix. THE IRVINE CAMPUS Ralph J. Cicerone, Chancellor The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and 1,589 students. Since then, UCI programs, faculty and graduates have achieved distinction in virtually every discipline. Two Nobel Prizes in 1995 for founding faculty F. Sherwood Row\u00ad land in Chemistry and the late Frederick Reines in Physics helped to secure UCI's position among the leading American research uni\u00ad versities. More recently, UCI has been ranked prominently along with much older universities for excellence in the arts and humani\u00ad ties, earth system science, management, social sciences, technol\u00ad ogy, and information systems. For quality of educational experience and caliber of faculty, UCI consistently ranks among the nation's best public universities, and among the top 50 universities overall. Election to the American Association of Universities (AAU), a group of 60 of the most dis\u00ad tinguished research institutions, is another indication of UCI's stature in the academic community. As a research university, UCI challenges students at every level, both academically and personally. While research is critical to graduate education, the research environment also opens up new educational experiences for undergraduates. Students have access to faculty at the forefront of their fields, and they also have oppor\u00ad tunities to participate directly in faculty research projects. In addi\u00ad tion, to empower students for the future in an information-focused society, UCI has integrated computer technology throughout the curriculum and campus life. UCI is committed to the discovery and transmission of knowledge. It makes available to its 23,780 students (19,400 undergraduate, 3,270 graduate, and 1,110 health science students and medical resi\u00ad dents and interns) the education, skills, and credentials which pro\u00ad vide the basis for lifelong personal and professional growth. UCI's education and research missions are fulfilled in its academic units, which are described briefly below, and in its formal research units, which are described in the Research and Graduate Studies section. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts teaches the creative as well as the academic and critical dimensions of the arts. It is concerned with the vitality of the arts in society. Faculty energies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of stu\u00ad dents' artistic and creative talents and toward the development of the students' understanding of related theory and history. The School offers programs which emphasize extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. There are 1,110 students in the School, including 990 undergraduate and 120 graduate. The School of Biological Sciences is one of the campus' larger academic units, with 3,230 students (3,010 undergraduate and 220 graduate). Faculty research areas include neural plasticity and behavior (which in part encompasses the development of the ner\u00ad vous system, memory, response to injury, and degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's); the nature of cell-cell interactions; pattern formation; the elucidation of ecological conditions and evo\u00ad lutionary histories that have been the driving forces in organism design and functional diversity; the organization and expression of genes; biomolecular structure; molecular pathogenesis; human mitochondrial genetics; and cell biology. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004FROM THE CHANCELLOR Welcome to the Irvine campus and to a new world of intellectual opportunity for you as a student. You've arrived as the University is expanding both in size and academic programs. Enrollments are rising as the State's college-age population increases during this decade. At the same time, UCI's reputation for innovation and high academic standards is attracting more of the nation's brightest students and faculty. UCI students compete successfully for the most coveted scholarships and fellowships. Their competitive edge comes from being at a research university where involvement in the intense creativity of the research process often begins during the undergraduate years. UCI is regarded as one of the finest public universities in the country. And many of our programs have achieved standing with those of the best private universities. Our strong faculty are the key. Two of UCI's founding faculty have received Nobel Prizes. Many others have attained worldwide recognition for their research, while gaining equal respect on campus for their ability to engage students in the excitement of learning. Faculty also are responsible for UCI's growing strengths in virtually every discipline from the arts, humanities, and social sciences, to technology and management. Increasingly, society and the workplace demand knowledge that crosses traditional bound\u00ad aries. So we have developed programs that combine studies such as art and technology, medicine and engineering, ecology and the social sciences, business and computer sciences, all designed to prepare students f01; roles as citizens and scholars in the new century. UCI's partnerships with the fast-growing Orange County community also create incompara\u00ad ble opportunities for our students. They include work experience in a dynamic international marketplace, learning as they serve the community through the campus' outreach and public service groups, or simply benefiting from the advice of UCI alumni and leaders from every area of society. Whether you are a graduate or undergraduate student, UCI offers a place to pursue whatever course you have in mind for your future, or to change that course should you decide to explore other educational goals. I look forward to seeing you on campus, and to sharing these next few years in your lifetime of learning. Sincerely, Ralph J. Cicerone Chancellor 5 UC IRVINE - 2003-20046 UCI .2003-04 Introduction The Department of Education, with 350 postbaccalaureate stu\u00ad dents, offers graduate degree programs and credential programs for current and prospective teachers and administrators in California's public elementary and secondary schools, as well as an undergrad\u00ad uate minor in Educational Studies.

UCI's Interdisciplinary Programs (IDPs) provide students with opportunities to pursue subject areas which derive from the interac\u00ad tion of different disciplines. The IDPs are African-American Stud\u00ad ies, Chicano!Latino Studies, History and Philosophy of Science, Latin American Studies, Transportation Science, and Women's Studies. Graduate School of Management faculty research and teach in traditional management fields including organizational behavior, information technology, finance, marketing, international business, managerial economics, new ventures, accounting, decision sci\u00ad ences, operations management, strategy, public policy, and health care management. They also focus on how the implementation and integration of technology, combined with information management, are changing the way business is conducted. GSM has 280 students in the M.B.A. and Ph.D. programs, 300 in the undergraduate minor in Management, and 510 in the Executive M.B.A., Health Care Executive M.B.A., and Fully Employed M.B.A. Programs. The School of Physical Sciences has a student body of 1,130 (760 undergraduate and 370 graduate). Researchers in the School are conducting investigations in atmospheric chemistry (including the discovery of the adverse impact of human-made chlorofluorocar\u00ad bon compounds on the earth's ozone layer), biogeochemistry and climate, synthetic chemistry, laser spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, plasma physics, and pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The School of Social Ecology, a multidisciplinary unit established in 1970, is unique to UCI. The School's central objectives are the application of scientific methods to the analysis and resolution of societal problems, and the development of theory and knowledge pertinent to environmental and social phenomena. Among issues of long-standing interest are crime and justice in society, social influ\u00ad ences on human development over the life cycle, and the effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. There are 2,270 students in the School, including 2,100 undergraduate and 170 graduate. The School of Social Sciences, with 4,930 students (4,660 under\u00ad graduate and 270 graduate), is the largest academic unit at UCI. The faculty, many of whom are nationally recognized, have exper\u00ad tise in a wide range of specific social science topics, for example, the mathematical modeling of perception and cognitive processes; the economic analysis of transportation; the examination of the impact of society's political system on its economy; the study of social structure and values in different cultures through a rigorous scientific methodology; and the exploration of authority structures ,and inequality in society. The UCI College of Medicine has 1,110 students (390 medical, 600 resident-physicians and fellows, and 120 graduate). It offers one of the country's largest residency training opportunities in pri\u00ad mary care and internal medicine and houses some of the most advanced equipment in medical imaging and laser medicine avail\u00ad able in the world. The College's faculty conduct innovative research in the following areas of emphasis: bioethics, biomolecu\u00ad lar structure, oncology, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, geriatric medicine, immunology, molecular and human genetics, the neurosciences, and perinatology. Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a founda\u00ad tion on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. Programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should pro\u00ad vide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and lifelong learning. An important aspect of UCI's educational approach is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Indepen\u00ad dent research in laboratories, field study, participation in writing workshops, and in arts productions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments, special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UCI provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to exploril).g the accumulated knowledge of humanity, and to developing new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, UCI has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and provides humanistic understanding of the problems fac\u00ad ing society.

UC IRVINE - 2003-20048 UCI 2003-04 Introduction The Campus Setting UCI's location combines the cultural and economic resources of an urban area with access to Southern California's spectrum of recre\u00ad ational, scenic, and entertainment venues. Fifty miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,489 acres of coastal foothills, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and the dynamic international business environment of Orange County and the sur\u00ad rounding region. The famed sailing and surfing beaches of Newport, Laguna, and Huntington are a short bike ride from campus, while hiking trails, desert camping, or mountain resorts for snow boarding and skiing are within two-hour's travel distance from Irvine. The campus itself is a natural arboretum of native species, as well as trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adjacent to the campus, the San Joaquin Marsh serves as a natural classroom or peaceful refuge, with trails for viewing the rich diversity of wildlife. A full roster of intramural sports and recreation events helps to fill the daily fitness needs of students, along with UCI's Anteater Recreation Center. This 92,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility includes a pool, gymnasiums, racquetball courts, weight room, and jogging track. UCI is also an NCAA Division I campus that com\u00ad petes in men's and women's intercollegiate athletics. Across Campus Drive, and linked by a pedestrian bridge, an area of shops and restaurants also features a movie theatre complex and a post office. Complementing UCI on-campus sports and cultural events throughout the year is the vigorous Orange County arts and entertainment environment. It offers everything from small venues for bands and performers to galleries, museums, the Irvine Barclay Theater, Orange County Performing Arts Center, and Pacific Sym\u00ad phony. And within a one-to two-hour drive are the metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego. With plenty of land for growth, UCI is building to accommodate greater numbers of students, as well as to provide the most updated classroom and laboratory space. Projects planned or under way include an arts complex renovation with plaza designed by famed artist/architect Maya Lin, an earth system science research build\u00ad ing, a multipurpose science and technology building, a medical sci\u00ad ence\u00b7research building, and expanded student housing. A seven\u00ad story parking structure opened in fall 2001. On the west campus, the 180-acre University Research Park is attracting private compa\u00ad nies such as America Online, Canon Information Systems, and Cisco Systems, that agree to collaborate with UCI faculty and stu\u00ad dents on internships, research, and other programs. Due to the high caliber of UCI faculty and scholarship, the campus is home to national organizations including the National Fuel Cell Research Center and the Western Center of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a major site for the nationwide cancer genetics research network. For its range of services and research, UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center is the county's only cancer facility designated \"comprehensive\" by the National Cancer Institute. UCI is noted in fact for its strengths in cancer and neuroscience research, much of which takes place at UCI Medical Center. Located in the City of Orange, 13 miles to the north, the Medical Center is the primary teaching and research hospital for the UCI College of Medicine. Bus transportation makes travel convenient between the campus, UCI Medical Center and major housing areas, shopping centers, and recreation locales. In addition, the campus and surrounding communities are designed for bicycle traffic with trails connecting UCI with student housing and the coast. CELEBRATE UCI On Saturday, April J 7, 2004, UCI will host its annual open house, Celebrate UCL Among the day's events are the Wayzgoose Medieval Fair, housing and campus tours, and lectures and presen\u00ad tations, including information about admissions, academic pro\u00ad grams, and financial aid.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004UCI ACADEMIC SENATE DISTINGUISHED FACULTY SHARON B. BLOCK Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Teaching, 2002-03 Assistant Professor of History My high school history teacher told us that secret commissions ran the world, that oppressed peoples could not handle freedom, and that large-scale political movements were all rich men's conspiracies. Though I have long since rejected his political ideology, this teacher single-handedly turned me into a historian. He showed me that history was less about memorization and more about the thrill of discovery. Historical events didn't live in textbooks, they lived in the mind of the historian. He gave me the heady power to rewrite history. In my first year at the University of Pennsylvania, I decided to undertake a four-year com\u00ad bined M.A./B.A. in history. I admit I have trouble embracing anything halfway: I completed the major in my sophomore year, and then fulfilled my science requirement with a course on the \"History of the Dinosaurs.\" I spent a year at Oxford University so I could learn about early modem England as background for my specialization in colonial America. Five years later, I received my Ph.D. from Princeton University. From there, I spent two years as a National Endowment for the Humanities postdoc at the Institute of Early American History in Williamsburg, Virginia, and another two years as an assistant professor at the University of Iowa before heading to the sunnier climate here at UC Irvine. Were I not an academic, I sometimes think I'd like to be a detective (yes, I read too many mystery novels). I love the thrill of the chase, despite the trips to obscure archives and the eyestrain from illegible documents. When I find the piece of evidence that solves an intel\u00ad lectual puzzle, I'm dancing for days. Being a historian is, however, also learning to live with ambiguities. My specialization, the history of sexuality, regularly leaves me with more ques\u00ad tions than answers. My current research focuses on sexual coercion in colonial America. By distinguishing the crime of rape from the coercion of sex, I show that men coerced sex far more often than scattered rape prosecutions suggest. Social and economic power underwrote sexual power, both in the act itself and in a community's reaction to that act. Early Americans reinforced existing racial, class, and gender hierarchies by viewing rape as a transgressive social intercourse. In opposition to modem notions that patriarchy is a cause of rape, for early Americans, a properly ordered patriarchy was the solution to rape. As a feminist, I am particularly interested in analyzing the historical (and ongoing) oppres\u00ad sion of women. I want my students to see the ways that power has been historically used against various groups, and I hope that the skills they gain in my class reverberate long after they've forgotten the details of eighteenth-century history. I teach out of the belief that his\u00ad tory matters in the present and for the future. Sometimes we can see uncomfortable truths in the distant past that we are loath to recognize in our own society. Once students learn to identify historical power dynamics, they may be more likely to make connections to social and institutional inequities in the present. My high school history teacher probably would not be impressed with the kind of history I do. I'm interested less in political rule and more in the ways that cultural ideologies related to structural forms. Regardless, I am humbled by the legacy he left me, and try to show future generations that their perspective matters: they can shape the histories that have yet to be written. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004PENELOPE MADDY Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Research, 2002-03 UC/ Chancellor's Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science and of Mathematics My interest in mathematics was first peaked by the word problems of high school algebra; I was impressed that definite answers could be squeezed out of such silly~sounding partial information by the simple trick of writing down a few equations. But I was truly amazed when I learned, in a National Science Foundation summer program, that solid mathematical proofs could be given for the likes of 2+2=4! The final straw was the realization that the same fundamental assumptions or axioms that made those elementary proofs possible were enough to prove every'known theorem of mathematics, but that they were not enough to prove or disprove a simple statement about sets of points in space called the \"Continuum Hypothesis.\" The CH has to be either true or false, or so it seemed, but the most powerful tools of mathematics couldn't give us an answer! I was soon off to UC Berkeley, where a group of fine mathematicians was actively engaged in the search for new axioms that might settle the CH. It was a heady time for all of us in the logic group there, but I soon found myself asking questions in class that were not regarded as properly mathematical: e.g., that's a beautiful theorem, but what's the motiva\u00ad tion behind the new axiom from which it's derived? What justification do we have for adding it to our list of fundamental assumptions? By midway through graduate school, my halting transition from mathematics to philosophy was complete. My project for years was to give sense to the pursuit of an answer to the CH by defending a version of realism: there is an objective world of mathematical objects in which mathematical claims are either true or false, regardless of whether or not we are able to tell which. Eventually, I found myself unable to maintain my faith in one of the widely accepted philosophical arguments that underpinned this realism-the idea that mathematical objects must exist because of the nature of their role in applications-and I began to develop an alternative approach I 'now call \"naturalism.\" Work in this area has led me into wider issues in philosophy of science and philosophy of logic. While we still have no answer to the CH, I imagine I have a better idea of what an answer would look like, and I keep a fond amateur's eye on exciting new developments in the mathematics. LARRY E. OVERMAN Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Research, 2002-03 UCI Distinguished Professor of Chemistry Larry Overman was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1943 and raised in Hammond, Indiana. He obtained a B.A. degree from Earlham College in 1965 and completed his doctoral disserta\u00ad tion in 1969 with Professor Howard W. Whitlock Jr. at the University of Wisconsin. After a NIH postdoctoral fellowship with Professor Ronald Breslow at Columbia University, he joined the faculty at UC Irvine in 1971 and served as Chair of the Department of Chemistry from 1990-93. Professor Overman's research interests center on the invention of new reactions and strate\u00ad gies in organic synthesis and the total synthesis of natural products and their congeners. Early in his career, Professor Overman invented a broadly useful method for preparing allylic nitrogen compounds from readily available allylic alcohols. Professor Overman and his co-workers have developed a suite of cyclization reactions that create new heterocyclic and carbocyclic rings while controlling stereochemistry to an exceptional degree. One of these, the aza-Cope-Mannich rearrangement, has served as the cornerstone of total synthe\u00ad ses of more than a dozen alkaloids, highlighted by the first asymmetric total synthesis of Distinguished Faculty 13 I 1Ut)f'f'f1b Larwt~,.~ Professor Overman pioneered in the use of intramolecular insertion reactions of organopalladiumintermediates for assembling complex polycyclic molecules, particularly those containing congested quaternary carbon centers. Using synthesis strategies developed largely in his laboratory, Professor Overman's group has completed total syntheses of more than 80 structurally complex natural products. Professor Overman is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and is the recipient of numerous scientific awards and spe\u00ad cial lectureships. Additionally, he is Editor-in-Chief of Organic Reactions, is a member of several editorial consulting and advisory boards, and is a member of the board of directors and scientific advisory board for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. At UC Irvine he has received the School of Physical Sciences Distinguished Teaching Award and the Alumni Association Distinguished Research Award. MARK P. PETRACCA Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Teaching, 2002-03 Associate Professor of Political Science Politics matters. Political culture, philosophy, and ideas, the design of political institutions, and the nature of civic engagement have consequences for the opportunities and constraints we face throughout life. This is particularly so in a democratic regime where individual choice is most extensive, but where individuals are also fundamentally responsible for the survival and prosperity of a regime type which aspires to optimize liberty balanced deli\u00ad cately against human desires for equality. As a political scientist I aspire to conduct research relevant to the nature of democracy; as a teacher I try to inspire students to think critically about and engage in that democratic experiment; and as a citizen I attempt to model an active life of civic engagement worthy of emulation. Growing up in Quincy, Massachusetts, I certainly didn't appreciate any of this, perhaps with one small exception-political talk mattered to my father. My father was a musician as his father had been. My father never attended high school, but he loved to talk about politics-alas with me-at the dinner table and at any other time he could command my attention, which was anytime he commanded. As the eldest of four boys, I absorbed the brunt of my father's compulsive and highly critical view of the political world. So long as I kept my father tied down in argument, my three younger brothers and my devoted mother were exempt from engagement. With all this \"at-home\" training, I seemed destined to become a lawyer. Thankfully, my mentors at Cornell and the University of Chicago helped me choose another path. Yet for a long time, through the intellectual excitement of graduate school and then as a teacher at Chicago, Amherst College, and UCI, something seemed to be missing from my newfound commitment to academic scholarship. Professional political science was too apolitical and not particularly relevant to much that was consequential about politics or democratic governance. Writings about politics seemed as removed from the reality of consequence as had all the boyhood talks with my father about politics sitting at the kitchen table. I discovered at least a partial an~wer to this critique-in the form of a dual revelation-after spending a semester teaching at Beijing University in the People's Repub\u00ad lic of China. Thanks to a library inherited from Yanjing University, I had surprising access to virtually all the books that served to found and motivate the development of political sci\u00ad ence and I had the time to read them. The foundations of political science had been highly UC IRVINE - 2003-2004relevant to the living experiment of self-governance, and key scholars in the emerging disci\u00ad pline were directly involved in political life. Additionally, I was deeply inspired by my Chi\u00ad nese students who were studying politics and political science because they thought it would help them help China to democratize. Upon returning to UCI from Beida I made a commitment as a scholar, teacher, and citizen to matter more to the prospects of democracy and democratization. This is a commitment solidified by the subsequent deaths of many stu\u00ad dents I had taught at Beida during the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. They died as part of an historic struggle for ideas, opportunities, and responsibilities I had been fortunate enough to take for granted. I variously study the nature of democracy. How does it operate? How can presumed democ\u00ad ratic systems be improved? What existing institutional mechanisms of democratic practice and discourse are essential to it? I am particularly interested in the distribution of political power in the United States and the implications of this distribution for democratic gover\u00ad nance. In so doing I hope to honor my many mentors, in particular Theodore J. Lowi, Ben~ jamin Page, Ira Katznelson, David Easton, Frances Zemans, James Danziger, and William Schonfeld; pay appropriate tribute to all that my former students have taught me; motivate to active citizenship my current students; thank those who hold me in high regard; and make political inquiry and public life much more than kitchen-table sophistry. JANICE GUDDE PLASTINO Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. Distinguished University Service Award, .2002-03 , Professor of Dance The University of California requires professors to teach, conduct research and creative activity, and perform service. Service is expected to be within the university including work within the department, school, university campus and senate, and the 10-campus University of California system. Most professors also give their time, energy, and expertise to various public, private, and nonprofit organizations and to professional groups that specifically relate to their field including editorial boards, conference planning and participation, and journal editorships. I have given to all these area, but my most rewarding service has been to the University of California. Service has provided me the opportunity to meet professors, staff, and stu9ents outside my field of dance who have become lifelong friends and colleagues. Perhaps more than any other positive experience derived from service, I have learned so much about aspects of academia outside the performance, creation, and production of the art of the dance. I have been able to use this knowledge to help administer my department and advise students and colleagues. Service cannot take time from the most important requirements of a professorship which are research, creative activity, and teaching. I could never teach the range of subjects nor could I do the kind of research I do in Dance Science without my contacts outside my department. Many of my research collaborators were recommended, or I met through service commit\u00ad ments, since all of my research colleagues are outside the field of dance. I am fortunate to be able to create and teach dance and to be able to conduct research. The university has pro\u00ad vided an environment that makes all these activities possible. I am grateful for this award and the recognition from the University of California, Irvine Senate. Distinguished Faculty 15 UC IRVINE - 2003-200416 UCI 2003-04 Distinguished Faculty LESLIE M. THOMPSON Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Research, 2002-03 Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and of Biological Chemistry As a young child, the innermost workings of a cell held the utmost fascination for me. A microscope and books kept me company many a cold, snowy Wisconsin day. That fascina\u00ad tion matured into a keen desire to combine biological research with the study of disease after my family moved to Mexico during my high school years and after spending time in a remote African village during college. I truly found a melding of all these interests and pas\u00ad sions as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of John Wasmuth of UCI, where I began the journey of working with talented colleagues and collaborators around the world who together strived to identify the Huntington's disease (HD) gene. HD is a devastating neu\u00ad rodegenerative disease characterized by a triad of symptoms including a movement disorder, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. There is currently no treatment or cure for this devastating disease that strikes individuals in the prime of life (typically mid-30s) at a time when they have typically had children who now have a 50 percent chance of carrying on this legacy. My role in this research involved identification ofpotential HD genes, one of which we later showed can carry mutations that cause achondroplasia, the most common genetic form of short-limbed dwarfism. The HD gene was cloned in 1993 by this group. Following the untimely death of Professor Wasmuth, I stayed at UCI and continued this work, first as an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Biological Chemistry and currently as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior. Through long-term collaborations with individuals on campus (in particular Professors Larry Marsh and Ralph Bradshaw), and with knowledge of the genetic mutations that under\u00ad lie these disorders, our research has focused on how these mutations cause disease and the possible therapeutic approaches we can develop. It has been an exciting year in our HD research. We have found that certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents, called HDAC inhibitors, as well as compounds that suppress \"inclusion formation\" (clumps of protein that accumulate in the brains of diseased HD patients), hold promise as possible therapeutics. This has only been possible through the intellectual talent and hard work of scientists in my laboratory (Joan Steffan, Barbara Apostol, Natalia Slepko, and Simona Raffioni) and scientists in Larry Marsh's lab. As I was trained in biochemistry for my Ph.D., an important and enjoyable aspect of my UCI experience has been as a teacher and basic science advisor for the medical students. In teaching as in research, my commitment has been to applying basic biological knowledge to identification, understanding, and treatment of diseases that compromise an individual's quality of life. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004PREADMISSION MATTERS OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS The mission of the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, a division of Student Affairs, is to: (1) optimize UCI's undergraduate enrollments by implementing Academic Senate, uni\u00ad versitywide, and campus policies for the selection and admission of new freshman and transfer students; and (2) stimulate and advance cooperative educational relationships between UCI and California schools and colleges. The Office works to improve the preparation of prospective students for higher education and to pro\u00ad mote their access to and success at UCI. Additional information about the services listed below is available from the Office; telephone (949) 824-6703; World Wide Web: http://www.admissions.uci.edu/. Undergraduate Admissions Staff are involved in monitoring applications and admission targets, in collecting and evaluating personal and academic data to select and admit new undergraduate students, in establishing students' permanent UCI academic record, and in evaluating for transfer credit course work taken in other colleges and universities by new and continuing students. Intersegmental Relations Staff are involved in: (1) promoting liaison and curricular articula\u00ad tion between UCI and California Community Colleges; and (2) various educational organizations designed to facilitate regional cooperation (South Coast Higher Education Council). School and College Relations Staff: (1) advise prospective students, their parents, teachers, coun\u00ad selors, and school administrators regarding academic programs, admission requirements, and admission selection, and assist them with UC application and enrollment processes; (2) increase public awareness by making presentations to schools, colleges, and the community regarding UCI and the University of California, and by creating publications which explain admissions policies and proce\u00ad dures, academic options, housing, financial aid, and student life opportunities; (3) provide general information on UC admissions and programs for all UC campuses; (4) interpret University poli\u00ad cies and procedures specific to undergraduate enrollment; (5) assist prospective transfer students and community college faculty and staff; (6) participate in activities and projects designed to enhance the academic success of students; and (7) sponsor an Academic Talent Search to identify gifted and high-ability sixth-through tenth-grade students and to design activities to prepare them for the University and promote their academic success. On-Campus Services Staff: (1) host programs for prospective students and educational groups including UCI Preview Day (fall) for high school students, and UCI's Transfer Track (fall) for prospective transfer students; (2) offer activities for applicants such as Explore UCI and the Campus Experience program (spring); (3) maintain an honors out\u00ad reach program for high-achieving prospective UCI students includ\u00ad ing the UCI Academic Talent Search; (4) inform UC and UCI administrators and faculty of developments in California schools and community colleges; and (5) provide consultative services to campus departments wishing to provide programs for schools and colleges or special recruitment for specific majors or programs. Transfer Student Services Transfer Student Services (TSS), a component of the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, provides advice and guid\u00ad ance to prospective UCI transfer students. Staff regularly visit Southern California community colleges and meet with prospective transfer students to discuss admission requirements, academic planning and preparation, and UCI lower-division major and gen\u00ad eral education requirements. Articulation agreements, which iden\u00ad tify how community college courses may be used to fulfill lower\u00ad division UCI degree requirements, are facilitated through TSS. Articulation agreements may be viewed on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. CAMPUS TOURS Student-led tours of the campus are conducted weekdays at noon, except during academic recesses; Saturday tours are offered during October, November, and April only. The regular weekday tour is expanded during the month of April to accommodate students on spring recess. To confirm tour dates, times, and parking instruc\u00ad tions and to arrange tours for school groups of 10 or more during the regular academic year, call (949) 824-2719. HOWTO USE THE CATALOGUE Because the UC/ General Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs and courses inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some courses are not offered each year. The Schedule of Classes, a publi\u00ad cation available from the Registrar's Office shortly before registra\u00ad tion begins each quarter, provides more current information on courses, instructors, enrollment procedures and restrictions, class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Stu\u00ad dents should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. (Admission to UCI does not guarantee enrollment in any particular course.) Presentation of information in the Catalogue is divided into five main concepts, as detailed in the Table of Contents: (1) Introduc\u00ad tion to UCI, (2) Preadmission Matters, (3) Information for Admitted Students, (4) Research and Graduate Studies, and (5) Academic Programs. Included in the academic unit sections are the following kinds of information: (a) brief descriptions of the areas that are covered in each school or program and a brief statement of the educational philosophy and orientation of the unit; (b) lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their areas of interest; (c) requirements for undergraduate majors and minors and graduate degrees; (d) additional areas of study referred to as concentrations, specializations, or emphases; (e) advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each school or program; and (f) courses offered. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as lower division (numbered 1-99) and upper division (numbered 100-199). Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate or professional courses. Lower division usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, upper division to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing UC IRVINE - 2003-200418 UCI 2003-04 Preadmission Matters UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREES Degree Title Aerospace Engineering African-American Studies Anthropology Applied Ecology Art History Arts and Humanities Asian American Studies Biochemistry and Molecuhrr Biology Biological Sciences Biomedical Engineering Biomedical Engineering: Premedical Business Administration Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Chemical Engineering Chemistry Chicano!Latino Studies Degree 1 B.S.

A course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) nor\u00ad mally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a number usually designates a laboratory course. The letter H preceding a number designates an honors course. The (4) or (4-4-4) designation following the course title indicates the quarter unit credits toward graduation. Some courses give other than four units of credit; for example, two, five, or a range from one to 12. The notations F, W, S, or Summer after the course number and title indicate when the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring quarter, or summer session. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the description. However, courses which have been approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement are not designated in this Catalogue. Rather, they are designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes with a W following the number. Students should refer to the Schedule of Classes for a complete listing of approved upper-division writing courses. UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS, MINORS, AND ASSOCIATED AREAS OF STUDY Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, and associ\u00ad ated areas of study. Special restrictions apply to some majors and minors; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students, others may be completed without such for\u00ad malities. Information about the programs listed below may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree programs are referred to as majors in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors, concentrations, specializa\u00ad tions, and emphases. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the introductory-level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or discipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. An interdisciplinary minor consists of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. All minors, including interdisciplinary minors, are available to all students regardless of their major, with the exception that students may not minor in their major. Minors are listed on a student's tran\u00ad script but not on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study consisting of courses offered by two or more schools or programs, Concentra\u00ad tions are similar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of concentration appears on the stu\u00ad dent's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentra\u00ad tions are taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. A specialization is a program of study which enables students to focus on courses in a particular field within a major. The area of specialization pursued appears on the student's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Areas of Undergraduate Study 19 An emphasis is a program of study within a major which empha\u00ad sizes a specific area of the discipline. Emphases usually have a defined course of study and are not listed on the transcript nor on the baccalaureate diploma. Honors programs for qualified upper-division students are avail\u00ad able within the following majors: Social Sciences; and Sociol\u00ad ogy. Additionally, the Humanities Honors Program is open to qualified upper-division students regardless of major, and the Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students in all majors from their freshman through senior years. Excellence in Research Programs are available to Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences, Engineering, and Psychology majors.

MAJORS AND CAREERS Choosing a Major Many students select their University major, the field of study which represents their principal academic interest, at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarship. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its academic pro\u00ad grams. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by broad interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, labo\u00ad ratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and arts productions. Such experiences can help students identify additional \u00b7 areas of interest. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available and requirements. Students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors and to go to any department to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limita\u00ad tions. (Some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. See the Undergraduate Admissions section for information.) While advisors may not be familiar with all Majors and Careers 23 fields, they can: suggest-ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Courses and workshops designed to assist students in choosing a major are offered by the UCI Career Center, the Division of Undergraduate Education, and some of the academic units. All students are required to choose a major by the time they reach junior status. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students should keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary. study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and could cause the student to need more than four years to obtain the baccalaureate degree. Further\u00ad more, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Certain restrictions may apply; students should check with their academic advisor. Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, as indicated above. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and policies and procedures. In addition, a form called the Under\u00ad graduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major or even to identify their interests with a particular school. Such students participate in the Unde\u00ad cided/Undeclared Advising Program which is administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. The goal of this program is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are required to choose their major by the time they reach junior status. To make a good decision about what major to declare, students should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of their own abilities and inter\u00ad ests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of their vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate preparation. Students in the Undecided/Unde\u00ad clared Advising Program receive quarterly individualized staff counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own interests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for graduate education and/or possible careers. Students also meet with faculty. To assist students in choosing a major, the program has created a required course designed to expose undecided/undeclared students to a variety of opportunities and resources available to them on the campus such as electronic technology including the World Wide Web and electronic mail, and to introduce students to each of the schools and majors offered. In addition, students learn about research and career opportunities within different disciplines. Call (949) 824-6987 for more information.

Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study Undergraduate students should keep the possibility of future gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic pro\u00ad grams, and they should discuss their career goals with their advi\u00ad sors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those require\u00ad ments in mind when selecting courses. Furthermore, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language or other special requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. Students should consult the graduate advisor or academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to their area of interest and visit the UCI Career Center which offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. Information about UCI's graduate education policies and proce\u00ad dures is available in The Manual of the Irvine Division of the Aca\u00ad demic Senate (http://www.senate.uci.edu/) and on the UCI Office of Graduate Studies Web site (http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/). Preprofessional Preparation LAW Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spec\u00ad trum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immigration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evi\u00ad dence of academic excellence. A good record in physics or clas\u00ad sics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in his\u00ad tory or political science. Most law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathematics, research methods, and statistics, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and suc\u00ad ceeding in law school and the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers a Humanities and Law minor, emphasizing courses that require critical reading and analysis, and courses that focus on theoretical and applied ana\u00ad lytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, international relations, and economics of law and rec\u00ad ommends that students take some political science courses as well. The School of Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice, and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to actual problems through its field study program. Students should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, LSAT results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative careers should one's goals change. MEDICINE AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SCIENCES Although health science educators strongly recommend that stu\u00ad dents obtain a bachelor's degree pnor to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many UCI students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is also required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergraduate preparation required includes one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with labora\u00ad tory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics, as well as one semester (or two quarters) of biochemistry. Courses in UC IRVINE - 2003-2004cell or molecular biology, genetics, developmental physiology or comparative anatomy, vertebrate embryology, and computer sci\u00ad ence are recommended. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommendations, for example, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish language is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately, and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the Medical Col\u00ad lege Admission Test (MCAT) and other aptitude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in\u00ad depth letters of recommendation; practical clinical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, which is regarded favorably as an indication of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extracurricular activities which demonstrate the appli\u00ad cant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience, especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants and competition for entrance is keen, it is important to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to a health science school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related programs now available. BUSINESS/MANAGEMENT The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and par\u00ad ticipate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, the ability to successfully deploy and manage information technologies, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of global economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. Although UCI does not offer an undergraduate degree ,in business, the Graduate School of Management offers a minor in Manage\u00ad ment as a supplement to any undergraduate major. This minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and practice and may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or under\u00ad take graduate-level study in management. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus, statistics, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and political science, and are encouraged to take intensive course work.in the culture, history, geography; economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. For admission purposes, the majority of graduate schools of busi\u00ad ness look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Manage\u00ad ment Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of pur\u00ad pose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work experi\u00ad ence. Substantive work experience is becoming an increasingly important prerequisite for many programs. Students from a variety of undergraduate disciplines including lib\u00ad eral arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering are encouraged to apply to UCI's Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management. Majors and Careers 25 Career Opportunities UCI's academic units which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level.

See the Undergraduate Admissions section of this Catalogue for information about apply\u00ad ing to UCI and the formal admission process. NOTE: Effective fall quarter 2003, UC Irvine has discontinued admitting high school students into the UCI University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS). Educational Opportunity Program The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is designed for stu\u00ad dents with promising academic ability and potential despite a low\u00ad income or educationally disadvantaged background. EOP is based primarily on family income level, and all students served by the program must be California residents, with the exception of Ameri\u00ad can Indian students. Admission. Counselors in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools visithigh schools and community colleges through\u00ad out California and meet with prospective students, parents, teach\u00ad ers, counselors, and school officials to discuss the admission and financial aid processes, housing, and the academic opportunities available at UCI. Prospective students indicate their interest in being considered for EOP services on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission and must provide the information requested. Application fee waivers are available for low-income applicants who meet the eligibility criteria. Housing. UCI guarantees on-campus housing to all new single undergraduates under the age of 25 who meet the housing applica\u00ad tion deadline. Center for Educational Partnerships In 1996 UCI established the Center for Educational Partnerships to. advance cooperative educational relationships among UCI and Cal\u00ad ifornia schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities. In collaboration with the academic deans and UCI fac\u00ad ulty, the Center, and its School-University Partners, offer academic outreach programs for K-12 and community college students. Innovative teacher professional development is provided through the UCI faculty and California Subject Matter Projects in the Arts, Reading and Literature, History and Social Science, Mathematics, and Science Projects. The Early Academic Outreach Program, MESA (Mathematics, Science and Engineering Achievement), The Saturday Academy in Mathematics, and Upward Bound programs offer academic-year and intensive summer programs aimed at improving preparation of students from under-served groups for success in higher education. COSMOS (the California State Sum\u00ad mer School for Mathematics and Science) and the Gifted \u00b7students Academy are state and national summer residential and commuter programs that challenge even the most accomplished young scholar. The Orange County Transfer Consortium, composed of the County's nine community colleges, sponsors programs designed to increase the transfer rate to UC and UCI, and to identify potential K-12 teachers from among potential community college transfers through its UCI TEACH program. Together with Santa Ana College, the Special Programs 27 nationally recognized Summer Scholars Transfer Institute is offered each summer on the UCI campus. National collaborations for discipline-specific and interdisciplinary initiatives for curriculum reform, professional development, and student academic services include the Ford and Kellogg Founda\u00ad tions, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the U.S. Department of Education (GEAR UP), and the National Science Foundation Mathematics and Science Partnership. The Center is the lead for the National Science Foundation/Univer\u00ad sity of California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CAMP), a program offering faculty\u00ad directed research and mentoring opportunities for undergraduates, and a pathway to graduate and professional schools. The McNair/ Star Program, funded through the U.S. Department of Education, is also directed toward students in the same disciplines as CAMP, as well as those social and behavioral sciences in which quantitative and statistical methods are used. The Center employs UCI students and provides undergraduate and graduate opportunities for research. Through SAGE Scholars (Stu\u00ad dent Achievement Guided by Experience), created in 1999 by the UC Office of the President, the Center works with local businesses to offer paid multi-year internships to talented and highly moti\u00ad vated UCI students related to their field of study.

Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS), a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education, provides support services to students who are first-generation college students or low-income students, as well as disabled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). The goal of SAAS is to help students earn their University degree. See the Division of Undergraduate Educa\u00ad tion section of the Catalogue for additional information. Graduate Diversity Program The University of California recently reaffirmed that a diverse stu\u00ad dent and faculty population is integral to academic excellence and is critical to promoting the lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essential to advanced scholarly research. The University remains committed to expand\u00ad ing outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts. Through the Grad\u00ad uate Diversity Program, steps are taken to increase the participa\u00ad tion of diverse groups who may be disadvantaged in graduate education in the United States. See the Research and Graduate Studies section of the Catalogue for additional information. Medical Student Support Programs The College of Medicine's Office of Admissions and Outreach is designed to meet the challenges of California's changing demo\u00ad graphics and to contribute to the College's goal of achieving a broad spectrum of diversity in the student population, and uiti\u00ad mately, in the medical profession. The office plays a major role in the recruitment and retention of targeted socioeconomically disad\u00ad vantaged students who have the potential of service to the med\u00ad ically underserved communities in California. See the College of Medicine section for additional information.

UC IRVINE - 2003-200430 UCI 2003-04 Preadmission Matters CALIFORNIA RESIDENCE AND THE NONRESIDENT TUITION FEE All students who have not lived in California with the intent to make California their permanent home for more than one calendar year prior to the residence determination date for each quarter or semester they propose to attend the University must pay the Non\u00ad resident Tuition Fee. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California cam\u00ad puses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester sys\u00ad tem, the day instruction begins for the semester. Laws Governing Residence The rules regarding residence classification for tuition purposes at the Uni\u00ad versity of California are governed by the California Educational Code and implemented by the Standing Orders of The Regents of the University of California. Under these rules adult citizens and certain classes of non-citizens can establish residence for tuition purposes. There are particular rules that apply to the residence classification of minors. Who Is a Resident? Adult students (at least 18 years of age) may establish residence for tuition purposes in California if they are a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or other immigrant, or a nonimmigrant who is not precluded from establishing a domicile in the U.S. This includes nonimmigrants who hold valid visas of the following types: A, E, H-1, H-4, I, K, L, 0-1, 0-3, R, or V. To establish residence a student must, immediately prior to the residence determination date: 1. Be physically present in California for more than one calendar year, and 2. Must have come to California with the intent to make California the per\u00ad manent home. For example, physical presence within the state of Califor\u00ad nia solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence regardless of the length of stay. 3. Students under 24 years of age whose parents are not residents of Califor\u00ad nia will be required to meet the Financial Independence requirement in order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes. Residence cannot be derived from a spouse or parents. Requirements for Financial Independence Students are considered \"financially independent\" if they fall into at least one of the following categories: 1. At least 24 years of age by December 31 of the calendar year of the term for which resident classification is requested. 2. Veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. 3. A ward of the court or both parents are deceased. 4. Has legal dependents other than a spouse. 5. A married graduate student or professional student who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the tax year immediately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested. 6. An unmarried undergraduate student, not claimed as an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the two tax years imme\u00ad diately preceding the term for which resident classification is requested, who can demonstrate self-sufficiency for those years. NOTE: Financial independence is not a factor in residence status for graduate student instructors, graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, junior specialists, postgraduate researchers, graduate student researchers, and teaching associates who are employed 49 percent or more of full time in the term for which resident classification is requested. Establishing Intent to become a California Resident Relevant indicia that contribute to the demonstration of a student's intent to make California the permanent home include, but are not limited to, the fol\u00ad lowing: registering to vote and voting in California elections; designating a California permanent address on all records (i.e., school, employment, mili\u00ad tary); obtaining a California Driver License or California Identification Card; obtaining a California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident (including taxes on income earned outside California from the date California residence was established); maintaining a California residence in which personal belongings are kept; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in places other than California during any period for which residence in California is asserted. General Rules Applying to Minors The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under the age of 18) lives is the residence of the unmarried minor. When the unmarried minor does not live with either parent, the residence of the unmarried minor is that of the parent with whom the unmarried minor hist lived. An unmarried minor may establish his or her own residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed unless the unmarried minor is a minor non-citizen who is precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from establishing domicile in the U.S. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by the unmarried minor's own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent's right of control. Specific Rules Applying to Minors 1. Parent of Minor Moves from California. If the California resident par\u00ad ent(s) of an eligible minor moves from California, the minor will be enti\u00ad tled to resident classification as long as the minor enrolls full-time in a California public postsecondary institution within one calendar year of the parent's departure, and remains physically present in California. This classification will continue until the minor has attained the age of major\u00ad ity and has resided in California for the minimum time required to become a resident. The Financial Independence requirement does not apply to this situation. 2. Self-Supporting Minor. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens may be eligible for resident classification if documentation of physical presence, intent to be a California resident, and self-support through the student's own employment or credit is provided for the entire calendar year prior to the residence determination date. 3. Two-Year Care and Control. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens may be eligible for resident classification if they have lived with and been under the continuous care and control of an adult or series of adults other than a parent for not less than two calendar years. The adult or series of adults must have been responsible for care and control for the entire two-year period and must be California resi\u00ad dents for 366 days prior to the residence determination date of the term for which resident classification is requested. Exemptions from the Nonresident Tuition Fee Students for whom any of the following conditions apply may be eligible for an exemption from the Nonresident Tuition Fee. 1. \u00b7 Member of the military, spouse, or child. A student, on active duty as a member of the United States military stationed in California, and their spouses and dependent children. 2. Child or spouse of a faculty member. To the extent that university funds are available, a student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a University of California faculty member who is a member of the Academic Senate. 3. Child or spouse of a University employee. A student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a full\u00ad time employee of the University of California who is permanently assigned to work outside the state of California (i.e., Los Alamos National Laboratory). 4. Child of a deceased public law enforcement or tire suppression employee. A student who is the child of a deceased public law enforce\u00ad ment or fire suppression employee, who was a California resident and was killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties. 5. Dependent child of a California resident. A student who has not been an adult resident for more than one year and is the natural or adopted, dependent child of a California resident who has been a resident for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. The student must also maintain full-time attendance in a California public postsecondary institution. 6. Graduate of a California school operated by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (B.I.A.). A student who is a graduate of a California school operated by the B.I.A. (i.e., Sherman Indian High School) and who enrolls at the University of California. UC IRVINE - 2003-20047. Employee of California public school district. A student holding a valid credential authorizing service in California public schools and employed by a school district in a full-time certificate position. 8. Student athlete in training at U.S. Olympic Training Center, Chula Vista. An amateur student athlete in training at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, until the student has resided in California the mini\u00ad mum time necessary to become a resident. 9. Graduate of California high school. A student who attended high school in California for three or more years (9th grade included) and graduated from California high school (or attained the eqfiivalent). 10. Congressional Medal of Honor recipient. An undergraduate student under age 27 who is the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor or a child of a recipient who at the time of his or her death was a Califor\u00ad nia resident. 11. Surviving dependents of 9/11 terrorist attacks. Undergraduate students who are the surviving dependents of a California resident who was killed in the 9/11101 terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon Building, or the crash of United Airlines flight 93. Temporary Absences If a nonresident student is in the process of establishing a domicile in Cali\u00ad fornia and returns to his or her former home during noninstructional periods, the student's presence in California will be presumed to be solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes and only convincing evidence to the contrary will rebut this presumption. Students who are in the State of California solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes will not be classified as residents for tuition purposes regard\u00ad less of their length of stay in California. If a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition purposes leaves California temporarily, the absence could result in the loss of California resi\u00ad dence. The burden of proof is on the student to demonstrate through docu\u00ad mentation that he or she (or the parents if the student is a minor) did nothing inconsistent with a claim of continuing California residence during a tempo\u00ad rary absence. Steps that should be taken to retain California residence include, but are not limited to: 1. Continue to use a California address on all records (educational, employ\u00ad ment, military, among others). 2. Continue to satisfy California tax obligations. A student claiming Califor\u00ad nia residence is liable for payment of income taxes on his or her total income from the date he or she begins to establish residence in Califor\u00ad nia, including income earned in another state or country. 3. Retain a California voter's registration and vote by absentee ballot. 4. Maintain a California Driver License, California Identification Card, and vehicle registration in California. If it is necessary to change the driver's license or vehicle registration, it must be changed back to California in the time prescribed by law. Change in Resident Classification Continuing students who are classified as nonresidents for tuition purposes, and who believe that they will be eligible for resident status for an upcoming quarter, must submit a Petition for Resident Classification to the Office of the Registrar in order to have their residence status changed before they submit their registration fee payment for the applicable quarter. Students must initi\u00ad ate all changes of status before the registration deadline of the quarter for which they want to be reclassified. (Specific deadline dates are listed in the quarterly Schedule of Classes booklet.) Students are strongly encouraged to submit their petition at the earliest possible date in order to expedite the review process. As long as submission deadlines are met, students may be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the quarter to provide any additional documentation required for residence determination. Incorrect Classification Any student found to be incorrectly classified as a resident is subject to non\u00ad resident classification and to payment of all previously unpaid Nonresident Fees. If a student has concealed information or furnished false information, and was classified incorrectly as a result, the student is also subject to Uni\u00ad versity discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents of California must immediately notify the UCI Residence Deputy. Expenses and Fees 31 UC/ Senior Information Day representatives answer questions about graduation, graduate school, cap and gown orders, and more. Inquiries and Appeals Inquiries regarding residence requirements, determination, and/or recognized exceptions should be directed to the University of California, Irvine, Resi\u00ad dence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, telephone (949) 824-6129, or to the Principal Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, Jill Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94607- 5200. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition fee purposes. This summary is not a complete explanation of the law regarding residence classification. Additional information is available from the Office of the Reg\u00ad istrar. Changes may be made in the residence requirements between the pub\u00ad lication of this statement and the relevant residence determination date. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Resi\u00ad dence Deputy, may appeal in writing to the Legal Analyst within 45 days of notification of the Residence Deputy's final decision. Fee Refunds Student Fee Refunds Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean and, for undergraduate students, the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable; and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal is used in determining the per\u00ad centage of fees to be refunded. This date is normally the date that the student submits the form to the appropriate Dean/Ombudsman for approval and is designated by that Dean/Ombudsma.n. It is pre\u00ad sumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Registration fees are refunded as follows. Students should bear in mind that the \"first day of the quarter\" often is several days prior to the \"first day of instruction.\" New Undergraduate Students. Through the first day of instruction, fees are refunded in full, except for: (1) the $100 Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, and (2) the Undergraduate Student Health Insurance Fee. (The Undergraduate Student Health Insurance Fee is refunded only if the Cancellation/Withdrawal form is submit\u00ad ted prior to the first day of the quarter.)

Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are mailed to the student generally two to four weeks after the official notice of withdrawal is initiated. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have all or part of the fee refund credited to the appropriate financial aid fund. Any cash disbursements, other than work-study, that a student received may also require repay\u00ad ment. The refund amount for new students who receive Title IV Federal financial assistance and withdraw during their first term at UCI is calculated as shown below (subject to change). Students withdrawing who received loans must schedule an exit interview with the Financial Services Office at (949) 824-7081.

FINANCIAL AID Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; 65 percent of UCI's enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Stu\u00ad dents who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend may be eligible for scholarships, grants, loans, and/or work-study awards through the Office of Financial Aid and Schol\u00ad arships. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, some scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence. Information regarding the application process, deadlines, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the 2003-04 Financial Aid Handbook. The handbook is mailed to entering students in January and is available to continuing students online at http://www.fao.uci.edu/ or in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, 102 Adminis\u00ad tration Building; telephone (949) 824-8262. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA/Renewal Application and FAFSA on the Web). To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the FAFSA, FAFSA on \u00b7 the Web (FOTW), or the Renewal Application and submit the necessary supporting d~cuments each year. The FAFSA is avail\u00ad able at high schools, local colleges and universities; at the UCI Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships; and on the Web at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Renewal applications are mailed to current financial aid recipients starting in mid-November and con\u00ad tinuing through the end of December. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible after January 1. The priority deadline to file the FAFSA/FOTW/Renewal Application for loans, work-study, and most grants is March 2. All other supporting documentation should be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholar\u00ad ships by May 1 for priority consideration. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to the extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the FAFSA and supporting doc\u00ad uments determines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's edu\u00ad cation. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and, if applicable, a spouse, can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college (excluding parents) are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate other than family residence; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business equity; and cash, sav\u00ad ings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security, Veterans' benefits, and foreign income. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant. The application deadline for Cal Grants is March 2 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures. Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the possibil\u00ad ity of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Exam\u00ad ples of such special expenditures include special equipment for stu\u00ad dents with disabilities and computer purchases. Eligibility Requirements Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the crite\u00ad ria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: (1) be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen of the U.S.; (2) be accepted for admission to the University; (3) be enrolled in good standing at the University; units taken through the Univer\u00ad sity Extension program are not counted toward half-or full-time enrollment; (4) demonstrate financial need (except for William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal PLUS loans); financial need is the differ\u00ad ence between the reasonable, approved expenses of attending UCI and all available resources, including the expected contribution from parents, the stu\u00ad dent, and any outside aid; (5) maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; (6) be registered with the Selective Service if the student is a male at least 18 years old, born after December 31, 1960, and not on active duty with the armed forces; (7) not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan. Once a student meets the above criteria, disbursement of financial aid funds is made only if the student does not have outstanding debts owed to UCI. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004UCI POLICY ON SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1986 state that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the stan\u00ad dards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May 1982 state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be main\u00ad taining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing according to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financiai aid awards administered by the UCI Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.

Contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships for more information. NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate students who enroll in more than the mini\u00ad mum number of units required per quarter in the first and second years will have the additional units carried forward for the cumulative total. 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility. All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Stu\u00ad dents will not be granted additional quarters of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pursuing more than one major. \u00b7 Financial Aid 33 Undergraduate students: I. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of 15 quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to determine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligibility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have up to six quarters of additional finanCial aid eligibility for a maximum of 21 quarters of under\u00ad graduate attendance. Graduate students: I. California educational credential students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 3. Ph.D. students may be eligible for financial aid for up to 2I quarters of academic-year attendance following the completion of their baccalaureate degree (whether or not they received financial aid during the 21 quarters). Medical students: 1. Incoming students in their first year of attendance will be eligible for financial assistance for a total of four years. 2. College of Medicine students who have been approved for Extended Cur\u00ad riculum will be\u00b7eligible for financial assistance for a total of six years. Unit Evaluation I. Remedial courses. Required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock-hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation. As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students: F (Failure), I (Incomplete), NP (Not Pass), U (Unsatisfactory), W (Withdraw), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of aD grade or higher; repeat of an advanced standing or high school course). Medical students: F (Failure), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher). 3. Incomplete courses-medical students. Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quarter/quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade of F, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. 4. Courses in progress-medical students. Clock-hours for courses In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during\u00b7 UC IRVINE - 2003-200434 UCI 2003-04 Preadmission Matters the first quarter/quintile of a course requiring more than two quarters/quin\u00ad tiles for completion. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Deficiencies in Satisfactory Academic Progress and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of each academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. 1. Quarterly totals-unit and GPA a. Cumulative GPA below the minimum required total: Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the GPA deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the GPA deficiency. Note: GPA deficiencies must be cleared at a University of Califor\u00ad niacampus. b: Unit deficiencies: i. Enrolled in Jess than the minimum units required but at least six per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter of that academic year or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. ii. Enrolled in less than six units per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive campus-based financial aid funds for that acad\u00ad emic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. 2. Academic year totals-units and GPA. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships will verify the cumulative totals for units and GPA after the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit and/or GPA deficiencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any future finan\u00ad cial aid funds, including funds that would be used for payment of fees. 3. Quarter limits of eligibility. At the end of each quarter students will be notified by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships if they are nearing the quarter limit of eligibility for financial aid. The notice will indicate how many quarters of eligibility remain. Students also will be notified when they have completed the maximum number of quarters of eligibility for financial aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: (a) sufficient units/clock-hours have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative GPA requirement has been satisfied, or (b) it is estab\u00ad lished through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating circumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (e.g., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeal Request Form (available from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships); a letter to the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit, clock-hour, or GPA progress requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties; and any other requested documents. Undergraduate and graduate students may seek the assistance of the University Ombudsman in the preparation of appeals. Medical students may seek the assistance of the Associate Dean of Student and Resident Affairs in the preparation of appeals. They may also be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or Jetter from their dean. Undergraduate Students-All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid pro\u00ad fessional staff). Once material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept an appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal inter\u00ad view with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final rec\u00ad ommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and forwarded to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for a final decision. Graduate Students-Appeals are reviewed by (1) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced degree program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies, who will make the final recommendation to the Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships for a final decision. Medical Students-All relevant materials will be presented to the Committee on Promotions and Honors. If the Committee, after consideration of the appeal, determines that the appeal should be approved, its decision will be forwarded to the College of Medicine Director of Financial Aid, and aid will be reinstated. In the event the appeal is denied by the Committee, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Committee. The Com\u00ad mittee will forward the final decision to the College of Medicine Director of Financial Aid for implementation. UCI POLICY ON EXCESSIVE UNITS Under the Partnership Agreement with the State of California, the University has made a number of commitments including the following: \"With regard to students who enter as freshmen, eliminate State funding, including financial aid, for those who exceed the required credit units for their current degree program by more than 20 percent.\" Students who are approaching the thresh\u00ad old may be notified by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships regard\u00ad ing the potential loss of UC State funds. However, final determination will be made by the UC Office of the President based on specific degree require\u00ad ments. Only credits earned at a University of California campus or through the Education Abroad Program or the UCDC Academic Internship Program are used in the calculation of this limit. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, extension course work, and transfer credit earned at a non-UC institution are not used to determine eligibility. If an aid recipient does exceed the 120 percent threshold, the recipient will be retroactively billed for any UC State funds received during the academic year. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achieve\u00ad ment, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate finan\u00ad cial need. UCI offers students with proven high academic achieve\u00ad ment and leadership potential three WP honors awards: Regents', Alumni Association, and Chancellor's Achievement. The scholar\u00ad ships have stipends which range from $1,000 to $6,000; or, in the case of Regents' Scholarships, may provide full demonstrated need. Entering Freshman and Transfer Students Students who are entering UCI in the fall must complete the schol\u00ad arship section of the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and submit the application by November 30. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships automatically collects information about applicants' scholarship qualifications. Applica\u00ad tions that meet the requirements are reviewed by the Faculty Advi\u00ad sory Panel on Undergraduate Scholarships, Honors, and Financial Aid. Information about the Alumni Scholarship is available in the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships. Restrictive Endowment Scholarships Eligibility requirements for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships vary greatly and are restricted in terms of such student characteris\u00ad tics as geographic location, family background, academic major, and career goals. For the most part, these scholarship awards are based on the student's established financial need. All UCI students will be considered for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships based upon information from the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and their current academic records. Regents' Scholarships Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or transfer from community college. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The scholarship is awarded both as an honorarium and a stipend. It may be renewed for an additional one or three years depending on the year of appointment, provided the student completes an average of 12 units per quarter and maintains a grade point average of at least 3.25. The honorarium is awarded without reference to financial need. The amount of the stipend will vary depending on the student's established financial need. Chancellor's Achievement Scholarships Chancellor's Achievement Scholarships are offered to students entering their freshman year and transfer students who show evi\u00ad dence of high scholastic achievement. The scholarship may be renewed for an additional one or three years depending on the year of appointment, provided the student completes an average of 12 units per quarter and maintains a grade point average of at least 3.00. The scholarship is awarded without reference to financial need. National Merit Scholarships UCI is a sponsor o(the National Merit Scholarship.

Financial Aid 35 Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) provides grant aid for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are undergraduate students and have demonstrated financial need. These federal grants range from $100 to $4,000 per year, depend\u00ad ing upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by The Regents of the Univer\u00ad sity of California and by the State of California and provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need and funding levels. Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recipi\u00ad ents with an opportunity to defer the cost of their education by bor\u00ad rowing when needed and paying later. However, loan recipients must pay interest on the amount borrowed. The deferment and can\u00ad cellation provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. A student's loan responsibility, prior to acceptance of the loan, is to understand the terms of the loan. After accepting the loan, the recipient must repay the loan in accordance with the repayment schedule, advise the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships upon leaving UCI; partiCipate in an exit interview; and provide the Financial Services Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total disability, outstanding loan obligations may be canceled upon presentation of official confirming documents. Federal Perkins Loan provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but cannot exceed $4,000 annually for undergraduates and $6,000 annually for graduate students. Cumulative totals for the full term of college attendance may not exceed $20,000 as an undergraduate and $40,000 as a graduate stu\u00ad dent. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load.

This site may be accessed through terminals located in the Center, from the many other on-campus terminals available to students, or via home Internet access. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools is responsible for the admission of new undergraduate freshman and transfer stu\u00ad dents. Inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (949) 824-6703; World Wide Web: http://www.admissions.uci.edu/. The Office is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The information on admission to UCI presented below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission as a Freshman Applicant Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Advanced Placement Credit Application Procedures Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the Gen\u00ad eral Educational Development (GED) Certificate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. The University considers a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular session of a college or university. Students who meet this definition cannot disregard their college record and apply as fresh\u00ad men. To be considered as a California community college trans\u00ad fer applicant to UCI, a student must have completed at least 30 semester units/45 quarter units at one or more California commu\u00ad nity colleges. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent resi\u00ad dence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Non\u00ad resident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly regis\u00ad tered and enrolled at UCI and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See Readmission: Under\u00ad graduate and Graduate Students. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bache\u00ad lor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Califor\u00ad nia is guided by the University's commitment to serve the people of California and the needs of the State, within the framework of the California Master Plan for Higher Education. \u00b7 The University's eligibility requirements follow the guidelines set forth in the Master Plan, which specify that the top one-eighth of the State's high school graduates be eligible for admission to the Undergraduate Admissions 37 University of California. These requirements, described in detail in the Minimum Admission Requirements for Freshmen section, are designed to ensure that all eligible students are adequately pre\u00ad pared for University work. Meeting eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be considered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. In recent years, the number of freshman applicants to UCI has exceeded the number of spaces available. Since the campus cannot admit all eligible applicants, it must use standards that are more demanding than the minimum UC requirements to select students. These standards, which the University calls selection criteria, are used to identify applicants who have demonstrated the highest academic achievement and who have a variety of other qualities that can contribute to the strength and diversity of the campus community. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit a change ofmajor petition. ADMISSIONS SELECTION UCI seeks to select students who have a demonstrated record of academic and personal achievement. The primary criterion for admission to UCI is academic excellence, including the number of college preparatory courses completed; the level of achievement in these courses, including honors, Advanced Placement, Interna\u00ad tional Baccalaureate, and college courses completed; and the qual\u00ad ity of the senior-year program as measured by the type and number of academic courses in progress or planned. Also considered are the high school grade point average calculated on UC-specified subjects (UCI uses a maximum of eight honors grade points in determining the UC GPA) and the required standardized national examinations. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. A secondary criterion in UCI's selection process is personal achievement outside the classroom. A range of pursuits is consid\u00ad ered, including academic activities, the creative and performing arts, community service and leadership, athletics, participation in pre-collegiate programs that develop academic ability, and other extracurricular activities. Persistence counts more than scattered involvement, while initiative and curiosity are also important. The admissions process at UCI is also sensitive to individual cir\u00ad cumstances and the effect these may have had on the resources available to and the experiences of applicants. While all applica\u00ad tions receive careful consideration, reviewers take note of any extenuating circumstances and/or a variety of cultural and eco\u00ad nomic situations, including students who are the first in their fami\u00ad lies to attend college, who have a low family income, or who have worked in support of their family during high school. The empha\u00ad sis, however, is less on the personal circumstances of the applicant and focuses instead on how the applicant has responded to chal\u00ad lenges while achieving academic success. Two or more members of the admissions committee read most applications, and every attempt is made to become familiar with the unique accomplishments of each applicant. Students interested in the majors below should be aware of the fol\u00ad lowing provisions. Dance and Music: Applicants to either Dance or Music must audi\u00ad tion and be selected by faculty. UC IRVINE - 2003-200438 UCI 2003-04 Undergraduate Admissions Engineering: Applicants to any of the Engineering majors must complete four years of high school mathematics, including at least one year beyond intermediate algebra. Computer Science, and Information and Computer Science: The number of applicants that can be admitted to these majors is limited. MINIMUM ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR FRESHMEN The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, or the General Educational Development (GED) examination, and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for admission at the time of high school graduation may be considered after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see Admis\u00ad sion as a Transfer Applicant). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college which conducted the course. The requirements described below represent the minimum acade\u00ad mic standards students must attain to be eligible for admission to the University. Meeting minimum eligibility requirements does not guarantee admission. Admission to UC Irvine and the program of choice often requires students to meet more demanding standards. California Residents There are three paths to satisfying the University's minimum admission requirements for freshmen students: eligibility in the statewide context, eligibility in the local context, and eligibility by examination alone. \u00b7 Eligibility in the Statewide Context Eligibility in the statewide context is the pathway by which most students attain UC eligibility. To be eligible in the statewide con\u00ad text, students must satisfy the Subject, Scholarship, and Examina\u00ad tion Requirements described below. UC Subject Requirement The UC subject requirement consists of several courses from seven core subjects. These required courses are called the \"a through g\" subjects. Students are required to complete 15 \"a through g\" sub\u00ad jects as described below. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.) Also, at least seven of the 15 units must have been earned in courses taken during the last two years of high school. To meet the subject requirement, these courses must appear on a certified course list which is avail\u00ad able in the high schools for California applicants and on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucop.edu/pathways/infoctr. The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants graduating from out-of-State schools. \"a through g\" Course Requirements a. History/Social Science: 2 years required. Two years of his\u00ad tory/social science, including one year of U.S. history or one-half year of U.S. history and one-half year of civics or American gov\u00ad ernment; and one year of world history, cultures, and geography. b.

Labo\u00ad ratory courses in earth sciences are acceptable if they have as prerequisites or provide basic knowledge in biology, chemistry, or physics. Not more than one year of ninth-grade laboratory sci\u00ad ence can be used to meet this requirement. e. Language Other Than English: 2 years required; 3 recom\u00ad mended. Two years of a single language other than English in which there is substantial literature. Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, and composition. (Language other than English courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own. courses. Students are strongly encouraged to complete three or four years of one lan\u00ad guage in preparation for the UCI language other than English breadth requirement.) f. Visual and Performing Arts Discipline (VPA): 1 year required. One year of visual and performing arts chosen from the following: dance, drama/theatre, music, and/or visual art. g.

Explanation of Changes to the Subject Requirement. Begin\u00ad ning with applicants for fall 2004 and fall 2005, students must satisfy the \"f' requirement by completing two semesters of approved arts courses from a single VPA discipline. Beginning with applicants for fall 2006, students must satisfy the \"f' requirement by completing a single year-long approved course from a single VPA discipline. Courses Satisfying the \"g\" Requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political his\u00ad tory, or economic history) and should provide an understanding of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate his\u00ad torical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in journa1ism, speech, debate, or drama is acceptable if it meets the rigor in reading and writing stated above.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Advanced Mathematics: Courses in mathematics with second-year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, pre\u00ad calculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, combinatorics, probability, and statistics are acceptable electives. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elective if it fulfills the following objectives. The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard computer language such as Pascal, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course each student should complete substantial programming pro\u00ad jects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic.\" Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the laboratory activ\u00ad ities should involve an amount of time equivalent to at least one full class period per week. An introductory science course normally offered in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamen\u00ad tal principles of physical and biological science. Laboratory activi\u00ad ties as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Language Other Than English: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the language other than English \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this lan\u00ad guage must have at least two years of the language as prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objec\u00ad tives should include as many of the following as are applicable to the field: (I) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cultures, (2) to examine the historic and con\u00ad temporary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function, (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize quali\u00ad tative and quantitative evidence in the laboratory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational charac\u00ad ter are not acceptable social science electives. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artis\u00ad tic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with dis\u00ad crimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to artistic performance and developing creative artistic ability should have prerequisites (either one year of intro\u00ad ductory course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the introductory level. Undergraduate Admissions 39 Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for exam\u00ad ple, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily athletic, or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. Scholarship Requirement The Scholarship Requirement defines the grade point average (GPA) students must attain in the required \"a-g\" subjects and the SAT I (or ACT) and SAT II scores students must earn to be eligible for admission to the University. Students with a GPA of 2.8 or higher satisfy the minimum Scholar\u00ad ship Requirement if they achieve the test score total indicated in the Eligibility Index. The University calculates the GPA in the \"a-g\" subjects by assign\u00ad ing point values to the grades a student earns, totaling the points, and dividing the total by the number of \"a-g\" course units. Points are assigned as follows: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = I point, and F = 0 points. Only grades the student earns in \"a-g\" subjects in grades-10-12 are used to calculate the GPA. Courses taken in the ninth grade can be used to meet the Subject Requirement if the student earns a grade of C or better, but they will not be used to calculate the GPA. Honors-Level Courses. Advanced Placement courses, higher-level courses offered through the International Baccalaureate Program, courses certified by the University as honors courses, and college courses in the \"a through g\" college preparatory subjects that are transferable are examples of honors-level courses. The University assigns extra grade points for up to four units of honors-level courses taken in the last three years of high school. NOTE: No more than two units of honors-level courses taken in grade 10 may be assigned extra points. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. Grades of D are not assigned extra points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in University-approved honors-level courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, lan\u00ad guage other than English, computer science, social science, and the visual and performing arts. Eligibility in the Local Context Under the Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) pathway, the top four percent of students at each participating California high school are designated UC-eligible and guaranteed admission to one of UC's eight general campuses. To be considered for ELC, students must complete 11 specific units of the Subject Requirement by the end of the junior year. With the assistance of each participating high school, the Univer\u00ad sity will identify the top four percent of students on the basis of GPA in the required course work. The 11 units include: 1 unit of history/social science, 3 units of English, 3 units of mathematics, 1 unit of laboratory science, 1 unit of language other than English, and 2 units chosen from among the other subject requirements. The University will notify ELC students of their status at the beginning of their senior year. Students designated UC-eligible through ELC must submit the University's undergraduate applica\u00ad tion during the November filing period and complete remaining eligibility requirements-including the Subject and Examination Requirements-to enroll. UC IRVINE - 2003-200440 UCI 2003-04 Undergraduate Admissions ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's eight under\u00ad graduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus. Comprehensive information about ELC is available on the Univer\u00ad sity's ELC Web site at http://www.ucop.edu/sas/elc/. Examination Requirements All freshman applicants must submit examination scores as described below. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should complete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that students will take either the Scholastic Assessment Test I or the American College Test in October or November, and will take the Scholastic Assessment Test II in November or December.) Scores from earlier dates will be accepted. Applicants must ensure that reports for all scores have been submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools. The following examinations are required: 1. One Aptitude Test, either: a. The Scholastic Assessment Test I: Reasoning Test (SAT I): the verbal and mathematical reasoning scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting; or b. The American College Test (ACT) composite score and 2. Three Scholastic Assessment Test II: Subject Tests (SAT II) examinations, which must include (a) writing, (b) math, level 1, lC, or 2C, and (c) one from among English literature, language other than English, sciences, or social studies. The SAT II exami\u00ad nation in Literature may not be substituted for the Writing Test. NOTE: Do not use the score choice option to withhold report\u00ad ing of SAT II scores. UC considers only a student's highest SAT II scores so there is no advantage to withholding scores. Eligibility By Examination Alone A student may be able to qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT I is 1,400. (If the ACT is presented, the minimum score is 31.) Also, the student's total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,760 or higher, or at least 1,850 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 530 on any individual SAT II examination. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transfer\u00ad able units prior to admission. The SAT II examinations cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Freshman applicants who qualify for admission by examination alone may be required to present acade\u00ad mic qualifications in addition to the test scores listed above. NOTE: UCI typically does not select students for admission by the examination-alone criteria. Eligibility Index \"a-g\" SAT \"a-g\" SAT [2 x (SAT II writing+ SAT II math + third SAT II)].

UCI considers a California community college transfer applicant as a student who has completed at least 30 semester units/45 quarter units at one or more California community col\u00ad leges. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements.) SELECTION CRITERIA UCI attempts to accommodate as many qualified transfer appli\u00ad cants as possible. Priority consideration for admission of advanced\u00ad standing applicants is given to junior-level applicants (with a mini\u00ad mum of 60 semester/90 quarter units of transferable credit) from California community colleges and is based upon: (1) GPA in transferable courses; (2) depth of preparation toward general edu\u00ad cation and major requirements; and (3) participation in the PAIF (Preliminary Admission-in-the-Field) program. Applicants with the strongest academic performance will be the most competitive for admission. Junior transfers from four-year colleges, including other UC campuses, and lower-division transfers will be considered as space permits. Applicants for fall quarter admission must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by the end of the spring term. Applicants for winter or spring quarter must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by summer or fall terms, respectively. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must submit a change of major petition. This is of particular importance to those who apply in majors which are subject to additional course prerequisites and/or have a limit placed on the number of appli\u00ad cants admitted into the major. (See the following list.) Some transfer applicants are selected based upon consideration of the academic criteria in conjunction with the following personal achievement criteria: an exceptionally challenging curriculum; out\u00ad standing accomplishments relevant to academic aims; hardships or unusual circumstances the applicant has faced, and the ways in which the student has responded to these challenges; a strong, thoughtful match between UCI's programs and the student's acade\u00ad mic and career objectives, preparation, talents, and skills; and potential contributions to the campus. The level of performance needed to gain admission varies from year to year depending on UC IRVINE - 2003-2004the size and the academic quality of the applicant pool and the number of enrollment spaces. Transfer applicants to the majors listed below must complete pre\u00ad requisite courses for the major as specified. Applied Ecology: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Applied Ecology major.

Programming-only courses in Basic, Fortran, Cobal, Pascal, and C are not acceptable. There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted into the majors. NOTE: It is strongly recommended that transfer students enter the ICS orCS major with knowledge of Java, as it is used in most pro\u00ad gramming-related courses. The lower-division requirements consist of five courses which must be taken in a certain order and which are prerequisite for upper-division courses. Students who transfer to UCI in need of completing any part of this sequence may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degree. Mathematics: Junior-level applicants with the highest grades over\u00ad all and who satisfactorily complete course prerequisites will be given preference for admission to the Mathematics major. All applicants must complete one year of approved calculus. Music: Applicants must audition and be selected by faculty.

All applicants must com\u00ad plete the following required courses: one year of calculus-based physics with laboratory for engineering and physics majors, and one year of approved calculus. UC IRVINE - 2003-200442 UCI 2003-04 Undergraduate Admissions TRANSFER STUDENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The University of California requirements for admission as a trans\u00ad fer applicant vary according to the high school record. Transfer applicants who have completed a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency or the equivalent must also meet regular University entrance requirements. Transfer applicants should also refer to the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average of 2.00 or better in all transferable course work. A transfer applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. Students who were eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school-meaning they satisfied the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination Requirements or were identified by the University during their senior year in high school as eligible under the Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program-are eligible to transfer if they have a C (2.0) average in their transferable college course work. 2. Students who met the Scholarship Requirement but did not sat\u00ad isfy the Subject Requirement must take transferable college courses in the subjects they are missing, earn a grade of C or better in each of these required courses, and earn an overall C (2.0) average in all transferable college course work to be eligible to transfer. 3. Students who were not eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school because they did not meet the Scholarship Requirement must: a. Complete 60 semester units or 90 quarter units of transferable college credit with a grade point average of at least 2.4 (no more than 14 semester units or 21 quarter units may be taken Pass/Not Pass), and b. Complete the following course pattern requirement, earning a grade of C or better in each course: i. Two transferable college courses (3 semester or 4:-5 quarter units each) in English composition; and ii. One transferable college course (3 semester or 4:-5 quarter units) in mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning; and iii. Four transferable college courses (3 semester or 4:-5 quar\u00ad ter units each) chosen from at least two of the following sub\u00ad ject areas: the arts and humanities, the social and behavorial sciences, the physical and biological sciences. NOTE: For UCI, in fulfilling items i and ii, the courses in English and mathematics should be completed no later than the following term: Applicants for: Fall Winter Spring_ Courses must be completed by: Spring term Summer term Fall term ADMISSION FOR A SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A student whose educational objective has changed substantially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admis\u00ad sion to a program for a second degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission available from the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission requirements for applicants who are not California resi\u00ad dents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. How\u00ad ever, all nonresident freshman and transfer applicants are subject to the same selection criteria as California residents, as explained in a previous section. Refer to the Expenses and Fees section for infor\u00ad mation regarding residence classification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN APPLICANT A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a region\u00ad ally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination; (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f' pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test either the SAT I (verbal and mathematical scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score, and three SAT II examinations which must include (a) writing, (b) math, Ievell, lC, or 2C, and (c) one from among English litera\u00ad ture, language other than English, sciences, or social studies; (the SAT II examination in Literature may not be substituted for the Writing test); and (5) meet the Eligibility Index for nonresidents (as shown below): \"a-g\" GPA Range 3.50 score] + [2 x (SAT II Writing score + SAT II Mathematics score + third required SAT II score)]. SAT I composite is highest combined mathematics and verbal scores from a single sitting. Highest individual SAT II scores, from any sitting, will be considered. An ACT to SAT I con\u00ad version table may be used to substitute for a SAT I score. To be considered for admission by examination alone, a nonresi\u00ad dent applicant must score either 1,400 on the SAT I or 31 on the ACT. The total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,850 or higher with a score of at least 530 on each test. NONRESIDENT TRANSFER APPLICANT The minimum admission requirements for nonresident transfer applicants are the same as those for residents, except that nonresi\u00ad dents must have a grade point average of 2.8 or higher in all trans\u00ad ferable college course work. ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a stu\u00ad dent who hol<;!s or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. The application should be submitted to the University of California Undergraduate Application Processing Service early in the appropriate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the neces\u00ad sary passport visa. Official certificates and detailed transcripts of UC IRVINE - 2003-2004records should be submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools only when requested. International applicants whose native language is not English will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum score of 550 (paper\u00ad based) or 213 (computer-based) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA; telephone (609) 771-7100; World Wide Web: http://www.toefl.org/. Students must ask the Educational Testing\u00b7 Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Comple\u00ad tion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency require\u00ad ment for international applicants. Students who wish to improve their English proficiency to meet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in Eng\u00ad lish as a Second Language sponsored by UCI Extension. Informa\u00ad tion is available from English and Certificate Programs for Interna\u00ad tionals, UCI Extension, P.O. Box 6050, Irvine, CA 92616-6050; telephone (949) 824-5591. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score, all international students whose native language is other than English must take an Academic English/English as a Second Language Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in Academic English/English as a Second Language courses during their first year, with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Univer\u00ad sity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. Interna\u00ad tional students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are consid\u00ad ered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay nonresi\u00ad dent tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY OF PERMANENT RESIDENT, REFUGEE, AND INTERNATIONAL {F-1 VISA) STUDENTS: ACADEMIC ENGLISH/ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE Any student (a) whose first or native language is not English, (b) who has not satisfied the Universitywide Subject A requirement, and (c) whose score on the verbal portion of the SAT I is 430 or less, or any such student without a verbal SAT I score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score or TSWE (Test of Standard Written English) score, take an Academic English/English as a Second Language Placement Test (AE/ESLPT) prior to the first quarter of enroll\u00ad ment. Also, any student who is identified as an ESL student through the Universitywide Subject A Examination must take the AE/ESLPT. The test is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Welcome Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction, and on dates to be announced. Information is available from the Testing Office (telephone 949-824-6207) and the Office of Academic English/English as a Second Language (telephone 949-824-6781 ). Based upon the results of the test, students may be required to enroll in AE/ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writing courses. Students required to enroll in AE/ESL courses must begin satisfying their AE/ESL requirements within their first Undergraduate Admissions 43 or second quarter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecu\u00ad tive quarters. The AE/ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the AE/ESL requirements by the end of their sixth quarter will be inel\u00ad igible to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject A must be sat\u00ad isfied during the quarter following the completion of AE/ESL requirements. If the AE/ESL requirements are completed during the first quarter of enrollment, the Subject A requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the fourth quarter of enrollment. AE/ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities and listed in the School's section of this Catalogue, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. CREDIT FOR AEIESL COURSE WORK Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for AE/ESL course work. Students rnay receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. CREDIT FOR NATIVE LANGUAGE Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Some restrictions apply; see the School of Humanities section for information. Advanced Placement Credit Students who earn scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations will receive credit toward grad\u00ad uation at UCI. The unit and subject credit allowed toward degree requirements assigned to each test are shown in the chart on pages 44-45. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Place\u00ad ment credit. Students who elect to enroll in courses for which they have already received Advanced Placement credit will have those courses specially coded on their transcript without unit or grade credit. However, if a student receives less than full series credit (i.e., 8 units of credit for a 12-unit series such as Art History 40A, 40B, 40C or 4 units of credit for an 8-unit series such as Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B), the student may elect to take the final course in the series for credit.

International Baccalaureate Students completing the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive 30 quarter units (20 semes\u00ad ter units) total toward their UC undergraduate degree. The University grants 8 quarter units units (51/3 semester units) credit for certified IB Higher Level examinations on which a stu\u00ad dent scores 5, 6, or 7. The University does not grant credit for Stan\u00ad dard Level examinations. Some Higher Level examinations may be considered equivalent to freshman level courses in the subject and may be used to satisfy breadth requirements. Contact the Office of Admissions and Rela\u00ad tions with Schools for more information on how subject credit may be granted. The units granted for IB examinations are not counted toward the maximum number of credits required for formal declaration of an undergraduate major or the maximum number of units a students may accumulate prior to graduation from the University. Students who enter the University with IB credit do not have to declare a major earlier than other students nor are they required to graduate earlier. Application Procedures Application packets for undergraduate admission to the University are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, from any University of California Admissions Office, or on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucop. edu/pathways/. Students applying for admission to UCI should complete the appli\u00ad cation and submit it according to the instructions provided in the Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarships. A nonrefundable application fee of $40 must accompany the applica\u00ad tion. This basic fee entitles the applicant to be considered at one campus; for each additional campus selected, an additional $40 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application procedure questions specific to UCI should communicate directly with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (949) 824-6703; World Wide Web: http://www.admissions.uci.edu/. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. WHEN TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other University campuses) and the student's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be filed during the priority filing period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Additionally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Completing the examination requirement (SAT I or ACT and three SAT II exami\u00ad nations) no later than the December testing date of the senior year of high school is required for students applying for the fall quarter. Quarter to be Admitted at UCI Winter quarter, 2004 Spring quarter, 2004 Fall quarter, 2004 Winter quarter, 2005 Spring quarter, 2005 Priority Application Filing Dates File July 1-30, 2003 File October 1-30, 2003 File November 1-30, 2003 File July 1-30, 2004 File October 1-30, 2004 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. Students are advised to check with the Admissions Office to find out if applications are being accepted for winter or spring terms. ADDING A CAMPUS If the campus or campuses being considered are still accepting applications, students may, after submitting their application,. add additional campus choice(s) to that or those initially listed on their application. A $40 fee for each additional campus will be required. Students should contact the Admissions Office on the campus to be added for information on which programs are still open and the procedures for adding campuses. Students should be aware that processing an additional campus choice will take several weeks before the new campus actually receives the application and data. Students should also be aware that special program commitments, such as the Educational Oppor\u00ad tunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program may vary from campus to campus. Students can communicate with the Housing Office or Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships UC IRVINE - 2003-200446 UCI 2003-04 Undergraduate Admissions directly for information about deadlines, priorities, and availability of these services. TRANSCRIPTS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Freshman Applicants. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Applicants are also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the SAT I or ACT tests and three SAT II examinations to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. An official final high school transcript showing an official graduation date also must be forwarded to the campus at which the student has decided to register and enroll. Official final transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for fall quarter. Those students entering in the winter or spring quarters must have their transcripts in the Office within one month of the completion of the term of the school from which they entered. A California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a Gen\u00ad eral Education Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Transfer Applicants. Transfer students should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. It is essential that applicants accurately complete the self-reported college credit information in the appli\u00ad cation because it will be used for initial admission screening. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UC/, an official tran\u00ad script from each college attended and the high school from which they graduated must be sent to the Office of Admissions and Rela\u00ad tions with Schools. Unless a student is attending a summer session, final official transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for the fall quarter. Summer-session transcripts must be submitted by September 15. Students entering UCI in the winter or spring quarters must have their final official transcripts sent to the Office no later than one month after completion of the term of the school they are currently attending. Delays in receiving official transcripts will disadvantage students in the academic advising process and can affect enrollment in appropriate courses. EXAMINATION ARRANGEMENTS Students should make arrangements to take the SAT I and SAT II examinations with the Educational Testing Service, College Board/ATP, CN 6200, Princeton, NJ 08541-6200; World Wide Web: http://cbweb l.collegeboard.org. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, IA 52243. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not to the University.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is important to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the applica\u00ad tion for admission and the test materials. In 2003-04 the SAT I and SAT II are offered concurrently on the following Saturday mornings: October 11, 2003; November 1, 2003; December 6, 2003; January 24, 2004; March 27, 2004 (SAT I only); May 1, 2004; and June 5, 2004. In 2003-04 the ACT is offered on the following dates: September 27, 2003; October 25, 2003; December 13, 2003; February 7, 2004; April 3, 2004; and June 12, 2004. Details on testing are available from the College Board, the Ameri\u00ad can College Testing Program, and from most high school counsel\u00ad ing offices. NOTIFICATION OF ADMISSION Most fall quarter freshmen applicants are notified of their status between March 1 and 31. Transfer applicants are usually notified by May I. In some cases for transfer applicants, complete tran\u00ad scripts of course work are required before\u00b7 a final decision can be made; such records will be requested by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall priority filing period (November 1-30). Those students who apply after the priority period will be notified as soon as possible after March 31. Statement of Intent to Register Students who wish to attend UCI must return a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR). The SIR serves to notify each campus of the stu\u00ad dent's decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before completing and returning their SIR, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their response to each campus. However, it is essential that students allow enough time to meet the stipulated deadline. Once they have decided which campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonrefund\u00ad able $100 deposit (if applicable) either electronically or by mail. Students must submit their SIR by the following deadline: Freshmen entering fall 2003: May I, 2003 Transfers entering fall 2003: June 1, 2003 Freshmen and transfers entering winter 2004: October 15, 2003 Freshmen and transfers entering spring 2004: refer to the spe\u00ad cific date on their admit letter Electronic Filing: Students may return their SIR electronicaliy by accessing the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools (OARS) Web site at http://www.admissions.uci.edu/status. Students submitting an SIR electronically are required to pay their $100 Acceptance of Admission Fee by credit card. Filing by Mail: Students may download and print an SIR from the Admissions and Relations with Schools Web site to submit, if they prefer. Students must return the printed SIR along with the $100 Acceptance of Admission Fee (if requested), made payable to UC Regents, to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075. Students who are not able to either submit their SIR electronically or download an SIR from the OARS Web site should contact Admissions and Relations with Schools at the address listed above and/or call (949) 824-6703. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Student Records Access and Disclosure At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"student\" at the time of submis\u00ad sion of the SIR. Information regarding access to student records and disclosure of student record information (both public and con\u00ad fidential) may be found in the Appendix. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004INFORMATION FOR ADMITTED STUDENTS ORIENTATION Each May information about UCI's orientation programs sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Students is sent to applicants for admission who plan to enroll in the fall. Student-Parent Orientation Programs (SPOP) are held at differ\u00ad ent times during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new stu\u00ad dents with their registration materials and offers informative ses\u00ad sions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in resi\u00ad dence halls, and the program fee covers room, board, and program\u00b7 costs. Mini-SPOPs (intensive one-day events) are held in July for students and parents who are unable to attend the multi-day pro\u00ad grams. For more information, telephone (949) 824-7759 or send e\u00ad mail to jhalvaks@uci.edu. Transfer Orientation is a unique one-day program geared to the needs of transfer students. Held in early August, the program pro\u00ad vides advising, access to campus resources, a graduate school preparation workshop, and more. Welcome Week features a variety of academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter class.es. DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION The core mission of the Division of Undergraduate Education is to provide campus leadership, programs, and services which enhance the quality of undergraduate education at UCI. An advocate and steward for educational excellence, the Division works with all academic units, programs, and members of the UCI community to foster a climate of learning and discovery for every undergraduate student. Through its diverse and innovative programs and services, the Division provides support for student academic achievement, for a rich and coherent curriculum, and for outstanding teaching through the integration of teaching and research activities and the facilitation of effective pedagogy. The Division of Undergraduate Education is responsible for the following programs and services: the Campuswide Honors Pro\u00ad gram, which also administers the Scholarship Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram; the Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program and the International Opportunities Program; the Peer Academic Advising Program and academic advising for Undecided/Undeclared students; the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; the Learning and Academic Resource Center; Student Academic Advancement Services; the Testing Office; the Instructional Resources Center and the Instruc\u00ad tional Technology Center; administration of the UCDC Academic Internship Program; and the organization of the campus' student orientation programs in cooperation with the Division of Student Affairs. The Division's programs and services are described in detail below. The Division is responsible for the administration of the revised Academic Honesty Policy (adopted by the UCI Academic Senate on December 12, 1996; see the Appendix) as it relates to under\u00ad graduates; for maintaining a classroom environment conducive to teaching and learning; and for implementing the Student Recom\u00ad mended Faculty Program, initiated at UCI in 1969. This is the only such program in the U.S. that affords undergraduates the opportu\u00ad nity to identify, select, and propose recruitment of nonrenewable faculty appointments in curricular areas of particular interest not represented at UCI. Call (949) 824-8658 for information. Additionally, the Division's Research, Evaluation, and Grants Office evaluates various programs and conducts research on topics related to undergraduate education such as student retention, acad\u00ad emic needs, course grades, enrollment patterns, and curricular issues, and also assists in developing grant proposals related to improvement of undergraduate education. Placement Testing UCI's Testing Office administers placement tests to new and con\u00ad tinuing students to ensure correct placement in selected introduc\u00ad tory courses and to help students assess their readiness for Univer\u00ad sity-level work. These tests are selected or developed by UCI faculty who also determine the grading criteria for each test. Results from placement tests are used by students and their acade\u00ad mic counselors to formulate a plan of study which is best suited to the students' learning needs and career goals and to determine enrollment in introductory courses. Additional information, such as entrance examination scores, Advanced Placement (AP) scores, and high school work, also may be used to determine course \u00b7 placement. Placement tests are given in the areas of chemistry, physics, precal\u00ad culus, mathematical analysis, Chinese, German, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Academic English/English as a Second Language: I. Chemistry Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in an introductory chemistry course (Chemistry IP, IA, or H2A) are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 2. Physics Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Physics 7 A or 7B are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. Students with no background in Physics need not take the place\u00ad ment test and should enroll in Physics 7 A. 3. Precalculus Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics 2A are required to take this test unless otherwise exempt. 4. Mathematical Analysis Test. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics 1A or 1B, or who have not had a prior course in precalculus and who plan to enroll in mathematics courses at UCI are strongly encouraged to take this test. 5. Chinese Placement Test. Students who plan to enroll in Chinese 1A, lB, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, or 3C are required to take this test.

Scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Lan\u00ad guage (TOEFL) and the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE) are not considered. The AE!ESL Placement Test also is required of students referred to the AEIESL Program on the basis of their score on the Universitywide Subject A Examina\u00ad tion. See the section on Admission of International Students for additional information. All newly admitted freshmen will receive a detailed brochure describing the placement tests and the testing schedule for the summer. Students should take required tests before registering for classes and should discuss their results with an academic counselor or faculty advisor. Students enrolling for the first time in fall quar\u00ad ter are strongly advised to take placement tests at the earliest possi\u00ad ble date (usually in June) in order to allow time to receive their results and discuss them with an academic counselor during the summer registration period and prior to enrolling in courses. For the convenience of continuing students, placement tests also are administered every quarter during the academic year; consult the Schedule of Classes for dates. The Testing Office also administers language tests for exemption to the Language Other Than English breadth requirement, and is responsible for the campus-based administration of the Subject A examination. Further information on placement and language testing may be obtained by calling (949) 824-6207 or by visiting the Office's Web site at http://www.testingoffice.uci.edu/. The Office is a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education. University Subject A Examination The University of California system has established the University\u00ad wide Subject A Examination (see University Requirements). Results from this examination are used to place students in UCI writing and, if needed, AEIESL courses. There is a $60 nonrefund\u00ad able administrative fee associated with the examination. The fee payment process and waiver information are explained in materials students receive in April from the Educational Testing Service. Students who receive admission application fee waivers will auto\u00ad matically have this exam fee waived. Please refer to the section on Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree for complete information on the Universitywide Subject A Examination. Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate student is assigned to the school or program that offers the student's selected major. Students who have indicated \"Undecided/Undeclared\" as a major on their UC Application for Admission receive assistance from the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program until they select an academic major. This program is located in 256 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-6987. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and acade\u00ad mic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or depart\u00ad ment to which a student is assigned or, in the case of undecided/ undeclared majors, with the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Each academic unit provides academic advising for its students and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change majors. Stu\u00ad dents are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. While each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising, these systems differ from unit to unit. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper-division students) assist students in many of the same areas as academic counselors. In addition, they are able to answer ques\u00ad tions relating to student life issues, providing a student perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advi\u00ad sors rests with the dean or chair of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; however, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or chair. Telephone numbers for academic advising offices are listed in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue and in the Schedule of Classes. New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an academic counselor shortly after being admitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the stu\u00ad dent determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the pro\u00ad posed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the requirements for graduation. In some schools and programs, consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, students are responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with their assigned faculty advisor. The actual frequency of these meet\u00ad ings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to registration for advice concerning UC IRVINE - 2003-2004class enrollment. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Finish in Four Advising Many UCI entering freshmen graduate in four years, with appro\u00ad priate planning. Students who wish to be assured of earning their degree in a timely manner should contact the academic counseling office for their major to receive information about Finish-in-Four Advising and assistance in developing a detailed curricular plan. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores, who are uncertain about their major, and who wish to explore, experi\u00ad ment, and then decide, participate in the Undecided/Undeclared Advising Program administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. The Division is devoted to enriching the learning envi\u00ad ronment for lower-division students, especially those in the fresh\u00ad man year. Further information is available in the Majors and Careers section of this Catalogue. Learning and Academic Resource Center The Learning and Academic Resource Center (LARC) is a cam\u00ad puswide academic support unit that provides programs designed to help students acquire the skills needed to develop intellectually, become successful learners, and achieve their ac.ademic and profes\u00ad sional goals. LARC staff and programs provide students with personal contact and support necessary for academic success on a large and diverse campus where students need to enroll in many large lecture courses. The Center works closely with faculty to develop pro\u00ad grams that meet both curricular objectives and the changing needs of students. LARC programs stress the development of academic abilities that all university students need regardless of major: effec\u00ad tive study strategies, critical reading, and analytical writing. Other programs focus on specific disciplines and offer students the opportunity to improve their academic skills in such areas as biol\u00ad ogy, chemistry, mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and com\u00ad puter sciences, among others. The Center offers adjunct classes, workshops, individual counsel\u00ad ing, small peer tutoring groups, and support in all forms of acade\u00ad mic writing. Students may enroll in LARC programs through TELE or by calling (949) 824-6451 to make appointments. Additional information including schedules for adjunct classes, workshops, and tutorials may be obtained online at http://www.larc.uci.edu/. Writing Workshops, sponsored by the Division of Undergraduate Education, seek to provide in-depth writing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to newly admitted students who may find English and Comparative Literature WR39A difficult because of insufficiencies in their University preparation. This assistance addresses specific compositional weaknesses and endeavors to pro\u00ad vide students, at an early stage of their course work, with neces\u00ad sary verbal skills. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of English and Comparative Literature 1 WR39A. The Writing Workshops enable instructors to give inten\u00ad sive and individualized attention to students. Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS) provides indi\u00ad vidual counseling and academic support for students who are first\u00ad generation college students or low-income students, as well as dis\u00ad abled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). SAAS sponsors several major projects and a variety of workshops. Division of Undergraduate Education 49 Aprimary responsibility of SAAS is to monitor the academic progress of its students. To best assist students who are having dif\u00ad ficulty with their course work, professional counselors maintain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, referrals to other campus support services are provided. In conjunction with these academic and service units, a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by SAAS, as well as a graduate school preparatory course for those students whose career interests require graduate study. SAAS also sponsors and conducts the Summer Bridge at UCI for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. Summer Bridge is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to successfully com\u00ad plete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with Student Acad\u00ad emic Advancement Services; telephone (949) 824-6234. Additional information is available online at http://www.saas.uci.edu/. Honors Opportunities UCI offers several challenging honors opportunities to its most motivated students. These include a comprehensive Campuswide Honors Program, which enrolls outstanding students from all majors from the freshman through senior years; a variety of major\u00ad specific honors programs at the upper-division level; the Humani\u00ad ties Honors Program, also offered at the upper-division level, but open to all majors on campus; and several Excellence in Research programs. These programs offer some of the advantages usually associated with selective liberal arts colleges: rigorous, small, personalized classes and the intellectual exchange that creates a community of scholars. The difference, however, is that UCI's programs have the support and benefit of the 30.5-million-volume University of Cali\u00ad fornia Library system (of which UCI Library collections number some 2.2 million volumes) and of the numerous state-of-the-art laboratories on campus. Honors students are also encouraged to participate in the Education Abroad Program, the International Opportunities Program, or the UCDC Academic Internship Program during their junior or senior year. These programs are described in a later section. Campuswide Honors Program Founded in 1988, the Campuswide Honors Program (CHP) is available to selected high-achieving students in all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. It maintains an active roster of approximately 600 students. About 90 percent of CHP students have continued their studiej after graduation from UCI at the most prestigious graduate and professional schools in the country. CHP provides outstanding UCI students with a special curriculum consisting of small, seminar-style classes, close interaction with peers, mentorship by UCI's top faculty, and the opportunity to par\u00ad ticipate in undergraduate research. Students also receive assistance in applying for scholarships, internships, education abroad, and rel\u00ad evant work experience. Completion of the Campus wide Honors Program is noted on the student's transcript and baccalaureate diploma. Admission to the program as an incoming UCI freshman is by invi\u00ad tation only; all eligible candidates are reviewed and selected by faculty representatives from each academic unit. Transfer and other students are eligible to apply for admission to CHP up until the first quarter of their junior year, if they have a minimum grade point average of 3.5. CHP seeks to admit students who have a demonstrated passion for learning, a willingness to explore and take risks, a focus within their primary area of interest, and, at the UC IRVINE - 2003-200450 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students same time, academic excellence in a range of disciplines outside of their major area. Students pursue three year-long interdisciplinary Honors core courses (one course per quarter), satisfying several categories of the breadth requirement. Many of these courses provide an inter\u00ad disciplinary approach to major subjects and issues. Faculty from a variety of disciplines are chosen especially for their teaching abil\u00ad ity and scholarship. During their junior and senior years, partici\u00ad pants pursue original research under the direct supervision of fac\u00ad ulty members, culminating in the production of an honors thesis, creative project, or publication-quality paper. Many CHP students also participate in major-specific honors programs. The senior hon\u00ad ors thesis that is developed and produced through these programs satisfies the CHP thesis requirement. CHP students begin their course of study by taking honors sections of the Humanities Core Course. Team-taught by professors from various disciplines in the School of Humanities, the Humanities Core Course is organized around major themes; the current focus is Laws and Orders: Humanities and the Regulation of Society. Faculty from a wide range of disciplines exemplify the ways in which humanists approach issues from philosophical, historical, and cultural perspectives. In small discussion sections, students put those perspectives into practice in their own writing and in class\u00ad room conversations and debates designed to engage each student intellectually in the examination of law and the regulation of society. A new sequence beginning fall 2003, Humanities 3, may serve as an option for the Humanities Core Course for some students. This honors option must be approved by the Director of CHP and may be appropriate for majors with unusual scheduling difficulties as well as students who enter CHP after the freshman year. It is not usually completed the freshman year. The sequence introduces stu\u00ad dents to fundamental approaches to the humanities: the study of lit\u00ad erary and visual representations, philosophical theories, and histor\u00ad ical evidence. This is accomplished by looking in different ways at how human beings develop, pursue, depict, and think about their desires and ambitions. While concentrating on major works from the Western tradition, the course also contrasts them to selected works from other cultures. The Critical Issues in the Social Sciences sequence is team-taught by professors from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Topics include human vision; authority (dis)obedience, and human society; decisions and compromises and their rewards and penalties; human language and its disablement; and exotic soci- eties (including our own). \u00b7 The Idiom and Practiee of Science interdisciplinary sequence explores the role science plays in addressing socially significant problems. Students develop the ability to understand scientific models and to judge the content, merit, and limitations of many issues of science in the modern world. The development of analyti- . cal and writing skills is emphasized. Topics have included earth\u00ad quakes, chemistry in the environment, radiation/radioactivity, evo\u00ad lution/aging, the mathematics of power, biodiversity/conservation, genetic plant engineering, and calculus. CHP students are eligible to participate in other lower-division Honors courses on the campus, along with other qualified students. These include the following courses: Honors General Chemistry covers the same material as Chemistry lA-B-C, but in greater depth. Honors Organic Chemistry, designed for Chemistry and Biology majors and anyone else interested in a research career, offers a smaller class size and the opportunity for interactions and experi\u00ad ences not possible in the larger Chemistry 51 series. It is usually taken in the sophomore year, after completion of the General Chemistry lecture and laboratory sequence. Honors Calculus, especially recommended for prospective Mathe\u00ad matics majors and others with a particular interest in mathematics, covers the same material as Mathematics 2D-E, but with greater emphasis on the theoretical structure of the subject matter. The Honors Introduction to Computer Science sequence is open to CHP students majoring in Information and Computer Science and other students by consent. The first course introduces basic con\u00ad cepts, fundamental laws a:nd principles of software and hardware organization, program construction, applications, and policy and social issues. The second course covers in-depth concepts of pro\u00ad gramming and mathematical tools for analyzing programs, and the third builds on this background with respect to mathematical tools and analysis. Extracurricular Activities. CHP students are invited to participare in many social and cultural activities, including weekly coffee hours, beach bonfires, poetry readings, faculty home visits/infor\u00ad mal lectures, movie and play nights, trips to museums, and camp\u00ad ing retreats. Honors students also produce a quarterly free-form creative writing journal, and continuing Honors students may volunteer for the Peer Mentor Program and Honors Ambassador Program, providing assistance to incoming Honors students. On-Campus Housing. CHP students are guaranteed on-campus housing, as long as they meet the Housing procedures and dead\u00ad lines. Freshmen may choose to live in Middle Earth in \"The Shire,\" or in Mesa Court in \"Lorna.\" Sophomores and upper-division stu\u00ad dents who wish to live in Honors housing may also select one of the four Honors houses in Arroyo Vista. These residences offer a valuable living/learning experience with other Honors students and the community spirit that is a special feature of CHP. Students bring to the living experience their vitality, creativity, and dynamic dedication to learning. Activities have included get-togethers with Honors faculty, staff, and students; international potlucks; off-cam\u00ad pus retreats; study breaks; and other events such as workshops and special speakers geared toward the interests of the residents.

Center for International Education The Center for International Education (CIE) includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP). CIE is a comprehensive resource and counseling center which helps students take advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, volunteering, research, and non-credentialed teaching, and prepares students for participation in these programs. Participating in an international educational experience typically introduces students to ways of thinking different from their own, broadens their understan\u00b7ding of the historical and contemporary world, sharpens their interest in particular fields, enhances their overall intellectual development, and prepares them for a career in this globally interconnected society. Professional staff and international peer advisors, who have returned from an lOP or EAP experience, are available to guide students in making appropriate choices of international programs for their educational goals. All EAP and lOP participants are pro\u00ad vided with pre-departure orientations, an EAP or lOP Student Guide handbook, and reentry orientations upon their return to UCI. Students can keep up-to-date on CIE events, deadlines, and new international opportunities by subscribing to the biweekly elec\u00ad tronic newsletter, CIE-NEWS. For information on how to subscribe, contact CIE. CIE, EAP, and lOP are located in 1100 Student Services II; tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6343; e-mail: cie@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.cie.uci.edu/. EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia offers students the opportunity to experience a different cul\u00ad ture while making progress toward degree objectives. EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with about 140 host universities and colleges in more than 30 countries throughout the world. One quarter's participation in EAP fulfills the International/Global Issues breadth requirement (category VII\u00ad B). Participation in selected EAP programs also may satisfy the Language Other Than English breadth requirement (category VI); see an EAP counselor for a list of approved programs. EAP offers four types of programs: (1) Full Immersion Programs. UC students take regular classes at the host university, in the lan\u00ad guage of the host country, side-by-side with native students. This option is available in many English-speaking and non-English\u00ad speaking countries, and students typically take classes in their major or related fields; (2) Language and Culture Programs. These are designed for students at beginning or intermediate language levels for the purpose of learning or improving language skills. UC students normally take classes side-by-side with other foreign stu\u00ad dents learning the language of the host country; (3) Programs for lower-division breadth. These programs are designed primarily to allow students to complete lower-division breadth requirements while experiencing another culture. Some other types of courses may also be available. Currently these programs are offered in English; and (4) Special Focus Programs. EAP offers a number of programs with a specific, limited academic focus, for example, Tropical Biology in Costa Rica, and Global Studies in Japan. The courses and fields of study open to EAP participants vary at each center. Each of the host universities has special areas of excellence and strength, as described in brochures for each country which are available at CIE and online at http://www.eap.ucop.edu/. Interested students can search the historical database of courses at http://eap.ucop.edu/coursefinder/. Admission of UC students to the Education Abroad programs is subject to several qualifications. All applicants must demonstrate well-defined goals and a clear academic plan for integrating EAP studies into their UC degree program. Other requirements vary by program. Prerequisites generally include a 2.5 to 3.0 GPA, depend\u00ad ing on the program. Some programs also require one to two years of university-level training in the host country's language. See the EAP Web site at http://www.eap.ucop.edu/ or individual program brochures for specific details. University of California faculty who serve as directors and associ\u00ad ate directors at most Study Centers provide academic counsel to students while abroad. Full credit is granted for courses satisfacto\u00ad rily completed, and courses are recorded on official UC transcripts. With careful planning, most EAP students make normal progress toward their UC degrees.

UC IRVINE - 2003-200454 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students toward major or graduation requirements is determined by the aca\u00ad demic unit in which the participant's major is offered. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institutions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. Classes in the natural and physical sciences, engineering, and computer science are available at many prestigious host institutions. In addition, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country, as well as experience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is often comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for the same fees as they pay at UCI, including UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books, and per\u00ad sonal expenses. The only additional costs directly related to the program are for their round-trip transportation and orientation and intensive language program (depending on the Study Center). All University of California financial aid (other than work-study), including grants, scholarships, and loans, is available to EAP stu\u00ad dents who qualify. EAP also offers need-based scholarships to both financial aid recipients and non-financial aid recipients. Contact CIE for additional information. Applications for EAP are generally due one year prior to the expected time of departure. Students may participate in EAP as sophomores, juniors, or seniors (fourth-or fifth-year), and may apply as early as their freshman year. In addition, students who have completed at least one full year of graduate study and who have support of their academic department and graduate dean may apply. Students interested in EAP should contact CIE early in the fall quarter to obtain an informative brochure, application forms, and information concerning application deadlines. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM UCI's International Opportunities Program (lOP) is the link between UCI students and any international educational experience that occurs outside the boundaries of the U.S. and is not a part of the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP). Any UCI student (undergraduate, graduating senior, or graduate) in good academic standing, regardless of major, class level, or foreign language abil\u00ad ity, may participate in lOP. CIE staff provide information and counseling to assist students in finding an appropriate program to meet their needs and interests. Students may choose from academic study (with transferable credit), paid work, paid or unpaid internships, unpaid or compensated vol\u00ad unteer service, field research, and paid teaching opportunities in . nearly every country in the world. This includes all academic pro\u00ad grams sponsored by U.S. institutions that occur on foreign soil or water (as in the case of the Semester at Sea program), direct enroll\u00ad ment at foreign institutions, summer session abroad programs through UCI and other UC campuses, and UCI Independent Study (199) done in foreign countries under the supervision of a UCI fac\u00ad ulty member. With careful planning lOP students participating in study programs can make progress toward their UCI degree by fulfilling major, minor, or breadth requirements. Students may apply for transfer credit and UCI financial aid by completing the International Study Advance Contract. Many scholarships are also available. To acquaint students with opportunities abroad, lOP sponsors the annual Go Abroad Fair and periodic presentations, orientations, \u00b7 and workshops. It also maintains a library of international resources and publications listing opportunities abroad. REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE There are four groups of requirements that must be met to earn a baccalaureate degree from UCI: general UC requirements, UCI requirements, school or program requirements, and degree-specific requirements.

UCI Requirements UNIT REQUIREMENT Credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work is required. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. GRADE REQUIREMENT A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required (1) over\u00ad all, (2) in all of the courses required for the major program, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors pro\u00ad grams. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major (or programs, in the case of an interdisciplinary or interdepartmental major). A major can include additional courses required for the major in this set, with the approval of the Council on Education Policy. In this case, the list of additional courses is published in the Catalogue with the requirements for the major. RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT At least 36 of the final 45 units completed by a student for the bachelor's degree must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program, the UCDC Academic Internship Program, or the International Opportunities Program with International Study Advance Contract. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Among the many possible purposes for breadth requirements, the one that stands out at UCI is that of introducing students to the basic modes of thought that characterize academic disciplines. In order to know ourselves and the world, we need to know first the ways these can and have been known. Thus the breadth require\u00ad ment at UCI requires students to devote a substantial amount of their course work, especially in their first years, to connected series of courses which provide a coherent experience within such areas UC IRVINE - 2003-200456 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students UCI's 16-acre Aldrich Park in the center of campus is crisscrossed with many tree-lined pathways. as the natural and social sciences, humanistic inquiry and the arts, and the nature of symbolic systems. Several other aims that UCI regards as especially desirable are con\u00ad sistent with this chief purpose and are embodied to varying degrees in the UCI breadth requirement: to cultivate a historical conscious\u00ad ness of society and culture; to acquaint students with fundamental ways of thinking different from their own or that of their gender, class, and culture with a view to expanding their sense of human possibilities and awakening an awareness of the conditioned nature of their own assumptions about the world; to equip students with a broad understanding of the contemporary world and its cultural, political, scientific, and technological problems; to equip students with the skills essential to understanding and grappling with these problems; to establish bridges and to understand relationships between academic disciplines; and to provide students with some intellectual experiences which virtually all can be assumed to have had in common and thus to introduce them to what, after all, a uni\u00ad versity has traditionally been supposed first and foremost to be, an intellectual community. The breadth requirement is a graduation requirement and, with the exception of the lower-division writing requirement, need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems VI. Language Other Than English VII. Multicultural Studies and lnternationaVGlobal Issues The specific course combinations and sequences in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses listed are available in more than one academic unit. When a breadth course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. Students should refer to the actual descrip\u00ad tions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These course combinations were selected to ensure that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an aca\u00ad demic area, as well as to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. With the exception of categories I and VII, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three quarter courses in philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, IV, V, or VI. Students fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing courses from the list which follows. Students can select from among a vari\u00ad ety of courses, depending upon their area of interest. Some of the course combinations available consist of multiple-quarter courses (such as Chemistry lA-B-C under the Chemistry subsection of \"category II. Natural Sciences\"). Multiple-quarter courses are referred to as being \"sequential,\" meaning that the course work in the earlier courses is prerequisite to the later course work. Students must take each part of a sequential course in alphabetical order (e.g., students must take Chemistry lA before either lB or lC). Sequential courses are separated by hyphens. Other course combi\u00ad nations consist of single-quarter courses (e.g., Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C under the Anthropology subsection of \"category III. Social and Behavioral Sciences\") which are related to one another but for which no course in the combination is preparatory to any other course in the combination. Single-quarter course combinations may be taken in any order. Single-quarter courses are separated by com\u00ad mas. Semicolons separate complete course combinations. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to develop\u00ad ing the writing skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this commitment, but the con\u00ad cern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, stu\u00ad dents must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses. Students who have not completed the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be sub\u00ad ject to probation. Academic English/English as a Second Language students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the seventh quarter following the comple\u00ad tion of their AEIESL courses or they will be subject to probation. The third course must be an upper-division writing course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of the lower- division requirement. \u00b7 Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR 39B (Critical Reading and Rhetoric) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). UC IRVINE - 2003-20042. English and Comparative Literature WR 37 (Intensive Writing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). Recommended students only. 3. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) beyond satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a section of the Core Course designated S/A during their first quarter. Successful com\u00ad pletion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. (The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy Subject A.) For these students, the lower-division writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quar\u00ad ters of the Humanities Core Course. Students who do not receive a Cor better in Humanities lAS/A in fall quarter and continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Humanities lB S/A dur\u00ad ing the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a letter grade of Cor better. The lower-division writing require\u00ad ment will be satisfied in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course for these students. 4. Students who complete English and Comparative Literature WR 37 or WR 39B with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substi\u00ad tute as the second course of the lower-division writing require\u00ad ment one of the following courses in creative writing or nonfic\u00ad tion and journalism: English and Comparative 31, or WR 3S. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). The require\u00ad ment may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for sat\u00ad isfaction of the requirement. NOTE: All courses approved to ful\u00ad fill the upper-division writing requirement should have a \"W\" suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not satisfy the upper-division writing requirement. 2. English and Comparative Literature WR 139W. 3. English and Comparative Literature WR 109, WR 110, WR 111, or WR 113. Consent of instructor is required. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower\u00ad division writing requirement. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the writing requirement should refer to the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations and Procedures section for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course combina\u00ad tion from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Any three courses from Biological Sciences lA, 5, 6, SA, 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, 9F, 90, 10, 11, 15, 20, 35, 36, 37, 3S, 45, 55, 65, 75 (NOTE: the prerequisite for 1B is lA.)

Language Other Than English. Students must demonstrate competency in a language other than English by completing one of the following options: A. College-level course work equivalent to UCI's fourth quarter of study in a language other than English. UCI courses approved to satisfy this requirement are: Chinese 2A; 2A, 2A For information on UCI's prerequisites and course placement policies, consult the School of Humanities, Foreign Language Placement section in this Catalogue. B. Credit for four years of high school study or its equivalent in a single language other than English with a C average or better in the fourth year. C. A score of 4 or 5 on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination in a language other than English. D. A score of 620 or better on a College Board SAT II examination in a language other than English, with the exception of SAT II: Modern Hebrew for which a score of 540 or better is required. E. Completion of an approved course of study through the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP). Careful planning is required to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled. Check with an EAP counselor at the Center for International Education to determine the programs in countries that fulfill this requirement. F. The equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. For information on availability of such examinations and testing schedules, consult the Testing Office, Student Services II, (949) S24-6207. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or bet\u00ad ter, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. Stu\u00ad dents must select one course in multicultural studies and one course on international/global issues from the following lists. In fulfilling category VII, students may use courses which are also being used in fulfillment of other breadth categories. For example, Anthropology 2A simultaneously satisfies category VII-B and a portion of category III. In addition, VII-B may be fulfilled by one quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP). Multicultural Studies (VII-A): African-American Studies 40A, Studies 51, 60A, 60B, 60C, 101, 110, 111, 111A, 132, 133, 135, 141, 143, 144, 145, 147, 149, 150, 151, 152, 160, 161, 163 Classics 17 5 Education 104E, 124, 155, 160 English and Comparative Literature CL 9, CL 105, E 105 Environmental Analysis and Design E15, E102U, lOOE, 110C, 140A, 140B, 142 Studio Art 149 Women's Studies 50A, SOB, SOC, 139, 150, 160, 161, 162, 163, 197 3A-B-C, lOOA-B-C, lOlA-B-C, 115, ISO Classics 176 Criminology, Law and Society C191 Dance SO, Sl, S2, 90A-B-C Drama 40A, 120B, 120C East Asian Languages and Literatures 20, 55, 110, 116, 117, 120, 130, 150, 155, 160, 170, 190 Economics 13, 14SD, 152A, 152P-Q English and Comparative Literature CL E127, E143U Film Studies 160 French 50, lOlA-B-C, 110, 116, 117, 11S, 119, 120, 125, 127, 139, 150, 160 German 50, lOOA, lOOB, lOOC, 101, 102A, 102B, 117, 11S, International Studies 11, 12, 13, lllA, 121, 122, Italian lOOA-B, lOlA, lOlA-B-C, 115, 180 Linguistics 1 Music 40B-C-D Ecology 183B Social Science 170C, 170P, 150, 160, 185 Vietnamese 3A-B-C Women's Studies 164 School, Departmental, and Major Requirements In addition to the University and UCI requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the Humanities course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one require\u00ad ment. Information on specific degree requirements and courses is available in the academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), and should make certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. Transfer students should read the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. Students should note that with the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Additional infor\u00ad mation on grading is located in the Academic Regulations and Pro\u00ad cedures section. Minor Programs For certification in a minor, a student must obtain a minimum over\u00ad all grade point average of at least C (2.0) in all courses required for the minor program. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Completion of the minor is noted on a student's transcript. (Students are not required to minor in a pro\u00ad gram in order to graduate from UCI.) Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 59 Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student shouid file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing are established quarterly by each academic unit so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Students should contact their academic counselors and see the Schedule of Classes for deadline dates. INFORMATION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: FULFILLING REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE This section provides a guide for transfer students in understanding how their course work from another collegiate institution applies to fulfilling UCI degree requirements. Transfer students should use this information in conjunction with the previous section, Require\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's Degree. Transfer students are required to meet university, breadth, school, department, and major require\u00ad ments described in the Catalogue. The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools and which has been mutually determined with a commu\u00ad nity college as being acceptable toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools about courses that may be used to sat\u00ad isfy UCI requirements. Transfer Students: Completion of the UCI Breadth Requirement Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment by completing either: (a) the current UCI breadth require\u00ad ment, (b) one of the options listed in the Catalogue Rights section on pages 54-55, or (c) the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum. UC IRVINE - 2003-200460 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students With the exception of students who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum, transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must be completed prior to matriculating to UCI. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement, which must be completed within the first three quarters of residency at UCI. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing an approved one-year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Any student entering UCI with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement is met by (a) taking an approved one-year sequence in one of the following areas: general chemistry or basic physics; or by (b) taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in biological sciences or physical sci\u00ad ences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved work in any of the following areas: anthropology, economics, geography, interdis\u00ad ciplinary, linguistics, logic and philosophy of science, political sci\u00ad ence, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. At least one of the courses must be an introductory course. For students on the quarter system, at least two of the courses must be in the same area. (His\u00ad tory, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science but rather an area of humanistic inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in one of the fol\u00ad lowing areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English lit\u00ad erature, comparative literature, women's studies, dramatic litera\u00ad ture, or the history of art, dance, or music. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, or logic. VI. Language Other Than English. This requirement is met by (a) completing the third semester or fourth quarter of approved col\u00ad lege-level study in a language other than English; (b) credit for four years of high school study, or its equivalent, in a single lan\u00ad guage other than English with a C average or better in the fourth year; (c) a score of 4 or 5 on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination in a language other than English; (d) a score of 620 or better on a SAT II examination in a language other than English, with the exception of SAT II: Modern Hebrew for which a score of 540 or better is required; (e) completion of an approved course of study in an Education Abroad Program; or (f) the equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. This requirement is met by completing: one course in multicultural studies and one course on international/global issues. One quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) also satisfies the international/global issues portion of the requirement. Courses satisfying the multicultural requirement specifically address the history, society, and/or culture of one or more minority groups in California and the United States. Courses satisfying the interna\u00ad tional/global requirement focus on significant cultural, economic, geographical, historical, political, and/or sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. INTERSEGMENTAL GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER CURRICULUM California community college transfer students may receive credit for the UCI breadth requirement by completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer. The IGETC consists of a series of subject areas and types of courses which, if completed prior to transfer, will satisfy the breadth and general education requirements at any campus of the University of California. Fulfillment of the IGETC does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who do not complete the IGETC prior to transferring to UCI must fulfill the UCI breadth requirement in its entirety. Please note: (1) IGETC must be completed in total prior to enrolling at UCI; (2) students are responsible for requesting IGETC certifi\u00ad cation from their community college; and (3) the IGETC certifica\u00ad tion should be submitted to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools no later than the end of the first quarter of UCI enrollment. Courses used to fulfill the IGETC must be completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of Cor better.) Lists of specific approved courses which may be taken in fulfill\u00ad ment of the IGETC are available from California community col\u00ad leges and on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum 1. Language Other Than English: Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school study in the same language. 2. English Communication: One course in English Composition and a second course in Critical Thinking-English Composition. 3. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning: One course in mathematics or mathematical statistics which has a pre\u00ad requisite of intermediate algebra. Courses on the application of statistics to particular disciplines are not acceptable. 4. Arts and Humanities: Three courses, at least one in arts and one in humanities. 5. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Three courses in at least two different disciplines. 6. Physical and Biological Sciences: One physical science and one biological science course; one must include a laboratory. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Transferability of Credit The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the edu\u00ad cational needs of students who transfer from other California colle\u00ad giate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. UNIT CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted at other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equiv\u00ad alent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI a minimum of 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) Community Colleges A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) at a community college toward a University degree. No fur\u00ad ther unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The counselors, with the aid of that college's UC Transfer Course List Agreement (UCTCA), can advise students about California community college courses and units which will transfer to the University. In addition, staff in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools can advise students about the transferability of courses. UCTCAs for all California community colleges are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While limi\u00ad tations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four\u00ad year institutions. However, see the Residence Requirement in the UCI Requirements section. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in resi\u00ad dence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Exten\u00ad sion courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the student's academic dean. Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 61 COURSE CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all UC campuses. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be trans\u00ad ferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting lower-division major or breadth require\u00ad ments. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. Many California community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's breadth, school, and departmental major require\u00ad ments may be readily communicated to prospective transfer stu\u00ad dents. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. It is recommended that transfer students complete as much of the lower-division breadth, school, and major requirements as possible prior to trans\u00ad ferring to UCI. Articulation agreements are available on the World Wide Web at http://www.assist.org/. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools for information on planning a program for transfer. Prospective transfer students with specific questions about course work in their major should contact the respective school or department at UCI. UC IRVINE - 2003-200462 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enroll\u00ad ment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Registration does not become offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid, and the student enrolls in classes with the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments are correct. A quarterly calendar of dates for enrollment and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. This booklet is dis\u00ad tributed at the UCI Student Center to continuing students during the seventh week of each quarter for the ensuing quarter and also may be purchased at the UCI Bookstore. New students receive the booklet by mail. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary authorizations for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines. Enroll in classes during the published registration period. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obliga\u00ad tions must be satisfied at this time also. NOTE: Late fee payment and/or late enrollment in classes may re\u00ad quire the student to enroll in classes using the Add-Card procedure. TELEPHONE REGISTRATION WebReg, UCI's Web registration system, and TELE, UCI's tele\u00ad phone registration system, allow students to enroll in classes from anywhere in the world. Students may add and drop classes, inquire about open sections, change their grading option or units for a vari\u00ad able-unit class, put themselves on an official waiting list, and list their confirmed class schedule. Immediate feedback on the avail\u00ad ability of a class and a student's eligibility to enroll is provided; schedule changes may be made during the registration period or the adjustment period. Complete information about WebReg and TELE is available in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. PAYMENT OF FEES AND ENROLLMENT Registration fees are assessed quarterly and appear on ZOTBills mailed to students by the Campus Billing Services Office. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published registration period are subject to a late service fee. This fee is graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. Students who do not enroll in classes during the published registra\u00ad tion period are subject to a late service fee. Students enrolled in zero (0) units or not previously enrolled at the close of business at the end of the second week of classes are assessed a $50 late enrollment fee. A signature of the student's dean is required for late enrollment after the second week of classes. The student is subject to both late service fees if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the student does not enroll in classes by the registration deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, stu\u00ad dents are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published registration deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Office of Financial Aid and Schol\u00ad arships, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. Late registration (payment of fees and/or enrollment in classes) is permitted only in exceptional circumstances with the authorization of the student's dean. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Late services charges may be waived only if the Uni\u00ad versity is responsible for the late transaction. CHANGE OF CLASS ENROLLMENT After officially enrolling with the Registrar, a student may add or drop classes, change sections of a course, change units in a vari\u00ad able unit course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change Card, available from the student's academic counseling office or the Registrar's Office. In the first two weeks of classes, instructors may authorize the use of TELE or WebReg for adding, dropping, and changing the grade option. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the student's academic dean or, for undecided/ undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. During the first six weeks of instruction, a student may add classes provided approval is granted by the instructor in charge of the class. To change the grading option of a class during the first two weeks of instruction, students must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge. The Change Card must then be submitted to the Regis\u00ad trar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruc\u00ad tion. Changes in the grading option from the third through the tenth week require approval of the instructor and the student's aca\u00ad demic dean. Students may drop classes from the first through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, with the signature of the instructor in charge. After the sixth week of instruction, students may add or drop a class only with the permission of the instructor and the student's acade\u00ad mic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and is not subject to disqualification, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop Card is received in the Registrar's Office. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class they attend. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop Card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change Cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. NOTE: Instructors and deans may have earlier deadlines than those mentioned above. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Change of Major Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for theirprospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and policies and proce\u00ad dures. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Program Part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree is available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. To take advantage of reduced fees for part-time status, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students enrolled in excess units after the Friday of the third week of instruction are liable for full fees. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students; the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status only for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In addition to all other required fees, students approved for part\u00ad time status pay one-half of the Educational Fee and, if applicable, one-half of the Nonresident Tuition Fee or Professional School Student Fee. Undergraduate petitions are available from academic counselors or the Registrar's Office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Since there are certain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Under\u00ad graduate Admissions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section. Additional information is available in the Schedule of Classes. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation, However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the acade\u00ad mic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their academic record quarterly. (Student copies of the academic record are avail\u00ad able at the Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quarter.) Enrollment and Other Procedures 63 Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately. After one year, it is assumed that the stu\u00ad dent accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic record will be released only upon receipt of a signed request from the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $5 per copy. All out\u00ad standing debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only ( 1) if the request is accompa\u00ad nied by a written authorization signed by the student whose tran\u00ad script is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Other tran\u00ad scripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agency such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical Col\u00ad lege Application Service (AMCAS). When a student orders a transcript to be sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a tran\u00ad script to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status The Registrar's Office provides verifications of student status. Ver\u00ad ifications may be needed for reference checks, bank loans, applica\u00ad tions for good-student-driver insurance rates, and Social Security payments. There is a $3 fee for each verification, however verifica\u00ad tions for the purpose of student loan deferments are free of charge. For verification purposes, enrollment in 12 units or more in regular sessions is considered full-time status; enrollment in 6.0-11.9 units is considered half-time status; enrollment in 5.9 units or less is considered less than half-time status. Enrollment in eight units is considered full-time status for summer session. Cancellation/Withdrawal Undergraduate students who pay fees for a regular academic quar\u00ad ter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean (or the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students) and the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable (see Fee Refund section); and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal is used in determining the per\u00ad centage of fees to be refunded. This date is normally the date that the student submits the form to the appropriate Dean/Ombudsman for approval and is designated by that Dean/Ombudsman. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which enrollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of withdrawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. (See W notation in the Grad\u00ad ing System section.) A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to with\u00ad draw and intends to return within one year should submit both the Cancellation/Withdrawal form and an application for a Leave of UC IRVINE - 2003-200464 UCI 2003-04 !~formation for Admitted Students Absence. Further information appears in the Research and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies section. New undergraduate students are encouraged to seek advice from their admissions or academic counselor to understand the conse\u00ad quences of withdrawal and their eligibility to return. If an undergraduate student plans to leave the University after com\u00ad pleting all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of with\u00ad drawal is not necessary. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the readmission policy in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed read\u00ad mission applications by the deadline. Former UCI students who wish to be readmitted should contact the undergraduate counseling office of the school or program which offers their intended major. Readmission is subject to dean's approval and campus deadlines (August 1 for fall quarter, November 1 for winter quarter, and Feb\u00ad ruary 1 for spring quarter). To apply for readmission, a student must first pay a nonrefundable $40 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office, and then file the Application for Readmission with the Reg\u00ad istrar's Office. Remittance of this fee may be made by bank draft or money order made payable to Regents-UC. New undergraduate students who cancel registration prior to the first day of the quarter must reapply to UCI; they are not eligible to file for readmission as described above. If a student has been academically disqualified from the University or has left the University while on probation or subject to disquali\u00ad fication, the student must apply for readmission. The application, however, is subject to the approval of the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Graduate Study must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section for additional information. Enrollment at Other Institutions Various programs exist that enable currently registered UCI stu\u00ad dents in good standing to take courses at other UC campuses, as well as at California State University and California Community College campuses. More information is available from the Regis\u00ad trar's Office and from the academic counseling offices. California Residence Detailed information about California residence is available in the Catalogue's Expenses an~ Fees section. All inquiries with regard to the requirements for tlfe establishment of California residence (including exceptions pertaining to minors, aliens, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed. to the University of California, Irvine, Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6129. Commencement UCI Commencement ceremonies are held each June for all stu\u00ad dents who graduate any quarter of that academic year. Commence\u00ad ment protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in the spring and also is available from academic counselors. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Commencement Office; telephone (949) 824-6378; World Wide Web: http://www. commencement.uci.edu/. Application for Graduation. In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office no later than the deadline date set by that office. Specific deadline dates for filing the application are established quarterly so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. Students should contact their academic counselor and see the Schedule of Classes for deadline information. Diplomas. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available; which is three to four months after the quarter in which the student graduated. Please note that summer and fall quarter graduates awarded academic honors (summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude) at the end of the academic year are noti\u00ad fied by the Registrar's Office to return their previously issued diplomas. New diplomas reflecting the academic honor will be issued and will be available three or four months after the end of spring quarter. Students may then pick up their diplomas at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to send their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $10 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term finan\u00ad cial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning acade\u00ad mic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained permanently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as academic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional or graduate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their enroll\u00ad ment and academic records and may do so throughout the acade\u00ad mic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since each student's current quarter class enrollment is put directly into the academic record system from telephone enrollment or source documents completed by the student, it is extremely impor\u00ad tant for each student to complete these entries or source documents (e.g., Add/Drop/Change Cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regulations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automatically be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regulation IR 345). After a student's degree has been certified by the student's dean, the academic record may not be altered except in those cases UC IRVINE - 2003-2004where a procedural or clerical error on the part of an instructor has occurred. GRADING SYSTEM A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass (equal to grade C-or below) S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so desig\u00ad nated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so desig\u00ad nated by the Committee on Courses or Graduate Council, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preced\u00ad ing award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instructor may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop the class, which would result in the NR becoming a W). UR-Unauthorized Repeat. A UR notation is recorded for the grade when a student already has a passing grade for a nonrepeatable course and has repeated the course again. W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus and minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. GRADE POINTS AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit, with the exception of the A+ grade which is assigned 4 points per unit. Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of baccalaure\u00ad ate credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the following text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course taken for a letter grade times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades, as well as workload credit, are excluded in computing grade point average. Baccalaureate credit counts toward degree requirements and is used to compute the grade point average. Workload credit is used Academic Regulations and Procedures 65 to determine full-time status for financial aid, housing, student loans, and other purposes. For most courses at UCI, baccalaureate credit and workload credit are identical. Courses differing in this credit or \"workload credit only\" courses are identified in the course description. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. No grade may be revised by reexamination or, with the exception of I and IP grades, by com\u00ad pleting additional work. If a student is dissatisfied with a grade, the student should review their work with the instructor and receive an explanation of the grade assigned. A grade may be appealed on any reasonable grounds to the instructor, the chair of the department, and the dean of the school. If the matter is not resolved, the student may go for counsel to the Office of the University Ombudsman. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Proce\u00ad dures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. INCOMPLETE GRADES An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been temporarily excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for mak\u00ad ing up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maxi\u00ad mum three-quarter period. The student should consult the instruc\u00ad tor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is completed within the time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the counseling office of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. UC IRVINE - 2003-200466 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students Concerts sponsored by the Associated Students of UCI are held on the Student Center patio at noon throughout the year. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete grade. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall aver\u00ad age is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades com\u00ad puted as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. PASS/NOT PASS The Pass/Not Pass option is available to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point aver\u00ad age which appears on a student's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. Some courses are designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. Students do not have the option of taking these courses for a letter grade. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. 2. In addition, students may count a total of 12 units of courses des\u00ad ignated Pass/Not Pass Only toward their graduation requirements. 3. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the stu\u00ad dent's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 4. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 5. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made dur\u00ad ing the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the stu\u00ad dent's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction of the quarter. 6. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option unless the course is offered on that basis only. SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY GRADES (GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, and upon approval of the Graduate Council, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a gradu\u00ad ate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Also, with the approval of the Graduate Council, certain graduate courses are graded S/U Only. Additionally, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. GRADES IN PROGRESS IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Acade\u00ad mic Senate Committee on Courses or Graduate Council for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. GRADES NOT REPORTED A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enroll\u00ad ment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004REPETITION OF COURSES With approval from their school or program, undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received or when the course has been approved for repetition. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Unit credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP (if repeated for a letter grade) was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned. All courses which were originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a letter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. If a student repeats a course for which a passing grade has already been received and the course is not approved as repeatable for credit, the student will receive a UR and no credit will be given. Information regarding the repetition of foreign language courses is available in the School of Humanities section. SATISFACTION OF THE WRITING REQUIREMENT Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). 1. Students who fail to attain a letter grade of C or better in English and Comparative Literature WR 37 must repeat the course or enroll in the equivalent. It is recommended that these students enroll in WR 39A followed by WR 39B-C to assure completion of this requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in WR 39C must repeat the course. 2. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR 39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 3. Students who fail to attain a grade of Cor better in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course after satisfying the Subject A requirement by attaining a grade of Cor better in Humanities 1A S/A, should substitute English and Comparative Literature WR 39C if they need one quarter of addi\u00ad tional work to complete the requirement, or English and Compar\u00ad ative Literature WR 39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in Humanities IA S/A, enroll in Humanities 1B S/A and attain a grade of C or better, but fail to attain a grade of C or better in the writing component of Humanities IC, should substitute Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature WR 39C to complete the require\u00ad ment. 4. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in either Humanities IA S/A or Humanities 1B S/A, should substitute English and Comparative literature WR 39A-B-C to complete the requirement. Academic Regulations and Procedures 67 The course taken to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). See the UCI Requirements section for fur\u00ad ther information. Students who have not completed the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of their seventh quarter at UCI will be subject to probation. Students transferring to UCI normally should have satisfied the lower-division writing requirement before entering UCI; if, however, they have not, they must complete it within their first three quarters of enrollment or they will be sub\u00ad ject to probation. Academic English/English as a Second Language students must complete the lower-division writing requirement before the beginning of the seventh quarter following the comple\u00ad tion of their AE!ESL courses or they will be subject to probation. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who nor\u00ad mally teaches that course. Detailed procedures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipu\u00ad late whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as a let\u00ad ter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the exami\u00ad nation, grades and grade points (if applicable) will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or simi\u00ad lar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergradu\u00ad ates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations, or their equivalent, are obligatory in all under\u00ad graduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, as individu\u00ad ally determined by the Committee on Courses. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term.

UC IRVINE - 2003-200468 UCI 2003-04 Information for Admitted Students Student Copies of Quarterly Grades After each quarter, a complimentary copy of the student's perma\u00ad nent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements completed (Subject A, American History, and American Institutions). Declaration of Major \u00b7 All students are required to declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation) or they will become subject to disqualifi\u00ad cation from further registration in the University. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). CLASS LEVEL Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0 45.0 90.0 135 + COURSE LOAD LIMITS 44.9 89.9 134.9 An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units, students must obtain the authorization of their dean or, for unde\u00ad cided/undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergrad\u00ad uate Education. Refer to the Reduced-Fee Part-Time Study Pro\u00ad gram section. ACADEMIC STANDING To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic proba\u00ad tion if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. NORMAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENT Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree, if they fail to declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation), or after declaring a major, if they fail to follow the program of study required by the academic unit of their major. Stu\u00ad dents w)lo have selected undeclared status within a school may be subject to probation or to disqualification if they fail to follow a program of study leading to completion of lower-division school requirements. A. Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com\u00ad pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Normal Disqualification 7 15 23 39 55 71 88 105 123 141 159 1. Undeclared students who have completed the number of units specified in the given quarter of their enrollment, as shown in the table above, and are following a course of study pre\u00ad scribed by their school are making \"Normal Progress.\" 2. Students who have declared a major must follow the program of study required for their major, as well as complete the units specified in the given quarter of their enrollment, as shown in the table above, in order to make \"Normal Progress.\" Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (90 units excluding college work completed prior to high school graduation). 3. Students who fail to make Normal Progress as defined in (1) or (2) above are subject to being placed on probation by the fac\u00ad ulty of their academic unit or its designated agent, or for first\u00ad year undecided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students or its designated agent. C. Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on acad\u00ad emic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) and (B) above are subject to disqualification. D. For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Pro\u00ad bation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following two circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examination; (2) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. F. The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including bac\u00ad calaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offer\u00ad ing the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required UC IRVINE - 2003-2004for such students to obtain the desired degree and with Univer\u00ad sity residence requirements. G. For purposes of this regulation students will be understood to have declared a major when they have been formally accepted by the faculty of a degree-granting program or its designated agent to pursue a defined course of study leading to a baccalau\u00ad reate degree. H. All undergraduate students are expected to graduate when they have completed the baccalaureate requirements of their declared major or majors. The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress requirement for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a stu\u00ad dent becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school or, for undecided/undeclared students, by a faculty authority designated by the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Faculties of undergraduate-degree-granting units and the Faculty Board for Undecided/Undeclared Students are obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may contest disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. HONORS Information about honors opportunities at UCI is found in the Division of Undergraduate Education section and the academic unit sections. Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to stu\u00ad dents who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Of the graduating seniors, no more than 12 percent will receive academic honors: approximately I percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude.

A general crite\u00ad rion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. Additional information is available in the Division of Undergraduate Education section of this Catalogue. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship.

Fee information is available from the UCI Extension Registration Office. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who plan to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should first consult with and secure prior approval from the academic dean or chair of their major who will determine if the credits are applicable to major and breadth requirements. UCI undergraduate students must submit an official transcript of all course work earned at another institution or college to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. If such courses are deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools to be transferable, do not duplicate other credit granted, and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students In accordance with UC Academic Senate policy, graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for a limited number of acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension before enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must submit a formal petition, including an original transcript, after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the stu\u00ad dent's graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies is required. The petition may be downloaded from http://www.rgs.uci. edulgrad/students/forms.htm. While enrolled at UCI or on a leave of absence, a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through UCI Extension only with the prior approval of the student's graduate advisor and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies. See the Research and Graduate Studies section for further informa\u00ad tion about graduate transfer credit and the University's Intercampus Exchange Program.

Students with varying disabilities, including those with mobility, visual, hearing, and learning disabilities, and chronic health prob\u00ad lems, may be eligible for reasonable disability accommodations through this program. Staff assist students from the point of their admission to UCI through graduation. Specialized services may include testing accommodations, priority registration, document conversion, adaptive equipment, readers, notetakers, interpreters, captionists, liaisons with faculty and campus departments, disabil\u00ad ity parking, and information regarding disability legal rights in the university setting. A Center Computing Lab provides adaptive computer technology and training. In addition, on-campus trans\u00ad portation is provided for students with permanent and temporary mobility disabilities. There is no cost to the student for the support services or accommodations provided by the Disability Services Center. Students are responsible for fully acquainting themselves with the detailed procedures for use of accommodations. These procedures are available on the Center's Web site. Students with disabilities may qualify for reasonable accommoda\u00ad tions based on disability-related needs. Students must provide appropriate documentation about their disabilities to the Center. Documentation provided to the Center is confidential. It is the responsibility of the applicant or student to provide this documen\u00ad tation and, if necessary, to cover the cost for such documentation. This includes the cost for professional assessments for such dis\u00ad abilities as learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and psy\u00ad chiatric disabilities. Contact the Center for more information about disability documentation requirements. In some cases there is need for recent or very detailed documentation about the disability. UCI reserves the right to determine the most effective and timely accommodations after consultation with the student about the dis\u00ad ability and previous use of accommodations. The provision or use of a disability accommodation does not guarantee or ensure a cer\u00ad tain level of achievement for the student. Students with disabilities must meet the same academic standards as all other students. Some academic accommodations may require approval of the chair or dean of the student's academic unit. Students with disabilities who need accommodations (in particular, reading assistance, textbook conversion including e-text and Braille, American Sign Language interpreting services, real-time captioning services, and adaptive computing technology in campus laboratories) that must be planned or arranged in advance of the start of classes should contact the Disability Services Center as quickly as possible after admission to UCI. Failure to do so may delay or in some cases preclude the Center's ability to provide cer\u00ad tain accommodations.

Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) began in 1972. Its goals are to create a comprehen\u00ad sive digital library of Greek literature; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation in these endeavors. TLG research activities combine the traditional concerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among current research foci are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials from various literary-historical periods; the conversion of these materials into digital form; the enhancement of automated text-correction routines; and the formu\u00ad lation of criteria for the lexical analysis and categorization of the texts in the data bank. The project also has established procedures to facilitate international access to its resources either online (http://www.tlg.uci.edu/) or through compact disk. The TLG digital library currently contains more than 80 million words of Greek text and essentially all ancient Greek literary texts from Homer to A.D. 600, as well as a large number of texts from the period A.D. 600 to 1453. Data entry continues with the aim of including later periods of Greek literature. Close ties with the Department of Classics are evidenced by fac\u00ad ulty participation in TLG research and TLG support of graduate students. TLG's library holdings enhance those of the University Library, and TLG-related conferences and scholarly visits afford faculty and students contact with eminent classicists. The The\u00ad saurus Linguae Graecae has made UCI a major source of Classics research activity. Organized Research Units Organized Research Units (ORUs) normally consist of an inter\u00ad departmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of multidisciplinary or interdisci\u00ad plinary research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. The following ORUs have been established on the Irvine campus. CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Cancer Research Institute provides leadership and support for researchers working toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Institute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and directing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine. It provides a central source of information con\u00ad cerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of_ immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell func\u00ad tion, viral carcinogenesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. The Cancer Research Institute admin\u00ad isters Sprague Hall, a research facility in the Biomedical Research Complex dedicated to cancer and genetics. The Cancer Research Institute serves as the basic science arm of UCI's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute-desig\u00ad nated comprehensive cancer center. Other units of the center include the Chao Family Clinical Cancer Research Center and the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County. CENTER FOR EMBEDDED COMPUTER SYSTEMS The Center for Embedded Computer Systems, established as an informal center in 1998, was recognized as an ORU in January 2001.

Faculty from the Graduate School of Management (GSM), the School of Information and Computer Science (ICS), the School of Social Sciences, and the Department of Education conduct research through the unit. There are approximately 15 faculty associates and 20 students involved in CRITO research. CRITO was recently designated by the National Science Founda\u00ad tion (NSF) as one of six Industry-University Information Technol\u00ad ogy Research Centers in the United States. Though there are more than 50 NSF Research Centers across the country, including the six focusing on information and technology, CRITO is the only one of the national centers to focus on the social and economic impact of information technology. The first such NSF center at UCI, CRITO brings together nation\u00ad ally prominent UCI faculty with researchers from participating cor\u00ad porations to study the impact of new information technologies\u00ad computers, telecommunications, multimedia, and the Internet--on business, consumers, and the workplace. Corporate sponsors of the NSF center, referred to as the CRITO Consortium, have included the following organizations among oth\u00ad ers: ATL Products/Quantum Corporation, the Boeing Company, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Canon Information Systems, the Department of Defense, IBM Corporation, International Data Corporation, Microsoft, Norte! Networks, Seagate Technology, Sun Microsys\u00ad tems, Systems Management Services, and Technology Services Corporation. CRITO's research projects also reflect a multidisciplinary nature. Ongoing research includes: nationwide study of computers and educational reform in schools; nationwide study of computers and the Internet in the home; nationwide study of e-government; the payoffs from investments in IT; the impacts of IT on firm and industry organization; the impacts of computing on work groups and collaboration; IT structuring for e-commerce; the effects of IT on training, employee performance, and quality of work life; the global spread of production and use of computers; and the global\u00ad ization of the Internet and e-commerce. In support of these research programs, CRITO sponsors regular seminars among faculty, students, and members of the business community; cosponsors and hosts talks by nationally and interna\u00ad tionally distinguished researchers in the field; assists in the prepa\u00ad ration of proposals to government, foundations, and industry for extramural funding to support research programs and training of the next generation of researchers; and maintains a Web site (http://www.crito.uci.edu) which contains working paper and publi\u00ad cations documenting its research. CRITO works with the campus academic units to match students with graduate assistantships and work-study positions that are available in conjunction with CRITO research projects. CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRACY The Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) sponsors research and education aimed at improving the democratic process in the United States and expanding democracy around the world. UCI's achievements in this area were recognized by the National Science Research 81 Foundation, which selected UCI as a national center for the train\u00ad ing of graduate students on democracy. The Center's faculty and students study both democratizing nations and the expansion of the democratic process in the United States and other Western democ\u00ad racies. CSD hosts research conferences, sponsors faculty research, publishes a research paper series, and facilitates research and teaching on democratic themes. The Center has a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses and is one of the leading univer\u00ad sity-based programs in America devoted explicitly to the study of democracy. Further information is available at the Center's Web site at http://www.democ.uci.edu/. CENTER FOR VIRUS RESEARCH The primary purpose of the Center for Virus Research (CVR) is to significantly stimulate the interaction of UCI virologists with many other UCI basic and clinical researchers. Research on viruses has often provided a biological and technological foundation from which much has been discovered concerning the basic molecular processes of organisms. Indeed, this technology has had enormous impact on other areas, such as the very foundations of molecular biology. Disciplines such as molecular genetics, cell biology, struc\u00ad tural biology, pathogenesis, evolutionary biology, neurology, and radiological sciences can now be readily linked by virus research, and provide a highly interdisciplinary character to the Center for Virus Research at UCI. Due to the national focus on biodefense, CVR has undertaken to assist with collaborations at the campus, systemwide, and national levels which are focused on virologic\u00ad based research into the mechanisms of disease replication, expo\u00ad sure, and ultimately the design of new vaccines targeted at the diesases. CVR consists of 14 faculty from the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. CVR is not a degree-granting pro\u00ad gram; however, it does hostresearch fellows from Pacific Rim nations, particularly those from Mexico. It is also an element of the combined graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry, which has a virology track, and provides oversight and direction for the viral vector facility that serves the campus research community, as well as outside entities. CVR provides training in virus-based biotechnology, such as in gene therapy. This background is sought by biotechnology and aca\u00ad demic laboratories and enhances the employment opportunities of participating students and fellows. In addition, CVR hosts speakers from biotechnology companies and assists in establishing contacts between its participants and employers. The Center for Virus Research at UCI is the only center in California with an emphasis on basic virology and its link to pathogenesis. CRITICAL THEORY INSTITUTE The Critical Theory Institute (CTI) provides a locus for the con\u00ad duct and support of collaborative, interdisciplinary research that focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of such fields as history, literature, philosophy, art, anthropology, politics, and cultural stud\u00ad ies. CTI's principal function is to create a forum for debate among competing movements in contemporary critical theory. CTI's work encompasses not only the application of theory to data but also a self-reflexive investigation of theoretical presuppositions in order to produce alternative theoretical models, methodologies, and research strategies. CTI investigates problems according to three-to four-year research projects on announced topics, such as \"The Forces of Globaliza\u00ad tion\" (1995-99), and \"The Futures of Property and Personhood\" (1999-2003). Research projects involve collaborations between CTI members and contemporary theorists from around the world. Contributors to each project present lectures in CTI's Irvine Lec\u00ad tures in Critical Theory series. Research programs are concluded with the publication of essay collections in CTI's project series UC IRVINE - 2003-200482 UCI 2003-04 Research and Graduate Studies with Columbia University Press. See for example, \"Culture\" and the Problem of the Disciplines, edited by John Rowe. CTI additionally hosts the annual Rene Wellek Library Lectures, inaugurated in 1981. Every year, typically in the spring quarter, a distinguished scholar delivers three public lectures on a topic rele\u00ad vant to the field of critical theory. Recent lecturers have included Gayatri Spivak, Judith Butler, Homi Bhabha, Paul Gilroy, and Angela Davis. The Wellek Lectures also are published with Columbia University Press in CTI's ongoing series. Other activities sponsored by CTI include workshops, conferences, reading and discussion groups, one-time lectures by international scholars, and co-sponsorships of a number of other theory-related events. In recent years, CTI has established broad connections to distin\u00ad guished institutions and scholars around the world and has been planning collaborative international projects on a regular basis. The inaugural event, a conference entitled \"The States of Theory: China and the West,\" took place in Beijing in the summer of 2000, and was co-organized by CTI and Beijing Language and Culture Uni\u00ad versity. In April of 2002, CTI hosted another major conference, \"Derrida/Deleuze: Psychoanalysis, Territoriality, Politics.\" The Deleuze fea\u00ad tured keynote lectures by Catherine of 1996). In association with the Postcolonial Institute, CTI is participating in another inter\u00ad national conference in September 2003 in Melbourne, Australia. Further information on CTI, including a calendar of events, is available at http://www.humanities.uci.edu/critical. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CENTER The Developmental Biology Center (DBC) is an Organized Research Unit supporting multi-investigator research and training projects in developmental biology. DBC scientists are investigating how cells cooperate during development to control the growth and development of the body. This involves study of the processes of cell division, migration, and differentiation at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels using a variety of experimental organ\u00ad isms, as well as human material. In support of these research programs, DBC manages shared facilities for confocal microscopy, computer-based image processing and analysis, cell sorting and analysis, and single-cell microinjection. These facilities are part of the Optical Biology Shared Resource of the Chao Family Compre\u00ad hensive Cancer Center. DBC also administers training grants to support both graduate students and postdoctoral investigators, and Program Project grants supporting research in multiple laboratories. The unit sponsors seminars; organizes local, national, and interna\u00ad tional conferences; and hosts visiting scientists for collaborative research. The results of the work will contribute to understanding normal development and growth control as well as abnormalities that lead to birth defects, cancer, and nervous-system malfunction in the human body. New research programs are helping to identify chemicals in the environment that pose hazards for human develop\u00ad ment, to develop methods to stimulate the regrowth of tissues and organs, and to produce tissues for reconstructive surgery. Addi\u00ad tional information is available on the World Wide Web at http://mamba.bio.uci.edu/-pjbryant/ dbc/index.htm. INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN AGING AND DEMENTIA The goal of the Institute is to mobilize and unify University resources to discover meaningful ways to prevent decline in brain function with aging prior to its inception and to reverse loss of function once it has occurred. The elusive, yet attainable goal of \"successful aging,\" maintaining functionality in one's later years, is one of the great challenges facing the nation. While many individu\u00ad als continue to maintain and even improve their intellectual and cognitive skills, others suffer a serious and seemingly irreversible loss of cognitive function and develop dementias, most commonly Alzheimer's disease. The Institute is a fully integrated basic sci\u00ad ence/clinical research program that operates a Dementia Assess\u00ad ment and Treatment Clinic; a Brain Imaging Acquisition/ Analysis Unit; a Tissue Repository for cellular and molecular analysis of the aged and Alzheimer's brain; and a comprehensive database of clin\u00ad ical and research data. Research is multidisciplinary, employing the latest techniques in computer science, artificial intelligence, molec\u00ad ular biology, and neuroscience. The Institute also sponsors a spe\u00ad cialized educational track in brain aging and dementia for advanced students who wish to develop a career opportunity in an exciting and expanding field. The Institute is the site of a National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a State of California Department of Health Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Faculty from the Departments of Neurobiology and Behavior, Neu\u00ad rology, Radiology, Anatomy and Neurobiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Cogni\u00ad tive Sciences, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and the Schools of Information and Computer Science and of Social Ecology comprise the Institute's core group of investigators. INSTITUTE FOR GENOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS The Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics (IGB) was estab\u00ad lished in January 2001. IGB provides an organizational structure for interdisciplinary research in genomics and bioinformatics, which are revolutionizing biology, medicine, and society. Genomics, in its various forms, is catalyzing the fundamental process of reverse engineering gene and protein networks and understanding biology at the system level. The genomic data del\u00ad uge creates a critical need for theoretical, algorithmic, and software advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, modeling, analyzing, navigating, and visualizing biological information. In turn, biological systems have inspired computer science advances, including genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, computer viruses and synthetic immune systems, DNA computing, artificial life, and hybrid VLSI-DNA gene chips. This cross-fertilization has enriched both fields and will continue to do so in the coming decades. The Institute is organized around four areas of research: structural genomics, functional genomics, human genomics, and evolutionary genomics with bioinformatics as a common theme. Additional information is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.igb. uci.edu/. INSTITUTE OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETARY PHYSICS The Irvine branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) was established in April 2001. IGPP is a University of California Multicampus Research Unit (MRU) established in 1946, with existing branches at UCLA, UCSD, UCR, UCSC, and the Los Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories. The Insti\u00ad tute's mission is to promote and coordinate basic research on the understanding of the origin, structure, and evolution of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe, and on the prediction of future changes, as they affect human life. The UCI branch's research goals complement the MRU in that the understanding of the Earth as a coupled system of atmosphere, land, and ocean is required to plausibly predict future changes in the Earth System. In order to assess the role of human activities on present and future changes in the global environment, as well as the consequent effects on human life, the UCI branch intends to forge links to social and economic scientists as well as policy makers. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The core of the UCI branch is the Center for Global Environmental Change Research (CGECR), which was established in June 1999. An additional center related to Astronomy and Astrophysics is envisioned as part of the UCI branch in the coming years. Cur\u00ad rently, there are 16 UCI IGPP faculty and researchers from the School of Physical Sciences, including the Departments of Earth System Science, Mathematics, and Chemistry, and from The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES The goal of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is to foster research in the application of mathematical models and methods to describe and to better understand human behavior, both individual and social. The Institute sponsors specialized seminars and colloquia, a visiting scholars program, summer workshops, and focused research groups of faculty, students, and visitors, and it maintains a Technical Report Series. Facilities include a computer network for research purposes. Participants include faculty from the Departments of Anthropology, Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Logic and Philosophy of Science, Political Science, and Sociology in the School of Social Sciences; the Department of Mathematics in the School of Physical Sciences; the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humanities; the Department of Electrical Engi\u00ad neering and Computer Science in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering; the School of Information and Computer Science; and the Graduate School of Management. INSTITUTE FOR SOFTWARE RESEARCH The mission of the Institute for Software Research (ISR) is to advance software and information technology through research partnerships. ISR is dedicated to fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information technologies.

Faculty members are drawn from throughout the University of Cal\u00ad ifornia. Graduate research assistants, professional research staff, and visiting researchers complete the Institute's research body. ISR supports research projects, sponsors professional meetings, and develops technology. To further its research agenda, the Insti\u00ad tute sponsors a distinguished speaker series, technical roundtables, workshops, symposia, and special events. Effective partnerships with industry are essential for ISR to achieve its goals of technology development and transition. Corporate and institutional sponsorships support ISR's research, activities, and professional meetings. Information about the Institute for Software Research is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.isr.uci.edu/. Research 83 INSTITUTE FOR SURFACE AND INTERFACE SCIENCE The Institute of Surface and Interface Science (ISIS) brings together faculty and researchers in chemistry, physics, engineering, and biological sciences by stimulating collaborative projects of an interdisciplinary nature. The common unifying theme is the promi\u00ad nent role played by surfaces and interfaces between media in con\u00ad trolling processes central to many disciplines. The physicists find new and fundamental issues when the outermost atomic layer or two of matter are explored, the chemist encounters the new forms of bonding and energy transfer which make the catalysts central to the chemical and automotive industry possible, and the materials scientist learns to grow unique new artificial materials with proper\u00ad ties not found in nature by bonding to surfaces, and exploiting unique properties of atoms which reside in interfaces. The new field of nanoscience is made possible by the experimental and the conceptual advances made by scientists such as those in the ISIS community. Indeed, ISIS is now a major world center of nano\u00ad science and related matters, exploiting and expanding such advances. INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), a University of Cali\u00ad fornia organized research unit with branches at Irvine, Davis, and Berkeley, was established to foster interdisciplinary research on contemporary transportation issues. ITS research at UCI involves faculty and students from The Henry Samueli School of Engineer\u00ad ing, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, and the School of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science. ITS has a long and rich history of providing both direct and indi\u00ad rect support to \u00b7the UCI transportation graduate programs. It pro\u00ad vides office and research space to virtually all of the students enrolled in UCI's three graduate transportation programs-the Transportation Science graduate program, the\" graduate concentra\u00ad tion in Transportation Economics, and the Transportation Systems UC IRVINE - 2003-200484 UCI 2003-04 Research and Graduate Studies Engineering graduate focus-as well as to students with a trans\u00ad portation research focus in the Urban and Regional Planning grad\u00ad uate program. ITS provides extensive computing resources to all of these students, together with state-of-the art simulation and labora\u00ad tory facilities to assist in their graduate research. Additionally, ITS subscribes to all transportation research journals and offers a vari\u00ad ety of computer-based information retrieval services. Through its fellowship programs, ITS has provided almost $700,000 in direct support to graduate students during the past five years; these programs have provided more than $1 million in grad\u00ad uate fellowships during the past 15 years. During the past five years, over 200 graduate student research positions have been funded through ITS grants and contracts; during the past 15 years, over 500 such positions have been funded. Research at ITS covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Much of the research conducted by the Institute is organized around centers. The Institute is part of the University of Califor\u00ad nia Transportation Center (UCTC), a federally designated center for transportation research that focuses on research in transporta\u00ad tions systems and policy. The ITS Center for Activity Systems Analysis (CASA) supports research directed toward the develop\u00ad ment of activity-based approaches to travel behavior analysis. For more than 25 years, CASA research associates have been on the leading edge of evolving research in activity systems analysis, establishing an international reputation in the study of complex travel behavior, activity-based approaches, agent-based models, microsimulation approaches, data collection technologies, and empirical modeling. The ITS Center for Advanced Transporta\u00ad tion Management Systems Research, which is part of the Univer\u00ad sitywide PATH (Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways) pro\u00ad gram, supports research directed toward the development of intelligent transportation systems. The ITS Advanced Transporta\u00ad tion Management Systems (ATMS) Laboratories provide facilities for the teaching, research, and development of intelligent trans\u00ad portation systems and form the backbone of the State of Califor\u00ad nia's research initiative in ATMS. This major effort is comple\u00ad mented by the ITS PATH Center for Traffic Simulation Studies (PCTSS), which features prototype systems for modeling and eval\u00ad uating intelligent transportation systems and telematics. The Cen\u00ad ter for Logistical Innovations in Freight Systems (CLIFS) focuses on the development of optimization techniques for dynamic and stochastic freight and fleet management and investi\u00ad gation of the impacts of information technology on logistics opera\u00ad tions. The Center for Urban Infrastructure (CUI) organizes and conducts research into the role of transportation in achieving and promoting sustainable community development. The Institute also plays a major role in the intelligent transportation and telematics research component of the California Institute for Telecommuni\u00ad cations and Information Technology, one of the Institutes for Science and Innovation created by the Governor of California. ITS also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facili\u00ad tate cooperative research and {nformation exchange, and sponsors conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results. The Institute maintains a regular publication series that documents research conducted within its programs. ITS Irvine is also the editorial headquarters of the international journals, Transportation Research: Parts A, B, and C, and Accident Analysis and Prevention. Irvine Research Units Irvine Research Units (IRU) are established on the Irvine campus for the purpose of providing an organizational structure for the conduct of research that is difficult or infeasible to be carried out within the normal school or departmental structure. IRUs normally are established for a period of five years, and may provide the basis for establishment of extramurally supported research centers or Organized Research Units. HEALTH POLICY AND RESEARCH The IRU in Health Policy and Research (HPR) is a multidiscipli\u00ad nary unit that provides an environment for collaboration among health policy researchers at UCI. Its shared research space, semi\u00ad nars, and workshops create an atmosphere of synergistic creativity for faculty, staff, and students from diverse academic backgrounds. Interaction among the members results in innovative multidiscipli\u00ad nary research proposals. HPR's staff assists in the development and submission of the proposals and administration of the contracts and grants that result from them. HPR has 22 members from four units: the College of Medicine, the Graduate School of Management, and the Schools of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy and Social Sciences. Their areas of expertise include anthro\u00ad pology, biostatistics, community health, epidemiology, family med\u00ad icine, general internal medicine, geriatrics, psychology, marketing, medical economics, medical education, medical ethics, sociology, pediatrics, and public health. HPR also provides an educational environment for undergraduate arid graduate students to learn how. to conduct health policy research. The goals of the IRU are: (1) to facilitate collaboration among UCI faculty participating in health policy research; (2) to disseminate research findings; (3) to provide education and training opportuni\u00ad ties to undergraduate and graduate students regarding health policy research; and (4) to support the research efforts through extramural support. Research programs emphasize investigations on health disparities, injury prevention, and health care economics. These programs are multidisciplinary, involving faculty associates from more than one department and/or school. HEARING AND SPEECH SCIENCES The IRU in Hearing and Speech Sciences was established in July 2000 and consists of a multidisciplinary group of scientists inter\u00ad ested in processes underlying hearing and speech. The range of expertise represented in the IRU includes the molecular determi\u00ad nants of neuronal function in the auditory system, the processing of acoustic stimuli by the auditory system, the plasticity of the audi\u00ad tory system, the perception of simple and complex acoustic stim\u00ad uli, the perception of speech and the neural mechanisms that underlie speech perception, and the perception of speech by hear\u00ad ing-impaired listeners. The clinical populations consist of people who either suffer from an auditory neuropathy or are aided by a cochlear prosthesis. The IRU consists of 10 faculty members, their graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. The faculty are from the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, the Department of Cognitive Sciences in the School of Social Sciences, and basic science and clinical depart\u00ad ments of the College of Medicine. The goals of the IRU in Hearing and Speech Sciences are: (1) to foster interdisciplinary research in these areas; (2). to train graduate students and postdoctoral schol\u00ad ars; and (3) to share information in these areas by inviting notable scientists to lecture at UCI and by hosting an annual workshop consisting of IRU members and scientists from other institutions. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The research conducted under the auspices of the IRU is multidis\u00ad ciplinary. It includes examining physiological mechanisms of hear\u00ad ing impairment, assessing manifestations in the human brain of findings obtained in basic science research, relating speech percep\u00ad tion to the plasticity of the auditory system, and examining the physiological mechanisms of the perception of simple and complex acoustic signals. MACROMOLECULAR STRUCTURE The IRU in Macromolecular Structure ties together UCI investiga\u00ad tors who utilize modern methods of macromolecular structure determination as a critical part of their research program. The IRU serves as the focal point for further development of Structural Biol\u00ad ogy at UCI. An essential function of the IRU is to coordinate multi\u00ad investigator research proposals, graduate student recruitment, semi\u00ad nar programs, and course development. Most recently the IRU has helped to establish and support a new Protein Expression Facility for UCI. The purpose of this facility is to aid UCI investigators in the development of recombinant expression systems in order to produce enzymes and proteins for structural work and other applications. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs (FRP) are established for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdis\u00ad ciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the develop\u00ad mental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. The following group is recognized as a Focused Research Program. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LABOR STUDIES Twenty faculty and graduate students from the Schools of Humani\u00ad ties, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences who share a strong inter\u00ad est in the interdisciplinary study of labor have created a research niche at UCI to focus on the multifaceted experiences of the work\u00ad ing class. The FRP in Southern California Labor Studies seeks new paradigms for understanding the global changes currently recon\u00ad structing and reshaping the work, community, and culture of work\u00ad ing people, particularly in Southern California. The participants, each with distinction in their respective fields, seek to develop innovative approaches to understanding the forces that modify labor processes and working peoples' lives. Several activities, including a speakers series, seminars, seed grants, and conferences, are sponsored by the FRP. GRADUATE EDUCATION With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medi\u00ad cine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies administers graduate education in accordance with aca\u00ad demic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for undergraduate education. Information about graduate education at UCI is published here in the UCI General Catalogue and in individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Graduate Studies is pre\u00ad pared to answer questions about admission,_ academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assis\u00ad tance, student services, and other matters of concern to applicants or graduate students. The Office of Graduate Studies is located in 120 Administration Building; telephone (949) 824-6761; World Wide Web: http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad. Graduate Education 85 The University of California affirms that a diverse student and fac\u00ad ulty population is integral \u00b7to academic excellence and is critical to promoting the lively intellectual exchange and the variety of ideas and perspectives that are essential to advanced scholarly research. The University remains committed to expand outreach, recruitment, and retention efforts. Through the Graduate Diversity Program, steps are taken to increase the participation of diverse groups who may be disadvantaged in graduate education in the United States. It is the goal of UCI's Office of Graduate Studies to award fellow\u00ad ships to a diverse group of students. Diversity fellowships for new and continuing graduate students are based on demonstrated scholas\u00ad tic achievement, full-time status, and U.S. citizenship. Although state law prohibits selection based on race, gender, ethnicity, reli\u00ad gion, or national origin, socioeconomic and educational limitations can be considered. Each academic department identifies those stu\u00ad dents whose background and life experiences can enhance the level of diversity within the department or discipline. In addition, a separate federal program exists, funded by the National Science Foundation, titled \"Alliance for Graduate Educa\u00ad tion and the Professoriate.\" It is designed to increase minority par\u00ad ticipation in academic faculty positions in science, mathematics, and engineering. Information about this program is available online at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. An applicant can be considered for only one pro\u00ad gram during a given academic term. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program on the basis of such factors as acade\u00ad mic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be sat\u00ad isfied by a graduate program on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all appli\u00ad cants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Application Procedures HOWTOAPPLY The Application for Graduate Study must be completed either elec\u00ad tronically or by using a paper application. Applicants are encour\u00ad aged to apply electronically using the online application available at http://www.rgs.uci.edu/grad/. A paper application may be obtained by contacting the specific academic department or pro\u00ad gram of interest. The mandatory application fee is $60 and is not refundable under any circumstances. (Please note, however, that the application fee for the Graduate School of Management is $90.) Payment instruc\u00ad tions are available in both the electronic and paper versions of the application. Need-based application fee waivers are available only for domestic students. Detailed instructions for both the electronic and paper applications are included in their respective formats. For additional information, call (949) 824-4611 or send e-mail to ogsfront@rgs.uci.edu. WHEN TO APPLY For all graduate programs, applications should be completed a_nd submitted by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellow\u00ad ship and assistantship awards. Some academic units will accept UC IRVINE - 2003-200486 UCI 2003-04 Research and Graduate Studies applications for winter or spring quarter admission for which dead\u00ad lines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive full consid\u00ad eration, letters of recommendation, official transcripts, and official test scores must be received before the published deadlines. Some schools and departments have earlier or later deadlines for filing the application. Applicants should consult their prospective depart\u00ad ment or school for detailed information. Telephone numbers for the schools and departments may be obtained by calling (949) 824-6761, or by visiting the online directory at http://www.rgs.uci. edu/grad/contact/prgm_dir.htm. Required Supporting Documents LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recommendation forwarded directly to their prospective academic department or program. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet and are also available for downloading at http://www.rgs. uci.edu/grad/. Only one set of three recommendation letters needs to be submitted in support of an application for admission and fel\u00ad lowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recommendation be completed by professors or instructors in disci\u00ad plines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION (GRE) SCORES All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion (GRE) General Test, with the following exceptions: (1) the Graduate School of Management requires that M.B.A. applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no standardized tests are required of those who seek the M.F.A. degree or the M.A.T. in Spanish degree. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Subject Test. There is no minimum GRE score. Appli\u00ad cants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. A computerized version of the GRE is now offered year-round. The standard written GRE is administered in 96 coun\u00ad tries. In addition, several administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE, as well as information about computerized GRE test center locations, is available from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, or online at http://www.gre.org/. DOMESTIC ACADEMIC RECORDS Domestic applicants should request that official .transcripts be forwarded directly to their prospective academic department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all post\u00ad secondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of atten\u00ad dance, are required. University of California transcripts must also be submitted by applicants. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree pro\u00ad grams before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must sub\u00ad mit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. FOREIGN ACADEMIC RECORDS Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the prospective academic department or program at UCI. Records of academic study from foreign institutions must be offi\u00ad cial, bearing the original signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Applicants should not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly certified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an autho\u00ad rized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases the institutional grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Offi\u00ad cial evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. TEST OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE (TOEFL) Applicants whose first language is not English are required to sub\u00ad mit TOEFL scores for admission consideration. However, the TOEFL requirement will be automatically waived for applicants who have received an advanced degree (i.e., higher than a bache\u00ad lor's degree) from a U.S. college or university. In addition to the paper-based TOEFL test, a computer-based TOEFL test is now available. Please note that the scales used for scores for the two tests are significantly different. For the paper\u00ad based test, a score of 550 or better is required for admission con\u00ad sideration. For the computer-based test, a score of 213 or better is required. (The Graduate School of Management requires a mini\u00ad mum paper-based test score of 600, or 250 for the computer-based test.) The paper-based TOEFL test should be taken at the earliest avail\u00ad able date to allow scores to be reported in time to meet application deadlines. Score results from the computer-based test are available much more quickly. Results of institutional administrations of the TOEFL or test results which are more than two years old are not acceptable. Applicants must ask the Educational Testing Service to forward scores directly to the UCI Office of Graduate Studies (Code #4859). Information about the TOEFL is available from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA; World Wide Web: http://www.toefl.org/. ORAL ENGLISH PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION All international and permanent resident applicants who are not citi\u00ad zens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council, and who expect to serve as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate, must pass either the Test of Spoken English (TSE), administered by the Educa\u00ad tional Testing Service (ETS), or the UCI Campus SPEAK (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) examination administered by the UCI Humanities Instructional Resources Center (HIRC) as the insti\u00ad tutional alternative to the TSE. A minimum score of 50 on either test is required in order to be appointed. Graduate students are responsi\u00ad ble for ensuring that the UCI Office of Graduate Studies is notified directly by ETS or HIRC of their passing score prior to beginning their appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate. There is no exception to this requirement. Please note that many UCI degree programs require students to serve as a Teaching Assistant for training purposes as a graduation requirement. UCI encourages prospective students to take the TSE, if possible, prior to applica\u00ad tion/admission. The TSE is given 12 times per year at test centers around the world. Information is available from TOEFL/TSE Services, P.O. Box 6157, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6151, or online at http://www.toefl.org/. Detailed information on all English proficiency tests is available on the Office of Graduate Studies Web site at: http://www.rgs.uci.edu/ grad/students/esl_tests.htm. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004SPECIAL NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess suffi\u00ad cient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. A Foreign Applicant Ques\u00ad tionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon admission to graduate study. The required finan\u00ad cial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registration for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter, including payment of registration and other fees and enrollment in courses. Information on registration dates and procedures will be mailed to new applicants prior to the registration cycle. If an applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quar\u00ad ter, the Office of Graduate Studies must be notified of the. request in writing. After formal admission has been offered, the request for deferral must also be approved by the academic program to which the applicant was admitted. Limited Status Applicants who wish to undertake graduate study at UCI after the award of the bachelor's degree, but whose proposed study is not within a graduate degree program, are ordinarily admitted under Limited Status. University of California academic regulations pro\u00ad vide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two pur\u00ad poses: (I) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to an advanced degree; or (2) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses (usually undergraduate courses). The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the\u00b7 same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. The Dean of Graduate Studies may offer admission to Limited Sta\u00ad tus upon the recommendation of an academic unit, which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Limited Status students may enroll in graduate courses, but courses taken while in Limited Status will not satisfy residency or minimum graduate-level course requirements for any UC graduate degree program to which the student may eventually be admitted. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of no more than three quarters (one acad\u00ad emic year) and does not imply admission to graduate study at some later date. The Application for Admission to Limited Status includes a nonre\u00ad fundable Application Fee of $60. The application deadline for Limited Status is the same as the deadline for application to gradu\u00ad ate study. Persons who wish to apply directly for Limited Status should first consult the Academic Dean, Director, or Chair of the academic program with which the applicant wishes to affiliate. An academic unit must recommend admission, define the prescribed course of study, and provide academic advising. Graduate Education 87 Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed graduate advisor or director of graduate studies. The graduate advisor is a regular faculty member responsi\u00ad ble for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The graduate advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies of the Office of Graduate Studies, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the graduate advisor is instrumental in the nomina\u00ad tion of students for fellowship support, the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an asso\u00ad ciate dean for graduate studies who coordinates many of the func\u00ad tions which affect graduate students within that school. Both grad\u00ad uate advisors and deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guid\u00ad ance; however, student academic petitions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described here apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education creden\u00ad tials. Other regulations and procedures are covered in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections, and in the description of each graduate program. SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic ses\u00ad sion (unless on an approved leave of absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted, via a formal peti\u00ad tion process, in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point aver\u00ad age is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. This record also includes formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit UC IRVINE - 2003-200488 UCI 2003-04 Research and Graduate Studies accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress is not eligible for any academic appointment such as Reader, Tutor, Graduate Student Researcher, Teaching Associate, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. GRADING With the consent of the academic units involved, and upon approval by the Graduate Council, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsat\u00ad isfactory (Stu). Also, with the approval of the Graduate Council certain graduate courses are graded Stu only. A grade of S is assumed equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No course credit is given to a student for a course in which a grade of U is received. Graduate students may take one undergraduate course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program and are not applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incom\u00ad plete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment but stricter lim\u00ad its may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change\u00ad of-grade notice to the Registrar, through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. If no action is taken by the end of the first quarter following the quarter in which the NR was assigned, or by the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first, the NR becomes an F, U, or NP and will remain permanently on the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point aver\u00ad age for .the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations section. ACADEMIC DISQUALIFICATION After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination or course within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the fac\u00ad ulty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet acade\u00ad mic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Graduate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to sub\u00ad mit other information or comments in writing, or to request a sec\u00ad ond review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal aca\u00ad demic record of that student. Following the formal notice of dis\u00ad qualification, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. . ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an acad\u00ad emic quarter if af least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may also be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two six-week sum\u00ad mer sessions, or four units of credit in an eight-or ten-week sum\u00ad mer session. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecu\u00ad tive sessions. ENROLLMENT POLICY Full-time academic enrollment is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Study for the Ph.D. requires a full\u00ad time commitment from the doctoral student. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or grad\u00ad uate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-divi\u00ad sion courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-divi\u00ad sion courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by the stu\u00ad dent's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recognizes the legiti\u00ad mate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to providing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part-time students wherever good edu\u00ad cational reasons exist for so doing. In general, part-time status is available in master's and credential programs where part-time study has been judged academically feasible by faculty and approved by the Graduate Council. The only doctoral program approved for part-time status is the Ed.D. degree program in Edu\u00ad cational Administration. However, on the recommendation of the academic unit, students admitted to a Ph.D. program may be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies for part-time status on an ad hoc basis. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less. Within the guidelines and limitations on the application form avail\u00ad able in the Office of Graduate Studies or the Registrar's Office, graduate students may petition for part-time status for a maximum of three consecutive quarters and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and if applicable, one-half the Non\u00ad resident Tuition Fee and one\" half the Professional School Student Fee. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION A graduate student is expected to register for each regular acade\u00ad mic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, includ\u00ad ing final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Registration is not official or complete until all required fees have been paid and the student has enrolled in classes. Stu\u00ad dents are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of Califor\u00ad nia for an entire quarter ordinarily will be required to register in absentia. Unless an official leave of abse_nce has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadline for any regular quarter will lose grad\u00ad uate standing (i.e., the student's status as a graduate student will lapse), and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. If readmitted, the student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmis\u00ad sion and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced to candi\u00ad dacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter follow\u00ad ing readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may sub\u00ad mit an application for a leave of absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for read\u00ad mission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. LEAVE OF ABSENCE A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a leave of absence. A leave of absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quar\u00ad ter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or comparable University employ\u00ad ment. During a period of leave, a student may not take compre\u00ad hensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). University resources and facilities, including housing, are ordinarily unavailable to stu\u00ad dents on leave. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. Graduate Education 89 READMISSION A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting a new Application for Graduate Study with the nonrefundable $60 fee. The Dean of Graduate Studies may grant readmission when recommended by the academic unit. If readmit\u00ad ted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candi\u00ad dacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the sec\u00ad ond quarter following readmission. INTERCAMPUS EXCHANGE PROGRAM A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one quarter of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respective Deans of Graduate Studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the Univer\u00ad sity in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home cam\u00ad pus after the term has ended. Although eligible for all normal stu\u00ad dent services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties. TRANSFERS OF CREDIT At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work com\u00ad pleted at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another graduate division of the University of California. After enrollment, the stu\u00ad dent must initiate a formal petition for such credit and submit an original transcript. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a leave of absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the depart\u00ad mentaJ'graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No UC IRVINE - 2003-200490 UCI 2003-04 Research and Graduate Studies transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent is received. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI sum\u00ad mer sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes summer session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI summer sessions. Graduate Degrees MASTER'S DEGREES The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candi\u00ad dacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree nor\u00ad mally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, the thesis option; or Plan II, the comprehensive examination option. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of pre\u00ad scribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achieve\u00ad ment. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a com\u00ad prehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (M.F.A. in Dance, Drama, Fine Arts, Music, or Studio Art) and by the Program in Creative Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon cre\u00ad ative expression and professional development. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers. A mini\u00ad mum of one year in residence is required, usually including sum\u00ad mer session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evi\u00ad dence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Master of Advanced Study (M.A.S.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology in Criminology, Law and Society upon successful completion of 52 units of course work in the broad areas of criminal justice, including corrections, probation, criminal pros\u00ad ecution, defense, and civil law. The program is fully online with the exception of a required one-week in-residence course during the first summer. Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in contempo\u00ad rary methods of planning and policy analysis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate criti\u00ad cal judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time residence . for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full\u00ad time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary exami\u00ad nation on the student's mastery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of schol\u00ad arship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when quali\u00ad fying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the academic unit on behalf of the Graduate Council. The Report of the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee (Form I) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Follow\u00ad ing a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $65 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the academic unit chair (on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guid\u00ad ance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. All stu\u00ad dent committees must conform to policy approved by the Graduate Council in effect at the time of examination. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all require\u00ad ments have been satisfied. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION DEGREE The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) is awarded by UCI in conjunction with the School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Refer to the Department of Education section of this Cat\u00ad alogue for more information. THESES AND DISSERTATIONS Candidates for the Ph.D., Ed.D., and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a dissertation or thesis in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the dissertation or thesis ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the academic unit, on behalf of the Graduate UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Council, two copies of the dissertation or thesis must be filed for placement in the UCI Library and automatically become available for public access. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. A thesis and dissertation manuscript preparation manual is available online at http://www.lib.uci.edu/libraries/ collections/special!thesis/tdmanual.html. All doctoral students are required to submit an Exit Survey and a Survey of Earned Doctor\u00ad ates prior to the awarding of their degree. Dissertations and theses must be filed by the deadline published in the quarterly Schedule of Classes in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Those students who complete requirements and submit theses/dis\u00ad sertations after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees for that quarter. \u00b7Please note that in order to avoid payment of fees, manuscripts, all forms, and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. THE FILING FEE Under certain circumstances, a student who has advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for a graduate degree may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. International stu\u00ad dents who wish to go on Filing Fee status must, in addition, secure approval to do so from UCI's International Center. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for .the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or compre\u00ad hensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or compa\u00ad rable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a require\u00ad ment is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission nor immediately following a leave of absence except under excep\u00ad tional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Fil\u00ad ing Fee is paid, the student must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. NONRESIDENT TUITION Nonresident doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy are eligible for a 75 percent reduction in the annual nonresident tuition fee for a maximum of three consecutive calendar years including time on leave of absence. Reduced nonresident tuition begins with the first academic term following advancement to can\u00ad didacy, and is based on the prevailing tuition rate for the year it is applied. Any nonresident student who continues to be enrolled, or who re-enrolls following the three-year maximum allowance, will be charged the full nonresident tuition rate that is in effect at that time of enrollment. CONFERRAL OF GRADUATE DEGREES Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming can\u00ad didacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies. The student should consult the departmental graduate advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Graduate Education 91 Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate stu\u00ad dents at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants\u00ad in-aid, and student loans. All graduate students are encouraged to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year to access state and fed\u00ad eral grants and loans. It is available online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov or in the Office of Graduate Studies and in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships after January 1, with a submission deadline of March 2 each year. The Financial Aid section in this Catalogue and the Financial Aid Handbook, available from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, contain information about assis\u00ad tance based upon financial need that is administered by that office. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. Appli\u00ad cations for graduate admissions should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year begins in the winter quarter. UCI subscribes to the agreement of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universi\u00ad ties may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents', UCI Chancellor's Fellowships, and Graduate Opportu\u00ad nity Fellowships are awarded to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philoso\u00ad phy, Doctor of Education, or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards may include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supple\u00ad mented by partial assistantship appointments. Fellowship awards are typically made by the student's academic unit. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the academic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. A graduate assis\u00ad tant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate Diversity Program, a number of diversity fellowships and assistantships are awarded to entering and continu\u00ad ing graduate students who may be disadvantaged in higher educa\u00ad tion in the United States. Departments nominate candidates on the basis of their merit and contribution to the diversity of the depart\u00ad ment or discipline. Individuals from diverse cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply to UCI's graduate programs. In conformance with State law, applicants may not be given preferential treatment on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or national origin.

Students normally apply for this pro\u00ad gram early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement section for further information. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be considered for honors at graduation. General criteria are that stu\u00ad dents must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a Uni\u00ad versity of California campus and must have a grade point average of 3.0 or better. More specific criteria include, but are not limited to, cumuiative grade point average in the major, curriculum breadth, and extracurricular efforts such as service to the major or the School, and creative/artistic activities; additional information is available from the individual departments. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors may receive honors. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 51). ArtsBridge Program Among the first of its kind in the nation, the UCI ArtsBridge pro\u00ad gram provides scholarships of up to $3,000 per year and hands-on opportunities for talented, energetic UCI students to become \"artists-in-residence,\" bringing arts education to schools and other community venues. Linking with a range of subjects in the K-12 UC IRVINE - 2003-2004curriculum, ArtsBridge reestablishes art programs in elementary and secondary schools where arts education has been greatly reduced or eliminated. UCI student-scholars bring drama produc\u00ad tions, instrumental workshops, musical theatre, photography, painting, dance, and storytelling classes to local schools as well as to other community-based institutions such as libraries and hospi\u00ad tals. The program also serves to cultivate an appreciation for the value of arts in society and to develop the creative and analytical skills of both the artist-teachers and the students. The program pro\u00ad vides a unique opportunity for students to augment and diversify their learning experience outside the classroom, as well as to pre\u00ad pare them for a job market that increasingly requires the creativity of artists. The ArtsBridge program is open to all majors and minors in the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, by application and/or audition.

Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54--59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments. Graduate Program The primary endeavor of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts is the creative act. Research activities are pursued both as an end in themselves and as a source that can inform both performance and the studio experience. \u00b7The intellectual activity of theoretical, liter\u00ad ary, and historical courses complements the practical work in stu\u00ad dio workshops and performance. The aim of the M.F.A. programs in Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art is, thus, to produce artists literate in both traditional and digital media who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, disciplined, and capable of integrating existing knowledge into creative projects. The M.F.A. concentration in Arts, Computation, and Engineering provides broad-based, inter\u00ad disciplinary training at the intersection of digital technology and cultural and artistic practice. The UCi-UCSD joint doctoral pro\u00ad gram in Drama and Theatre provides opportunity for significant crossover research and teaching between the two campuses in a wide range of areas in drama and the theatre. It is the strong belief of the UCI Claire Trevor School of the Arts that intellectual integrity and creative excellence cannot exist without each other. ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordi\u00ad narily must be completed by March 1 for all the Master of Fine Arts degrees and January 15 for the doctoral degree, as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the Claire Trevor School of the Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for audi\u00ad tions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, compositions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by January 15, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 94 UCI 2003-04 Claire Trevor School of the Arts Upon admission to the program the student is assigned an advisor. Students should discuss with their advisor the scope of undergradu\u00ad ate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthen\u00ad ing if full benefit from graduate study is to be derived. Minor in Digital Arts The minor in Digital Arts is geared toward students with computer skills who want a grounding in the arts. This program allows stu\u00ad dents to acquire a working knowledge of digital imaging and related technologiCal skills within an arts context. It provides the tools necessary to understand the basic aesthetic components of the new digital media, relating digital arts to traditional art forms. These tools range from a basic understanding of \"art\" to sophisti\u00ad cated applications of state-of-the-art computer software, in various forms of art production including CD-ROM, digital video and pho\u00ad tography, Web site and other network applications, installations, and more. For entry into the minor, students must show ability to use e-mail, surf the net, and use productivity tools such as word processing or spreadsheets.

The program focuses on the dance tech\u00ad niques of ballet, modem, jazz, tap, world dance, and dance and technology. Theoretical studies include history; philosophy, aes\u00ad thetics, and aesthetics of digital media. Cre\u00ad ative opportunities bridge the studio and theoretical work through performance and choreography for multiple contexts; creative applications of animation, motion capture, audio and video tech\u00ad nologies; lecture demonstration; and critical, historical, ethno\u00ad graphical, and scientific writing. The objective of studio work is to develop kinesthetic resources, precision, flexibility, creativity, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive dancer. The techniques of classical ballet, modem dance, and jazz constitute crafts and styles for the dancer that serve not only as a basis for the training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. The theoretical, historical, and scientific courses are desigmid both to broaden the perspective of those students whose first interest is performance or choreography, and to provide a foundation for those students who plan to pursue careers in the academic, scien\u00ad tific, technological, or administrative fields of dance. The dance archives in the UCI Library Special Collections offer a rich source of research materials which enhance the Dance program. Among other special holdings, the archives include the extensive Ruth Clark Lert collection of dance books, journals, photographs, original costume sketches, and memorabilia of dance in Europe and the United States from pre-World War I to the present. CAREERS FOR THE DANCE MAJOR Careers in dance require excellent training and extraordinary disci\u00ad pline, tenacity, and dedication. Graduates of the Department have an excellent record of placement in the many fields of dance. Some have become professional dancers in ballet companies (including the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Nashville Ballet, and Ballet Pacifica); in modem dance companies (including Hubbard Street Dance Company, MOMIX, and Martha Graham Dance Ensemble); in touring companies (including The Lion King, Fame: The Musical, Carousel, and Cirque du Solei/); and in films, televi\u00ad sion, and theatre. In addition to training for professional dance performance and choreography, the major in dance serves as a basis for graduate study or job opportunities in fields such as dance history, dance sci\u00ad ence, dance pedagogy, dance reconstruction, dance criticism, dance video, and technology. Related fields, such as arts administration, Dance 95 law in relation to the arts, arts therapies, design and production, and music also offer positions for graduates. Students who are interested in a career in physical therapy or dance science will find a major in Dance, with related course work in chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics, to be excellent preparation for further study. THE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) is designed for those who wish to obtain a broad undergraduate background as preparation for careers or graduate work and related fields. It offers students a dance edu\u00ad cation that stresses performance and choreography, and, at the same time, intellectual depth and scope. In addition to the core, 12 units of elective Dance courses are required. The remaining elective units required for graduation may be chosen from Dance or other disciplines in relation to a student's individual interest. While the program of study in Dance stresses technical proficiency and acad\u00ad emic understanding in dance, the B.A. degree program also enables students to pursue elective subjects in their special areas of interest in other academic disciplines. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree program with special\u00ad izations in Performance and Choreography, is designed for students who wish to prepare intensively for careers in those areas. The courses required in addition to the core are primarily in Dance. The B.F.A. program allows for a few free electives in other areas. Admission to the B.F.A. program with a specialization in Choreog\u00ad raphy is by faculty approval only. The B.F.A. program with a specialization in Performance does not require additional faculty approval beyond the required audition for admission to the Dance major; students should declare their inten\u00ad tion to pursue this specialization during spring quarter of their sophomore year. Proficiency Levels In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to UCI, applicants must demonstrate technical/creative promise. The Department holds annual entrance auditions for potential freshmen and transfer students during winter quarter prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated. First-year students wishing to major in Dance must be at technique level II in at least one of the three major genres (ballet, modern, jazz). Placement auditions for admitted students are held during Welcome Week to determine levels of technical ability for placement in courses. It is suggested that transfer students wishing to pursue a B.A. degree in Dance complete, in addition to their breadth require\u00ad ments, one course in choreography, two courses in dance tech\u00ad nique, and one course in music for dancers prior to transfer to UCI. Previously admitted majors who wish to obtain a B.F.A. degree should contact the School of the Arts Student Affairs Office to obtain information about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies. Transfer students wishing to pursue the B.F.A. degree must declare their intention in writing at the time of their entrance audition and demonstrate technique and/or choreography levels appropriate to their year. It is suggested that transfer students complete, in addition to their breadth requirements, one course in choreography, two courses in dance technique, one course in music for dancers, and one course in dance performance prior to transfer to UCI. Students deficient in level of performance or academic preparation should be prepared to extend their studies beyond the normal four\u00ad year program in order to meet the requirements for graduation.

California State University, Long Beach, Lecturer in Drama (costume design) The Bachelor of Arts program in Drama combines broad liberal study and comprehensive training in several subdisciplines of drama. Each Drama major studies and practices in each of several mutually related areas of the theatre: performance, literature, his\u00ad tory, criticism, design and stage management, and production. The curriculum is structured to relate studio practices, technical resources, and production techniques to the development of dra\u00ad matic literature and current critical theory. The program is designed for students who, while not necessarily planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama, as well as for stu\u00ad dents preparing to work professionally in the theatre, often after more specialized training at the graduate level. The Department of Drama is a member of the University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA). CAREERS FOR THE DRAMA MAJOR A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employ\u00ad ment in theatre or film. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and television. They serve as artistic directors, designers, art directors, business man\u00ad agers, and performers at more than 100 theatre companies, and as faculty at more than 75 institutions of higher learning. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts management, advertis\u00ad ing, and teaching; others pursue further study at UCI or elsewhere. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None.

Honors candidates meet with their faculty mentor at the beginning of every quarter to evaluate their progress and with the Head of Design to check that all grade and course requirements are being satisfied. Honors in Directing Program The Honors in Directing Program provides the opportunity for Drama majors to concentrate on the study and practice of stage direction. Honors in Directing students study basic and advanced directing techniques, participate in the Directing Laboratory with graduate Directing students, take a course in directorial themes and/or the history of directing, and direct two full plays in the Drama Workshop series. Honors students also have the opportunity to receive credit as the assistant director of a Stage I or Stage 2 Department show; as a production internship with a professional theatre company; or for production/direction responsibility with the Playwright's Workshop. Admission to the Honors in Directing Program is competitive. Candidates must first complete Drama 170 (Directing) with a grade of B or higher, which qualifies them to enroll in Drama I85 (Advanced Directing) .. Candidates must apply, as a director, for Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) by submitting a proposal to direct a play in the Drama Workshop series. If the proposal is accepted, the candidate must declare to the Head of Directing that the production is to be counted as an audition for admission to the Honors in Directing Program. A committee of three Drama faculty members, Drama 101 including the Head of Directing, will then see and evaluate the production for clarity of interpretation, unity of style, strength of acting, and ensemble performance, and will examine the candi\u00ad date's self-evaluation and the evaluations of the director by mem\u00ad bers of the cast. The Head of Directing will inform the candidate of the committee's decision as to whether or not the candidate is admitted to the Honors Program. Undergraduate Drama majors can be admitted into the program as early as the winter quarter of their freshman year but no later than the spring quarter of their junior year. Students may be admitted to the program retroactively if all the requirements for Directing Honors have been met by their final year, but only if a faculty committee of three has seen their workshops and agrees to admit the candidate. To achieve the Honors in Directing distinction, students must fulfill all the courses required of the regular Drama major, with an overall GPA of 3.2 or higher. In addition, students must complete the fol\u00ad lowing courses with a GPA of 3.4 or higher: 1. Drama 170 (Directing). This course is taught each year in the fall quarter only. 2.

In this course, undergraduate Directing students present work in the Directing Laboratory along with graduate Directing students. 3. Two Drama Workshops, one of which must be taken as Drama 198 (Drama Workshop) with the candidate serving as director. The candidate must stage a second Drama Workshop as Drama 199 (Projects in Theater), for which a letter grade is earned. 4. Four additional units to be satisfied by any of the following: Drama I99 (as a summer internship, approved by the Head of Directing, with the candidate serving a professional theatre com\u00ad pany as director, assistant director, or production assistant); Drama I99 (as a production/directing project for Playwright's Workshop); Drama 100 (as assistant director to a faculty direc\u00ad tor); or Drama 199 (as assistant director to a graduate director's thesis production). Honors candidates meet with the Head of Directing at the begin\u00ad ning of every quarter to evaluate their progress and to check that all grade and course requirements are being satisfied. Successful graduating seniors will receive the \"Honors in Directing\" notation on their official transcript and will receive a nomination and rec\u00ad ommendation for national University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA) interviews. NOTE: All of the above courses are open to all students even though they may not qualify for the Honors Program. Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory Program The Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory Program is designed to challenge superior students beyond the scholarly requirements of the Drama major. It provides them with the oppor\u00ad tunity to advance their knowledge of dramatic literature, history, and theory and to further develop their writing, analytical, and research skills. An additional purpose of the program is to better prepare students for graduate study in not only dramatic literature, history, and theory, but in all fields in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in law. Eligibility requirements are: (1) completion of Drama 40A, B, C and two courses of Drama 103 (for upper-division writing credit), or equivalents to these courses from other institutions; (2) possess and maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.2, with a GPA of 3.4 or higher in all dramatic literature, history, and theory courses; and (3) completion of the eligibility form.

In consultation with the student, the adviser for this project is selected before the end of the fall quarter of the student's senior year. Students develop their projects until the spring quarter when they enter the writing phase. It is only during the spring quarter that students achieve full course credit for their work on the thesis, in the form of an independent study course with their advisor. This independent study is the final course of the program. \u00b7 Successful graduating seniors will receive the \"Honors in Dramatic Literature, History, and Theory\" notation on their official transcript.

DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAM Degree Offered Ph.D. in Drama and Theatre. Drama 103 This is a joint program offered by the UCI Department of Drama and the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. Preparation Students with a B.A. (minimum GPA of 3.5), M.A., or M.F.A. degree in Drama and Theatre are eligible for admission to the doc\u00ad toral program. Students with training in literature (or another area in the humanities) will also be considered, provided they can demonstrate a background in drama or theatre. Experience in one of the creative activities of theatre (acting, directing, playwriting, design, dramaturgy) enhances a student's chances of admission. All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion and to submit samples of their critical writing. While not required for admission, a working knowledge of a sec\u00ad ond language is highly desirable (see Language Requirement). Course of Study Students are required to take a minimum of 144 units, which is equivalent to four years of full-time study (full-time students must enroll for\u00b7 a minimum of 12 units each quarter). Forty of these units are taken in required seminars; the balance is made up of elective seminars, independent study and research projects (including preparing the three qualifying papers), and dissertation research. Students must take a minimum of one seminar per year in the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. The program of study makes it possible for students to take a significant number of elec\u00ad tive courses and independent studies both with faculty in Drama and Theatre and in other departments. Required Courses Students must take a minimum of 12 units (three seminars) each of Drama 290 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History Prior to 1900) and 291 (Dramatic Literature and Theatre History, 1900 to Present), and 16 units (four seminars) of 292 (Cultural and Critical Theory). All graduate courses may be repeated when the topic varies. Descriptions of the topics to be treated in a given academic year are published by the Department in the fall. Enrollment in each course requires the consent of the instructor. The courses are lim\u00ad ited to registered doctoral students. These 10 required seminars must be completed by all students, including those who have an M:A. or an M.F.A. degree, before the end of the third year. In addition, students must pass comprehen\u00ad sive examinations at the end of their first and second years. Drama 293 (Directed Studies) and 294 (Dissertation Research) are also required. Comprehensive Examinations In the first year, students prepare for the Written Comprehensive Examination, which is based on a reading list of approximately 150 titles ranging from the Ancient Greeks to the present. Students take this examination at the beginning of the fall quarter of their second year. (Comprehensive examinations are scheduled at the beginning of fall quarter in order to allow students the summer to prepare.) Students who fail the Written Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their second year. Students who fail the Written Comprehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. In their second year, students prepare for the Oral Comprehensive Examination. The reading list for this examination is designed to permit students to acquire a knowledge of their dissertation subject area, broadly conceived. The reading list is compiled by the student UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 104 UCI 2003-04 Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the dissertation advisor, in consultation with other members of the faculty, as appropriate; the reading list must be established by the end of winter quarter of the second year. Students take the Oral Comprehensive at the beginning of the fall quarter of their third year. Students also submit a dissertation prospectus (approximately five pages) when they take this examination. Students who fail the Oral Comprehensive may retake it no later than the first week of winter quarter of their third year. Students who fail the Oral Com\u00ad prehensive for a second time are dismissed from the program. Advancement to Candidacy: Three Qualifying Papers Students normally select a dissertation advisor during their second year and must do so before the end of spring quarter of that year. In consultation with the dissertation advisor and other faculty members, students develop topics for three qualifying papers, which are written during their third year. The three qualifying papers-one long (approximately 50 pages) and two short (approx\u00ad imately 30 pages each)-must be completed by the end of the third year; these completed papers provide the basis for the Oral Quali\u00ad fying Examination. Students write the long paper under the direc\u00ad tion of their dissertation advisor; it is understood that the long paper is preparatory to the dissertation. The short papers deal with other related topics, subject to the approval of the student's advi\u00ad sors; the two short papers are understood as engaging in exploring the larger contexts of the dissertation. Students normally pass the Qualifying Examination and advance to candidacy at the end of their third year; students must advance to candidacy no later than the end of fall quarter of their fourth year. Once advanced to candi\u00ad dacy, students write their dissertation which, upon completion, is defended in a final oral examination. Students may select a dissertation advisor from either the UCI Department of Drama or the UCSD Department of Theatre and Dance. All UCI doctoral dissertation committees must include at least one faculty member from UCSD. Language Requirem~nt Students are required to complete an advanced research project using primary and secondary material in a second language (mate\u00ad rials may include live and/or recorded performance; interviews with artists, critics, and scholars; and other non-documentary sources, as well as more conventional textual sources). This requirement may be satisfied by writing a seminar paper or a quali\u00ad fying paper (see Advancement to Candidacy above) that makes extensive use of materials in a second language. The second-Ian\" guage requirement must be satisfied before the end of the third year. This requirement will not be waived for students who are hi\u00ad or multilingual; all students are required to do research-level work in more than one language. It is assumed that students will have acquired a second language before entering the doctoral program, although second-language proficiency is not a requirement for admission. While students may study one or more second languages while at UCI or UCSD, lan\u00ad guage courses may not be counted toward doctoral program requirements. Teaching Students are required to teach a minimum of four quarters. No more than eight units of apprentice teaching may be counted toward the required 144 units. Departmental Ph.D. Time-Limit Policies Students must advance to candidacy by the end of the fall quarter of their fourth year. Departmental normative time for completion of the degree is five years; total registered time in the Ph.D. program at UCI or UCSD cannot exceed seven years. Financial Support Ph.D. students entering the program with a B.A. may be supported (either by teaching assignments or fellowships) for five years. Stu\u00ad dents who have an M.A. and have been given transfer credit may be supported for four years. Such support depends upon the funds available, the number of students eligible, and the student's rate of progress. Courses in Drama LOWER-DIVISION 10 Introduction to Production Theory (4) F, W, S.

Music 107 PROGRAMS OF STUDY The Department of Music offers two undergraduate degrees (the Bachelor of Arts in Music and the Bachelor of Music) and the Master of Fine Arts degree in Music. The minor in Music is unavailable until further notice. The Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree program is performance\u00ad oriented. It offers students the opportunity to specialize in one of the following: bassoon, clarinet, composition, contrabass, flute, French horn, harp, jazz instrumental, Jute and guitar, oboe, percus\u00ad voice. (The specialization appears on the student's UCI transcript.) In addition, B.Mus. students may qualify for the Spe\u00ad cial String Performance option, an intensified curriculum for pro\u00ad fessional-level students. All B.Mus. students receive weekly private instruction, for a maximum of 12 quarters for entering freshmen or six quarters for transfers and composition students, and present a solo recital during their senior year. B.Mus. students participate in performance classes each quarter. Normal residency for the Bache\u00ad lor of Music degree is four years, and two years for transfer stu\u00ad dents. Vocal performance students focus on diction, movement, stage presentation, repertory, criticism, and style. Guitar and Jute students focus on ensemble work, repertory with other instruments and voice, criticism, and pedagogy. Piano students give weekly solo performances before other students, and also focus on criti\u00ad cism, style, and interpretation. String, wind, brass, percussion, and also piano students focus on quartet work, small ensembles, and solo sonatas privately coached and presented in afternoon recitals. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree program enables students to pursue elective subjects in music (such as analysis, history, or jazz), in the arts, or in other academic disciplines. Students receive two years of instrumental or vocal instruction and participate at the same time in two years of ensemble or repertory classes. Students also complete a senior project in an area of interest: a historical project, a composition, or a lecture/performance. Music scholarships are offered to promising undergraduate per\u00ad formers. Scholarship awards are generally based on the preadmis\u00ad sion auditions held in February. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad during their junior year. Music majors may enroll in conservatories and universities in several countries; highly qualified performers may be eligible to attend the Conserva\u00ad torio G. B. Martini in Bologna, Italy. See the Educational Abroad Program section for additional information. In each baccalaureate degree program, students receive private lessons on their instruments or in voice, and perform in orchestral or choral concerts, in chamber ensembles, and in solo recitals. A five-year program coordinated with the UCI Department of Edu\u00ad cation is available for students interested in obtaining a California Teaching Credential. The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree program in Music emphasizes Accompanying, Choral Conducting, Composition and Technology, Guitar/Lute Performance, Instrumental Performance, Jazz Instrumental/Composition, Orchestral Conducting, Piano Per\u00ad formance, and Vocal }>erformance. PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES ChoraiNocal Choral ensembles at UCI offer all students, regardless of major, the opportunity to sing. Regular ensembles include the California Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Madrigal Singers, Men's Chorus, Women's Chorus, and Women's Chamber Choir. Performances range from international concert tours, to Southern California con\u00ad cert venues, to campus concerts. The Department produces the annual Madrigal Dinner celebrating the court of Henry VIII. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 1 08 UCI 2003-04 Claire Trevor School of the Arts Annual invitational choral festivals are an integral part of the pro\u00ad gram. Opera and oratorio performances feature student soloists. Instrumental The UCI Symphony Orchestra offers participants an opportunity to explore the great masterworks of the standard orchestra repertory. The most proficient students have an opportunity to perform a con\u00ad certo with the orchestra by winning the annual concerto competi\u00ad tion. The symphony performs six times a year including collabora\u00ad tions with the UCI Opera Theatre and the Departments of Dance and Drama. Productions have included Bize_t's Carmen and Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. A cornerstone of instrumental study at UCI is the chamber music program. Small ensembles, coached by the faculty, have frequent opportunities to perform. Additional student performance opportunities are available in larger ensembles: the Wind Ensemble performs music written for varying combinations of wind and percussion instruments; the Jazz Orchestra performs a variety of jazz big band charts; and the Ath\u00ad letics Bands (Pep Bands, Drumline, Marching Band, and others) play for athletic events and other school, community, and private functions. Composition Students have the opportunity to compose works for performances by undergraduates and graduates, chamber groups, and a student modern music chamber ensemble. Selected student works may be read by the large performing ensembles. CAREERS IN MUSIC A degree in Music offers many career opportunities. Music is a highly competitive profession and a degree may or may not lead to professional employment with an orchestra or as a concert artist. Many graduates do, however, become successful freelance mem\u00ad bers of symphony orchestras, composers, and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in performance, music his\u00ad tory, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composi\u00ad tion, or secondary or postsecondary education. Some graduates have made careers in music publishing and in the recording industry. RECOMMENDED PROFICIENCY LEVELS All applicants for admission are required to pass an audition in their principal performing medium and will receive infor\u00ad mation concerning the mandatory audition approximately 60 days following the close of the application period. Freshmen students wishing to enter either of the baccalaureate degree programs in Music must demonstrate appropriate perfor\u00ad mance proficiency and should have had a minimum of three years of private instrumental or vocal instruction. They should know scales, fundamental notation, triads, and have the ability to read music in both treble and bass clefs. Basic keyboard skill is highly desirable, as is experience as a solo performer. Choral, orchestral, band, or stage experience is desirable.

Transfer students pursuing either undergraduate degree should have had college-level private instrumental or vocal instruction; two years of music theory; the history of western music; ear-training; sight-singing; sight-reading; and piano. For transfer students pursuing the B.Mus. degree, results of place\u00ad ment tests wi\u00b7ll determine the minimum number of quarters neces\u00ad sary to complete degree requirements. All transfer students must take placement tests in musicianship, theory, and history in order to transfer these courses in fulfillment of the UCI Music degree requirements. These placement tests are given just before the beginning of the student's first quarter of study at UCI.

Students are encouraged to develop an individual, disciplined direction through an experimen\u00ad tal approach to media, materials, and techniques. To further this end, the curriculum provides studio experiences in drawing, paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, ceramics, photography, digital imaging, and video, in addition to emphasizing cultural studies in relation to contempo\u00ad rary practice. Visiting artists and theorists who teach on a quarterly basis, or who make shorter guest appearances, are an integral part of the program. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Special programs for Studio Art majors are offered in Venice. Graduate-level study also is available. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 116 UCI 2003-04 Claire Trevor School of the Arts CAREERS FOR THE STUDIO ART MAJOR Departmental faculty and the range of artists whose work is repre\u00ad sented in the University Art Gallery exhibitions provide diverse \u00b7 career models. Some graduates go on to careers as exhibiting artists or teachers; others work in arts-related activities in museums, galleries, and artists' organizations. A bachelor's degree in Studio Art is usually required as preparation for graduate-level study in studio art. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59.

MASTER OF FINE ARTS PROGRAM Degree Offered M.F.A. in Studio Art Graduate emphases in Feminist Studies and in Asian American Studies are also available. (Refer to the Program in Women's Studies section or the Department of Asian American Studies sec\u00ad tion of the Catalogue for information.) General Information and General Degree Requirements The program is designed to provide intensive professional training for independently motivated students wishing to pursue careers in the field of contemporary art. Rather than traditional ideas of sub\u00ad ject and technique, experimental and interdisciplinary approaches to art making are emphasized. Students undergo a rigorous course of study combining seminar classes, intensive critique courses, and independent study. The seminars cover a range of critical issues dealing with the relationship of culture to contemporary art and are designed for students interested in theoretically positioning their art practices within an interdisciplinary framework. All incoming students must take the First-Year Graduate Seminar in preparation for further course work. As students progress in the program, they are required to take a series of additional seminars aimed at train\u00ad ing them to develop research skills and a written component aug\u00ad menting their culminating thesis exhibitions. Various approaches to developing text and word are considered, and students are encour\u00ad aged to approach developing the thesis textual component follow\u00ad ing a path best suited to their postgraduate interests (e.g., critical writing, spoken word/performance, critical memoir, digital narra\u00ad tive structures). The overall emphasis in the program, however, is on studio produc\u00ad tion. Throughout their three years, students must take a series of critique seminars. Work-in-progress, produced for the given quar\u00ad ter's critique class, is intensively discussed within a group context. Students must also, throughout their graduate careers, work each quarter on an independent basis with faculty of their choice and are encouraged to work with a range of faculty members. During the second year, students must select a thesis committee with whom they will work closely on the development of both thesis studio production and research interests. However, even after selecting their committee, students are still encouraged to work with a range of faculty on an independent basis in order to continue to respond to and reflect on a diversity of ideas and differing approaches to both studio production and art distribution systems. Throughout the first two years, students must also undergo a series of progress checks including open studio reviews and a second-year exhibition. Students are evaluated by faculty committees during their first and second years. Satisfactory opinion by these committees coupled with both satisfactory independent study evaluations and grades of at least a B or above will allow the student to progress to candi\u00ad dacy for the degree. During the third year, candidates must mount a thesis exhibition. In tandem with the final thesis exhibition, stu\u00ad dents are required to do a public presentation on their work as part of their final defense before their thesis committee. During the first two years, students are required to take courses from a structured curriculum totaling 12 units each quarter. Beyond that, students can select additional course work from any sector of the Department or University including approved upper-division undergraduate courses. The third year is structured so that students can individualize their course of study through a wide selection of classes. For example, students wishing to focus primarily on studio production can do so through a combination of independent studies and critique classes, or students could design their third year to focus both on studio production and acquiring additional course work in a given research area or graduate emphasis. M.F.A. candidates are each provided with an individual studio space. Facilities include photography laboratories (analog and digi\u00ad tal), video production studios, data laboratories, and sculpture lab~ oratories for work in wood and metal. There are also facilities to support work in digital media, painting, performance, drawing, and ceramics. Students also have regular opportunities to exhibit in two galleries. Various programs of visiting artists and lecturers are an integral part of the student experience. There is a public lecture series for which solicited graduate student input is considered an important component. Visiting artists, curators, critics, and gallerists are invited to give lectures and conduct studio visits with graduate stu\u00ad dents. The Studio Art 220 seminar (required both first and second year) incorporates visiting lecturers into a colloquium setting where students are asked to lead in-depth discussions with a given visitor. In addition to artists and curators, Studio Art 220 visiting lecturers include faculty from the UCI campus as well as other UC campuses whose work and research may be of interest to graduate students. Some Studio Art faculty, in addition to their departmental appointment, are affiliated with other UCI and UC programs, e.g., Asian American Studies, African-American Studies, Women's Studies, Engineering, Information and Computer Science, Critical Studies, Art History, the Cal-(IT)2 Gaming Studies Initiative, and the UC Institute for Research in the Arts (UCIRA). UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Admission Applicants for admission to the M.F.A. program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, have completed one year of twentieth-century art history (students who have not completed this will be required to do so as part of their graduate studies), and submit by January 15 a portfolio of their most recent creative work of a maximum of 20 slides, on a #80 Kodak carousel tray, or video tape (VHS; no more than five minutes, cued up).

M.F.A. IN FINE ARTS WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ARTS, COMPUTATION, AND ENGINEERING (ACE) As digital technologies infiltrate increasingly diverse aspects of cultural practice, and human culture at large is influenced by the presence of digital technologies, there is a profound need for a new type of professional in the entertainment industry, in education, and in the arts, who can help to construct, manage, and monitor these changes. Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.F.A. in Fine Arts with a con\u00ad centration in Arts, Computation, and Engineering is to provide stu\u00ad dents with a broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the inter\u00ad section of digital technology and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordinated across the School of Information and Computer Science, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic, and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in Studio Art 117 composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immersive and aug\u00ad mented environments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the-. sis, in addition to completion of course work. The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Studio Art 270), four ACE studio/labs (Studio Art 271-277), two ACE project internship~ (Studio Art 279), and one quarter of ACE thesis research (Studio Art 278). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core categories may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Electives: four courses in school-based specialization electives chosen by students in consultation with faculty advisors, consistent with the technical, aesthetic, and theoretical themes of their thesis project; and two breadth electives that may be chosen by students in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by the candidate's advisor.

Otis Art Institute, Assistant Professor of Studio Art (video, multimedia, film theory) The major in Arts and Humanities provides students with a broad exposure to a range of disciplinary and methodological opportuni\u00ad ties in the Arts and Humanities. It insists on the productive inter\u00ad section of these two fields as the focus of each student's program. Students improve their critical and historical sophistication while learning about the process of performance and creative work, a combination that equips them to participate more effectively in a society that increasingly joins critique and creation just as closely as it fuses image and information. Arts and Humanities students investigate the symbolic dimension of human behavior and identity, an interest shared by many critics and artists alike. Often, this interest is expressed in the context of interdisciplinary programs designed to facilitate contact among faculty and students from a wide range of different academic disci\u00ad plines. This major's focus on the connection between practice and analysis distinguishes it from the broader and more diverse scope of more general interdisciplinary programs. The scholarly work of many UCI faculty in the Arts and Humanities lies at an intersection between the two academic units, and the major translates this intel\u00ad lectual and creative activity into a coherent curriculum and projects current forms of scholarship and artistic practice into the classroom. CAREERS FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES MAJOR Graduates of this program will be very attractive to teacher-train\u00ad ing programs. There is also a steadily growing market in private industry for students whose training combines skills sharpened by both the Arts and Humanities. Business demands graduates with strong writing and analytic skills, talents stressed in the Humani\u00ad ties. They also desire people with creativity and visual skills who have experience putting their original ideas into practice, some\u00ad thing emphasized in the Arts. Graduates will have special skills that will enable them to work in professional fields directly allied with the Arts, including museum work, art foundations, art criti\u00ad cism, journalism, theatre, and the entertainment industry. The UCI CareerCenter provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Requirements for the Major Humanities 1A-B-C; a language other than English through 2C; one lower-division survey in a specialization in the Arts, chosen from Dance 90A-B-C, Drama 40A,B,C, Music 14A-B-C, Studio Art lOA,B,C; six units of \"studio courses\" in Dance, Drama, or Studio Art or six units of \"ensemble courses\" in Music (if students have the necessary skills, these can be upper-division courses); Arts and Humanities 100, 101; 16 additional units of upper-divi\u00ad sion Arts courses and 16 additional units of upper-division Human\u00ad ities courses focusing on a specific theme, region, or period, cho\u00ad sen with the approval of an Arts and Humanities faculty advisor. (Students must have their proposed program of study approved by their advisor each year.) It is expected that students will choose their courses from one major in the Arts and one major in the Humanities. Students with well-developed interests can shape their curriculum more precisely to their needs. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI.

Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face the human race in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated people understand the contributions that biological sciences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of human beings. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biol\u00ad ogy in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to learn the principles and facts in this ever-expanding field of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the responsibili\u00ad ties of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for under\u00ad graduates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter several hundred undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the Biological Sciences Core. Upper-division laboratories and satellite courses developing the major concepts of modern biology expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences meaningful and inter\u00ad esting and to inform intelligent citizens of biological phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. The School offers majors in Biological Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Neurobiology. In addition, students who wish to focus on a particular area may choose to obtain a special\u00ad ization along with their Biological Sciences degree in: Cell Biol\u00ad ogy, Developmental Biology, Ecology, Evolution, Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Neurosciences, Physiology, and Plant Sciences. The School also offers a minor in Biological Sciences. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Ecology. Information is available in the School of Social Ecology section. Opportunities are available at the graduate level to specialize in Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Microbiol\u00ad ogy and Molecular Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Behavior, Physiology and Biophysics, and Pro\u00ad tein Engineering Science. Degrees Biochemistry and (offered jointly with the School of Social Ecology) HONORS Honors Program in the School of Biological Sciences The Honors Program in the School of Biological Sciences provides an opportunity for outstanding students majoring in Biological Sci\u00ad ences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Neurobiology to pursue advanced work in independent research via participation in the Excellence in Biological Sciences Research Program and earn Honors in Biological Sciences upon graduation. Admission to the program is based on an application to participate in the Excellence in Biological Sciences Research program filed during the middle part of the fall quarter of the year of the student's participation. Additionally, students must have a minimum overall 3.5 grade point average and a minimum 3.5 grade point average in all required Biological Sciences courses. The Program requires a min\u00ad imum of three quarters enrollment in research (Biological Sciences 199) including successful completion of Biological Sciences H195 and the Excellence in Biological Sciences Research program. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Graduation with Honors Of the graduating seniors, no more than 12 percent will receive Latin honors: approximately 1 percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. The selection for these awards is based on winter quarter rank-ordered grade point aver\u00ad ages. To be eligible for honors at graduation, the student must, by the end of winter quarter of the senior year, be officially declared a Biological Sciences major; submit an Application to Graduate to the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office by March 21; have completed at least 72 units while in residence at a UC campus; have all corrections to the academic record processed by the Regis\u00ad trar's Office by the end of winter quarter; if completing the Lan\u00ad guage Other Than English breadth requirement with a language exemption test, pass the test by the end of winter quarter; and be able to verify completion .of all course work by the end of the spring quarter of the senior year. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 51). Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful partici\u00ad pation in creative research is one\u00b7 of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excellence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and fac\u00ad ulty, and possibly of seeing their research papers published. Selected papers are published in the School's Journal of Under\u00ad graduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a minimum of three quarters on the same project (with at least one quarter taken during the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to participate. They must be in good academic standing, have a grade point aver\u00ad age of 2.7 or better, and be making normal progress in Biological Sciences. Campuswide Honors\u00b7 Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Requirements for the Minor in Biological Sciences Nine courses are required, no more than two of which may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis: A. Three courses selected from Biological Sciences 94, 96, 97, 98, and 99. (Prerequisites are strictly enforced. Exceptions may be made for some majors that accept the above courses for degree requirements. Consult with the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office or the academic counseling offic~ of the major.) B. Three four-unit courses selected from Biological Sciences 5-H90, 94-110, excluding 46. (Courses used to satisfy group A may not also be used to satisfy group B.) C. Three four-unit courses selected from Biological Sciences 114-189. (Prerequisites are strictly enforced.) Residence requirement for the minor: A minimum of six courses required for the minor must be completed at UCI. Approved courses taken in the Education Abroad Program are considered to be in-residence courses. NOTE: Students majoring in Biological Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Neurobiology, or Applied Ecology may not minor in Biological Sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the phys\u00ad ical sciences, it is very important for students to take their required physical sciences early, particularly general and organic chemistry. Students who have not completed high school chemistry are well advised to complete a preparatory chemistry course before entering UCI. The academic program shown is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take Humanities 1A, Chemistry 1A, Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences 94, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2A) during.the fall quarter. Students will then continue with Biological Sciences 96 and a recommended Biological Sciences elective, and complete their general chemistry and humanities requirement the remaining winter and spring quarters. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry 51A or 52A), continue the Biological Sciences Core with 97, 98, 99, and IOOL; students enrolling in 100L must have completed or be concurrently enrolled in Biological Sciences 98 and 194S. Sophomores also com\u00ad plete the Humanities requirement if they have not taken it during their freshman year and often begin taking courses in other disci\u00ad plines to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathe\u00ad matics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. During their junior year, most majors complete the Biological Sci\u00ad ences Core and take physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry will be required to take Physics 7 A-B and 7D or 7E in place of Physics 3A-B-C. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and usually start their research and their upper-divi\u00ad sion laboratory and satellite courses. Since research and the con\u00ad tent of satellite courses are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before undertaking certain satellite courses or research projects. Finally, during their senior year, students continue their research and their optional specializations by completing the remaining required upper-division laboratory and satellite courses. Students in the Biological Sciences major are required to make progress toward their degree. Students' progress will be monitored. If normal academic progress toward the degree in Biological Sci\u00ad ences is not being met, students will be subject to probation.

Students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing require\u00ad ment. Students taking Humanities 1 A must enroll iri the Subject A section of this course if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. 2 Students may take Chemistry 52A-B-C, 52LA-LB instead of 51 A-B-C, 51LA-LB. 3 Prerequisites for Biological Sciences 1 OOL are completion of or concurrent enrollment in Biological Sciences 98 and 194S, and satisfactory completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Biological Sciences 166 can be taken in place of lOOL. Biological Sciences lOOL or 166 must be completed prior to tak\u00ad ing the three upper-division laboratories. 4 In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics 147A-B-C, and Psychology 112A-B-C (for Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. 5 Electives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. Undergraduate Major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology The recent explosive growth of chemical and molecular under\u00ad standing of biology is a notable scientific achievement. Students who wish to begin an in-depth study of the molecular basis of microbiology, immunology, virology, developmental biology, pathogenesis, and evolution can do so through this major. This pro\u00ad gram will be especially attractive to those students who intend to pursue an advanced degree in biological or medical sciences. The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major is based upon required courses in Advanced Biochemistry and Advanced Molecular Biol\u00ad ogy (Biological Sciences 114 and 116). These courses, along with satellite courses in the areas of biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, and genetics, provide majors with a choice to either explore the breadth of the field or to follow a more in-depth study of any of its subdisciplines. The program of study emphasizes lab\u00ad oratory experience through the Biochemistry Laboratory and the Molecular Biology Laboratory (Biological Sciences 114L and 116L), and through either the Immunology Laboratory or the Virology Laboratory (Biological Sciences 121L or 124L), which provide students with the opportunity to develop a range of skills and an appreciation of the experimental foundations of the field. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 130 UCI 2003-04 School of Biological Sciences The major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology is intended to provide students with the appropriate tools and training to success\u00ad fully pursue graduate degrees emphasizing basic research skills. This would include Ph.D. and M.S. training as well as combined M.D./Ph.D. programs. In addition, graduates could use their back\u00ad ground very effectively in pursuing careers in business, education, law, and public affairs. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.

Applications to declare the major can be made in spring, typ\u00ad ically in the sophomore year, with a review of applications and selection to the major by the Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Faculty Board completed during the summer. Double majors between Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and either Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences, Applied Ecology, or Neurobiology will not be approved. Undergraduate Major in Neurobiology The Neurobiology major is designed to teach students how neuro\u00ad biologists apply cellular, molecular, systems, and behavioral analy\u00ad ses in understanding how the nervous system works. The hallmark of the major is a year-long, in-depth exploration of the intellectual tools used to create, advance, and disseminate knowledge about the nervous system. Through neurobiology satellite courses, students acquire advanced factual knowledge about neurobiology. In addi\u00ad tion, Neurobiology majors may choose to participate in research through Biological Sciences 199, where they will learn technical skills and receive mentoring from faculty members. Students completing the Neurobiology major will be well qualified for admission to graduate or professional schools in preparation for careers in biological research, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medi\u00ad cine, nursing, and other related fields. Even without additional edu\u00ad cation, they will be competitive for positions in the pharmaceutical industry, the health care delivery industry, or in medically or bio\u00ad logically related technologies. The major also provides valuable preparation for students interested in entering other disciplines that increasingly interface with biology and biotechnology, such as law, business administration, and government policy. Additionally, the major provides excellent preparation for students who wish to become high school science teachers. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S.

GRADUATE STUDY IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sci\u00ad ences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biol\u00ad ogy, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Neurobiology and Behavior) and four basic science Departments of the College of Medicine (Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Bio\u00ad physics), representing respective concentrations of study under the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, cooperate in the conduct of graduate education administered by the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences. Although students are admitted to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree program, the Master of Science (M.S.) degree may be earned in pursuit of the Ph.D. Additionally, a master's program in Biotechnology (M.S. degree in Biological Sciences) is offered. Each department has a graduate advisor whom students may con\u00ad sult in regard to the technical details of the individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated by the department or program to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other relevant qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the particu\u00ad lar department or program whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests and background. MASTER OF SCIENCE AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy pro\u00ad grams are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs, with the exception of the master's program in Biotech\u00ad nology. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the Biological Sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the stu\u00ad dent plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is possible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided they are accepted into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and acad\u00ad emic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assis\u00ad tants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Mas\u00ad ter of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The student completes seven upper-division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the stu\u00ad dent's field of specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence. The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence. This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the School, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Graduate student status or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for all 200-299 courses. Master of Science with a Concentration in Biotechnology Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry 3205 Krishna K. Tewari, Director The field of biotechnology has developed explosively since the dis\u00ad covery of gene cloning and sequencing methods in the mid-1970s. The field is now embodied by many successful companies and an intense demand has developed for well-trained people with up-to\u00ad date familiarity with research techniques in the manipulation of nucleic acids, proteins, immunological reagents, and pathogenic organisms. The program in Biotechnology, leading to an M.S. degree in Biological Sciences, provides extensive training in actual research settings (individual faculty laboratories) in techniques rel\u00ad evant to industry, and seminar exposure to the nature of industry. It is designed to train students to enter the field of biotechnology as skilled laboratory practitioners. Emphasis is placed on learning state-of-the-art technology in protein isolation and characterization, animal and microbial cell culture, and recombinant DNA method\u00ad ology. Students are trained in experimental rationales for solving actual research problems and are encouraged to take summer internships in industry during the course of their studies. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry evaluates applicants to the program on the basis of grades, letters of recom\u00ad mendation, GRE scores, and other relevant qualifications. Appli\u00ad cants should have successfully completed courses in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biol\u00ad ogy, microbiology, immunology, and virology, as well as labora\u00ad tory courses in biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, and either animal virology or immunology. However, it is possible to defer up to two of the required laboratory courses to be taken dur\u00ad ing the first year of graduate study. The program emphasizes immediate participation in research. First-year students participate in research projects in faculty labo\u00ad ratories and learn techniques in protein isolation and characteriza\u00ad tion, animal and microbial cell culture, and recombinant DNA methodology. Research training is supported by formal course work in nucleic acids, proteins, genetic engineering, and molecu\u00ad lar/cellular biology. In addition, students are trained rigorously in data recording and presentation and are required to maintain a lab\u00ad oratory notebook for faculty review. Emphasis during the second year is devoted almost solely to participation in research projects in faculty laboratories with one formal required course in molecular biology/cell biology. The program is terminated at the end of the second year by a comprehensive examination (Plan II). While the Biotechnology program is designed to produce skilled laboratory practitioners for industrial positions, some students may wish to continue in a Ph.D. degree program. The Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry is a member of the interdisci\u00ad plinary graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bio\u00ad chemistry, a program which offers the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences. Biotechnology program students who wish to enter the interdisciplinary graduate program upon completion of the M.S. degree should apply for admission during their second year. Biological Sciences Graduate Programs 141 INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School is structured in a manner that encourages an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach to scientific problems. Interaction and cooperative efforts across traditional institutional boundaries are especially evi\u00ad dent in the School's participation in various organized research units (described in the previous Research and Graduate Studies section) and in the interdepartmental/interschool graduate pro\u00ad grams described below. Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry 145 Biological Sciences Administration; (949) Web: http://www.bio.uci.edu/ Rozanne M. Sandri-Goldin, Director The combined graduate program in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry (MBG&B) brings more than 100 faculty from the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chem\u00ad istry, Developmental and Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecu\u00ad lar Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Physiology and Biophysics. Each faculty member's area of research is listed at the beginning of the departmental sections on the following pages. The departments administer a graduate concentration in association with the MBG&B program; the degree offered is the Ph.D. in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences. The MBG&B program is designed to offer stu\u00ad dents a unified curriculum, broad training, and a wide range of research opportunities in the following tracks: cancer biology, cell biology, developmental biology and genetics, immunology and pathogenesis, mechanisms of gene expression, neurobiology, struc\u00ad tural biology/molecular biophysics, and virology. The goal of the combined program is to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth comprehension in a given subspecialty. During the five years established as the normative time for com\u00ad pleting the Ph.D. degree, students complete the MBG&B program requirements during their first year, and in the remaining years complete the requirements of one of the department graduate pro\u00ad grams. In the first year of study, emphasis is placed on immediate research participation supported by formal course work in protein synthesis and structure, nucleic acid biochemistry, cell biology, and gene expression. At the end of the first year, student eompetence and critical thinking in the molecular aspects of biological sciences are tested through a comprehensive preliminary examination and overall evaluation. Selection of an advisor usually occurs prior to the preliminary examination. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of graduate student training in the first or second year of study. At this time, students also begin to lay the experimental foundation for their dissertation project proposal. During the sec\u00ad ond year and beyond, students participate in the departmental jour\u00ad nal club and seminar series of the department in which they have elected to carry out their dissertation work, as specified by the con\u00ad centration requirements. In years three and beyond, students fulfill requirements of a departmental Ph.D. concentration. Further infor\u00ad mation is available in the Catalogue sections of the participating departments and through the MBG&B program office. Applicants should have significant laboratory experience and be well-prepared in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, and bio\u00ad chemistry. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 142 UCI 2003-04 School of Biological Sciences http://www.neuroscience.inp.uci.edu The Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program (INP) is a first-year graduate program that brings together more than 70 faculty from the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Cognitive Sci\u00ad ences, Developmental and Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Behav\u00ad ior, and Pharmacology. INP faculty have broad research interests in behavioral neuroscience, brain aging, developmental neurobiology, genetics, learning and and sensa\u00ad tion and perception. Neuroscience as a discipline requires scientists to have a detailed understanding of at least one field, and a broad understanding of many other fields. INP provides breadth early on, followed by specialization in years two through five of predoctoral training. INP organizes and coordinates a core curriculum that provides a foundation in Neuroscience; this forms the basis of future special\u00ad ized instruction in a participating departmental degree-granting program. This curriculum includes course work and laboratory rotations. Each trainee is assigned a Student Advisory Committee, consisting of three participating faculty members, to assist trainees in tailoring an appropriate course of study based on academic background, interests, and research foci. After successfully com\u00ad pleting the core curriculum, students select an advisor from the participating faculty and then are guaranteed automatic admission to the Ph.D.-granting program in their advisor's home department. In this way, INP serves not as a degree-granting program, but as a \"gateway\" to further graduate training. In particular, the program will provide trainees an opportunity: (1) to begin training in Neuroscience with a broad academic introduc\u00ad tion, (2) to receive individualized attention to curricular needs, (3) to conduct initial research projects with a large and diverse group of faculty in a wide variety of departments, and ( 4) to conduct dis\u00ad sertation research in any of a large and diverse group of laborato\u00ad ries in a wide variety of departments. The ideal INP candidate will have had a substantial subset of the following courses: biology, chemistry, physics, calculus, neuro\u00ad science, psychology, biochemistry, and genetics. Preference will be given to applicants who have had laboratory research experience. Graduate Program in Protein Engineering 1121 McGaugh Hall; (949) E. Vickery, Director Faculty Dana W.

Senear: Interactions of proteins and DNA in transcriptional regulation Athan J. Shaka: New techniques in molecular chaperones Stephen H. White: Protein folding in membranes The new discipline of protein engineering has emerged, combining biochemistry, physical and organic chemistry, recombinant DNA technology, structural biology, and biochemical engineering. This has provided new approaches to the basic study of protein structure and function, as well as the opportunity to design and produce pro\u00ad teins with a broad spectrum of industrial and health-related appli\u00ad cations. The School of Biological Sciences, in conjunction with the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, offer an interdiscipli\u00ad nary graduate program. The program brings together faculty with research interests in: structure/function of enzymes, metallopro\u00ad teins, receptors, and growth factors; protein folding and protein modification with non-natural amino acids; NMR spectroscopy; and X-ray crystallography. The program offers the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or Engineering with a concentration in Protein Engineering Science. Upon entrance to the program, students choose a Protein Engineer\u00ad ing curriculum leading to one of the three degrees. First-year stu\u00ad dents take courses in molecular biology and protein chemistry, structure, and engineering, and complete three laboratory rotations of their choice. Additional elective courses, current literature semi\u00ad nars, and research presentations are used to broaden training in subsequent years. A qualifying examination is administered at the end of the first year for students in the Schools of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and Engineering. For students in Chemistry, a written exami\u00ad nation is administered early in the second year. Students are then expected to select a laboratory and begin work toward completion of a Ph.D. dissertation based upon their own original research. Stu\u00ad dents advance to candidacy for the ph.D. by presenting their dis\u00ad sertation proposal to an examining committee which also guides and advises the students and monitors research progress throughout their graduate training. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years. DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND CELL BIOLOGY 5205A McGaugh Hall; (949) 824-1721 Arthur D.

Weis: Evolutionary ecology of plant-insect interactions; plant population biology Stephen G. Weller: Plant reproductive ecology; plant population ecology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establishment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the organismal func\u00ad tion in ecological time. Faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology study questions pertinent at a variety of lev\u00ad els of biological organization, from molecular aspects of evolution, to organismal structure and performance, to the ecology of ocean ecosystems. Research is conducted in both the laboratory and field and includes work on a variety of organisms from phage and bacte\u00ad ria, to higher plants and animals. Primary attention is given to evolu\u00ad tionary, ecological, and functional questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often col\u00ad laborative and interdisciplinary in approach. Departmental research activities include physiological ecology energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions, microbial ecology and coevolu\u00ad tion, quantitative genetics, life history evolution, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors provide a balance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolutionary, organismal, and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. pro\u00ad gram. A basic course sequence consisting of Ecology and Evolu\u00ad tionary Biology 205, 206, 207, and 208 is recommended for most entering students during their first year. At the end of the first year, students complete an oral examination based upon three of these courses (205, 206, and 208) and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Each entering graduate student chooses a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the stu\u00ad dent meets at least twice each year. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty once each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than six years will be allowed for com\u00ad pletion of the program. Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a comprehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Applicants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathematics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit aptitude and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is January 15. Courses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 200A-B-C Research in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (2 to 12 per quarter) F, W, S.

The Depart\u00ad ment offers credential programs for teaching or administration in the public schools of California, a minor in Educational Studies, an M.A.T. degree in Elementary and Secondary Education, and an Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration. Faculty associated with the Department of Education include researchers and scholars of national and international reputation. Many faculty have taught or served as administrators in public schools, and all are committed to the continued improvement of education through conducting research and the development of more effective approaches to teaching. Teaching and Service Credential Programs The Department of Education offers teacher and school administra\u00ad tor professional preparation programs for California teaching and service credentials. The Department is authorized by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) to offer full-time programs for Cali\u00ad fornia's two basic teaching credentials-the Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dential and the Single Subject Credential. There are two paths avail\u00ad able to obtain each of these teaching credentials: the Intern Teacher Credential Program and the Student Teacher Credential Program. Additionally, the Department offers Administrative Services Cre\u00ad dential programs. MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL A Multiple Subject Teaching Credential authorizes teaching in multiple-subject environments, as well as designated classrooms with English Language Learners, as commonly practiced in Cali\u00ad fornia elementary schools. A Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of a baccalaureate degree and the State\u00ad approved UCI teacher education program which includes student or intern teaching and a Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA). Students must also complete a college-level course or pass an examination on the U.S. Constitution, pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), and verify subject-matter compe\u00ad tence. In addition, candidates for a Multiple Subject Credential are required to pass the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA). This test may be taken during or immediately following completion of the teacher education program. To prove subject matter competence, multiple subject candidates must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) or complete a California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC)-approved subject-matter program. (UCI does not have a subject-matter program for multiple subjects but will honor approved programs from other universities.) Students are tested in the following areas: reading, language and literature, history, social UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 154 UCI 2003-04 Department of Education science, science, mathematics, physical education, human develop\u00ad ment, and visual and performing arts. Multiple subject students must pass all subtests of the CSET or complete at least four-fifths of an approved subject-matter program prior to student or intern teaching. SINGLE SUBJECTTEACHING CREDENTIAL A Single Subject Credential authorizes teaching in a single-subject environment, as well as in designated classrooms with English Language Learners, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and middle/intermediate schools. UCI offers Single Sub\u00ad ject Teaching Credentials in art, English, languages other than English, mathematics, music, sciences, and social science. A Preliminary Single Subject Teaching Credential is awarded by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) upon completion of a baccalaureate degree and the State-approved UCI teacher education program which includes student or intern teach\u00ad ing and a Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA). Students must also complete a college-level course or pass an examination on the U.S. Constitution, pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), and.verify subject-matter competence. California requires all credential candidates to demonstrate subject\u00ad matter competence. Single subject candidates achieve this by pass\u00ad ing the appropriate CSET examination in their subject area or by completing a CCTC-approved subject-matter program in the teach\u00ad ing area. UCI offers CCTC-approved subject-matter programs in English, Social Science, and Latin, which are available to under\u00ad graduate students majoring in English, Social Science, and Clas\u00ad sics, respectively. Consult an academic counselor in the Depart\u00ad ment of Education for more detailed information. INTERN TEACHER PROGRAM Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential requirements. The stipend is paid by a school district. To serve as an intern, the student must be admitted to the Department of Education Intern Teacher Program, selected by a school district, and be eligible for an Intern Credential. Eligibility requirements for an Intern Credential include: a baccalaureate degree, current tuberculin test clearance, Certificate of Clearance, passage of the CBEST, verification of subject-matter competence, and passage of a course or college-level examination on the U.S. Constitution.

Student teaching for Single Subject candidates (grades 7-12) is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for one full public school semester in an appropriate classroom setting. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Department of Education and are contingent upon a Certificate of Clearance, a UC IRVINE - 2003-2004current tuberculin test clearance, academic preparation clearances including CBEST, and verification of subject-matter competence. Advancement to student teaching is limited to those candidates who are adjudged to be professionally ready to assume such responsibilities. Such readiness shall be determined by, but not be limited to, the candidate's academic work, professional deport\u00ad ment, and potential for success in teaching. Failure to be advanced to student teaching will be considered good cause for removal and/or a leave of absence from the program. A grade of B or better is required in all courses and in student teaching for successful completion of the program. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other CCTC and Departmental requirements are met, the student is eligible for a credential recommendation by UCI. STUDENT TEACHER PROGRAM WITH BCLAD (SPANISH) EMPHASIS Students who are bilingual in Spanish (as .ascertained through test\u00ad ing) may be eligible for the Bilingual Crosscultural, Language, and Academic Development (BCLAD, emphasis in Spanish) credential. Students should consult an academic counselor in the Department of Education for more detailed information. SUPPLEMENTARY AND ADDITIONAL TEACHING AUTHORIZATIONS After acquiring a basic credential, it is possible to add further teaching authorizations. Students wishing to be authorized in more than one subject area may qualify in either of two ways: 1. Students may c.;omplete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in specific college-level course work to qualify for a supplementary authorization to teach in areas other than the major teaching area. Consult an academic counselor in the Department of Education for details. 2. Students may pass the appropriate examinations in any area of their choice and successfully complete specified additional course work. Subject to approval by CCTC, they will then qual\u00ad ify for the additional teaching authorization in that subject. PREPARATION FOR APPLYING TO THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS Eligibility for admission is supported by passing the CBEST, pro\u00ad viding evidence of possession of/application for a Certificate of Clearance, and successfully completing the appropriate subject area examinations or an approved subject-matter program. Registration for examinations must be made well in advance of test dates. Students are urged to contact the Department of Education for information about the tests and test dates at least one year before credential program application deadlines. The Department of Education requires appropriate field experi\u00ad ences or other professional life experiences that are preparation for the teaching profession, prior to entering the program. Course credit for field experience is available through, for example, Edu\u00ad cation 100, 103, and 160/160L, as well as through other University programs. Field experience can also be earned by other appropriate activities, e.g., tutoring, assisting in public school classrooms. Admission to the Credential Programs Information and applications are available from the Department of Education, 2000 Berkeley Place. Admission is based on a broad index, including but not limited to the following: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the Department of Education. Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to a Education 155 credential are not guaranteed admission to the program; admission through the regular graduate admissions process is required. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation are required for admission. These letters should relate to the student's potential for success in teaching or administration and should indi\u00ad cate the student's ability to perform academic work. For applicants to the teaching credential programs, at least one letter should focus on experiences related to teaching. CBEST. Evidence of having passed the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test must accompany the application for admission. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a Certificate of Clearance from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). Applicants must provide evi\u00ad dence of filing for this Certificate along with their application for admission to the Department of Education. Contact an academic counselor in the Department of Education for advice on how to handle this process. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES CREDENTIAL Services credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel ser\u00ad vices, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs leading to the Administrative Services Credential generally required for school administrators. There are two tiers of the Administrative Services Credential. In the first tier, a candidate obtains the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential by completing the approved program of 36 quarter units and a comprehensive examination. This credential also requires a valid basic credential, three years of full-time teach\u00ad ing or services experience, and passage of the CBEST. After an administrative position is obtained, the individual must begin the Professional Clear Administrative Services Credential (tier two) program. The UCI Professional Clear program requires the completion of an additional 38 quarter units (120 hours of non\u00ad University work or other structured programs may substitute for 12 of these units) and two years of successful full\"time school administrative experience in a position which requires the Prelimi\u00ad nary Administrative Services Credential. Some courses in the Pro\u00ad fessional Clear Administrative Services program are applicable to the Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration at UCI. Students interested in. these credentials should make an appoint\u00ad ment with an academic counselor in the Department of Education. Undergraduate Minor in Educational Studies \u00b7 The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education, and provides a strong foundation for K-12 teaching. The program consists of a coordinated set of courses which includes an introductory level course and several advanced courses in the field of education. A number of the minor's elective courses are offered by other acade\u00ad mic units. Students who plan to apply for admission to a credential program in the UCI Department of Education (or at other institutions) will enhance their admissibility through taking the minor's coordinated set of courses and will acquire a strong basic foundation for their advanced work. Students who do not eventually choose education as a career path will have gained a valuable knowledge base applicable to many other occupations and to roles as citizens, par\u00ad ents, and volunteers. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 156 UCI 2003-04 Department of Education Requirements The minor requires completion of a minimum of seven courses (at least five of which must be upper-division) totaling 28 units drawn from the four required areas of study shown below and from the approved electives. No more than two courses from the student's major area of study may be used for completion of the minor. Area 1. Educational systems, issues, and reforms: Origins, Pur\u00ad poses, and Central Issues in K-12 Education (Education 50). Area 2. Learning and the learning process: either Learning The\u00ad ory and Classroom Practices (Education 173) or Psychology of Learning, Abilities, and Intelligence (Education 176). Each of these courses also fulfills a prerequisite requirement for the Department's fifth-year teacher credential programs. Area 3. Educational contexts and influences: There are two requirements in Area 3: (1) a course that focuses on K-12 educa\u00ad tion/schooling and (2) fieldwork in K-12 schools. To satisfy the fieldwork requirement, students must be involved in at least 20 clock hours of verified observation and/or service in the schools. Courses which include fieldwork are: Educational Strategies for Tutoring and Teacher Aiding (Education 100), Advanced Tutoring (Education 103), Multimedia and the Arts in the Multicultural Classroom (Education 104E), Multicultural Education in K-12 Schools (Education 124), Changing the High School Experience (Education 150), and Practicum in After-School Learning and Inquiry (Education 160, 160L). Department of Education courses that meet the course requirement in this area but do not include fieldwork are: Children, Schools and Cinema (Education 125), Mainstreaming Special and General Edu\u00ad cation (Education 162), Foundations of Education (Education 175), and Health Education for Teachers (Education 380).

Taking one of these courses in combination with 20 clock hours of verified obser\u00ad vation and/or service in the schools under the auspices of campus outreach programs or through independent observation or service in K-12 schools will fulfill both requirements in this area. Area 4. Subject-matter content and pedagogy: This area requires completion of one course focusing on an academic disci\u00ad pline of the student's choice which has direct applicability to K-12 instruction. A list of courses approved for Area 4 is available in the Department of Education. NOTE: In addition to the approved courses shown, a variety of other courses may be appropriate for Areas 3 and 4. Students must have these additional courses pre-approved by the Department of Education Faculty Advisor. Only two courses may be chosen from the student's major area of study. Electives. The remaining courses needed to complete the seven\u00ad course minor may be selected from any approved courses that are not used to meet an area requirement or from other courses deemed appropriate by the Faculty Advisor. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be successfully completed at UCI.

MASTER OF ARTS IN TEACHING IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION The Department of Education offers an M.A.T. degree program in Elementary and Secondary Education. The 15-month program is designed for candidates with a baccalaureate degree who wish to earn a teaching credential in conjunction with an advanced degree. The M.A.T. program consists of a one-year teacher credential pro\u00ad gram of the student's choice (Multiple Subject or Single Subject), and a total of six additional courses spread over the summers before and after the credential program. Candidates planning to earn a Single Subject credential and to teach in secondary schools are expected to have an academic major in the subject they plan to teach. The combination of the M.A.T. courses with the UCI creden\u00ad tial program provides a theoretical and empirical framework for can\u00ad didates who may later be interested in working toward National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification, after three years of successful teaching. Admission Candidates complete a Supplementary Application to the M.A.T. program. Successful candidates must meet the general admission requirements of the UCI Office of Research and Graduate Studies and must be admitted to a credential program offered by the Department of Education. Selection of candidates is based on the overall strength of each applicant's undergraduate preparation, three letters of recommendation from individuals who are familiar with the applicant's ability to pursue graduate study, and scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), the California Basic Educational Skills Test, and the CSET. (The CSET may be waived if a candidate has successfully completed an approved subject-mat\u00ad ter program in his or her content area). Program of Study During the summer prior to beginning the credential program, stu\u00ad dents admitted to the M.A.T. program enroll in three courses: Teachers' Lives and Professional Development (Education 201), Outcomes of Schooling and Student Assessment (Education 202), and The Nature of Research and Inquiry in Education (Education 203). In the summer following completion of their credential pro\u00ad gram, M.A.T. candidates enroll in three courses: Reflective Prac\u00ad tice in Teaching (Education 204), Teacher Portfolios and Assess\u00ad ment (Education 205), and Instructional Design and Educational Technologies (Education 240).

DOCTORAL DEGREE IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION The Department of Education, in cooperation with the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, offers an Ed.D. degree program in Educa\u00ad tional Administration. This program of part-time study aims to pre\u00ad pare outstanding educational leaders who are able to articulate and accomplish important improvements in educational practice while attending to the complex demographic, social, 'and economic chal\u00ad lenges faced by K-12 education. The program emphasizes a range of social and behavioral science frameworks and research method\u00ad ologies relevant to scholarship about schooling and thus provides a broad base of knowledge applicable to K-12 school leadership. Emphasis also is placed on using theory and research to select, orchestrate, and implement useful and effective educational practices. Admission Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and scores from the General Test of the Graduate Record Examination. Other requirements include samples of written work and demon\u00ad strated evidence of potential for leadership in school administra\u00ad tion, educational policy, or other fields pertinent to school practice and educational scholarship. Program of Study The program is designed for full-time employed professionals. Course work is covered in three academic years and four summers of study prior to the dissertation. Students typically enroll in eight units per quarter during the academic year. All courses are required, except that a student may petition to take a substitute course at UCLA. Students admitted to the program are expected to take all courses on schedule. First-Year Requirements First-year courses.

Third-Year Requirements In the third year, students complete their study of research and eval\u00ad uation tools with two courses: Applications to Education of Social and Psychological Theories and Research Methods (Education 285A) and Data Analysis in Education Research and Evaluation (Education 287). Students also spend the third year developing their dissertation proposals: Third-Year Seminar (Education 259B-C). Oral Qualifying Examination. In the third year, students take an oral qualifying examination administered by a five-person Candi\u00ad dacy Committee. The examination consists of a review by the com\u00ad mittee of the student's dissertation proposal and examination of the student's competence in areas specified in the proposal. Students who do not pass in the first attempt have one opportunity to retake the examination within three months. Advancement to Candidacy After the completion of all required courses, and passing the first\u00ad year written comprehensive examination and the oral qualifying examination, students will advance to candidacy. Dissertation Research and writing of the dissertation are undertaken in the fourth (and fifth, if necessary) year of the program. Students enroll in Dissertation Research (Education 299) once they begin their dis\u00ad sertation research. At the completion of the dissertation work, the doctoral committee conducts a final oral examination during which the candidate defends the dissertation. Time Limits The required program of study is designed to be completed on a part-time basis in four to five years. A leave of absence or other exception to the program of study will only be considered under special circumstances.

Ziaka-Vasileiadou, Ph.D. University of Southern California, Lecturer in Civil and Environmental Engineering Overview The academic mission of The Henry Samueli School of Engineer\u00ad ing has been developed to be consistent with the missions and goals set for it by the State of California, the University of Califor\u00ad nia, and the University of California, Irvine (UCI) campus. Specifi\u00ad cally, the academic mission of the School is to provide a stimulat\u00ad ing academic environment for individuals interested in the application of science and the development of new technologies for the benefit of society, and to provide a-supportive environment for each program to meet its unique objectives. The individual engineering and related programs have published program objectives that are consistent with the missions and goals of the University of California and UCI, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Accreditation Board for Engineer\u00ad ing and Technology (ABET) General Criteria for Accrediting Pro\u00ad grams in Engineering in the United States. The School offers undergraduate majors in Aerospace Engineering (AE), Biomedical Engineering (BME), Biomedical Engineering: Premedical (BMEP), Chemical Civil Engineer\u00ad . ing (CE), Computer Engineering (CpE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE, a joint program with the School of Information and Computer Science), Electrical Engineering (EE), Engineering (a general program, GE), Environmental Engineering (EnE), Mate\u00ad rials Science Engineering (MSE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). The majors in Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Elec\u00ad trical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Aerospace Engineering considers the flight characteristics, perfor\u00ad mance, and design of aircraft and spacecraft. An upper-division series of courses in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and con\u00ad trol follows a common core with Mechanical Engineering. The skills acquired in those courses are integrated in the capstone aero\u00ad space design course. The intent of the program is to produce highly proficient engineers who can tackle the aerospace engineering challenges of the future. See pages 213-218. Biomedical Engineering applies fundamental engineering princi\u00ad ples to solve complex problems that are fundamentally medical in nature, and focuses at improving the quality of health care by advancing technology and reducing costs. Examples include advanced biomedical imaging systems, the design of microscale diagnostic systems, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. Two bachelor's degree programs are offered-Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering and Biomedical Engineering: Premedical. The former con\u00ad tains more engineering content and less biology whereas the latter is geared toward preparing students for admission to medical school. See pages 179-183. Engineering 167 Chemical Engineering applies the knowledge of chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities to solve societal problems in areas such as energy, health, the environment, food, textiles, shelter, semiconductors, and homeland security. Employ\u00ad ment opportunities exist in various industries such as chemical, petroleum, polymer, pharmaceutical, food, textile, fuel, consumer products, and semiconductor, as well as in local, state, and federal governments. See pages 184-190. Civil Engineering addresses the challenges oflarge-scale engi\u00ad neering projects of importance to society as a whole, such as water distribution, transportation, and building design. Specializations are provided in General Civil, Environmental, Structural, Transporta\u00ad tion Information and Control Systems, and Water Resource Engi\u00ad neering. See pages 193-198. Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digi\u00ad tal computers, including both software and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI circuits, data base, software engineering, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, and data structures and algorithms. Courses include program\u00ad ming in high-level languages such as Python, Java, C, C++; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system soft\u00ad ware such as editors, compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; application of computers in solving engineering problems,. and lab\u00ad oratories in both hardware and software experiences. See pages 202-210. Computer Science and Engineering is designed to provide stu\u00ad dents with the fundamentals of hardware and software computer science and the application of engineering concepts, techniques, and methods to both computer systems engineering and software engineering. See pages 202-210. Electrical Engineering is one of the major contributors to the modernization of our society. Many of the most basic and perva\u00ad sive products and services are either based on or related to the sci\u00ad entific and engineering principles taught at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Students can spe\u00ad cialize in three general areas of studies-Electro-optics and Solid\u00ad State Devices, Power Electronics and Power Systems, and Systems and Signal Processing-all at the forefront of technological advancement. See pages 202-210. The major in Engineering is a special program of study for upper\u00ad division students who wish to combine the study of engineering principles with other areas such as the physical and biological sci-. ences, social and behavioral science, humanities, and arts. Students may construct their own specialization. See pages 172-173. Environmental Engineering concerns the development of strate\u00ad gies to control and minimize pollutant emissions, to treat waste, and to remediate polluted natural systems. Emphasis areas include air quality and combustion, water quality, and water resources engi\u00ad neering. See pages 193-198. Materials Science Engineering is concerned with the generation and application of knowledge relating the composition, structure, and synthesis of materials to their properties and applications. Dur\u00ad ing the past two decades, Materials Science Engineering has become an indispensable component of modern engineering educa\u00ad tion, partly because of the crucial role materials play in national defense, the quality of life, and the economic security and competi\u00ad tiveness of the nation; and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an integral part of almost every modern engineering design. Emphasis in the Materials Science Engineering curriculum is placed on: the synthesis, characterization, and prop\u00ad erties of advanced functional materials; analysis, selection, and design related to the use of materials; the application of computers to materials problems; and the presence of an interdisciplinary theme that allows a qualified student to combine any engineering UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 168 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering major with the Materials Science Engineering major. See pages 185-190. Mechanical Engineering considers the design, control, and motive power of fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems ranging from microelectronics to spacecraft to the human body. Specializations allow students to focus their technical electives in the areas of Aero\u00ad space Engineering, Computers in Engineering Design, Energy Sys\u00ad tems, Environmental Engineering, Flow Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Systems, and Propulsion Systems. See pages 213-218. The School offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineer\u00ad ing; Chemical and Biochemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering, with concentrations in Elec\u00ad trical Engineering, Computer Networks and Distributed Comput\u00ad ing, and Computer Systems and Software; Engineering, with con\u00ad centrations in Arts, Computation, and Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Protein Engi\u00ad neering Science; Materials Science and Engineering; and Mechani\u00ad cal and Aerospace Engineering.

UNDERGRADUATE STUDY Student Affairs Office 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer; (949) 824-4334 John LaRue, Associate Dean PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Advising Academic advising is available from academic counselors and peer advisors in the School's Student Affairs Office, 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer, and from faculty advisors. Students must realize, however, that ultimately they alone are responsible for the planning of their own program and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students are encouraged to consult with the academic counselors in the Engineering Student Affairs Office whenever they desire to change their program of study. All Engineering majors are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part-time employment or extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can stay on track by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. High-achieving students may declare a double major. Early consul\u00ad tation with the School is advisable. Required courses may be replaced by other courses if the student substantiates the merits of the program of study and obtains prior approval from faculty in the School. Students should be aware that most Engineering courses require the completion of prerequisites. The sample programs shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses in the freshman and sophomore years in order to enroll in any upper-division Engineering course. School policy does not permit the addition or deletion of Engineer\u00ad ing courses after the second week of the quarter. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic stand\u00ad ing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Undergraduate Studies Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Students are required to complete UCI's lower-division writing requirement (see the Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree sec\u00ad tion) during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level language such as FORTRAN, Python, C, C++, and/or Java) is expected in all Engineering courses. Students in the School, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are courses which do not fulfill the major requirements and the breadth courses (except for courses taken in fulfillment of the University Subject A requirement). Admissions The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year make it beneficial for students to begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wish\u00ad ing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 2004 must have submitted their completed application forms during the priority filing period (November 1-30, 2003). High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram must have completed four years of mathematics and are advised to have completed one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement UC IRVINE - 2003-2004courses, is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to an Engi\u00ad neering major during periods of restricted enrollments. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT I and three SAT II examination scores by mid-January, 2004. Applicants must apply for admission to a specific Engineering major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. Transfer students may be admitted to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering either from another major at UCI or from another college or university. A student seeking admission to The Henry Samueli School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy University requirements for admission with advanced standing and should complete appropriate prerequisites for their major of choice. It is to the student's advantage to\u00b7 com\u00ad plete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) or UCI breadth and lower-division requirements prior to transfer. Since requirements vary from major to major, those con\u00ad templating admission with advanced standing to the School should consult each Department's Catalogue section and the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, (949) 824-6703, for the specific requirements of each program. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-4334. Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the approval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exer\u00ad cises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a stu\u00ad dent has completed at UCI.

Calls for proposals are issued in the fall and spring quarters. Projects supported by UROP may be done at any time during the academic year and/or summer, and the research performed must meet established academic standards and emphasize interaction between the student and the faculty supervisor. In addition, all students participating in faculty-guided research activities are wel\u00ad come to submit their research papers for faculty review and possible publication in the annual UCI Undergraduate Research Journal. For more information, contact the UROP Office, 1100 Student Ser\u00ad vices II; telephone M.S. and M.SJPh.D. Program in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduate Engineering students with a minimum cumulative 3.5 GPA may, during their junior or senior year, apply for streamlined admission into an M.S. program within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Streamlined admission would allow a student to petition for exemption from UCI's GRE requirement for graduate school admission. (The exemption applies only to current UCI students applying for admission to one of the M.S. programs in the UCI Henry Samueli School of Engineering; other graduate schools may still require the GRE.) The student would request GRE exemption at the time of applying. Streamlined admission applicants would otherwise and in all other ways be evaluated in the same manner as other applicants to the School's graduate programs. Occasionally, a candidate for stream\u00ad lined admission may be required by the faculty to submit GRE scores in support of the graduate application. In such cases the stu\u00ad dent will be informed in writing within two weeks following receipt of the application package. St].ldents offered admission under the streamlined procedures may, upon completion of the undergraduate degree program and follow\u00ad ing matriculation as a graduate student, petition to credit toward M.S. degree requirements up to 18 units of graduate-level course work completed in excess of requirements for the UCI bachelor's degree. Students who wish to apply for early admission to the M.S./Ph.D. program may do so in their senior year but must take the GRE prior to admission. Undergraduate streamlined admission students admitted to an M.S. or M.S./Ph.D. program within The Henry Samueli School of Engi\u00ad neering may also petition their department to use up to eight units of 199 Individual Study to meet undergraduate degree require\u00ad ments, either as design units or as preliminary preparation for their master's thesis work. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Education Abroad Program Upper-division and graduate Engineering students may participate in a number of programs which offer unique opportunities for edu\u00ad cation and training abroad. The University's Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram (EAP) offers engineering course work for UCI academic credit at a number of universities. Some of the EAP-affiliated engi\u00ad neering schools require proficiency in the host country's language, while others are English speaking. Study abroad may postpone the student's graduation for one or two quarters, depending primarily on the student's language preparation (which can begin in the fresh\u00ad man year), but the added experience can add to the student's matu\u00ad rity and professional competence. EAP students pay regular UCI fees and keep any scholarships they may have. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the Education Abroad Program section. STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND ORGANIZATIONS Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving personnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encouraged and expected to partici\u00ad pate in the development of School policy.

Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.S. in Engineering with a con\u00ad centration in Arts, Computation, and Engineering is to provide stu\u00ad dents with a broad-based and interdisciplinary training at the inter\u00ad section of digital technology and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordinated across the School of Information and Computer Science, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic, and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immersive and aug\u00ad mented environments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the\u00ad sis, in addition to completion of course work. The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Engineer\u00ad ing 270), four ACE studio/labs (Engineering 271-277), two ACE project internships (Engineering 279), and one quarter of ACE the\u00ad sis research (Engineering 279). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core categories may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Electives: a minimum of four graduate electives in Engineering (12-16 units, depending on whether the courses carry credit of three or four units), which will support the student's area of spe\u00ad cialization and must be approved by the student's Engineering fac\u00ad ulty advisor. Two additional breadth electives: that may be chosen by the stu\u00ad dent in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by the candidate's advisor.\u00b7 A program faculty member from Engineering will advise on elec\u00ad tive selection and may be on the thesis committee.

Sanders: Environmenial and computational fluid dynamics, water resources engineering Jan Scherfig: Biological treatment, water reclamation and reuse, waste. treatment Roland Schinzinger: Electric energy systems William A. Sirignano: Combustion, pollutant formation, fire spread, noise suppression Environmental Engineering addresses the development of strategies to control anthropogenic emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere, waterways, and terrestrial environment; the remediation of polluted natural systems; the design of technologies to treat waste; fire safety; noise suppression; energy efficiency; and the evaluation of contaminant fate in urban environments. Environmental engineer\u00ad ing issues are now an important component in the development of many engineering technologies and consequently are an important \u00b7 aspect of an engineering education. The discipline itself is interdis\u00ad ciplinary and requires a curriculum that provides students with an understanding of fundamentals in air-and water-quality sciences, contaminant fate and transport, and design concepts for pollutant emission control and treatment. To avoid the development of envi\u00ad ronmental engineering solutions which only transform one form of pollution to another, modem engineering education programs must require exposure and familiarity with a greater number of subjects than ever before. Environmental engineers with an interdisciplinary background are particularly sought to address the complex infrastructure needs of today's society, where they must be able to communicate with teams of scientists and engineers from different disciplines. Envi\u00ad ronmental engineering graduates who meet this description can expect to remain in strong demand in the private and public employment sectors, and their range of career opportunities is highly diverse. Examples of career fields and activities include the development of new technologies to genetically engineer microor\u00ad ganisms for waste treatment, design of combustion and control processes that minimize pollutant emissions and maximize energy efficiency, resolution of complex pollutant transport processes in naturally heterogeneous systems, development of new physical\u00ad chemical treatment approaches, and characterization of pollutant transformation mechanisms in natural systems. Curricular and research subjects of interest in Environmental Engi\u00ad neering include environmental air and water chemistry, environ\u00ad mental microbiology, combustion technologies, aerosol science, transport phenomena, reactor theory, unit operations and systems design, mathematical modeling, energy systems, soil physics, fluid mechanics, hydrology, and meteorology. Interdisciplinary research endeavors commonly bridge many of these different subjects and a Engineering 175 current focus is maintained on new and emerging technologies. Curriculum objectives have also been set to maintain a balance between the depth and breadth of program scope for each student. Students may pursue either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Engineering. Required Background The interdisciplinary nature of the program allows students with a variety of backgrounds to undertake studies in this field. Students with a background in engineering-particularly chemical, civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering-as well as scientists from biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics, are encouraged to participate. Students admitted to the program are expected to have had rigor\u00ad ous undergraduate exposure to a number of relevant subject areas including air quality, environmental chemistry, fluid mechanics, microbial processes, and reactor theory and design. The degree to which each student meets the program's background requirement is determined by participating faculty at the time of admission. Stu\u00ad dents with an insufficient background who are offered admission will be required to take a set of appropriate prerequisite courses. Prerequisite work typically involves at least two and frequently as many as five or six upper-division, undergraduate courses each of which must be completed with a final grade of B or better. Occa\u00ad sionally, lower-division work in chemistry, mathematics, or physics is required. The student's specific prerequisite course work require\u00ad ment, if any, is stated the letter of admission. The background requirement establishes a common foundation for graduate study in the program. Not all students are required to take prerequisite course work; those who are may do so following matriculation iri the graduate program. In addition, M.S. students may use a limited amount of upper-division course work taken to meet the background requirement in partial fulfillment of graduate degree requirements. Although this list is not exhaustive, commonly required prerequi\u00ad site courses within each of the required background areas are as follows: Air Quality: Engineering MAEllO, MAE162, or MAE164. Environmental or CBEMS 116/216. Reactor Theory and Design: CBEMSllO. Core Requirement Students must complete an advanced mathematics course, either CBEMS230 (Applied Engineering Mathematics 1), CEE283 (Mathematical Methods in Engineering Analysis), or MAE200B (Engineering Analysis II). Areas of Emphasis Each student selects a primary area of emphasis within Environ\u00ad mental Engineering: Water Quality, Water Resources, or Air Qual\u00ad ity and Combustion. To achieve the interdisciplinary objectives of the program, students are required to take at least two electives outside their primary area, one each in two different areas. These outside\u00b7 electives may also be taken from approved courses in other academic units, including the Schools of Social Ecology and Phys\u00ad ical Science, and the College of Medicine. Electives within each of the emphasis areas in Engineering are listed below. Water Quality: CBEMS210 (Reaction Engineering), CBEMS214 (Bioremediation), (Transport Phenomena), CBEMS234 (Bioreactor Engineering), CEE263 (Advanced Biological Treatment Processes), Treatment Models), CEE269 (Haz\u00ad ardous Waste Treatment and Disposal), Earth System Science 201B (Global Biogeochemistry).

MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for M.S. degree students: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the completion of 36 units of study. Study plans for both options must also include two graduate courses from outside the student's pri\u00ad mary area of emphasis. Plan I. Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must com\u00ad plete an original research investigation and a thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. Of the 36 required units, at least 20 must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either CBEMS230, MAE200B, or CEE283. A maximum of eight M.S. research units and up to eight units of upper-division undergraduate elective courses may be applied to the degree with the prior approval of a faculty advisor. Plan II. Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either CBEMS230, MAE200B, or CEE283. Up to 12 units may be taken as upper-divi\u00ad sion undergraduate elective courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Environmental Engineering requires the achievement of original and significant research that advances the discipline. Doctoral students are selected on the basis of an out\u00ad standing record of scholarship and potential for research excellence. The doctoral study program is tailored to the individual student in consultation with a faculty advisory committee. There are no spe\u00ad cific course requirements, however, additional mathematics courses beyond those required for a M.S. degree are generally required, reflecting the student's specific research interests. Within this flexi\u00ad ble framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that out\u00ad line the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral stu\u00ad dents should consult the Environmental Engineering program guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty, passage within the first year of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success, research prepara\u00ad tion, formal advancement to candidacy by passing a qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. Committees for preliminary and Ph.D. qualifying examinations and the doctoral committee must have at least one Environmental Engi\u00ad neering faculty member from outside the student's area of emphasis. The student's dissertation topic must be approved by the student's doctoral committee. The degree is granted upon the recommenda\u00ad tion of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

Tsai: Integrated optic devices, circuits, materials; acoustic microscopy with applications to materials, device characterization Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is concerned with the generation and application of knowledge relating the composition, structure, and processing of materials to their properties and appli\u00ad cations. During the past two decades, MSE has become an impor\u00ad tant component of modern engineering education, partly because of the increased \u00b7level of sophistication required of engineering mate\u00ad rials in a rapidly changing technological society, and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an inte\u00ad gral part of almost every modern engineering design. In fact, fur\u00ad ther improvements in design are now viewed more and more as primarily a materials issue. Both the development of new materials and the understanding of present-day materials demand a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scientific principles including, for example, crystal structure, mechanics, mechanical behavior, electronic, optical and magnetic behavior, thermodynamics, phase equilibria, heat transfer, diffusion, and the physics and chemistry of solids. The field of MSE ranks high on the list of top careers for scientists and engineers. The services of these engineers and scientists are required in a variety of engineering operations dealing, for exam\u00ad ple, with design of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high\u00ad temperature superconductivity, biomedical products, performance UC IRVINE - 2003-2004(quality, reliability, safety, energy efficiency) in automobile and aircraft components, improvement in nondestructive testing tech\u00ad niques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, and fabrication of steels. Subjects of interest in Materials Science and Engineering cover a wide spectrum, ranging from metals, optical and electronic materi\u00ad als to superconductive materials, ceramics, advanced composites, and biomaterials. In addition, the emerging new research and tech\u00ad nological areas in materials are in many cases interdisciplinary. Accordingly, the principal objective of the graduate curriculum is to integrate a student's area of emphasis-whether it be structural materials, chemical processing, mechanics of solids, or electronic devices-into the whole of material science and engineering. Such integration will breed familiarity with other disciplines and provide students with the breadth they need to face the challenges of cur\u00ad rent and future technology. Students may pursue either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Engineering. Recommended Background Given the nature of Materials Science and Engineering as an inter\u00ad disciplinary program, students having a background and suitable training in either Materials, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical), or the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Geology) are encouraged to participate. Recommended background courses include an introduction to materials, thermodynamics, mechanical behavior, and electrical/optical/magnetic behavior. A student with an insufficient background may be required to take remedial undergraduate courses following matriculation as a gradu\u00ad ate student. Core Requirement Because of the interdepartmental nature of the concentration, it is important to establish a common foundation in Materials Science and Engineering for students from various backgrounds. This foun\u00ad dation is sufficiently covered in MSE courses that are listed below and that deal with the following topics: Crystal Structure and Crystal Defects: MSE200 (Advanced Con\u00ad cepts in Materials). Physical and Electrical Properties: MSE205 (Physical and Electric Properties of Engineering Materials). Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena: one course from MSE252A (Theory of Diffusion), MSE253 (Kinetic Phenomena in Materials), CBEMS240 (Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics), or Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory). Processing of Materials: one course from ECE116 (Wafer Fabrica\u00ad tion Processes), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), or MSE257B (Solidification Processes). Electives These electives represent courses in areas of emphasis. Typical examples for elective courses in various areas of emphasis are listed below. Chemical Processing: CBEMS210 (Reaction Engineering), CBEMS220 (Transport Phenomena), CBEMS230 1), CBEMS240 (Chemical Engineering Ther\u00ad modynamics), MSE210 Techniques Electronic Devices), ECE279A, (Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics I, II). Mechanics of Solids: CEE242 (Advanced Strength of Materials), CEE243 (Mechanics of Composite Materials), CEE246 (Structural Engineering 177 Performance and Failure), CEE281 (Finite Element Method in Continuum Mechanics). Optoelectronics Packaging: CEE281 Element Method in Continuum Mechanics), CBEMS280 (Optoelectronics Packaging), ECE176 (Engineering Optics for Medical Applications), ECE176L (Engineering Optics for Medical Applications Laboratory), ECE178 (Optical Electronics), ECE249 (Micro Sensors and Devices), Fiber Optics), MSE272 (Microelectronic and Photonic Materials and Technology). Physics and Chemistry of Materials: Chemistry 213 (Chemical Kinetics), Chemistry 225 (Polymer Chemistry), Chemistry 230 (Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory), Chemistry 252 (Special Topics in Physical Chemistry), Physics 221 (Elasticity), Physics 239A (Plasma Physics), Mathematics 292A (Applied Mathematics). \u00b7 Structural Materials: MSE210 (Materials Characterization Tech\u00ad niques and Analysis), MSE251 (Dislocation Theory), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), MSE255B (Science of Compos\u00ad ite Materials), MSE256A (Fracture of Engineering Materials), MSE258 (Computer Techniques in Experimental Materials Research), MSE259A (Theory of Electron Microscopy), ME200B (Engineering Analysis). It should be noted that specific course requirements within the areas of emphasis are decided based on consultation with the Director of the MSE concentration and the faculty advisor; that in selecting electives, students are encouraged to take courses which are not in their area of emphasis; and that MSE courses which are not selected to satisfy the core requirement can also serve as elec\u00ad tives under the Structural Materials emphasis. Furthermore, stu\u00ad dents in the MSE concentration who are interested in an area of emphasis other than Structural Materials are urged to take one course which covers aspects related to mechanical behavior such as Dislocation Theory (MSE251) and Fracture of Engineering Materi\u00ad als (MSE256A). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE A minimum of 36 units is required for the M.S. degree. Two options are available, a thesis option and a comprehensive exami\u00ad nation option. For the thesis option, students are required to com\u00ad plete a research study of great depth and originality and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. At least 21 units must be taken from courses numbered 200- 289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and nine units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of MSE296, ECE296, CBEMS296, or CEE296 and up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses taken as a graduate student at UCI can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. For the comprehensive examina\u00ad tion option, students are required to complete 36 units of study. At least 24 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, \u00b7 among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and 12 units are in the area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses taken as a graduate student at UCI can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collaboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After sub\u00ad stantial academic preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 178 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the produc\u00ad tion of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the follow\u00ad ing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor during the student's first year of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for doing research, comple\u00ad tion of The Henry Samueli School of Engineering teaching require\u00ad ments, and the development of a research proposal; passing the qualifying examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed research; successful com\u00ad pletion of the research; development and approval of the disserta\u00ad tion; presentation of the dissertation and a final examination on its contents. There is no foreign language requirement. The preliminary examination, to be taken during the second year of the Ph.D. program, is based on the core courses in MSE and courses taken in the area of emphasis. The examination committee is appointed by the MSE Director with subsequent approval by the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be com\u00ad pleted within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

Biomedical engineering combines engineering expertise with med\u00ad ical needs for the enhancement of health care. It is a branch of engineering in which knowledge and skills are developed and applied to define and solve problems in biology and medicine. Stu\u00ad dents choose the biomedical engineering field to be of service to people, for the excitement of working with living systems, and to apply advanced technology to the complex problems of medical care. Biomedical engineers may be called upon to design instru\u00ad ments and devices, to bring together knowledge from many_ sources to develop new procedures, or to carry out research to acquire knowledge needed to solve new problems. During the last 20 years, we have witnessed unprecedented advances in engineering, medical care, and the life sciences. The combination of exploding knowledge and technology in biology, medicine, the physical sciences, and engineering, coupled with the changes in the way health care will be delivered in the next cen\u00ad tury, provide a fertile ground for biomedical engineering. Biomed\u00ad ical engineering, at the confluence of these fields, has played a vital role in this progress. Traditionally, engineers have been con\u00ad cerned with inanimate materials, devices, and systems, while life scientists have investigated biological structure and function. Bio\u00ad medical engineers integrate these disciplines in a unique way, com\u00ad bining the methodologies of the physical sciences and engineering with the study of biological and medical problems. The collabora\u00ad tion between engineers, physicians, biologists, and physical scien\u00ad tists is an integral part of this endeavor and has produced many important discoveries in the areas of artificial organs, artificial implants, and diagnostic equipment. The Department offers a B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering, a four-year engineering curriculum. This program prepares students for a wide variety of careers in Biomedical Engineering in indus\u00ad try, hospitals, and research laboratories or for further education in graduate school. The Department also offers a B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineer\u00ad ing: Premedical, a four-year engineering curriculum taken with required premedical courses. It is one of many majors that can serve as preparation for further training in medical, veterinary, or allied health professions. It is also suitable for students interested in pursuing graduate work in Biomedical Engineering and other biomedical areas such as physiology, neurosciences, and bioinfor\u00ad matics. The curriculum has less engineering content but more bio\u00ad logical sciences than the Biomedical Engineering major. Biomedical Engineering 179 Areas of graduate study and research include biomechanics, tissue engineering, biomedical computation, biophotonics, and biomed\u00ad ical nanoscale systems. Undergraduate Major in Biomedical Engineering Program Objectives: (1) provide students with a solid foundation and training in the fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering; (2) provide a broad background in engineering sciences and their application to biomedical problems through design and problem\u00ad based learning; (3) provide opportunities for teamwork, clinical and industrial rotations, independent research, open-ended problem solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning; and (4) prepare students for a career in the biomedical engineering industry or graduate school. Biomedical Engineering students learn engineering and principles of biology, physiology, chemistry, and physics. They may go on to design devices to diagnose and treat disease, engineer tissues to repair wounds, develop cutting-edge genetic treatments, or create computer programs to understand how the human body works. The curriculum emphasizes education in the fundamentals of engi\u00ad neering sciences that form the common basis of all engineering subspecialties. Education with this focus is intended to provide stu\u00ad dents with a solid engineering foundation for a career in which engineering practice may change rapidly. In addition, elements of bioengineering design are incorporated at every level in the cur\u00ad riculum. This is accomplished by integration of laboratory experi\u00ad mentation, computer applications, and exposure to real bioengi\u00ad neering problems throughout the program. Students also work as teams in senior design project courses to solve multidisciplinary problems suggested by industrial and clinical experience. NOTE: Students may complete only one of the following programs: the major in Biomedical Engineering, the major in Biomedical Engineering: Premedical, or the minor in Biomedical Engineering. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See pages 168-169. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of engineering physics (with laboratory), one year of chemistry (with laboratory), and one additional approved course for the major. \u00b7 Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer. Students who enroll at UCI in need of completing lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees.

School Requirements: See page 169. Major Requirements Mathematics and Basic Science Courses: Students must complete a minimum of 48 units of mathematics and basic sciences including: Core Courses: Mathematics 2A-B, 2D, 7A-B\u00ad and - 2003-2004I 180 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Elective Courses: Students select, with the approval of a faculty advisor, at least one additional basic science course needed to satisfy school and major requirements. Engineering Topics Courses: Students must complete a minimum of 28 units of engineering design including: select, with the approval of a faculty advisor a minimum of 8 units of engineering topics needed to satisfy school and major requirements. (The nominal Biomedical Engineering program will require 196 units of courses to satisfy all university and major requirements. Because each student comes to UCI with a different level of prepa\u00ad ration, the actual number of units will vary). MINOR IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING The minor in Biomedical Engineering requires a total of nine courses-two advanced mathematics courses, five core Biomedical Engineering courses, and two Biomedical Engineering electives. Some of these courses may include prerequisites that may or may not be part of a student's course requirements for their major. Private biomedical industry has indicated a keen interest in engi\u00ad neers that have a more traditional engineering degree (i.e., electri\u00ad cal engineering), but also possess some in-depth knowledge 9f bio\u00ad medical systems. Hence, the minor in Biomedical Engineering is designed to provide a student with the introductory skills necessary to perform as an engineer in the biomedical arena. Admissions. Students interested in the minor in Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering must apply through The Henry Samueli School of Engi\u00ad neering Student Affairs Office and must have a UCI cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher. NOTE: Students may not receive both a minor in Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering and a specialization in Biochemical Engineering within the Chemical Engineering major. \u00b7 Requirements for the Minor in Biomedical Engineering Mathematics Courses: Mathematics 2J, 3D. Engineering Topics Courses: BME1, BME50A-B, BME120, BME121. Technical Electives: Students select, with the approval of a faculty advisor, two technical elective courses: BMEllOA, BME110B, BME130, PROGRAM OF STUDY The sample program of study chart shown is typical for the major in Biomedical Engineering. Students should keep in mind that this pro\u00ad gram is based upon a sequence of prerequisites, beginning with ade\u00ad quate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chem\u00ad istry. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their program approved by their faculty advisor. Biomedical Engineering majors must consult at least once every year with the academic counselors in the Student Affairs Office and with their faculty advisors.

The curriculum is designed to meet the requirements for admission to medical schools, but is also suitable for those planning to enter graduate school in biomedical engineering, physiology, biology, neurosciences, or related fields. It has less engineering content and more biological sciences than the accompanying Bio\u00ad medical Engineering major. It is one of many majors that can serve as preparation for further training in medical, veterinary, or allied health professions. The Biomedical Engineering: Premedical curriculum provides future physicians with a quantitative background in biomechanics, bioelectronics, and biotransport. Such a background is increasingly important because of the heavy utilization of biomedical technol\u00ad ogy in modem medical practice. The curriculum includes courses in the sciences that satisfy the requirements of most medical schools. The education experience is enriched through a design course where students work as teams to solve Biomedical Engi\u00ad neering problems inspired by the clinical arena at the UCI Medical Center.

Biophoton\u00ad ics faculty are interested in photomedicine, laser microscopy, opti\u00ad cal coherence tomography, medical imaging, and phototherapy. Biomedical Nanoscale Systems faculty are interested in molecular engineering, polymer chemistry, molecular motors, design and fab\u00ad rication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), integrated microsystems to study intercellular signaling, and single molecule studies of protein dynamics. Biomedical Computation faculty are interested in computational biology, biomedical signal and image processing, bioinformatics, computational methods in protein engi\u00ad neering, and data mining. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineering. Required Background Because of its interdisciplinary nature, biomedical engineering attracts students with a variety of backgrounds. Thus, the require-\u00b7 ments for admission are tailored to students who have a bachelor's degree in an engineering, physical science, or biological science discipline, with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher in their upper\u00ad division course work. The minimum course work requirements for admission are six quarters of calculus through linear algebra and ordinary differential equations, three quarters of calculus-based physics, three quarters of chemistry, and two quarters of biology. Students without a physics, chemistry, or engineering undergradu\u00ad ate degree may be required to take additional relevant undergradu\u00ad ate engineering courses during their first year in the program; any such requirements will be specifically determined by the BME Graduate Committee on a case-by-case basis and will be made known to the applicant at the time of acceptance to the program. The recommended minimum combined verbal and quantitative por\u00ad tion of the GREis 1200, or a minimum combined MCAT score in Verbal Reasoning, Physical Sciences, and Biological Sciences problems of 30. A minimum score of 600 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is recommended of all international students whose native language is not English. In addition, all applicants must submit three letters of recommendation. Exceptionally promising UCI undergraduates may apply for admis\u00ad sion through The School of Engineering's acceler\u00ad ated M.S. and M.S./Ph.D. program, however, these students must satisfy the course work and letters of recommendation require\u00ad ments described above. Core Requirement All students are required to take a set of core courses which total 22 units: BME 210, BME220, BME221, BME230A, BME230B, and BME240. Elective Requirement The remaining 14 units required to fulfill the course requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degree are comprised of elective courses offered within The Henry_ Samueli School of Engineering, the Schools of Biological Sciences and Physical Sciences, and the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine. A minimum of eight of the elective units must be taken from The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. The group of elective courses must be approved by the BME Graduate Com\u00ad mittee, for M.S. students, or, for Ph.D. students, the student's grad\u00ad uate advisory committee, and are chosen to meet the specific needs of each student. The electives must provide breadth in biomedical engineering, but also provide specific skills necessary to the spe\u00ad cific research the student may undertake as part of the degree requirements. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 182 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Areas of Emphasis Although a student is not required to formally choose a specific research focus area, three research thrust areas have been identified for the program: Biophotonics, Biomedical Nanoscale Systems, and Biomedical Computational Technologies. The three areas capi\u00ad talize on existing strengths within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and UCI as a whole, interact in a synergistic fashion, and will train biomedical engineers who are in demand in both pri\u00ad vate industry and academia. Biophotonics. This research area includes the use of light to probe individual cells and tissues and whole organs for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The research areas include both fundamental investigation on the basic mechanisms of light interaction with bio\u00ad logical systems and the clinical application of light to treat and diagnose disease. Current and future foci of the faculty are: (1) microscope-based optical techniques to manipulate and study cells and organelles; (2) development of optically based technologies for the non-invasive diagnosis of cells and tissues using techniques that include fiber-optic-based sensors, delivery systems, and imag\u00ad ing systems; and (3) development of optically\u00b7 based devices for minimally invasive surgery. Nanoscale Systems. This class of research areas encompasses the understanding, use, or design of systems that are at the micron or submicron level. Current strengths within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and the UCI faculty as a whole include bio\u00ad materials, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and the design of new biomedical molecules. The focus of biomedical engineering research in.this area is the integration of nanoscale systems with the needs of clinical medicine. Projected areas of growth include: (1) micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for biomedical devices and biofluid assay; (2) programmable DNA/ molecular microchip for sequencing and and (3) bio\u00ad materials and self-assembled nanostructures for biosensors and drug delivery. Biomedical Computational Technologies. computa\u00ad tional technologies include both advanced computational tech\u00ad niques, as well as advanced biomedical database systems and knowledge-base systems. Computational technologies that will be developed in this research area include: (1) methods for biomedical analysis and diagnosis such as physical modeling of light-tissue interactions, atomic-level interactions, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine-learning algorithms; (2) language instruction and platform standardization; and (3) machine-patient interfaces. Areas of research related to biomedical database sys\u00ad tems include the development of new technologies which can cap\u00ad ture the rich semantics of biomedical information for intelligent reasoning. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the stu\u00ad dent to specify an area of specialty, and to complete a minimum of 36 units, at least 28 of which must be at the 200 level including the 22 units that comprise the core courses as described above. The degree will be granted upon the recommendation of the Director and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Plan 1: Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must select a thesis advisor and complete an original research investigation including a written thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. A maximum of eight M.S. research units (i.e., ECE296) may be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. The preliminary examina\u00ad tion in the Ph.D. program, described below, will serve as the com\u00ad prehensive examination. However, the passing grade to qualify at the Master's competency level will be lower than the grade required for a student to advance in the Ph.D. program. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree requires the achievement of an original and sig\u00ad nificant body of research that advances the discipline. Students. with a B.S. degree may enter the Ph.D. program directly, provided they meet the background requirements described above. The Graduate Committee will handle applicants on a case-by-case basis, and any specific additional courses required by the student will be made explicit at the time of admission. Each student is matched with a faculty advisor, and an individual program of study is designed by the student and a faculty advisory committee. There are no additional course requirements beyond that of the M.S. degree. Four milestones are required: (1) success\u00ad ful completion of 36 units of course work beyond the bachelor's degree, at least 28 of which must be at the 200 level including the 22 units of core course requirements; (2) successful completion of a preliminary examination at the Ph.D. competency level; (3) for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy by successfully passing a qualifying examination; and (4) completion of a significant body of original research and the submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The preliminary examination will normally be taken at the end of the first year (July), but will also be offered in December. A stu\u00ad dent must take it within two years of matriculating in the program, and must either have passed all of the core courses or have an M.S. degree prior to taking the examination. The Graduate Committee prepares the examination and sets two minimum competency lev\u00ad els, one for awarding the Master's degree and the second for con\u00ad tinuing on in the Ph.D. program. Students who fail to pass at the Ph.D. level may retake the examination once within six months of the initial attempt. Students who fail the second attempt will not be allowed to continue in the program. Students who pass either attempt at the Master's competency level will be awarded an M.S. degree. After passing the preliminary examination at the Ph.D. competency level, students are matched with a BME faculty advi\u00ad sor and design an individual program of study with their advisor. Advancement to candidacy must be completed between the ninth and twelfth quarters of enrollment, usually during a student's third year. (Special exceptions can be made, but a formal request with justification must be supplied in writing to the Director.) The quali\u00ad fying examination follows campus and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering guidelines and consists of an oral and written pre\u00ad sentation of original work completed thus far, and a coherent plan for completing a body of original research. The qualifying exami\u00ad nation is presented to the student's graduate advisory committee, which is selected by the student and faculty advisor and must have a minimum of five faculty (including the faculty advisor). Of these five faculty, a minimum of three must be affiliated BME faculty. In addition, a minimum of two faculty must have part of their primary appointment in The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. The Ph.D. is awarded upon submission of an acceptable written dissertation and its successful oral defense. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the graduate advisory committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Completion of the Ph.D is expected in the fifth year following completion of the B.S. degree, although a maximum of seven years (28 academic quarters) is allowed.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 186 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Since the beginning of history, materials have played a crucial role in the growth, prosperity, security, and quality of human life. In fact, materials have been so intimately related to the emergence of human culture and civilization that anthropologists and historians have identified early cultures by the name of the significant materi\u00ad als dominating those cultures. These include the stone, bronze, and iron ages of the past. At the present time, the scope of materials science and engineering has become very diverse;\u00b7 it is no longer confined to topics related to metals and alloys but includes those relevant to ceramics, composites, polymers, biomaterials, nanos\u00ad tructures, intelligent materials, and electronic devices. In addition, present activities in materials science and engineering cover not only areas whose utility can be identified today, but also areas whose utility may be unforeseen. The services of materials scien\u00ad tists and engineers are required in a variety of engineering opera\u00ad tions dealing, for example, with design of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high-temperature superconductivity, biomedical products, performance (e.g., quality, reliability, safety, energy effi\u00ad ciency) in automobile and aircraft components, improvement in nondestructive testing techniques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, and fabrication of advanced materials. The undergraduate major in Material Science Engineering (MSE) provides students with a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scientific principles. The undergraduate curriculum in MSE includes: (a) a core of Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics; (b) basic Engineering courses; (c) Materials and Engineering core; and (d) technical courses in Materials Science, Engineering, and Sciences. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of MSE and its intimate relations with other Engineering disciplines (Aerospace, Biomed\u00ad ical, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering), qualified students will be .able to satisfy in a straightforward manner the degree requirements of their Engi\u00ad neering major and the MSE major. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See pages 168-169. Transfer Students: Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of engineering physics (with laboratory), one year of gen\u00ad eral chemistry (with laboratory), and one additional approved course for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer. Students who enroll at UCI in need of completing lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees.

Because each student comes to UCI with a differ\u00ad ent level of preparation, the actual number of units will vary.) PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY A sample program of study chart for the major in Materials Sci\u00ad ence Engineering is available in the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a sequence of prerequisites, beginning with adequate prepara\u00ad tion in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their program approved by their faculty advisor. Materials Science Engineering majors must consult at least once every year with tl)e academic counselors in the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office and with their faculty advisors. Graduate Study in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Chemical engineering uses the knowledge of chemistry, mathemat\u00ad ics, physics, biology, and social sciences to solve societal problems such as energy, health, environment, food, clothing, shelter, and semiconductors. It serves a variety of processing industries whose vast array of products include chemicals, petroleum products, plas\u00ad tics, pharmaceuticals, foods, textiles, fuels, consumer products, and electronic and cryogenic materials. It also serves society to improve the environment by reducing and eliminating pollution. Chemical engineering is an engineering discipline that has its strongest ties with the molecular sciences. This is an important asset since sciences such as chemistry, molecular biology, biomedi\u00ad cine, and solid-state physics are providing the seeds for future technologies. Chemical engineering has a bright future as the disci\u00ad pline which will bridge science with engineering in multidisciplinary environments. Biochemical Engineering is concerned with the processing of bio\u00ad logical materials and processes that use biological agents such as living cells, enzymes, or antibodies. Biochemical Engineering, with integrated knowledge of the principles of biology and chemical engineering, plays a major engineering role in the rapidly develop\u00ad ing area of biotechnology. Career opportunities in Biochemical Engineering are available in a variety of industries such as biotech\u00ad nology, chemical, environmental, food, petrochemical, and pharma\u00ad ceutical industries. The principle objectives of the graduate curriculum in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are to develop and expand students' abilities to solve new and more challenging engineering problems and to promote their skills in independent thinking and learning in UC IRVINE - 2003-2004preparation for careers in manufacturing, research, or teaching. These objectives are reached through a program of course work and research designed by each student with the assistance, advice, and approval of a primary faculty advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are offered. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Students who enter the program with a B.S. degree in chemical engineering must take at least six graduate-level courses (22 units), while students who enter without undergraduate preparation in chemical engineering are required to take three to five additional prerequisite courses (Mathematics 105A-B-C and Engineering CBEMS40B, CBEMSllO, CBEMS112, and CBEMS120A). A detailed program of study for each entering student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor and must be approved by the graduate advisor. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 38 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and successful defense of the thesis. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires a minimum of 36 quarter units in approved courses, at least 28 of which must be from graduate courses in the 200 series in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory com\u00ad mittee which takes into consideration the objectives and prepara\u00ad tion of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor, successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed original research, success\u00ad ful completion of the research, and presentation and successful defense of the dissertation. There is no foreign language require\u00ad ment. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research require\u00ad ments as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Graduate Study in Materials Science and Engineering It is now well-accepted that materials are crucial to national defense, the quality of life, and the economic security and competi\u00ad tiveness of the nation. As a result, needs and opportunities for highly trained materials scientists are dramatically increasing. Over the next decade, engineering students graduating with M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are needed to join universities as promising faculty members, work in national laboratories as young researchers, or serve industry as Chemical Engineering and Materials Science 187 leaders and managers. The services of these faculty members, researchers, and managers will play a key role in: (a) solving many technical problems facing society; (b) improving the design and development of modern devices, structural products, and aerospace vehicles; (c) increasing the efficiency of energy utilization; (d) achieving major breakthroughs in future technologies, such as those associated with telecommunications, medicine, nanostruc\u00ad tures and smart materials; and (e) helping industry maintain and improve international competitiveness. The MSE graduate degree program in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science is complementary to the inter\u00ad disciplinary MSE graduate concentration in the School (see the previous section dealing with this concentration). The Depart\u00ad ment's program (M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering) is fundamental in scope, focuses more on the under\u00ad standing and modification of structural material properties, and explores ways of tailoring materials to meet specified design goals. The interdisciplinary MSE graduate concentration (M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering with a materials specialization) focuses on interdisciplinary research issues in Materials Science. Examples include the development of materials for use in IC interconnect, microelectronic and photonic packaging, and electronic and micro\u00ad electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), the preparation of thin films that are free of structural defects, the analysis and design regarding spraying and deposition of particles, and the use of advanced mate\u00ad rials in nano technology and biomedical devices, the search for new materials with appropriate benign environmental impact, and the selection of intelligent materials for sensor applications. These examples and others require not only the interdisciplinary efforts of several academic units but also coordinated curricula. There are several areas in which the materials program has excelled. Primary among these areas is the quality and impact of publications dealing with forefront research on advanced materials and novel alloys. Such impact has been in part reflected by the Citation Index complied by the Institute for Scientific Information (lSI). Recommended Background Given the nature of Materials Science and Engineering as a cross\u00ad disciplinary program, students having a background, and suitable training, in Materials, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical, Aerospace), and the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chem\u00ad istry) are encouraged to participate. A student with an insufficient background may be required to take remedial undergraduate courses. Recommended background courses include an introduc\u00ad tion to materials, thermodynamics, mechanical behavior, and elec\u00ad trical/optical/magnetic behavior. Specific Fields of Emphasis The materials faculty have special interests and expertise in the processing, behavior, and characterization of structural materials. In particular, the following areas have been the subjects of special study: mechanical behavior of materials with special focus on creep and superplasticity; fractUre and fatigue behavior of advanced com-. posites and alloys with special focus on high-temperature and envi\u00ad ronmental damage mechanisms; processing of advanced materials using droplet-based procedures with special focus on composites, nanocrystalline materials, and thermal spraying; processing and characterization with special focus on ferroelectric thin films and ceramics; phase transformations with special focus on modeling and simulation; damping behavior with focus on improving proper\u00ad ties of composite materials; corrosion prevention with an emphasis on biomaterial; modification of boundary structure in ceramics with focus on producing superplasticity; IC interconnect materials; semiconductor and fiber-optic materials; and optoelectronic age materials. IRVINE - 2003-2004I 188 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Required Courses Because MSE primarily deals with the processing, behavior, and characterization of materials and because these three components are the focus of research in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, it is important to establish a common foundation in Mate\u00ad rials Science and Engineering for students with various back\u00ad grounds and research interests. This foundation is sufficiently cov\u00ad ered in MSE courses that deal with the following topics: Crystal Structure and Crystal Defects: MSE200 (Advanced Con\u00ad cepts in Materials). Mechanical Behavior: one course from MSE251 (Dislocation The\u00ad ory), MSE256A (Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials), MSE256B (Fracture of Engineering Materials), MSE256C (Fatigue of Engineering Materials). Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena: one course from MSE252 (Theory of Diffusion), MSE265 (Phase Transformations), CBEMS240 (Thermodynamics), CBEMS280 (Optoelectronics Packaging), or Chemistry 230 (Thermodynamics). Processing of Materials: one course from CBEMS174 (Microelec\u00ad tronics Processing), MSE255A (Design of Ceramic Materials) or MSE270 (Solidification Processes). Electives Typical examples for elective courses in various areas of interest are listed below. Structural Materials: MSE2l0 (Materials Characterization Tech\u00ad niques and Analysis), MSE220 (Analytical Methods in Materials Science), MSE255A (Design with Ceramic Materials), MSE255B (Science of Composite Materials). Experimental Methods and Analysis: MSE220 (Analytical Methods in Materials Science), MSE258 (Computer Techniques in Experi\u00ad mental Materials Research), MSE259A (Theory of Electron Microscopy). Chemical Processing: CBEMS210 (Reaction Engineering), (Transport Phenomena), CBEMS230 I), Electronic (Physical and Properties), ECE216 Solids: CEE243 (Mechanics of Composite Materi\u00ad als), CEE250 (Finite Element Method in Structural Engineering). Physics and Chemistry of Materials: Physics 206 (Laboratory Skills), Chemistry 226 (Materials Science of Polymers), Chemistry 247 (Problems in Analytical Chemistry), Chemistry 248 (Electro\u00ad chemistry), Chemistry 252 (Special Topics in Physical Chemistry), Chemistry 272 (Industrial Chemistry). IC and Photonic Packaging: MSE272 (Microelectronic and Optics), CBEMS280 (Optoelec\u00ad tronic Packaging). It should be noted that that in selecting electives, students are encouraged to take courses which are not merely related to their area of research. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of com\u00ad petence for professional practice of materials science and engineer\u00ad ing. Two options are available: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Plan 1: Thesis Option For the M.S. thesis option, students are required to complete a research study of great depth and originality and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. A minimum of 36 units is required for the M.S. degree. For the thesis option, at least 21 units must be taken from courses num\u00ad bered 200--289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and nine units are from elective courses approved by the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of 296 and up to eight units of under\u00ad graduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option For the comprehensive examination option, students are required to complete 36 units of study and a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be taken from courses numbered 200-289, among which 12 units are from MSE core courses and 12 units are from elective courses approved by the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and col\u00ad laboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After substantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the following: acceptance into a research group by the fac\u00ad ulty advisor during the student's first year of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for pursuing research, completion of the School of Engineering teach\u00ad ing requirements, and the development of a research proposal; passing the Qualifying Examination. There are no unit requirements for the Ph.D. However, past experi\u00ad ence indicates that most students continue to take courses for one to two years after receiving the M.S. degree, and that as a result of the preliminary examination, some students are advised to take a course or two to correct deficiencies in background. Final examination involves the presentation and defense of an acceptable dissertation in a seminar attended by students and 'fac\u00ad ulty. The Ph.D. degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Relationship of M.S. and Ph.D. programs. Students applying with the objective of M.S./Ph.D. are admitted only if they are likely to successfully complete a Ph.D. program. These students do not formally reapply to the Ph.D. program. Financial support is usually reserved for those students who plan to complete both degrees. The average time to complete M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is two and five years, respectively.

Ziaka-Vasileiadou: Water resources UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Civil Engineering is described as the art of sustainably harnessing the great powers of nature for the use and convenience of human beings. The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers in Southern California has been transformed into a thriving metropolis largely by the application of civil engineering. The goal of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare graduates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the undergraduate level a common core of fundamental subjects is provided, and stu\u00ad dents are required to specialize in their senior year. Specializations are offered in General Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineer\u00ad ing, Structural Engineering, Transportation Information and Con\u00ad trol Systems, and Water Resources Engineering. Concentrations are offered in Computer Applications, Engineering Management, Infrastructure Planning, and Mathematical Methods. Graduate opportunities are in three major thrust areas: structural analysis, design, and reliability; transportation systems engineering; and water resources and environmental engineering. The career opportunities in civil engineering are varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consult\u00ad ing firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good ground for many administrative and managerial positions. Environmental Engineering involves designing environmental pro\u00ad tection or remediation strategies for multiple resources-water, air, and soil, often with combinations of physical, chemical, and bio\u00ad logical treatment methods in the context of a complex regulatory framework. The goal of the Environmental Engineering curriculum is to pre\u00ad pare graduates with a strong basic science background, particularly in chemistry and biology, and to provide students with a broad exposure to several environmental engineering science disciplines. Courses relating to transport processes, water quality control, air quality control, and process design are included in the core. Career opportunities in environmental engineering are diverse. Graduates generally find careers related to pollution control and the remediation of air, water, and soil environments. Undergraduate Major in Civil Engineering Program Objectives: (1) provide the basis for advanced study in civil engineering, the foundation for lifelong learning in a dynamic technical society, and the requisite skills to enter directly into the practice of engineering; (2) enable understanding of current soci\u00ad etal and global issues; (3) provide the knowledge in the basic and engineering sciences that forms the foundation for the design and management of civil infrastructure systems; (4) instill recognition of the importance of effective communication in all aspects of pro\u00ad fessional endeavor; (5) enable proficiency in the use of complex software packages integral to the practice of modern engineering, while understanding both software development and the constraints resulting from the assumptions built into complex software pack\u00ad ages; (6) provide an understanding of the systems-level approach to the analysis, design, and management of civil infrastructure, based on a balance of problem-formulation and problem-solution techniques through computer-aided analysis and design; (7) pro\u00ad vide the foundation for professional practice through a design practicum in which a team of students, under the supervision of faculty and professional engineers, execute a comprehensive, mul\u00ad tidisciplinary, year-long design exercise; (8) enable proficiency in four major recognized civil engineering areas, and in-depth knowl\u00ad edge in one area of civil engineering through an elective career\u00ad specialization course sequence; (9) enable passage of the FE/EIT examination prior to graduation and provide the foundation for professional registration. (Program objectives are those aspects of engineering that help shape the curriculum; achievement of these objectives is a shared responsibility between the student and UCI.) Civil and Environmental Engineering 193 The curriculum provides the opportunity to obtain a firm founda\u00ad tion in engineering science and to develop the techniques of analy\u00ad sis and design, which are basic for the successful practitioner.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 196 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Graduate Study in Civil Engineering Civil Engineering addresses the technology of constructed environ\u00ad ments and, as such, embraces a wide range of intellectual endeav\u00ad ors. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering focuses its graduate study and research program on three areas: structural and geotechnical engineering, including aspects of soil mechanics, structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and relia\u00ad bility and risk assessment; transportation systems engineering, including traffic operations and management, advanced informa\u00ad tion technology applications, travel behavior, and transportation systems analysis; and water resources and environmental engineer\u00ad ing, including hydrology, water resources, contamination manage\u00ad ment, and pollution control technologies. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Civil Engineering. Students may also pursue M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering through The Henry Samueli School of Engineering graduate con\u00ad centration in Environmental Engineering. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of com\u00ad petence for the professional practice of civil engineering. Two plans are available to those working toward the M.S. degree: a the\u00ad sis option and a course work option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and presentation of the thesis research findings in a public seminar. Of the 36 units, a minimum of 20 units must be in nonresearch, graduate-level courses. Plan II: Course Work Option The course work option requires the completion of 36 units of study, at least 30 of which must be in nonresearch graduate-level \u00b7 courses. The remaining six units may be earned as graduate-level course work, individual research, or upper-division undergraduate units. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree indicates attainment of an original and significant research contribution to the state-of-the-art in the candidate's field, and an ability to communicate advanced engineering concepts. The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty advisor and the Graduate Advisor of the Department. There are no specific course requirements. Within this flexible framework, the School maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral program. All doctoral students should consult the Civil Engineering program's guidelines for details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; early assessment of the student's research potential (this includes a preliminary examination), research preparation, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no foreign language requirement. Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be com\u00ad pleted in seven calendar years from the date of admission. THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies at Irvine (ITS) is part of a multicampus research unit of the University of California. Several faculty studying transportation systems engineering in the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering participate in the Institute. Students choosing to focus their studies in transportation will find strong interdisciplinary opportunities between the Depart\u00ad ment and ITS. See the Research and Graduate Studies section of the Catalogue for additional information. THE URBAN WATER RESEARCH CENTER The Urban Water Research Center focuses on five integrating water issues in urban areas: (1) supply, demand, and distribution; (2) water quality; (3) urban ecology; (4) water reuse; and (5) institu\u00ad tions and public policy. In each of these areas the Center enables the issues to be addressed in an integrated way from the biological and earth, economical, engineering public policy, and public health points of view. The Center is the collaborative effort of the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Department of Earth System Science, and the School of Social Ecology.

Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences is applied to the theory, design, and imple\u00ad mentation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. The Department offers two ABET-accredited undergraduate degrees: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. The Department also offers a joint undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, in conjunction with the School of Information and Computer Science. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of electronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study power electronics and the generation, trans\u00ad mission, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of elec\u00ad trical engineers studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Still another group studies complex electronic systems such as automatic controls, telecommunications, wireless communications, and signal processing. Computer engineers are trained in various fields of computer sci\u00ad ence and engineering. They engage in the design and analysis of digital computers and networks, including software and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI circuits, computer graphics, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, data structures and algorithms, distributed computing, and computer networks. Computer Engineering courses include pro\u00ad gramming in high-level languages such as C++ and Java; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system soft\u00ad ware such as compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; and application of computers in solving engineering problems. Labora\u00ad tories in both hardware and software experiences are integrated within the Computer Engineering curriculum. The undergraduate curricula in Electrical Engineering and Com\u00ad puter Engineering provide a solid foundation for future career growth, enabling graduates' careers to grow technically, adminis\u00ad tratively, or both. Many electrical and computer engineers will begin work in a large organizational environment as members of an engineering team, obtaining career satisfaction from solving mean\u00ad ingful problems that contribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As their careers mature, technical growth most natu\u00ad rally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the under\u00ad graduate years. Administrative growth can result from the develop\u00ad ment of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. Graduates of Electrical and Computer Engineering will find a vari\u00ad ety of career opportunities in areas including wireless communica\u00b7 tion, voice and video coding, biomedical electronics, circuit design, optical devices and communication, semiconductor devices and fabrication, power systems, power electronics, computer hard\u00ad ware and software design, computer networks, design of computer\u00ad based control systems, application sof~ware, data storage and retrieval, computer graphics, pattern recognition, computer model\u00ad ing, parallel computing, and operating systems.

To achieve their goals, mechanical engineers use mathematics, physics, and chemistry together with engineering science and technology in areas such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, controls, and atmospheric science. Mechanical Engineering students at UCI learn the problem-solving, modeling, and testing skills required to contribute to advances in modern technology. Mechanical Engineering undergraduates complete required courses that provide engineering fundamentals and technical electives that allow students to study particular areas of interest. Specializations are available in: Aerospace Engineering, Computers in Engineering Design, Environmental Engineering; Flow Physics, Materials Sci\u00ad ence and Engineering, Mechanical Systems, and Propulsion Sys\u00ad tems. Independent research opportunities allow students to pursue other avenues for focusing their studies. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of subjects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in engineering or in areas such as medicine, law, and management. Aerospace Engineering deals with all aspects of aircraft and space\u00ad craft design and operation, thus requiring the creative use of many different disciplines. Aerospace engineers work on the forefront of technological advances and are likely to be leaders in scientific dis\u00ad coveries. The undergraduate curriculum in Aerospace Engineering includes courses in subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics, propulsion, con\u00ad trols and performance, light-weight structures, spacecraft dynam\u00ad ics, and advanced materials. In the senior capstone course, students work in teams on the preliminary design of a commercial jet transport. Career opportunities for Aerospace Engineering graduates are in the broad range of aerospace industries, including manufacturers of aircraft, spacecraft, engines, and aircraft/spacecraft components; makers of aircraft/spacecraft simulators; and government research laboratories. Areas of graduate study and research are the thermal and fluid sci\u00ad ences, combustion and propulsion, mechanical systems and robot\u00ad ics, environmental engineering, and aerospace engineering. Appli\u00ad cation areas in mechanical engineering include combustion, heat engines, refrigeration, and robotics. Application areas in aerospace engineering include propulsion, aerodynamic design, and guidance and control.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 216 UCI 2003-04 The Henry Samueli School of Engineering Graduate Study in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in three thrust areas: systems and design, fluid and thermal sciences, and combustion and propulsion. Sys\u00ad tems and design faculty are studying robust and nonlinear control, structural control, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), computer-aided design, and robotics-including mechanical design, biorobotics, motion optimization, and coordination of multiple robot systems. Thermal and fluid sciences encompasses multiphase heat transfer and fluid flow, convection, turbulent flows, atmospheric processes, supersonic shear flows, fluid dynamics of semi-conduc\u00ad tor processing, and aerooptics. Combustion and propulsion research efforts include studies of the processes of fuel-air mixing, turbulent transport, liquid sprays, microgravity combustion, high-speed reacting flows, miniature combustor design, and the formation of gaseous and solid pollutants in gas, liquid, and coal-fueled com\u00ad bustion systems, including gas turbines, boilers, incinerators, and rockets. Aerospace engineering research efforts combine specialties from each of the three thrust areas as well as study in propulsion, aero\u00ad dynamics, trajectory optimization and guidance, and control of flexible space structures. The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available to pursue study toward the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportuni\u00ad ties are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan I: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study; the completion of an original research project, the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gain research experi\u00ad ence or as preparation for study toward the doctoral degree. To complete the required 36 units, students must complete a minimum of 20 units in graduate courses numbered MAE200:-289, and 16 units from unrestricted courses of which not more than eight units are in MAE296 and not more than five units are in other courses numbered MAE291-299. The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, 24 units of which must be from graduate courses numbered MAE200-289. With a faculty advisor approval, the remaining 12 units can include execution and documentation of a research or design project (which can count for up to seven of the 36 required units). The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and by the graduate advisor. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. Within this flexible framework the Department maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral pro\u00ad gram. All doctoral students should consult the Departmental Ph.D. guidelines for program details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; comple\u00ad tion of six non-research courses beyond M.S. degree requirements; passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral pro\u00ad gram; course work; meeting departmental teaching requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy through a qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; development of a research pro\u00ad posal; completion of a significant research investigation, and com\u00ad pletion and defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no for\u00ad eign language requirement. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. A program of part-time study is not available for the Ph.D. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Before seeking admission, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to communicate directly and in some detail with prospective faculty sponsors. The student's objectives and financial resources must coincide with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a teaching assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship may not cover the period of several years required to com\u00ad plete the program. During the balance of the period the student will be in close collaboration with the faculty research advisor.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES Karen R. Lawrence, Dean 143 Humanities Instructional Building Undergraduate Counseling: (949) 824-5132 Graduate Counseling: (949) 824-4303 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/ The School of Humanities comprises thtee fundamental areas of knowledge: history; literature, film, and the arts; and philosophy. The intellectual activity of departments and programs in the School reflects the discrete concerns of these basic disciplines and inter\u00ad sections among them. By expanding our knowledge in these three areas and developing skills in rhetoric, expository composition, and foreign languages, humanists influence the fundamental techniques of communication used throughout the modern university and our whole society. They analyze and question those techniques and examine the web of cultural beliefs in which they are practiced. At the core of the educational mission of the humanities is the goal of imparting to students critical tools of analysis, ways of seeing, knowing, explaining, describing, and understanding, that will allow them to comprehend the world around them. Consider some of the challenges that we all face: the pressures created by demographic change, rapid economic expansion, and increased ethnic and cul\u00ad tural diversity; the development of new technological forms, partic\u00ad ularly those related to computers and the Internet; and the increas\u00ad ingly complex problem of human interaction with the environment. Equipping students to understand and analyze such phenomena is precisely what a liberal education in the humanities accomplishes. In the words of a \"Manifesto for the Humanities,\" prepared for the President of the University of California, it is humanities that pro\u00ad vide \"the ability to express oneself clearly and accurately; the skill of critical evaluation, both of ideas and actions; the courage to make choices based on shared values and priorities; the opportu\u00ad nity to conduct an intensive conversation with the traditions, pre\u00ad sent and past, that help make us who we are, and above all, who we will be; and as a result, the ability to understand and make sense of other people and their cultures.\" Humanistic inquiry is in no way isolated from the \"real world,\" cordoned off in some ivory tower; rather its central goal is to equip students to enter into that real world as critically thinking citizens. Because language is the humanist's essential tool and the tradi\u00ad tional medium of historical record, philosophical speculation, and literary creation and criticism, the School of Humanities .places special emphasis on language and training in composition. The campuswide Writing Program is housed in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, as are our distinguished programs in creative writing and the Program in Academic English/English as a Second Language. The School of Humanities also offers programs in over a dozen foreign languages, both classical and modern, and requires that its majors take two years or the equivalent of foreign language study. The pursuit of critical literacy involves analyzing and understand\u00ad ing our immediate culture, and one way to do this is through the study of foreign languages and the cultural systems they entail. We rarely scrutinize or analyze something we know as intuitively as our native language, yet it is by means of this language that we organize and express our thoughts. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language permits us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. The knowledge of one's native language, gained by this kind of comparative observation, is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, scientific, or other. Serious study of a foreign language is, therefore, crucial to any university education that aims at fostering critical thinking and objective self\u00ad reflection. A crucial part of the School's curriculum is the Humanities Core Course, which integrates the study of philosophy, literature, film and the arts, and history along with lower-division writing. Inter\u00ad disciplinary studies are also an essential feature of the Humanities Honors Program and programs in Film Studies and Comparative Literature. The Department of Asian American Studies and the Interdisciplinary Programs in African-American Studies, Latin American Studies, and Women's Studies are also located in the School. With faculties that draw on the Social Sciences as well, these programs are excellent examples of how the Humanities reaches across the boundaries of disciplinary knowledge. In addi\u00ad tion, the interdisciplinary minor in Religious Studies is affiliated with the School of Humanities. Because humanists deal analytically with the most complex prob\u00ad lems and issues affecting people, and because they are especially adept at analyzing language and texts, students majoring in the humanities are particularly well-prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are important. Students from the School of Humanities at UCI have moved into business, the law, education, politics, public policy, academia, and journal\u00ad ism. Employers in all sectors are placing increasing emphasis on the recruitment of college graduates who can write and think. . These skills are ultimately more important to many employers than a specific form of technical training, and it is these skills that are imparted most effectively in the School of Humanities. For stu\u00ad dents who leave the School with a solid grounding in critical analysis, research, and communication, the sky is the limit.

HUMANITECH 170 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-7445 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/humanitech Barbara L. Cohen, Director The mission of HumaniTech is to work with Humanities faculty in the discussion, incorporation, problem solving, and facilitation of technology in their teaching and research. It accomplishes this mis\u00ad sion in a variety of user-friendly ways. Faculty workshops, one-on-one consultations, and group consulta\u00ad tions, including sharing of technology-based projects among peers, provide education and outreach to faculty. Liaisons are facilitated \u00b7 between the faculty and Humanities bibilographers and other infor\u00ad mation specialists; the California Digital Library; and the various technological arms of the UCI campus, such as Network and Acad\u00ad emic Computing Services, the Instructional Resources Center, and the Educational Electronic Environment. Information on intellec\u00ad tual property rights on the Internet are researched, collected, and disseminated for Humanities faculty use. HumaniTech hosts collo\u00ad quia on teaching with technology, and, in conjunction with the Humanities Center, sponsors a lecture series for faculty and stu\u00ad dents on \"Humanities and Technology,\" with a focus on issues such as multiple literacies and what it means to be human in a digital age. HUMANITIES CENTER 172 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-1948 John H. Smith, Director Founded on the principle that humanistic inquiry plays a vital role in debates within and beyond academia, the UCI Humanities Cen\u00ad ter has three missions: to provide resources for research in the Humanities; to foster interaction among scholars; and to encourage dialogue between the UCI School of Humanities and the non-acad\u00ad emic local community. The Humanities Center fulfills these three missions through a vari\u00ad ety of activities. It funds both individual and collaborative research projects of UCI faculty and graduate students; it houses fellows in residence; it initiates workshops, seminars, and lectures for the UCI academic community to share research results; it organizes and supports lectures and conferences, often with the UC Humani\u00ad ties Research Institute and various departments, to invite scholars to present their work; it hosts public forums, reading groups, and on-campus presentations for members of the non-academic com\u00ad munity; and it produces and distributes its tri-annual newsletter, Between the Lines. HUMANITIES INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCE CENTER AND COMPUTING FACILITY The Humanities Instructional Resource Center (HIRC) and the Humanities Computing Facility (HCF) share space in Humanities Hall and provide comprehensive technology support for instruc\u00ad tion, research, and faculty and staff development. HIRC and HCF also serve as the center for innovative technology-mediated instruc\u00ad tion within the School of Humanities. HIRC services and facilities include video and audio libraries, for\u00ad eign language satellite feeds, and audiovisual equipment. HCF includes the computer laboratories, fee-based laser printing, video editing, support for wireless networking in the Humanities quad, and computing consultation. Both facilities provide technology\u00ad related research and development assistance for faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students. HCF houses two PC laboratories, one Macintosh laboratory that doubles as a language laboratory, and one drop-in laboratory (with both Macs and PCs). The facility has more than 100 stations. HCF also houses five digital video editing bays, a software library, and a wide range of computer services (scanning, document conversion, workshops, and more). ' Both HCF and HIRC laboratories provide a wide variety of instructional resources including, among others, multimedia appli\u00ad cations and development stations, foreign language word process\u00ad ing, Web browsing (including support for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), and language learning materials. All laboratories are con\u00ad nected to a central server and to the campus backbone for access to the Internet, MELVYL \u00ae, and other research resources. The labora\u00ad tories are available to Humanities students, instructors, and staff for class instruction and drop-in purposes. Additional information may be obtained from the HCF Computer Consultant's Office, 213 Humanities Hall, telephone (949) 824-7609, or the HIRC main offices, 269 Humanities Hall, tele\u00ad phone (949) 824-6344 .. \u00b7 HUMANITIES OUT THERE (H.O.T.) PROGRAM 168 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-8119 Julia Reinhard Lupton, Director H.O.T. is an outreach program between UCI's School of Humani\u00ad ties and local schools. The program consists of a series of five\u00ad week workshops on selected topics in the humanities. Each quarter, there are at least 20 workshops on topics such as Creative Writing, Imagining America, California Stories, Spanish Literature, U.S. History, World History, and World Mythology. Each workshop sends out a team of five or more undergraduates to a K-12 class\u00ad room, supervised by faculty and advanced graduate students in the humanities. Requirements for undergraduates include: attending at least five training sessions at UCI; attending at least five tutoring sessions at a local school; submitting two electronic journals on the tutoring experience; and writing a three-to five-page paper with an acade\u00ad mic focus. Undergraduates can earn two units of H.O.T. credit each quarter through Humanities 195. INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR WRITING AND TRANSLATION 172 Humanities Instructional Building Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Director Established in 2001, the International Center for Writing and Translation in the School of Humanities fosters writing, transla\u00ad tion, and criticism in multilingual and international contexts. The Center possesses an international scope, a focus that champions writing, and an earnest exploration of translation as a challenge and practice. It links existing faculty research interests in cultural literacy to general discussions about linguistic, cultural, political, and media issues relevant to the diverse, multiethnic, and mu1tilin\u00ad guistic student population at UCI and to the population of Califor\u00ad nia more generally. Through its support of writers, critics, and translators, the Center cultivates an awareness of the international world of letters and steers research and creative activities in the Humanities in vital, new directions. The following goals are integral to the general mission of the Cen\u00ad ter: (1) supporting writers working in various languages and diverse genres, including fiction and creative nonfiction, through UC IRVINE - 2003-2004grants and residencies; (2) fostering research and discussion of the theory, practice, aesthetics, and politics of translation, broadly con\u00ad ceived; (3) supporting translations of work of literary merit; (4) sponsoring conferences, workshops, and public fora on writing and translation, as well as reading and performances; and (5) support\u00ad ing activities of UCI faculty, students, and the surrounding commu\u00ad nity involving the far-reaching themes of cultural and media liter\u00ad acy and cross-cultural transposition. The Center is a partner of the International Institute of Modem Letters at Las Vegas. Undergraduate Programs HUMANITIES UNDERGRADUATE STUDY 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/ Robert G. Moeller, Associate Dean In addition to 22 majors and 24 minors, the School also offers a formal concentration in Medieval Studies and courses in Italian, Portuguese, and Russian. The academic counselors in the Humanities Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, located in 143 Humanities Instructional Building, help all students in planning a program of study. Transfer students in particular need to consult an academic counselor to determine major requirements. Students who expect to pursue graduate study also should consult with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. The academic counselors assist freshmen and sophomores who are interested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. They are especially knowledgeable about University regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course con\u00ad tent, options to major, and other matters that may present difficul\u00ad ties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the academic counselors are prepared to help the unde\u00ad clared student keep options to a major open, plan a coherent pro\u00ad gram of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Many courses are composed of both\u00ad lectures and required discussion sessions. \u00b7 Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on com\u00ad mittees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, by participating as mentors for new Humanities majors, by working as peer academic advisors in the Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Humanities Peer Mentor Program The Humanities Peer Mentor Program is designed to address some of the academic, cultural, and social needs of disadvantaged stu\u00ad dents in the School of Humanities. The program features two\u00ad tiered mentoring, with successful upper-division students mentor\u00ad ing small groups of new students, and the student mentors in tum working with faculty and staff. Another focus of the program is to encourage and assist student mentors to go on to graduate school. Participants attend workshops on topics such as study skills, library research, time management, and careers, as well as a variety of social events, and keep journals in which they express their ideas Humanities 223 and raise issues for their mentors. Call (949) 824-5132 for addi\u00ad tional information. HUMANITIES HONORS PROGRAM 143 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-5132 Victoria A. Silver, Director The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is a two-year, upper-division program designed to challenge superior students from all fields by providing special opportunities for interdiscipli\u00ad nary work within an intellectually charged framework. Small semi\u00ad nars and the opportunity for independent research are some of the advantages offered by the program, which is open by invitation to all UCI students regardless of their majors. Students in the program benefit from their involvement in the cam\u00ad pus community of Humanities scholars. They enjoy a close rela\u00ad tionship with the faculty and profit from intense interaction with their intellectual peers. A comprehensive advising program involv\u00ad ing Honors faculty advisors as well as specially trained Honors peer advisors ensures that Humanities Honors students continually receive timely, individualized advice about their academic careers. Formal as well as informal gatherings, including student-organized social activities ranging from coffee hours to theater parties, aug\u00ad ment a wide range of campus activities. Humanities Honors students have the opportunity to become some of the campus' best informed scholars on a broad range of topics: from artificial intelligence to medical ethics, from Shakespeare to Gilbert and Sullivan, from problems of the ancient Near East to the dilemmas of modernity. Humanities Honors students complete a two-part course of study. In their junior year, students take three quarters of an interdiscipli\u00ad nary Proseminar (Humanities H120) organized about a single topic or problem, such as crime and punishment, the other, the develop\u00ad ment of religion in the West, the self, nature, or the American dream. The sequence is designed to compare and contrast modes of analy\u00ad sis and critical thinking in ~istory, literary studies, and philosophy. In a small seminar setting, students are encouraged to become reflective about their own chosen disciplines. In their senior year, students take a sequence beginning in the fall with a Senior Honors Seminar (Humanities H140), and continuing in the winter and spring with the Senior Honors Thesis (Humani\u00ad ties H141) and the Senior Honors Colloquium (H142), prepared as an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. Students present their theses in an informal gathering with their faculty advisors in the spring, and a prize is awarded for the year's outstanding thesis. In both sequences the Honors students benefit from their close association with exceptional scholars and the challenge and sup\u00ad port of their intellectual peers. Students interested in learning how the Humanities Honors Pro\u00ad gram will fit into their regular courses of study are encouraged to contact the Senior Academic Counselor in.Humanities; telephone (949) 824-5132. CAMPUSWIDE HONORS PROGRAM The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. HUMANITIES INTERNSHIP 166 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-1392 Robert G. Moeller, Director The Humanities Internship Program is designed to bring highly qualified Humanities majors together with public sector employers UC IRVINE - 2003-2004224 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities and nonprofit companies in the Orange County area who are look\u00ad ing for employees with excellent skills in writing and communica\u00ad tion. Local employers who participate in the program believe that Humanities students' education in critical thinking, writing, com\u00ad munication, and analysis equip them to be successful employees in their firms. Interns are placed for the academic year, working 10-15 hours a week for hourly salaries of $10. (No course credit is earned.) Employers offer management-level supervisors to student interns and thus, interns are involved in a meaningful aspect of the firm's ongoing business. The internship relationship can become the basis for long-term employment with the firm. Interns participate in several quarterly meetings with a program coordinator at UCI to discuss their work experiences and benefit from one another's insights. At the end of each quarter of the internship, the student provides an assessment of the experience. The program coordinator also conducts on-site visits with the interns and their management supervisors. The Internship Program is open to all Humanities majors who are in good academic standing and will have completed at least three quarters of academic work at UCI by the end of the quarter in which they are selected for the program. Only students who will have completed the Humanities Core Course (or the Core Course substitution) by the end of that quarter will be eligible. Applications are available in the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office, 143 Humanities Instructional Building, in mid-to late-win\u00ad ter quarter. The deadline for submission of all application materials is early April. CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION The Center for International Education, which includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, vol\u00ad unteering, and research. School of Humanities majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of their fields by studying for one year at a university in such countries as China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, or the United Kingdom through EAP. Students can also augment their exposure to other cultures with programs sponsored through lOP. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements Satisfactory completion of the following, which must be taken for letter grades: Humanities lA-B-C, taken in the freshman year*; two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quar\u00ad terly consultation with an assigned advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. *Transfer students in all majors in the School of Humanities, except Asian American Studies, may substitute for the Humanities Core Course appropriate course work in English composition, liter\u00ad ature, history, and philosophy. Substitution is by petition; apply in the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office. See the Asian American Studies section for specific information about substitu\u00ad tion courses for this major. NOTE: Within the beginning and intermediate foreign language instructional sequences (lA-B-C and 2A-B-C, and for Latin and Greek, lA-B-C and 25), students must earn a grade of C or better in order to advance to the next level of instruction. Foreign Language Placement. Placement tests are required for the following languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Viet\u00ad namese. Contact the UCI Testing Office for e-mail: testoff@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http:// www.testingoffice.uci.edu/. Placement tests are recommended but not required for German language courses. The purpose of place\u00ad ment testing is to ensure success in UCI language courses. For other foreign languages, students entering UCI with previous high school foreign language training are placed as follows: in gen\u00ad eral, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in lB-, lC-, 2A-, or 2B-levellanguage courses, respectively. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Study. Transfer students may not receive credit for repeating at UCI foreign language courses for which they received credit upon matriculation to UCI even if they are placed by testing into the equivalent of their previous course. Also, once a student begins instruction in a foreign language, the student must complete each course in the sequence until the requirement is satisfied. If any course is skipped, the student will be required to complete an additional course beyond the 2C level. Foreign Language Advanced Placement Credit. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Placement credit. How\u00ad ever, since Advanced Placement awards a maximum of 8 units for scores of 3, 4, and 5, students may elect to take 2C or the equiva\u00ad lent for credit. Native Speakers of Languages Other Than English. A native speaker of a foreign language, defined by the University as some\u00ad one who attended the equivalent of secondary school in another country where the language of instruction was other than English, may be exempted from taking third-year language study in that language for some majors offered by the School of Humanities. In this case, the student must substitute appropriate upper-division courses in the major to replace the number of exempted courses. For example, if a native speaker of French is exempted from French lOOA and lOOB, that student must replace those two courses with two other upper-division French courses offered by the Department of French and Italian. Repeating Deficient Foreign Language Grades. First- and sec\u00ad ond-year foreign language courses and third-year foreign language composition courses are sequential and each is prerequisite to the next. This is generally true also of fourth-year Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. Students wishing to repeat a deficient grade in one of these courses must repeat it prior to continuing on to the next level of the language. A student may not take a lower-level course for credit once a more advanced level has been completed with a pass\u00ad ing grade. Maximum Overlap Between Major Requirements: Students completing double majors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both majors simultaneously (i.e., a double major in Comparative Literature and Spanish can count only two upper-division Spanish literature courses for both majors). Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing majors and minors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both a major and a minor. No course may be counted for two minors. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed successfully at UCI. Completion of a minor program is optional; however, for cer\u00ad tification in a minor, at least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. See individ\u00ad ual major and minor requirements for specific courses. Exceptions UC IRVINE - 2003-2004are considered on a case-by-case basis and decided in consultation with the appropriate department or faculty member. Off-campus Internship Policy. In most cases, Humanities students are not allowed to earn credit for off-campus internships. However, if a department or program determines that the internship is acade\u00ad mically appropriate and promotes the student's academic goals, the student may take the internship as Independent Study and credit will be given. A maximum of four units total may be earned for internships; how\u00ad ever, the units may not be counted toward the student's major requirements. (No credit is given for paid internships, such as those offered through the Humanities Internship Program.) The sponsoring department or program and the instructor will in all cases require a substantial academic product, such as a paper, growing out of the internship. A student who wishes to seek approval for an unpaid off-campus internship and earn course credit must file an Independent Study form with the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office prior to beginning the internship. Graduate Programs HUMANITIES GRADUATE STUDY 172 Humanities Instructional Building; (949) 824-4303 Ellen S. Burt, Acting Associate Dean \u00b7 The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught by faculty members from various departments. Further, sev\u00ad eral departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the UCI Department of Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School by serving on committees of the various departments and sitting with the faculty in its meetings.

The program's curriculum encourages students to investigate the African-American experience from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theoretical approaches. Among the topics explored in the course offerings are the process of colonization and the forced migration of African people, the positionality of African people in the racialized symbolic and social orders of the western hemisphere, the rhetoric produced by and about African people, and the cultural and aesthetic values associated with \"blackness\" and \"Africanness.\" The Program offers a B.A. degree program in African-American Studies and a minor. Descriptions for courses offered by the departments are available in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue and on the Program Web site at http://www.hnet.uci.edu/afam/. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES UCI graduates with a B.A. degree in African-American Studies enhance their chances of success in the job market and in the highly competitive arena of graduate and professional school admissions, especially in the fields of medicine and other health professions, law, and business. Employers and admissions officers understand that many of their employees and graduates will one day work in communities with significant African-American popu\u00ad lations, and for this reason they give due consideration to appli\u00ad cants who have in-depth knowledge of African-American culture.

Conse\u00ad quently, the undergraduate curriculum in Art History, with its global perspective, is one of the most diverse disciplines in the humanities. Through Art History students learn how to describe and interpret a range of objects including sculpture, painting, pho\u00ad tography, architecture, and so-called \"new media\" such as video or performance art. These skills, along with the program's intense focus on writing and verbal expression, prepare students to think critically and to express themselves clearly at a time when visual communication is becoming ever more important. Because works Art History 227 of art are always created within a larger cultural context, Art His\u00ad tory courses are a good way to understand what other places or times were like. Students may explore, for example, ancient Greece, nineteenth-century Japan, or even the twenty-first century United States. Majors in Art History are thus welcon;te to take related courses in other fields of the humanities. Students are encouraged to pursue the study of language beyond the minimum requirements, and because of its international perspective, Art His\u00ad tory is a particularly good major for students interested in studying abroad. There are many study centers throughout the world associ\u00ad ated with the University's Education Abroad Program. Special scholarships are available for the Pacific region program. CAREERS FOR THE ART HISTORY MAJOR Following their graduation, students with a B.A. in Art History have found employment in art galleries, auction houses, and muse\u00ad ums, and they have entered graduate programs with a view to careers in university teaching, curatorial work, and art conserva\u00ad tion. Moreover, with its strong emphasis on developing critical skills in writing, speaking, and analysis, Art History also provides an excellent preparation for many other careers. UCI graduates have pursued professional paths ranging from medicine and law, to business and education, to information technologies and architec\u00ad ture. As in the case of arts administration or intellectual property law, some of these professional pursuits have depended on and continue to make use of training in the arts.

The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical Civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin lan\u00ad guage and literature; and (2) helping students, through courses in Classical literature, history, civilization, mythology, and religion taught through English translations, to appreciate the achievements of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion in which most of the required courses are in English transla\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of their programs. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as Classics 233 possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classical authors in the original language. From then on, courses are devoted to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students knowledge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue gradu\u00ad ate study in the Classics, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of 10 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization should obtain the most recent copy of the brochure, Quid Novi, available in the Department office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) 1B, 1C, 25, and 101 respectively. Placement may vary, depending on the extent of the student's preparation. Students with transfer credit for Greek and/or Latin may not repeat those. courses for credit. Students with high school training in the Classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the under\u00ad graduate majors, participate in all open departmental meetings. Representatives are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curricu\u00ad lum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the acad\u00ad emic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 120 Human\u00ad ities Office Building II, telephone (949) 824-6735. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agree\u00ad ment between the School of Humanities and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Courses are offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. \u00b7 Classics (Greek emphasis): Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 25; Greek UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 234 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C; Latin 25, 101, 102; Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 170 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-Latin 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C; Greek 25, 101, 102; Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 170. NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional course at the 100 level in the same language may. be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, two additional upper-division courses in related fields such as Classical history, Classical philosophy, or Classical art. These two courses may be taken in another UCI department. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Greek 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Latin: Latin 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Classical 37C or 45A-B-C; five upper-division Classics courses, one of which may be in a related field such as history, art history, or philosophy. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students planning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possi\u00ad ble moment to learn about the various programs. Single-Subject Waiver Program in Latin. The California Com\u00ad mission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC)-approved Single-Subject Waiver Program in Latin is designed to provide the prospective teacher with rigorous training in all aspects of the Latin language and culture. First and foremost is language competency: students are required to take four years of college-level Latin or the equiva\u00ad lent. Emphasis is placed upon the acquisition of firm grammatical understanding, as expert mastery of Latin grammar enables a teacher to use inductive approaches to Latin learning as well as more traditional methods. In addition, students are required to complete the historical/cultural survey class, Classics 35A, 35B, 35C, in order to gain an understanding of the history and culture of Greece and Rome in its Mediterranean context. Students are also asked to take several upper-division Classical Civilization classes on Roman topics in order to deepen their understanding of ancient Rome itself. Because vocabulary-building skills are now often taught along with Latin, students are required to take Classics 5, an etymology class. Through Linguistics 10, students gain a theoreti\u00ad cal understanding of the nature of language. Classics 201 provides students with an introduction to the use of technology in the Class\u00ad room by focusing upon electronic resources in Classics; it enables students to utilize these resources in teaching, to construct Web pages, and to integrate multimedia tools into the classroom. For students with undergraduate degrees from other institutions, some substitutions for these requirements are permitted. Every effort is made to work with the student's previous undergraduate training. Specific course requirements are available in .the Classics Depart\u00ad ment. Students interested in completing the waiver program in Latin are encouraged to contact the Undergraduate Advisor in the Classics Department or a Department of Education advisor. The Department of Classics encourages students to take advantage of educational opportunities abroad while making progress toward their UCI degree. Classics and Classical Civilization majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of the field by study\u00ad ing for periods ranging from one quarter to one year at any number of universities all over the world through the UC Education Abroad Program. Students can also augment their exposure to Greek, Latin, and Classical civilizations by studying for a summer or during the academic year in Greece or Italy at programs sponsored by other academic institutions through the International Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram. See the Department of Classics Undergraduate Program Director for additional information. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for modem life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a well\u00ad rounded education. Greek and Latin language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, mythology and religion make an excellent basis for exploring all periods of Western culture down to the pre\u00ad sent day. Classics is an interdisciplinary study, exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, law, management, and other fields welcome students with training in Classics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of an education in Classics. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express themselves in clear, coherent, and cogent lan\u00ad guage, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physi\u00ad cians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the gradu\u00ad ate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate fur\u00ad ther study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and lin\u00ad guistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of the humanities and social sciences. The UCI Career Center provides &ervices to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information.

Classics 235 Students accepted into the program may enroll at any of the three campuses, but normally apply for admission through UCI, which is the main location for instruction and administration. Applications are reviewed by an admissions committee composed of faculty members from all three campuses. The goal of the program is to provide a graduate education that unites the main currents of modern literary, cultural, and social-sci\u00ad entific theory with the traditional skills and methodologies of clas\u00ad sical philology. Candidates for degrees are expected to exhibit facility in Greek and Latin, competence in research, including the\u00ad oretical approaches to texts and objects, technical mastery of com\u00ad puting for.research and teaching, and experience in teaching. These goals are realized through the four core courses (Classics 200 A-B\u00ad C and 201), seminars (Classics 220), and reading courses (Classics 205). All entering students are admitted into the Ph.D. program. With the exception of those granted advanced standing because they hold the M.A. degree in Classics from another institution, entering stu\u00ad dents are concurrently enrolled in the M.A. program. Master of Arts in Classics The requirements for the M.A. degree are two years (six quarters) of course work, passage of a special set of examinations, and com\u00ad pletion of a Master's paper. The normal course load is three 200- level courses each quarter. Minimum course requirements are Clas\u00ad sics 200A-B-C and 201; four quarters of Classics 205; and four quarters of Classics 220. (Classics 280 may be substituted for these courses at the discretion of the faculty.) A reading knowledge of either German, French, Italian, or an equivalent language, demon\u00ad strated by examination or other means, is also required. At the end of a student's M.A. studies, a positive vote of the program faculty is necessary for continuation in the Ph.D. program. The expected time for completion of the M.A. degree is two years. Doctor of Philosophy in Classics The requirements for the Ph.D. degree are three years (nine quar\u00ad ters) of course work. Minimum course requirements are Classics 200A-B-C and 201; five quarters of Classics 205; and six quarters of Classics 220 or an equivalent course. (Classics 280 may be sub\u00ad stituted for these courses at the discretion of the program faculty.) Students are encouraged to take courses and seminars in relevant areas outside the program at any of the three campuses. Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in a second modern language by the end of their third year. At this stage, and during the fourth year of study, students are expected to have read extensively in the primary texts, in literary \u00b7history and theory, and in ancient history. In addition, experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity is normally required. In order to qualify as a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage, a student must pass an individually designed set of qualifying examinations, including translation examinations in Greek and Latin, written examinations or lengthy papers in special authors and field, and an oral examina\u00ad tion. The expected time for the completion of the Ph.D. degree is six years. The facilities, course offerings, programs, and individual faculty mentorship of all three campuses are available to students in the UC Tri-Campus Graduate Program in Classics. In addition, pro\u00ad gram resources are enhanced through a cooperative teaching arrangement among the Tri-Campus Program and the Classics graduate program at UC Los Angeles and at the University of Southern California. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) is a research center atUCI. TLG has created a digital library of Greek literature, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 236 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities Although administratively separate, TLG is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics.

Students take a total of four years of courses in the modem language, in which comprehension, speaking, UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 238 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities reading, and writing are stressed. Studies of texts take place throughout the curriculum: the first three years students read texts in translation and the fourth year they read in the original language. The literature-in-translation courses consist of generai introductory overviews as well as more specific topics at the intermediate level for those students whose language proficiency is insufficient to cope with difficult literary texts. At the advanced level, course con\u00ad tent focuses on reading texts in the original language and rotates among significant literary and cultural topics. In these courses, the curriculum integrates the study of East Asian literatures with theo\u00ad retical issues that shape the study of world literature in general. In this way, the student gains the dual perspectives of studying East Asian cultures on their own terms as well as recognizing the affini\u00ad ties these civilizations share with the emerging world culture. CAREERS FOR THE MAJOR Studies in East Asian languages and literatures will give the stu\u00ad dent the intensive linguistic and cultural preparation needed to pur\u00ad sue a career involving these important Pacific Rim nations. In an era in which the United States is seeking to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities presented by this vital area of the world, the training in language and literature offered by the depart\u00ad mental faculty will serve the student well in a variety of endeavors, such as international business, law, government service, journal\u00ad ism, teaching, and other careers involved with public affairs. Undergraduate studies in an East Asian language are also a valu\u00ad able preparation for those students intent upon pursuing graduate study in any field of East Asian language or culture. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program The Department offers three undergraduate majors: the B.A. degree program in Chinese Language and Literature, the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in Japanese Language and Literature, and the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in East Asian Cultures. In addition, minors are offered in Chi\u00ad nese Language and Literature and Japanese Language and Literature. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program that both fulfills the requirements of the major and covers the student's areas of interest in allied fields outside East Asian Languages and Literatures. Students are placed in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school language taken in the United States is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school work will most often enroll in levels IB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Students with background in an Asian language gained through primary or secondary school work taken in Asia must consult with the faculty to determine their proper placement level. Those who have gained substantial knowl\u00ad edge of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean either through secondary school work or through college-level language courses may not repeat those courses for credit. Prospective majors who place out of the upper-division language requirement are expected to substi\u00ad tute an equivalent number of other courses to be selected in consul\u00ad tation with their advisor. The faculty encourages students to study abroad, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently, after completing at least two years of study (or its equivalent) of the rel\u00ad evant language at UCI. Additional information is available in the Department office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the Majors Three separate majors: Chinese Language and Literature, Japanese Language and Literature, and East Asian Cultures. Chinese Language and Literature: Completion of Chinese 3C or equivalent; Chinese lOOA-B-C, lOlA-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or cul\u00ad ture of another East Asian country; and at least four additional courses in Chinese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. Japanese Language and Literature: Completion of Japanese 3C or equivalent; Japanese lOOA-B, 101A-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or culture of another East Asian country; and at least five additional courses in Japanese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or compara\u00ad tive literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. East Asian Cultures: Completion of Chinese 3C, Japanese 3C, or Korean 3C; two quarters of East Asian Languages and Literatures 155, with different topics; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; and nine additional upper-division courses, at least three of which must pertain to a country other than the one of language specialization; up to four of these courses may be taken outside the Department, with the approval of the undergraduate advisor. Residence Requirement for the Majors: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Students are encouraged, however, to complete up to a year of their language study in approved programs of study abroad. Requirements for the Minors Two separate minors: Chinese Language and Literature and Japan\u00ad ese Language and Literature. Chinese Language and Literature: A three-quarter sequence selected from Chinese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B-C, or 101A-B-C; and four courses selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Chinese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Chinese. Japanese Language and Literature: Either Japanese 3A-B-C, IOOA-B, or 101A-B-C; and four courses (or five courses, if the IOOA-B sequencehas been chosen) selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Japanese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Japanese. Residence Requirement for the Minors: A minimum of four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course con\u00ad tent is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. Graduate Program The Department offers a Ph.D. degree program in East Asian Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures, with concentrations in Chinese, Japanese, and East Asian Cultural Studies. The M.A. degree may be awarded to Ph.D. students in progress toward the doctoral degree. The graduate program emphasizes rigorous training in language and textual analysis, with equal attention given to the historical, social, and cultural dimensions of literary study. In addition to more traditional vocabularies of criticism and theory, the curricu\u00ad lum encourages exploration of recent challenges to established conceptual and methodological frameworks. The program builds on the foundation of a faculty whose research interests engage UC IRVINE - 2003-2004major issues in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean literature and cul\u00ad ture, while developing connections with the larger community of scholarship at UCI. Because the graduate program is designed to prepare students for both college-level teaching and advanced research, each student will be required to serve, under direct faculty supervision, as a teaching assistant in an appropriate undergraduate course offered through the Department. As noted below, one quarter's worth of this teaching may be counted as part of the required course work toward completion of the degree. Assuming that a student is enrolled full-time and enters the program with no major deficiencies in background or training, normal time needed to complete the Ph.D. degree is six years from matriculation. For students admitted with an M.A. degree or its equivalent from another institution, certain course requirements may be waived upon the approval of a faculty advisory committee, with a conse\u00ad quent reduction in normative time for completion of the Ph.D. The following graduate emphases are available: Critical Theory (see page 268); Feminist Studies (see the Women's Studies section); and Comparative Literature (see below, following the Ph.D. program requirements). MASTER OF ARTS IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Students are not admitted to an M.A.-only degree program but may be granted an M.A. in recognition of progress toward the Ph.D., normally after six quarters of course work and submission of two approved seminar\u00b7 papers, which will serve as the M.A. examination. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Requirements for Admission In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, specified by the Office of Graduate Studies, all students must present the following for review by an admissions committee composed of members of the faculty in East Asian Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures: records of prior scholastic performance, including all college transcripts; three letters of recommendation; samples of written work; and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. Although the Department does not require entering students to have received an undergraduate degree compa\u00ad rable to its own, it recommends as much preparation in an East Asian language as possible. It also welcomes applications from students whose language training may not be as extensive but who have shown promise in the study of related disciplines. The study of appropriate European languages is encouraged as well. General Requirements Upon admission to the program, the student is assigned a graduate advisor, in consultation with whom an advisory committee consist\u00ad ing of two additional faculty members is constituted. The student and committee plan a program of study consisting of 15 graduate courses. Before advancement to candidacy (normally after three years of graduate study), the student must have: (1) completed required course work as detailed below; (2) prepared one paper of publish\u00ad able quality; (3) completed language requirements as listed below; (4) prepared five research reports on current scholarly articles to be decided upon in consultation with the faculty advisor; and (5) passed the qualifying examinations on four topics to be selected in consultation with the faculty advisory committee no more than two quarters before the examinations are to be taken. At least one of the topics should be related directly to the student's projected area of specialization in dissertation research. East Asian Languages and Literatures 239 Students who complete the qualifying examinations successfully are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. They then write their doctoral dissertation on a topic developed in consultation with the faculty advisory committee. Some period of study abroad, for enhancement of language proficiency and/or dissertation research, is strongly encouraged. Concentration in Chinese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Chinese 201-204; Chinese 211A-B or 212A-B; Chinese 213A\u00ad B; Chinese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consulta\u00ad tion with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on a relevant topic in literary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language requirements may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modem Chinese, two years of classical Chinese, and three years of modern Japanese, and have demonstrated reading proficiency in another appropriate language. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. In addition, the requirement for a second year of classical Chinese may be fulfilled by taking three reading courses in classical literature. Concentration in Japanese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Japanese 201-204; Japanese 211A-B or 212A-B; Japanese 213A-B; Japanese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon con\u00ad sultation with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on relevant topics in literary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language require\u00ad ments may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modern Japanese and one year of classical Japanese, and have demonstrated reading pro\u00ad ficiency in another appropriate language. In addition, students emphasizing classical Japanese are required to take one year of classical Chinese. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. Concentration in East Asian Cultural Studies Course Work. Each student is required to complete: four Theory and Cultural Studies graduate courses; four graduate courses in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consultation with faculty advisors.

Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is crit\u00ad ical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through elected representatives to departmental committees. Each quarter both undergraduate and graduate students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate their courses and teachers. CAREERS FOR THE ENGLISH, COMPARATIVE LITERATURE, OR LITERARY JOURNALISM MAJOR The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public rela\u00ad tions, business, and management. Departmental advisors encourage their students to investigate vari\u00ad ous careers--especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these students have completed their undergraduate educations. For those students interested in going on for a credential in sec\u00ad ondary school teaching, UCI has a CCTC-approved single-subject\u00ad matter preparation program in English. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 244 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities Undergraduate Program All of the Department's areas of study emphasize a variety of criti\u00ad cal approaches in the reading and criticism of literature. Three majors, as well as an emphasis in Creative Writing, are offered: English. This major seeks to introduce students to the entire range of literatures written in English, from British and American to African, Asian, and Australasian literatures. The major emphasizes the differences among historical periods and various genres, and encourages exploration of a broad range of literary theories. It also offers students the opportunity to do significant work in Compara\u00ad tive Literature and Creative Writing. Creative Writing is an emphasis within the English major offering concentration in the writing of poetry or fiction; undergraduate courses in nonfiction are also available. The aim of the emphasis is to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). Comparative Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature offers a separate major and minor within the Department of Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature. The program focuses on the study of literatures from around the globe and across history. While stu\u00ad dents in Comparative Literature will almost certainly read novels, plays, and poems written in English, emphasis is placed on works originally composed in other languages. Most of these will be read in translation, but there is a foreign language requirement to ensure that students have the experience of encountering another culture from the inside. Another key component of the program is the study of critical theory, or the methods required to think analyti\u00ad cally and philosophically about works of literature and culture. Comparative Literature is well suited for students interested in international issues, the history of inter-and cross-cultural contact up to the present, and the ways in which literature and cultures dia\u00ad logue with one another across time and space. The Comparative Literature 50A, B, C series introduces students to a geographically and chronologically broad selection of texts not limited to the western tradition. The goals of this series are to study literature in dialogue with other literatures and in a histori\u00ad cally intensive way, as well as to study literature using the lens of genre and medium. (Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in this sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously.) \u00b7 Literary Journalism. This major is designed for students inter\u00ad ested in writing creative nonfiction and journalism, and in studying their history. Defined both by its historical and theoretical focus and by its intensive writing seminars, the program contextualizes literary journalism in a wider study of the discourses of fact throughout history, while also attending to the impact of new media technologies on the evolution of the field. While distinct from an applied journalism major in that it does not focus primar\u00ad ily on newspaper writing, the major in literary journalism is excel\u00ad lent preparation for students planning to enter graduate programs in journalism. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all four of its programs. Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Depart\u00ad ment recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Descriptions of specific courses are available online at http://www.humanities.uci.edu/ undergrad/crsdesc.htm. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E or CL 50A (in some cases, students who change their majors to English after taking E 6, E 7, E 8 may petition to substitute one of those courses for a course from theE 28 series); CR 100A; CR 100B; E 102A, E 102B, either E 105 or CL 105; E 106; and at least three more Departmental courses numbered 102 or above (excluding E 140, E 150, WR 139, or WR 179). At least one of the courses taken for the major must be an upper-division Com\u00ad parative Literature course. Competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at UCI (in classical languages, 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102) plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language. (Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Russian, may ordinarily require three years of language study as preparation for the study of literature; students who wish to use such languages should consult with the Department about satisfaction of this requirement before doing so.) Students selecting a creative writing emphasis have some flexibil\u00ad ity in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR 100A, CR 100B, and three E 102s must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E 6, E 7, E 8, CL 8, including at least one quarter of E 28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 102 or higher (excluding WR 139), although two courses from the following may be substituted: CR 100A, CR 100B, WR 100B, CL 100, for the English Minor: Four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the department chair. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major CL two of which must be Compara\u00ad tive Literature courses, and two of which may be drawn from Com\u00ad parative Literature, English, Creative Writing, or upper-division lit\u00ad erature courses in a foreign language (in addition to any such courses used to fulfill the Comparative Literature foreign language requirement). Competence in a foreign language at a level to be able to read both literature and other forms of writing (criticism, journalistic prose, history) in the language; completion of two upper-division courses in a foreign language. NOTE: One approved upper-division course reading foreign litera\u00ad ture in translation may substitute for one of the upper-division lit\u00ad erature courses in a foreign language. If the latter option is taken, students are usually required to match language and literature (e.g., if the student's foreign language is German, then the student must UC IRVINE - 2003-2004take a German 1SO course). Study abroad is highly encouraged. Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian, ordinarily require three years of language study as preparation for the study of literature. Students who wish to study these languages may take three years of the language and an approved course read\u00ad ing literature in translation in fulfillment of the Comparative Liter\u00ad ature language requirement; here again, literature and language should be matched. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recom\u00ad mended before graduation. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: CR IOOA, CL 101, and three upper-division literature courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL SOA, B, C, CR IOOA, CL 101, one upper-division CL course, and one foreign language literature course or a third year of language in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program, providing course content is approved by the appropriate program advisor or chair. Departmental Requirements for the Literary Journalism Major LJ 20 and two courses from the following list: E 28A (orE E 28D, or CL SOA (in some cases, students who change their majors to Literary Journalism after taking E 6, E 7, E 8 may petition to substitute one of those courses for a course from theE 28 series); CR IOOA; LJ lOlA, LJ 101B (three times, on genres); at least three more Departmental courses num\u00ad bered 102 or above (excluding E 140, E 150, WR 139, or WR 179); either E 105 or CL 105; two upper-division History courses in a single regional or thematic focus area; and LJ 197. Residence Requirement for the Literary Journalism Major: LJ 20, CR lOOA, LJ must be com\u00ad pleted successfully at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students should plan coherent programs of study with their faculty advisors, including undergraduate seminars, workshops and semi\u00ad nars in writing (for students choosing a Literary Journalism major or Creative Writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in lit\u00ad erature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an English, Comparative Literature, or Literary Journalism major as preprofessional training in government, law, or medicine. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should con\u00ad sult both the Department and people in their prospective profes\u00ad sional areas. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad through the Education Abroad Program. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for additional information. Subject-Matter Program in English. English and Comparative Literature majors wishing to obtain a single-subject credential in English may complete a California Commission on Teaching Cre\u00ad dentialing (CCTC)-approved subject-matter program in English. English and Comparative Literature 245 The program can be easily satisfied in tandem with major require\u00ad ments, especially with early and careful planning. Program require\u00ad ments include specific courses in English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, course work in linguistics and education, in-class K-12 experience, and a portfolio. Interested students should contact the Department of English and Comparative Literature for further information. Students who intend to pursue a single-subject or multiple-subject teaching credential should consult the UCI Depart\u00ad ment of Education as early as possible to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. Graduate Program The Department's four principal areas of work on the undergradu\u00ad ate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, the English major with a creative writing emphasis, and Liter\u00ad ary Journalism-are reflected in the graduate programs: M.A. and Ph.D. in English, M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing), and an emphasis in Creative Nonfiction within the Ph.D. degrees in English and Comparative Literature. A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include a specialization in American literature as well. The faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special inter\u00ad ests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature may stress by adding the Schoolwide Critical Theory emphasis. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Depart\u00ad ment, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair, but there are close administrative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be established by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-pe~son committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, for\u00ad eign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Test in Literature in English; applicants to the Comparative Literature program need not submit the Subject Test in Literature in English. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the acade\u00ad mic year. The normal expectation is enrollment in three courses each quarter; Teaching Assistants take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teach\u00ad ing should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teach\u00ad ing and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. can\u00ad didates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 246 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to partici\u00ad pate in this program. Candidates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. The Murray Krieger Endowed Fellowship in Literary Theory was awarded for the first time in the 1996-97 academic year. It is intended for an outstanding entering graduate student who is pur\u00ad suing the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature and who demonstrates a primary interest in theory as theory relates to liter\u00ad ary texts. This prestigious grant is the foremost fellowship in the Humanities and one of the largest at UCI. The five-year support package is worth over $92,000. Also included is a readership and study space in the Rene Wellek Collection at the UCI Library, in addition to benefits such as priority housing and access to child care. A range of other fellowships is also available to students in the Department. Emphasis in Creative Nonfiction Students admitted to the emphasis in Creative Nonfiction must meet all course, language, and examination requirements for the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature. Their course work must include: (a) three writing workshops in nonfiction; (b) three courses in nonfictional literature or rhetoric; and (c) if needed for the projected dissertation, one course outside the Department. Stu\u00ad dents must also conduct a dissertation defense. School Emphases Schoolwide graduate emphases are available in Asian American Studies, Critical Theory, and Feminist Studies. Refer to the appro\u00ad priate sections of the Catalogue for information. ENGLISH Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (l)the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modem or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accom\u00ad plished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Grad\u00ad uate Committee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable, and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. The Department of English and Comparative Literature sponsors a Summer M.A. Program in English designed for teachers. The M.A. degree in English is awarded to candidates who complete 32 units of graduate course work through two consecutive summers in the program and submit an acceptable Master's essay. Applicants from outside the State of California may apply for the program. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-to three-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length man\u00ad uscript of poetry or short stories or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); profi\u00ad ciency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modem or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on des\u00ad ignated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading compe\u00ad tence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evidence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student is examined in four areas: (1) literary theory and criticism; (2) literary form; (3) histor\u00ad ical period of English and/or American literature; and (4) selected major authors. The student has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an indi\u00ad vidual to demonstrate breadth of historical knowledge and literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examina\u00ad tion as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to disser\u00ad tation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral examination on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Applicants to the Comparative Literature program must hold a B.A. or equivalent degree and should normally have majored in Comparative Literature, English, or a foreign literature. Majors in other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, history, visual studies, women's studies, ethnic studies) will be considered, provided that a suffi\u00ad cient background in literary and cultural studies, as well as in at least one foreign language, is demonstrated. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature, proficiency in foreign languages is essential. Professional competency in at least one foreign language is expected of all doctoral students; the area of a student's specialization will dictate the relevant language. The ability to study the core texts of the modem theoretical and literary traditions in their original languages (e.g., Chinese, French, Ger\u00ad man, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Russian) is usually expected, and a classical language (Arabic, Greek, and Latin) may prove indispensable for work in many fields of study. The student's own area of specialization may require the mastery of still other languages. Competence in two foreign languages is required for the Ph.D.; this competence is verified through examination. UCI's Program in Comparative Literature is designed to prepare the student for a professional career in literary, rhetorical, and cul\u00ad tural studies. To this end, the Program maintains a flexible curricu\u00ad lar structure that enables students to make the most of faculty expertise and programmatic strengths both in the Program and across the School of Humanities while also maintaining the free\u00ad dom to develop independent and innovative projects. Faculty advi\u00ad sors work to ensure each student's progress toward creating a suc\u00ad cessful, professional profile. Although not required to do so, in the course of their studies, students may elect to follow a course of study consonant with a track in (1) Comparative Literature with an emphasis in a literary tradition, (2) Comparative Literature with an emphasis in Translation Studies, or (3) Comparative Literature with UC IRVINE - 2003-2004an emphasis in Critical Theory. (See the departmental graduate stu\u00ad dent handbook for a description of these emphases.) Within these specializations, students enroll in sequences of courses designed to highlight individual interests and expertise such as: (1) CL 200A (History of Comparative Literature and Literary Theory), CL 200B (Theories of Translation), and either CL (Cul\u00ad tural Rhetoric and Rhetorical Theory), along with an emphasis in a specific national literary and cultural focus; (2) CL 200B (Theories of Translation) and those workshops and courses designated as required for the emphasis in Translation Studies; or (3) CL 200A (History of Comparative Literature and Literary Theory), CL 200D (Cultural Rhetoric and Rhetorical Theory), and either CL 200B (Theories of Translation and Mediality) or CL 200C (Theories of Globalization, Inter-Nationalism, and Postcolonialism), and the Schoolwide Critical Theory emphasis. In consultation with faculty advisors, students may also develop individualized curricula of their own that cut across these and other offerings in the Depart\u00ad ment, Program, and School. A minor field specialization is also recommended; this optional component of the program is designed to promote engagement with a field or methodology outside of the student's main area of specialization; it may be of a national, historical, disciplinary, or methodological nature, with the student of western post-modem lit\u00ad erary theory and forms engaging in a focused study of ancient Greek or Roman philosophy and culture, for example, or the stu\u00ad dent of East Asian languages and diasporic literatures working in the fields of anthropological or ethnographic approaches. This optional component of the student's program may be fulfilled through seminar course work, independent studies, or specialized Qualifying Examination topic. Graduate students in Comparative Literature may also choose the emphases in Asian American Studies, Feminist Studies, and Criti\u00ad cal Theory available in the School of Humanities. They may also complete a course of study with an emphasis in Translation Studies or an emphasis in Chinese Language and Literature, Classics, East Asian Cultural Studies, French, German, Japanese Language and Literature, or Spanish. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Entering students are assigned a faculty advisor who usually serves as the chair of the student's M.A. examination committee (which consists of at least two other members of the faculty). The M.A. examination is normally taken during the quarter in which the stu\u00ad dent completes the course work; nine courses are required. The candidate submits an M.A. paper as well as a statement of purpose outlining past and future course work and preliminary plans for the qualifying examination. The M.A. examination itself consists of a discussion of the student's paper and the statement of purpose. In practice, the examination resembles an extended advising session, but with particularly close attention given to the student's paper. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program in Comparative Literature is designed to prepare the student for a professional career in the research and teaching of literary studies and cultural studies; some students also choose to enter professions (e.g., specialized research institutes and consortia, philanthropic organizations, international cultural exchange) in which the specialized work in a specific field indi\u00ad cated by an advanced degree is highly desirable. Details of the program may be found in the departmental graduate student hand\u00ad book. Normally, students who have not done graduate work at another university complete at least 16 courses before the qualify\u00ad ing examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student takes a general examination based on six topics formulated by the student in consultation with the four faculty members who will make up the English and Comparative Literature 247 examination committee. The topics should combine historical breadth and some generic variety with special fields. The examina\u00ad tion is part written, part oral, according to a formula decided by the student and the committee. The examination as a whole should re\u00ad flect the student's ability to work in at least two foreign languages. After passing the qualifying examination, the student forms a dis\u00ad sertation committee of three faculty members, formulates a disser\u00ad tation topic in consultation with them, and submits a prospectus for the dissertation along with a preliminary bibliography. The study toward the Doctor of Philosophy degree culminates in the writing of a suitable dissertation, often on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general lit\u00ad erary and theoretical problems not confined to any specific litera\u00ad tures are also acceptable.

Bin Wong, Ph.D. Harvard University, Director of the Minor in Asian Studies and UCI Chancellor's Professor of History, Economics, and East Asian Languages and Literatures The program in European Studies provides undergraduates with an opportunity to study Europe from the vantage points of several dis\u00ad ciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Because Europe is both a geographical place and an idea which changes throughout UC IRVINE - 2003-2004history, it has haq different meanings at different times and in dif\u00ad ferent places. The study of Europe thus requires an open, pluralis\u00ad tic, and interdisciplinary curriculum that takes a critical approach to the idea (or ideas) of Europe. The program provides a multidis\u00ad ciplinary view of Europe as a whole and of its historical, political, and cultural formation and global implications. It also provides a focus on a specific area of European experience that cuts across traditional disciplinary and national boundaries. Participation in an Education Abroad Program in a European country is strongly rec\u00ad ommended for all European Studies majors. Students may elect to emphasize one of the following areas: Medieval Studies, Early Modem Europe (1450-1789), Modem Europe (1789-present), Encounters with the Non-European World, British Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, The Mediterranean World: Past and Present, Russian Studies, or Spanish-Portuguese Studies. As an alternative, students may define their own emphasis in consultation with a program advisor and with the approval of the European Studies Advisory Board. Because there are so many emphasis options within the major, stu\u00ad dents are assigned for academic advising to members of the Euro\u00ad pean Studies Advisory Board and are required to consult with their advisor on a quarterly basis. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in European Studies prepares its graduates to enter advanced degree programs in international business, history, law, and political science. The strong academic skills and professional orientation acquired by European Studies majors are necessary to pursue successful careers in such fields as international banking, law, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. Humanities graduates in general learn to express ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analyti\u00ad cally and imaginatively-the required tools for success beyond the undergraduate career. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See page 224-225.

Stein, Ph.D. Yale University, Associate Professor of Art History (American art, history of photography, photography and media) Undergraduate Program We live in a world in which we are surrounded by images. Whether printed on roadside billboards or broadcast into our homes via tele\u00ad vision, the media greatly influence our sense of who we are and how we live. Yet so much of our exposure to the sights and sounds of film, TV, video, advertising, and new technologies is taken for granted. Those sights and sounds are so pervasive, and in many cases so enjoyable, that we rarely pause to consider how they act upon us and how we interact with them. An undergraduate educa\u00ad tion in Film and Media Studies provides students with an opportu\u00ad nity to explore the appeal and to begin to understand the operation of these complex meaning-producing machines we call cinema, television, and new technologies. The course work for the B.A. degree program in Film Studies trains students to read and understand the audio-visual languages of modem media and new technologies and to analyze images from socioeconomic, political, aesthetic, and historical perspectives. Learning these critical viewing skills involves learning new ways of seeing. The Film and Media Studies curriculum is systematic and comprehensive; upper-division courses have between 20 and 50 students and are typically taught by regular faculty. During the 2002-03 academic year, there were more than 235 Film Studies majors enrolled at UCI. The Department of Film and Media Studies familiarizes students with the history, theory, and art of cinema and other media. Courses focus on a range of topics, including individual directors, period styles, genres, national cinemas, the history and criticism of televi\u00ad sion, and developments in new technologies. Additional courses offer students hands-on experience in video production and screen\u00ad writing. The program provides its majors with a thorough apprecia\u00ad tion of the modem media's roles in contemporary society. Regular course offerings are complemented by film and video screenings and series at the School of Humanities Film and Video Center. Film and Media Studies, in cooperation with other units at UCI, regularly invites scholars, directors, producers, and screenwriters to campus to share their work and perspectives with students. Film and Media Studies at UCI is unique in its concentration on the history, theory, and criticism of cinema, television, and new technologies. The faculty has published books and articles on top\u00ad ics that include images of the Vietnam war, avant-garde directors, ethnographic film, film and postmodemisrri, horror cinema, women filmmakers, television performance, and new technologies. In order to cover the extra costs generated by the purchase and rental of media and production equipment demanded by the spe\u00ad cialized Film and Media Studies curriculum, the School of Human\u00ad ities charges a laboratory fee of $20 per course to all students tak\u00ad ing Film Studies courses. Film Studies students can complete professional internships in the fields of film or television production, distribution, writing, and related areas for elective course credit. Film Studies students also have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the University's Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program. Information is available both in the Film and Media Studies Office and the Education Abroad Program Office. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Film Studies will provide students with a variety of opportunities leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. Graduates from the program have gone on to a host of different careers. Some have pursued graduate work in critical film studies at leading institutions such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Iowa. Others have entered M.F.A. programs in production at places like the University of Southern California, UCLA, or San Fran\u00ad cisco State University. Many are now at work in various sectors of the entertainment industry as feature film editors, executives in video distribution companies, technicians for local news programs, and independent filmmakers. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French (sixteenth-century French literature) Undergraduate Program in French The Undergraduate Program in French offers a broad humanistic course of study designed for students in the liberal arts. The orien\u00ad tation of the program is multidisciplinary, where the study of liter\u00ad ature is linked to critical, cultural, and historical concerns. Courses reflect the faculty's interest in the related disciplines of history, philosophy, anthropology, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative literature, and express its conviction that the study of French literature and culture is enriched by pursuing its relations with other disciplines, fields, and cultures. Lower-division language courses encourage students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. These courses are taught entirely in French, and the approach to teaching stresses the inter\u00ad dependence of the four basic language skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Laboratory is used to comple\u00ad ment classroom activity. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary lit\u00ad erary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversa\u00ad tion, reading, and composition. After the second year, advanced courses in conversation and writing enable students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in the multidisciplinary upper-division program. All upper-division offerings are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in size, they promote and encourage participation and discussion and facilitate direct contact with UC IRVINE - 2003-2004professors. In the introductory courses in literature, texts are stud\u00ad ied in their historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical concepts and vocabularies. At the more advanced level, the multidisciplinary courses bring together material and methodologies from the various disciplines in order to address interpretive problems of French literature, culture, and history. In recent years, courses have been offered in literature and political opposition, monsters and madness in Renaissance literature, cubism in painting and poetry, ethnography and literature, autobi\u00ad ography, Francophone literature, and Albert Camus and Algeria. The content of courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Placement examinations will no longer be required for students who have successfully completed French language classes in high school. Students will now be placed in French language courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school French will be considered equal to one quarter of a UCI French course. Thus, for example, students with two years of high school French language will be placed in lC, while students who have completed three years in high school will be placed in 2A. Students in 2A will, however, be informed of their level of competency in French by taking a diagnostic test the first day of class. Students who place in 2A but who have scored below what is expected for successful performance in 2A will be informed that they may either remain in 2A or choose to enroll in lC instead. Student representatives serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. CAREERS FOR THE FRENCH MAJOR The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in business and commerce, where they can take advantage not only of their proficiency in French language but also of their knowledge of French literature and culture. Many students also go on to law school, to medical school, and to careers in the diplomatic service. In recent years, graduates have entered the field of education in increasing numbers. The Department's multidisciplinary approach to the study of literature teaches students to think critically and develops analytical skills that can be applied to a wide range of problems. It also helps students to develop the interpretive and writing skills necessary to express their own ideas clearly and per\u00ad suasively. Whether they enter business or professions such as law, education, or government, French majors acquire the intellectual and communicative skills requisite for success. The UCI Career Center provides service to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the Major French lOOA-B, 101A-B-C, and nine other upper-division courses taught in the Department. Students may take up to two courses from the Department offerings taught in English. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses (above 101A-B-C) required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French lOOA-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper~division. Prerequisite: French 2C or equivalent. French and Italian 255 Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfill the major requirements. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or indepen\u00ad dently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with faculty members concerning career plans in areas such as teaching, industry, journalism, law, and civil service. Undergraduate Minor in Italian Studies The minor in Italian Studies is an interdisciplinary curric4lum that allows students to go beyond second-year Italian and engage in various aspects of Italian culture by taking courses in Italian litera\u00ad ture in the Department of French and Italian and other courses related to Italian history and culture in the Departments of Art His\u00ad tory, English and Comparative Literature, Film and Media Studies, History, and Philosophy. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Italian lA-B-C, 2A-B-C; and seven upper-division courses selected from the following two lists, when topics are appropriate. At least five of the seven courses must be from list A. A. Art History 120, 121, 125, 198; English and Comparative Liter\u00ad ature lOlB, lOlC; Philosophy 132. (No more than two courses may be taken from the same department.) B. Art History 107, 198; Classics 140, 150, 170; English Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken at an Italian university through the UC Education Abroad Program, provided they are approved in advance by the Director of the Minor. Students who complete significant course work on Italian topics while participating in the Education Abroad Program in Italy are encouraged to pursue their interest in Italian studies through the special Humanities interdisciplinary major, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities. Interested students should consult the Senior Academic Counselor in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Graduate Program in French The Department of French and Italian offers a graduate program in French with a strong theoretical, cultural, and multidisciplinary ori\u00ad entation. In addition to their specialties in the traditionally consti\u00ad tuted fields of French literature, the faculty is actively involved in related disciplines such as philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropol\u00ad ogy, history, women's studies, cultural studies, and comparative lit\u00ad erature. A theoretical and multidisciplinary approach to literature is a demanding one requiring, among other things, a restless critique of its own evaluations and concepts. In small seminars designed to stimulate intellectual exchange, stu\u00ad dents and faculty explore literature written in French within the context of relevant historical, cultural, or theoretical issues. They raise questions engaged by literary discourse and study critically UC IRVINE - 2003-2004256 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities the theories formulated to account for it. Courses tend to cross lines between disciplines and to emphasize both the close reading of texts and modem theories of history, culture, literature, and crit\u00ad icism. Students are encouraged to pursue their work in related fields outside the Department. They are also strongly encouraged to study abroad at some point during their graduate career. MASTER OF ARTS IN FRENCH The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doc\u00ad torate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. All entering graduate stu\u00ad dents are counseled by the graduate advisor. During the winter quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign lan\u00ad guage in addition to French is required for the M.A. degree (profi\u00ad ciency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass the Master's examination. Plan I allows particularly well-prepared students to receive special permission to take nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. Under Plan II candidates take a mini\u00ad mum of 11 courses and have the option of taking a written exami\u00ad nation or of writing a research paper. The written examination con\u00ad sists of essays that demonstrate skills of literary analysis and an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The research paper involves a care\u00ad fully developed and well-documented analysis that reflects exten\u00ad sive critical reading. In all cases students also take an oral exami\u00ad nation that focuses on the written essays or the research paper and that seeks as well to test the student's broader knowledge. The Master's examination is normally given at the end of the win\u00ad ter quarter of the second year of studies. Students who are Teach\u00ad ing Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Students transferring to the program from other graduate institu\u00ad tions may receive credit for up to two courses, subject to the approval of the Department. A maximum of five courses may be transferable from other UC graduate programs, with departmental approval. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN FRENCH Upon successful completion of the Master's examination and admission to the Ph.D. program, or upon admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed in consultation with the student. The Guidance Com\u00ad mittee advises the student in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The Committee is com\u00ad prised of five faculty members: three from the Department, one from outside the Department who represents the student's outside area of specialization, and, for the qualifying examination, another faculty member not affiliated with the Department who represents the faculty-at-large. One member of the Committee is expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 15 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A. and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specializa\u00ad tion are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Department and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with an emphasis in Comparative Literature by taking a minimum of five courses in the Comparative Literature program. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination-Written and Oral: Upon completion of course work, the student takes a series of examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The Ph.D. Examina\u00ad tion encourages focus and depth at a time when the student's area of specialization and eventual dissertation topic should be taking an increasingly clearer shape. In consultation with the Guidance Com\u00ad mittee, the student defines the precise nature and scope of four top\u00ad ics for the examination, which consists of written and oral parts. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members; chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Departmental courses are focused on language, literature, and film in context, that is, within the historical, social, intellectual, and political circumstances of their production and continuing recep\u00ad tion. Clearly, we come to understand ourselves and our immediate culture much better through the study of different languages and cultural systems. Therefore, university language study is not merely a matter of memorizing vocabulary and practicing pronunciation. It is the serious investigation of a foreign linguistic system and the cultures which are defined by it. It is difficult-in fact, nearly impossible-for us to scrutinize and analyze something we know as intimately as our native language, and yet this is the order by which we formulate our thoughts and the order which may some\u00ad times formulate our thoughts for us. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language allows us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. This kind of knowledge of one's native language is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, jour\u00ad nalistic, and others. Thus, serious study of a foreign language is absolutely crucial to a university education. The Department teaches its language courses with this principle in mind and seeks to provide its students with a framework for these linguistic and cultural comparisons. Department literature and film courses offer a variety of critical perspectives from historical, social, or politically engaged readings to feminist and post-structuralist analysis. Topics range from stud\u00ad ies of individual authors, periods, and genres to the history of Ger\u00ad man-language literature and film, the theory of criticism, and the relations of German-language literature to other literatures. Undergraduate Program The Department offers a major and a minor in German Studies. The major can be combined as a double major with any other UCI course of study; see an academic counselor for information. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the coui:se. In the lowercdivision lan\u00ad guage courses students develop skills in speaking, listening, read\u00ad ing, and writing through an engaging, collaborative, task-based curriculum. The courses place a great deal of emphasis on mean\u00ad ingful cultural literacy in German, employing a diverse range of authentic texts and materials from the beginning, including avid use of Internet resources. During the second year (intermediate), students benefit from a curriculum based on authentic literary and cultural content (theater, media, and such) and global simulation of \"real world\" situations. These courses have the additional goal of contributing to students' education in the humanities and develop\u00ad ing their skills in critical thinking. After completion of the intermediate level, students enroll in the German 100 series (Advanced Reading, Writing, Oral Communica\u00ad tion) and in Introduction to German Literature and Culture (Ger\u00ad man 101), which provides an introduction to genre, periodization, and the German terminology used in critical analysis. This course is taken in preparation for the upper-division literature and film courses (German 102, 117, 118, 119, 120), which range histori\u00ad cally from the Reformation to the present and cover a variety of topics and approaches. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) is taught in English for both German Studies students and those who do not speak the language, and covers topics in German literature and culture, literary theory, and criticism as well as German-language cinema. Students are encouraged to participate in work-and study-abroad programs in German-speaking countries: The Department recom\u00ad Education Abroad Program (EAP) in GOt\u00ad tingen, Germany. Gottingen is an old university town in central Germany, where EAP students complete an advanced language program and enroll in university courses with great success, usu\u00ad ally achieving native or near-native fluency during this exciting year abroad. EAP also offers semester- and year-long programs in Berlin and Bayreuth. All EAP courses are accepted for UCI gradu\u00ad ation credit and many contribute to fulfillment of the German UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Studies major and minor requirements. More information is avail\u00ad able from the academic counselors. German placement tests are recommended but not required for stu\u00ad dents who have successfully completed foreign language classes in high school. To obtain information about dates and content of the German placement test, please contact the UCI Testing Office at (949) 824-6207. Students with college-level course work should present their transcript to an academic counselor in the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office, 143 Humanities Instructional Build\u00ad ing, or call (949) 824-5132 for assistance in determining which UCI course to take. Apart from the optional placement test, students are placed in Ger\u00ad man language courses according to the number of years of previ\u00ad ous study. In general, one year of high school German is consid\u00ad ered equal to one quarter of a UCI German language course. During the first week of German 2A a diagnostic test is adminis\u00ad tered in class, in order to inform students of their readiness to suc\u00ad ceed in 2A. While all students with at least three years of high school German or the equivalent may opt to remain in German 2A, those who score below 70 percent on the diagnostic test will be advised to enroll in 1C or below. CAREERS FOR THE GERMAN STUDIES MAJOR The ability to speak and write German can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, gov\u00ad ernment, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Because German plays such an important role in modern technology, employers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, professional translating, and all levels of education increasingly seek students with a knowl\u00ad edge of German. German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sciences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the arts. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the Major German lOOA, B, C; German 101; eight upper~division courses in German literature and culture; and two courses selected from Ger\u00ad man 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 3, English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture CL 50A, B, C, courses in German history, German philosophy, or German political science, as approved by the advisor for the major. The upper-division writing requirement must be met by additional course work either within or outside the Department. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German lOOA, B, C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. German 259 Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students into direct contact with some of the outstanding scholars in the field of German Studies. Distinguished Visiting Professors typically visit for one quarter, during which they teach a\u00b7 graduate course and an undergraduate course and present a lecture to which students, faculty, and other members of the University community are invited. Program participants include Bengt Algot Sfi)renson (Odense), Uwe Ketelsen (Bochum), Peter State), Hans Wysling (ZUrich), Hans-Wolf Jager (Bremen), Norbert Oellers (Bonn), Hans Rudolf Vaget (Smith College), Heinrich Detering (Gottingen), Ulker Gokberk (Reed College), Stephanie Hammer (UC River\u00ad side), Helmut Schneider (Bonn), RichardGray (University of Washington), Ursula Mahlendorf (UC Santa Barbara), and Sander Gilman (University of Illinois, Chicago). Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical under\u00ad standing of the nature of literature and culture. Seminars focus on German literary and cultural development after 1700. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all depart\u00ad ments of the School of Humanities. A graduate emphasis in Femi\u00ad nist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. In addition, graduate students in German may choose to complete an emphasis in Comparative Literature. The graduate program in German is essentially a Ph.D. program. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a ter\u00ad minal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institu\u00ad tion, the Department will evaluate the studenfs progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. MASTER OF ARTS IN GERMAN Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Nor\u00ad mally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered indi\u00ad vidually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this require\u00ad ment before entering the program. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German lit\u00ad erature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 260 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works on the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially famil\u00ad iar. In its final form (including works read during the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the stu\u00ad dent's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodolog\u00ad ical progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the can\u00ad didate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the following items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The dis\u00ad cussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Year of Residence. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN GERMAN The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, and others suitable for the individual student's program of study. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current dur\u00ad ing the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individ\u00ad ually as to remaining course requirements. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examina\u00ad tion. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the stu\u00ad dent will choose either (1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. The examina\u00ad tion essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the compre\u00ad hensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive exami\u00ad nation is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's stud\u00ad ies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate read\u00ad ing knowledge of two languages or extensive competence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these require\u00ad ments may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the stu\u00ad dent should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and comple\u00ad tion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the signature page of the dissertation.

Bin Wong, Ph.D. Harvard University, Director of the Minor in Asian Studies and UCI Chancellor's Professor of History, Economics, and East Asian Languages and Literatures The major in Global Cultures provides UCI students with an opportunity to explore the stimulating ways in which local and global processes are intertwined. In recent decades, the intensified processes of globalization have meant that cultural practices, sym\u00ad bolic systems, and the intersectional formations of gender, sexual\u00ad ity, race, ethnicity, and class have increasingly spanned national boundaries. But, on the other hand, this feature of the world today was shaped by and is as much a feature of the past. The aim of the Global Cultures major is to provide students with a humanistic framework for understanding the problem and processes of global\u00ad ization in relationship to change across time and space, the forma\u00ad tion and contestation of identity, and theoretical and discursive practices that shape philosophical speculation and belief. Students may choose one of the following approved emphases or may define their own emphasis in consultation with a program advisor and with the approval of the Global Cultures Committee. Atlantic Rim: Explores the movement of people and cultures in relationship to the historical and contemporary experience of soci\u00ad eties that are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, including, among oth\u00ad ers, west Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, and western and northern Europe, as well as the British archipelago. Hispanic, U.S. Latina/Latina, and Luso-Brazilian Cultures: Exam\u00ad ines the historical, political, and cultural formations of regions where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken, including Spain, Portu\u00ad gal, Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in the Western Hemisphere, and the Latino/Latina population in the United States. Locating Africas (Nation, Culture, and Diaspora): Examines Africa as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its historical, political, and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Locating Asias (Nation, Culture, and Diaspora): Examines Asia as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its his\u00ad torical and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Locating Europes and European Colonies: Examines Europe as a diverse geographical and political expression, including its histori\u00ad cal and cultural formation locally, regionally, and globally. Pacific Rim: Explores the movement of people and cultures in rela\u00ad tionship to the historical and contemporary experience of societies that are adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, including, among others, India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, the United States, Central and South America, and Malayasia. Inter-Area Studies: Includes comparative studies of the geographi\u00ad cal regions outlined in the above six emphases, for instance, the analysis of Africans in Asia, or the cultural, historical, and political connections between the Atlantic and the Pacific Rim. Because there are so many emphasis options within the major, stu\u00ad dents will be assigned for academic advising to a member of the Global Cultures Committee or a Core faculty \u00b7member and are required to consult with their advisor on a quarterly basis. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Students in this major will be well prepared to do what other. Humanities majors do after graduation: work in business, law, edu\u00ad cation, politics, public policy, academia, and print and television media. Global Cultures majors will be especially qualified for careers inthe foreign service and international business. Students majoring in Humanities are particularly well prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are impor\u00ad tant. The Global Cultures major will equip students with a knowl\u00ad edge and understanding of the complexities of the diverse world in which they live. Perhaps nowhere more than in the State of Cali\u00ad fornia, the contemporary workforce is constituted of people who have crossed geographic and cultural boundaries and who are embodiments of the forces of globalization that this major will help students to understand better. Global Cultures majors will thus be particularly sensitive to the challenges and opportunities pre\u00ad sented by the multicultural society of which they are a part. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

The Department presents a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disci\u00ad plinary skills: weighing evidence, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. The Department offers a number of lower-division courses open to nonmajors as well as majors, most of which fulfill part of the UCI breadth requirement: The Department requires all majors to take an introductory course in three of four regional histories-United States history, European history, Latin American history, or East Asian history. These courses are also open to nonmajors. Students who are interested in the study of history but are major\u00ad ing in other disciplines may minor in History. The minor incorpo\u00ad rates elements of the Department's prograni for majors but allows students enough flexibility to pursue programs in other depart\u00ad ments and schools. Upper-division courses range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., Chinese history), to studies. of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to his\u00ad torical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women in the United States). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of col-. loquia in social history, political history, international history, intel\u00ad lectual history, social thought, imd comparative history. The collo\u00ad quia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The research seminar is a one\u00ad quarter seminar in primary materials that culminates in the writing of a research paper. The faculty encourages History majors and minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward UC IRVINE - 2003-2004264 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities their UCI degree. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that can provide other perspectives on history. See the Center for International Edu\u00ad cation section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for additional information. CAREERS FOR THE HISTORY MAJOR The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to under\u00ad stand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to grad\u00ad uate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required: three courses from the History 70 series, Problems in History (History 70A Asia, 70B Europe, 70C United States, 70D Latin America); three upper-division History courses with a regional or thematic focus decided upon in consulta\u00ad tion with a faculty advisor, at least one of which is devoted to the period prior to 1800; two colloquia (History 190), one of which is followed by a research seminar (History 192); two additional upper-division History courses outside the regional or thematic focus area; and three additional lower-or upper-division History courses. Residence Requirement for the Major: Three History courses, a colloquium, and a research seminar must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required: a year-long survey in world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (History 40A, 40B, 40C), or three courses in problems of history (History 70A Asia, 70B Europe, 70C United States, 70D Latin America); and four upper-division History courses. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. Graduate Program The M.A. and Ph.D. degree programs in History are designed to provide students with both advanced historical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with signifi\u00ad cant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candidates for a Ph.D. in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a teaching assistant. Basic to the curriculum is the Department's course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most sat\u00ad isfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. The colloquium, a reading course that examines a field's chief his\u00ad torical works, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. A collo\u00ad quium series is offered annually in American history; biannually (depending on demand) in modem European history, early modem European history, Latin American history, South and Southeast Asian history, East Asian history, world history, Middle Eastern and North African history, and ancient history; and occasionally in medieval history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. In addition to the History and Theory sequence and the major field colloquia, students also take a proseminar/research seminar sequence during their first year. The proseminar provides an orien\u00ad tation to the literature on a broad historical subject, and the associ\u00ad ated seminar offers guidance in research and writing on problems within this broad area. Students awarded M.A. degrees at other institutions before entering the graduate program at UCI may be exempted from this requirement, subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses. During the second year of study, Ph.D. students normally take a colloquium series in their second field. They also take a two-quar\u00ad ter research seminar where they have an opportunity to work on problems of their own choosing; students who entered the program with an M.A. degree must also take this seminar. In addition, inde\u00ad pendent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop two fields of competence in addition to History and Theory. Compe\u00ad tence in the two fields is demonstrated by the satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of three courses in each of these areas. A comprehensive oral examination on the student's major field follows fulfillment of all degree requirements. However, those students who elect a second field administered by another program or department (e.g., Critical Theory, Asian American Studies, Feminist Studies) must complete requirements, which sometimes include a written examination, for that field. Competence in History and Theory is demonstrated by satisfactory completion of History 200A and 200B. History 200C may be taken as an elective. The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical community at UCI in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also accepts students who have previously special\u00ad ized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and UC IRVINE - 2003-2004self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergradu\u00ad ate grade point average of 3.3 (B+) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation and scores from the Graduate Record Examination. An example of written work in history from undergraduate courses is also required. A departmental interview may also be required. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admis\u00ad sion is January 2. MASTER OF ARTS IN HISTORY Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoretical and historiographical dimensions of history. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the stu\u00ad dent's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in a colloquium series, a proseminar and related first-year research seminar, a secondary emphasis of two related courses (History and Theory 200A and 200B, or other), a thesis course or preparation class for the written examination in the major field (taken as 291), and another elective course. Students who decide to pursue the Ph.D. after completion of the M.A. program need to consider Ph.D. course requirements when selecting courses. Language Requirement. Students in the M.A. program whose major field requires use of foreign language sources demonstrate competence in a foreign language in the process of writing the first-year research paper and thesis. Other M.A. students do not have to meet a foreign language or alternative skills requirement. Plan 1: Thesis. The master's thesis represents a revision of the first-year research paper, equivalent to a scholarly article of 40-50 typescript pages, under the supervision of a professor in the stu\u00ad dent's major field and reviewed and approved by a three-member thesis committee, at least two of which must be History faculty members. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive written examination administered by three faculty members covering the student's major field (e.g., America, Early Modem Europe) and focused upon material assigned in the three-quarter colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and can be completed during that term if full-time study is undertaken. However, it is expected that many M.A. stu\u00ad dents are employed and need to enroll on a part-time basis. There\u00ad fore, students are allowed up to three years of graduate study to complete the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN HISTORY Ph.D. students are advised to begin their graduate work at UCI, since those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming stu\u00ad dents, with the exception of the First-Year Research Seminar. Sub\u00ad ject to evaluation of their M.A. theses, these students will be exempted from this requirement. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to their advantage in speeding them to the qualifying examination. First-Year Review. To be admitted formally into the doctoral pro\u00ad gram, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Emphasis in Creative Nonfiction. In addition to meeting admis\u00ad sion requirements, applicants must submit an additional writing sample that demonstrates aptitude for the program. During their program of study, students take three of the writing workshops or their equivalents that are offered through the International Center for Writing and Translation. They also write a dissertation that History 265 meets traditional intellectual standards for academic rigor and is accessible to an audience beyond the academy. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in three different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first field (such as Modem Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second field (such as American History or Critical Theory), which is designed as a second teaching field. The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquium series in both fields, First-Year Pro\u00ad seminar/Research Seminar sequence, and the Second-Year Research Seminar. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. However, applicants may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows students to take a lighter course load at reduced fees for a maximum of two academic years. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examination. Ph.D. students can be awarded an M.A. after fulfilling require\u00ad ments for residence and one language and successfully completing 36 units, including 28 in required courses. They also take a two\u00ad hour oral examination with an advisor. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of two foreign languages prior to taking the Ph.D. candidacy qualifying examination. Com\u00ad petency in a language may be established either by passing a depart\u00ad mental examination (proctored in the department office) or through extensive language use in one of the research seminars. The spe\u00ad cific languages that may be used to satisfy this requirement depend on the students' first fields, subject to their advisors' approval. Students may substitute for one of their language requirements one or a sequence of two graduate courses in an allied discipline or rel\u00ad evant methodology (e.g., critical theory, political theory, cultural anthropology, Asian Americari studies, feminist theory, art history, linguistics, statistics, quantitative methods), at the discretion of their major field advisors. Students choosing this option are nor\u00ad mally expected to write a substantial paper and must demonstrate that the allied discipline or methodology used to fulfill the require\u00ad ment is of value to historical inquiry. The course(s) taken to satisfy a language requirement may not count toward fulfilling the requirement for the second field. Qualifying Examination and Dissertation. In preparation for the oral Qualifying Examination, the student will present to the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee a portfolio of three papers totaling at least 45 pages on subjects related to the major field (but not from required colloquia courses). Successful completion of this exami\u00ad nation results in the student's advancement to Ph.D. candidacy. Within one academic quarter of the oral examination, new candi\u00ad dates must meet in a colloquy with their Doctoral Committee to present their dissertation proposal. Once the Doctoral Committee approves the proposal, the student begins intensive work on the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort may require from one to four years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation, focusing on the adequacy of the stu\u00ad dent's research and thesis, is normally held. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within seven years.

Otis Art Institute, Assistant Professor of Studio Art (video, multimedia, film theory) The major in Humanities and Arts provides students with a broad exposure to a range of disciplinary and methodological opportuni\u00ad ties in the Humanities and Arts. It insists on the productive inter\u00ad section of these two fields as the focus of each student's program. Students improve their critical and historical sophistication while learning about the process of performance and creative work, a combination that equips them to participate more effectively in a society that increasingly joins critique and creation just as closely as it fuses image and information. Humanities and Arts students investigate the symbolic dimension of human behavior and identity, an interest shared by many critics and artists alike. Often, this interest is expressed in the context of interdisciplinary programs designed to facilitate contact among faculty and students from a wide range of different academic disci\u00ad plines. This major's focus on the connection between practice and analysis distinguishes it from the broader and more diverse scope of more general interdisciplinary programs. The scholarly work of many UCI faculty in the Humanities and Arts lies at an intersection between the two academic units, and the major translates this intel\u00ad lectual and creative activity into a coherent curriculum and projects current forms of scholarship and artistic practice into the classroom. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates of this program will be very attractive to teacher-train\u00ad ing programs. There is also a steadily growing market in private industry for students whose training combines skills sharpened by both the Humanities and Arts. Business demands graduates with strong writing and analytic skills, talents stressed in the Humani\u00ad ties. They also desire people with creativity and visual skills who have experience putting their original ideas into practice, some\u00ad thing emphasized in the Arts. Graduates will have special skills that will enable them to work in professional fields directly allied with the Arts, including museum work, art foundations, art criti\u00ad cism, journalism, theatre, and the entertainment industry. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR;S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Requirements for the Major Humanities 1A-B-C; one lower-division survey in a specialization in the Arts, chosen from Dance 90A-B-C, Drama 40A,B,C, Music l4A-B-C, Studio Art IOA,B,C; six units of \"studio courses\" in Dance, Drama, or Studio Art or six units of \"ensemble courses\" in Music (if students have the necessary skills, these can be upper\u00ad division courses); Humanities and Arts 100, 101; 16 additional Humanities 273 units of upper-division Humanities courses and 16 additional units of upper-division Arts courses focusing on a specific theme, region, or period, chosen with the approval of a Humanities and Arts faculty advisor.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Philosophy, and other majors in the School. The major in Humani\u00ad ties accommodates students who want to organize their undergrad\u00ad uate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Com\u00ad munity; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reforma\u00ad tion; Italian Society and Culture). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper (40-50 pages) in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the Senior Acade\u00ad mic Counselor in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses in Humanities required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI.

One set of courses develops skills .in critical reading, writing, and analysis that are necessary in dealing with legal issues. Another set presents theoretical and analytical perspectives on ethical, political, and social issues relevant to the law. A final set focuses on specific legal issues from a humanistic perspective. Lower-division require\u00ad ments primarily develop foundational skills in the first set, whereas upper-division requirements build on these skills by addressing the concerns from the other sets. The minor does not include how-to courses on particular legal practices. Requirements for the Minor Lower-Division: Philosophy 29 (Critical Reasoning) or Classics 75 (Classical Rhetoric); Humanities lA-B-C (Humanities Core Course) or Philosophy I (Introduction to Philosophy), 4 (Introduc\u00ad tion to Ethics), and either 5 (Contemporary Moral Problems) or 9 (Feminist Moral and Political Philosophy). Upper-Division: Six courses from among a list of quarterly approved courses. Each year the list will include courses from clas\u00ad sics, history, literature/writing, and philosophy. Consult the School of Humanities Web site (http://www.humanities.uci.edu) or an aca\u00ad demic counselor for currently approved courses. Students considering a career in law are strongly encouraged to take advantage of other law-related courses offered across the cam\u00ad pus and of extracurricular activities such as the Pre-Law Society. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be successfully completed at UCI. Two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, provided course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair.

Walsh, M.B.B.S., Ph.D. University of Queensland, Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and of Philosophy Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insistently in every area of human experience and in every discipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as religion and moral thought, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004CAREERS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergraduates trained in Philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The ana\u00ad lytical skills developed in Philosophy courses are especially useful in legal education; indeed, many UCI Philosophy graduates have been successful at top law schools. Former Philosophy students have also used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and computer programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the grad\u00ad uate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, there\u00ad fore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sus\u00ad tained interchanges between students and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and spe\u00ad cial disciplines such as art or science. The undergraduate advisor should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the spe\u00ad cialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those Philoso\u00ad phy majors whose intention may be either to enter some profes\u00ad sional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. The faculty encourages Philosophy majors and minors to seriously consider expanding their perspective through an experience of study abroad. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities for study and research. Specifically, those interested in analytic philosophy could consider the EAP programs in the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Aus\u00ad tralia, and New Zealand, and those interested in Continental philos\u00ad ophy could consider the EAP programs in France, Germany, and Italy. See the Center for International Education section of. the Cat\u00ad alogue or your academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 224-225. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30 or 104; 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; Philosophy 101, 102, 103, and five additional quarter courses from Philosophy 100, 105-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 105A and 105B. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of two portions: a lower-division portion and an upper-division portion. Both must be satisfied. Lower division: Three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 4, 5, 30 or three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 6, 7, 30 or three courses selected from Philosophy 10, 11; 12, 13, 30. Philosophy 279 Upper division: Four courses in a given subfield of philosophy, some of which have been pre-approved by the Department and are included below: History of Philosophy (Philosophy 110-117); Metaphysics and Epistemology (Philosophy 120--124); Value Theory (Philosophy 113B, 130--135); Logic and Methodology (Philosophy 115, 140--148). Other four-course sequences may be pos\u00ad sible, subject to written permission by the Department.. Such a sequence must consist of related courses in a coherent subfield. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be completed successfully at UCI. By petition, two of the four may be taken through the UC Education Abroad Program, providing course content is approved in advance by the appropriate department chair. Graduate Program The Ph.D. program in Philosophy is jointly and cooperatively administered by the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humanities and the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Sci\u00ad ence (LPS) in the School of Social Sciences. The graduate program has two distinct tracks-the Philosophy track and the LPS track\u00ad both of which begin from a common core of shared requirements in history of philosophy, logic, ethics, and metaphysics/epistemol\u00ad ogy. Students are advised to apply to the track whose faculty, areas of specialization, and curriculum most closely correspond to their interests. The Philosophy track is described here. See the Depart\u00ad ment of Logic and Philosophy of Science for a description of the LPS track. Students in the Philosophy track are encouraged to seek the coun\u00ad sel of any and all members of the Philosophy Department and the Logic and Philosophy of Science Department whose recommenda\u00ad tions the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and pro\u00ad fessors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward the advanced degree. In addition, the Philosophy Department spon\u00ad sors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. The Logic and Philosophy of Science Department also sponsors colloquia that might be of interest to Philosophy track students. Every new graduate student is assigned a faculty. member whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with this faculty member each quarter about progress and any adminis\u00ad trative or academic difficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Philosophy Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of April. When the student has satisfied the residency requirement and the history, logic, field, tools of research, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is.the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. MASTER OF ARTS IN PHILOSOPHY There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the logic and portfolio requirements for the Philosophy track. Refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 280 UCI 2003-04 School of Humanities the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHILOSOPHY There is no set number of courses required for the Philosophy track, so that work can be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Philosophy track is designed to take five years for the nor\u00ad mally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within four years. A master's degree is not a pre\u00ad requisite for the Ph.D. The following items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Distribution Requirements. Students are required to take a range of courses designed to expose them to the various historical peri\u00ad ods and fields of philosophy. No particular courses are required; when course offerings are announced, students are notified about which courses can be used to satisfy which requirements. In some cases, the requirement satisfied will ultimately depend on the con\u00ad tent of the student's term paper(s). The Distribution Requirements are: 1. History. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in at least four courses covering at least three of the following areas: Ancient, Medieval, Modem Empiricism, Modem Rationalism, Kant, Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. 2. Field. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in two courses in value theory and one course in metaphysics/epistemology. These requirements must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Logic Requirement. Students must receive a grade of B or better in an approved logic course. This requirement must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Tools of Research. This requirement allows students to pursue the tool which they and their advisors deem most useful for their area of concentration, either a foreign language or some course of study outside philosophy. To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an examination in a single appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in each of three appropriate graduate-level courses in a discipline other than philosophy. The two-hour foreign language examination (administered by the Philosophy Department) requires students to translate, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from one or two philosophical authors. For the second option, courses of study outside philosophy will be approved (by the Philosophy Department Director of Graduate Studies) when they bear on a student's area of philosophical con\u00ad centration. Though the courses must be in a discipline other than philosophy, they may in fact be taught in the Philosophy Depart\u00ad ment or the LPS Program (e.g., a course in mathematical logic taught by an LPS faculty member). This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Portfolio. A portfolio is an extended writing sample designed to demonstrate a student's ability (a) to understand, analyze, and evaluate positions and arguments in classical and contemporary philosophical literature, and (b) to formulate and defend an origi\u00ad nal philosophical thesis. These virtues must be displayed at a level of sophistication that indicates the student's ability to write a Ph.D. dissertation. The portfolio must be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator at the end of the fourth week of the student's seventh quarter in residence. Portfolios will be evaluated by the entire faculty of the Philosophy Department. (Philosophy track students may request that relevant LPS faculty also be present at the evaluation meeting.) Candidacy Examination. In preparation for the candidacy exami\u00ad nation, students consult with their thesis advisor and other appro\u00ad priate faculty to prepare a reading list on their area of concentra\u00ad tion and a brief dissertation proposal. Students apply for candidacy by filing appropriate forms, including a list (devised in consultation with their advisor) of appropriate members for their Candidacy Committee; one of these, the External Examiner, must come from outside the School of Humanities. The Committee is then appointed by the Philosophy Department, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, to administer the oral candidacy examination on the reading list and proposal to determine whether or not the student is prepared to begin work on the dissertation. This requirement must be completed by the end of the tenth quarter in residence. The Philosophy Department Chair, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, then appoints a Doctoral Committee (typically taken from the Candidacy Com\u00ad mittee and naturally including the dissertation advisor) to supervise the writing of the dissertation. Dissertation Defense. Students must defend their dissertation dur\u00ad ing an oral examination administered by their Doctoral Committee. THE SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM The Department of Philosophy and the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science jointly administer an Exchange Program with the University of Salzburg. The program has two parts. The Scholarly Exchange provides opportunities for faculty and graduate students in Philosophy and LPS to visit Salzburg and for faculty and graduate students from Salzburg to visit one or the other of the UCI units. The Program also sponsors joint conferences, held alter\u00ad nately in Irvine and in Salzburg; these are co-sponsored by Salzburg and the UCI Interdisciplinary Program in the History and Philoso\u00ad phy of Science. To be eligible for the Salzburg Exchange, a graduate student must have advanced to candidacy. The selected student spends one semes\u00ad ter in Salzburg, usually teaching one course in the general area of the thesis topic. An upper-division course may be taught in Eng\u00ad lish, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typically, a Salzburg visitor will receive a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg will also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). Application should be made to the Philosophy Department's Salzburg Exchange Director by November 1 and should include a curriculum vita and syllabi for possible courses to be taught. The Director and/or the Philosophy Department Graduate Coordinator should be consulted for further information. EMPHASIS IN CRITICAL THEORY The School of Humanities offers an emphasis in Critical Theory that can be appended to the Philosophy track. A student interested in the emphasis begins by taking the three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop. With the recommendation of a workshop instructor or a Critical Theory faculty member in the Philosophy Department, the student may then apply to the Critical Theory Committee for admission to the emphasis. Emphasis students must complete the following requirements in addition to the usual Philosophy track requirements. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The Critical Theory Workshop. Students must successfully com\u00ad plete the three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop. This sequence is conceived as a reading group, normally conducted by a team of instructors, and developed with the input of all participants. Signif\u00ad icant texts are discussed and analyzed in class; no term papers are required. (Students receive 0 units and In-progress grades for the fall and winter quarters; passing students receive 4 units and a Sat\u00ad isfactory grade for the spring quarter. Advanced Critical Theory Requirement. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three Humanities 270 courses offered under the supervision of the Critical Theory Committee. At least three such courses will be offered each year. With the approval of the Philosophy Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the tools of research requirement. Mini-Seminar Requirement. Students must participate in two committee-sponsored mini-seminars (six--eight hours each) offered by visiting scholars on their ongoing research. Research Paper Requirement. Students must complete a research paper under the guidance of a three-member committee, selected in consultation with the Director; at least one member must be from outside of the Philosophy Department. This paper may (but need not) be part of the portfolio or dissertation. Upon completion of the emphasis requirements, a letter certifying that fact, signed by the Dean of Humanities apd the Director of the Critical Theory Emphasis, will be added to the student's dossier. EMPHASIS IN FEMINIST STUDIES A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information.

Its rich cultural traditions have enhanced world literature, theater, art, and dance. As the world's first social\u00ad ist state, it became a major political rival of the United States after the Second World War. In the past decade, Russians have aban\u00ad doned their socialist system and are now in the process of making a rocky transition to capitalism and a multi-party system. Although Russia lost sizeable amounts of territory in this transition, the Russian language now serves as the lingua franca throughout many areas formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. While the demand for specialists in various sectors of government has eased, relationships between our countries at other levels of society are growing more active and business opportunities are exciting and rewarding. Other areas in which the need for Russian language competence is evident right now include trade, environ\u00ad mental protection, social services, law, medicine, and technology. All students in Russian language courses are encouraged to take part in the UC Education Abroad Program and spend a portion of their junior or senior year studying in Russia. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue. The Russian Studies minor is a multidisciplinary curriculum com\u00ad bining the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Social \u00b7Ecology. It is designed to introduce students to the rich history and culture of Russia and provide them with the intellectual and linguistic tools necessary for sustained engagement with this area of the world. Requirements for the Minor Russian !A-B-C, 2A-B-C, 50 (three different topics); 16 units of upper-division courses selected from the following: Russian 140, 150, 199, appropriate Comparative Literature courses, History 124A, 124B, 190 (when topics are related to Russia), Political Sci\u00ad ence 154F (cross-listed with Anthropology 136D), and 159C. (A maximum of four units may be chosen from the following courses devoted in part to Russian themes: History 126A, 126B, 126C, 158A, Political Science 154G, and Social Ecology E113.) Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI.

Placement examinations will no longer be required for students who have successfully completed Spanish language classes in high school. Students will now be placed in Spanish language courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Spanish will be considered equal to one quarter of a UCI Spanish course. Thus, for example, students with two years of high school Spanish language will be placed in lC, while students who have completed three years in high school will be placed in 2A. Students in 2A will, however, be informed of their level of competency in Spanish by taking a diagnostic test the first day of class. Students who place in 2A but who have scored below what is expected for successful performance in 2A will be informed that they may either remain in 2A or choose to enroll in lC instead. Transfer students who have had a previous course (or courses) in Spanish from another college or university who want to enroll in any Spanish lA through 5 course at UCI must take a copy of their transcript to the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office in order to receive authorization to enroll in the appropriate course. Native or near-native speakers who place into Spanish 2C and whose home language is Spanish are encouraged to enroll in Span\u00ad ish 5, Spanish for Native Speakers, instead. To enroll in Spanish lOA, lOB, or beyond: An active prerequisite check system is in place for Spanish lOA and lOB. In order to enroll in Spanish lOA a student must have passed Spanish 2C or 5. The prerequisite for Spanish lOB is lOA. Students who have satisfied the required prerequisite at another college or university, or who graduated from a high school in a Spanish-speaking country, or who graduated from a Spanish Academy must take a copy of their transcript to the Humanities Spanish and Portuguese 285 Undergraduate Counseiing Office in order to receive authorization to enroll in the appropriate course. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, stu\u00ad dents attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and abil\u00ad ity to converse on everyday topics, as well as to read and write at an elementary level. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year two-quarter sequential course stresses composition and introduces literary analysis. Further, a course in phonetics aims to perfect pronuncia\u00ad tion and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. In addi\u00ad tion to giving students a sense of literary history, the introductory courses in literature, also to be taken in the third year, introduce stu\u00ad dents to elements of literary research and writing. The courses in Hispanic culture combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic, and require a final research project. Upper-division literature and film courses offer a more detailed analysis of specific texts and require a final research paper. Although a major in Portuguese is not offered, advanced literature courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. The faculty encourages Spanish majors or minors who are serious about improving their Spanish language ability in reading, writing, and speaking to take advantage of opportunities to immerse them\u00ad selves in the Spanish language by studying in Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, or other Spanish-speaking countries through the Education Abroad Program (EAP) or through the International Opportunities Program (lOP). Programs are available for the sum\u00ad mer, one quarter, one semester, or one year. While studying abroad, students can continue to make progress toward their UCI degree. See the Center for International Education section of the Cqtalogue or an academic counselor for additional information.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. For a listing of possible professions, please see http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanish on the World Wide Web. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and pro\u00ad fessional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, international relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Master's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information.

Graduate Program All graduate courses in the Department are taught in either Spanish or Portuguese, unless otherwise indicated in the course description. MASTER OF ARTS IN SPANISH The Master of Arts degree in Spanish is a two-year program of study designed to expose the beginning graduate student to all peri\u00ad ods of peninsular, Latin Ameriqm, and Chicano/Latino literature and culture. The degree is awarded upon the successful completion of course work and written and oral comprehensive examinations. A minimum of 11 courses (one course in Chicano/Latino litera\u00ad tures required) must be completed with a letter grade; at least eight of these must be graduate seminars. Required course work includes Spanish 239A, and one course in linguistics (Spanish 201 or 204 are recommended). Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of com\u00ad pleting 2C) in a foreign language other than Spanish is required; it is recommended that master's students take Portuguese as their for\u00ad eign language, although other languages are accepted. Students may choose a focus in literature, linguistics, or creative writing. Master's candidates must complete a minimum of three quarters of course work in the Department; the maximum time to complete the master's program is three years. Normally only students intending to work toward the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. MASTER OF ARTS IN TEACHING IN SPANISH This program is specifically designed to meet the needs of work\u00ad ing, credentialed Spanish teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modem and relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish. The program con\u00ad sists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in His\u00ad panic civilization; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be com\u00ad bined with a curricular research project or a thesis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPANISH The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree in Spanish with a specialization in Spanish, Spanish-American, or Chicano/Latino literatures and cultures. The program integrates period and genre studies with work in literary and critical theory, linguistics, sociohistorical studies, and cultural studies. The Department seeks to professionalize its Ph.D. candidates not as narrow specialists but rather as scholars and critics acquainted with a range of fields that relate to and enhance their discipline. Gradu\u00ad ate emphases in Comparative Literature, Critical Theory, and Fem\u00ad inist Studies are available; other areas of study (for example, film, history) may be designed with approval from the student's Ph.D. guidance committee. The Department has been traditionally com\u00ad mitted to excellence in teaching, both in its own practice and in the formation of its graduates. Language Requirements In addition to Spanish and English, all doctoral candidates should have the necessary command of Portuguese to successfully com\u00ad plete a graduate course in Portuguese. An additional foreign lan\u00ad guage (with proficiency equivalent to the 2C level) is also required; this requirement may be satisfied by examination or course work. The selection of a second foreign language must be approved by the student's guidance committee and is based on the specific research interests and field of study of the candidate. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Course Requirements A minimum of 24 courses beyond the B.A. or 13 beyond the M.A. are required: two courses in literary theory (Spanish 239A and 239B), two courses in linguistics (one diachronic and one syn\u00ad chronic), one graduate course in Luso-Brazilian literature, and Spanish 292. Note that these requirements may include course work completed in the master's program; the remaining elective courses are selected with the approval of the student's guidance committee to prepare for the doctoral examination and the disserta\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses. A student who transfers into the doctoral program from elsewhere must take a minimum of 13 graduate courses at UCI, of which nine must be in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese (of these, six must be regularly scheduled graduate seminars). With regard to students who enter the Ph.D. program with their master's degree from another institution, the Ph.D. guidance committee will deter\u00ad mine the number of courses. that will be accepted. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with an emphasis in Comparative Literature by taking a minimum of five courses in the Comparative Literature program. The Department offers an emphasis in Critical Theory designed to focus upon theoretical issues considered within the contextual real\u00ad ities of the Iberian Peninsula, Latin America, and U.S. Latino com\u00ad munities. Ph.D. students may earn a certificate in critical theory by taking four courses in theory, one of which should be taken outside the Department. To obtain all necessary application materials and for further information, contact the Emphasis Coordinator. Teaching The Department recognizes its responsibility to train all Ph.D. can\u00ad didates as teachers and requires that all doctoral students with no prior teaching experience complete a minimum of three quarters of language teaching (Spanish 399). Moreover, all doctoral students are required to complete a teaching practicum by co-teaching an upper~division course with a professor and enrolling in Spanish 292 for a letter grade. Comprehensive Examination The Ph.D. student advances to candidacy by passing by majority vote the qualifying examination. The qualifying examination con\u00ad sists \u00b7of: 1. An essay of 25-30 pages written on a topic related to the stu\u00ad dent's primary field of study.

The essay will be dis\u00ad cussed during the oral examination. It will be circulated to the full committee two months prior to the date of the written examination. The essay\u00b7 may be.substituted by a dissertation proposal that includes a substantial bibliography on the subject. 2. A four-hour written examination on the student's major field of \u00b7 study requiring a cultural perspective of the toialliterary pro\u00ad duction of a given period with emphasis on one genre, topic, or problem. The definition of the major field of study as well as the emphasis must be approved by the Ph.D. examination com\u00ad mit~ee and the graduate director. 3. A three-hour written examination in the minor field. 4. A two-hour oral examination that includes discussion of the writ\u00ad ten examinations and the essay or proposal. Spanish and Portuguese 287 Dissertation A dissertation topic is chosen by the candidate in consultation with the dissertation director and committee, and normally falls within the major field covered by the qualifying examinations. The candi\u00ad date presents a study plan to the dissertation committee, which approves the proposal and a preliminary research outline. The stu-\u00b7 dent submits drafts of chapters to the dissertation director who cor\u00ad rects and approves the drafts and circulates them to other comril.it\u00ad tee members for commentary.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Professor of History (recent American history, theory and history) The graduate program in Visual Studies, administered jointly by the faculties of the Department of Art History and the Department of Film and Media Studies, offers students the opportunity to pur\u00ad sue a doctorate in the cultural analysis of visual artifacts and expe\u00ad riences. Visual Studies synthesizes methodological insights from both component disciplines in order to examine the social practices of visual representation and visuality itself. The program leads to a Ph.D. degree in Visual Studies. While the program (in certain instances) grants an M.A. to students on route to their Ph.D., it admits only those students intending to complete their doctorate at UCI. ADMISSION The program is open to students applying with either a bachelor's or a master's degree, and applicants must meet. the general require\u00ad ments for admission to graduate study at UCI. A recent sample of academic writing-such as a representative undergraduate paper, or the master's thesis or a major research paper written at the master's level-should be submitted with the application packet. The deadline for application is January 15, and the program accepts applicants for admission during the fall quarter only. Addi\u00ad tional information is available from the Graduate Advisor for the Visual Studies program. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS All students are required to demonstrate a reading knowledge of at least one foreign language and are strongly encouraged to develop competence in a second. Students consult with the Graduate\u00b7 Advi\u00ad sor and/or their principal advisor(s) to determine the appropriate language to be tested, based on their interests and program of study. Advisors, moreover, may require the demonstration of read\u00ad ing knowledge in additional languages according to the scholarly demands of the student's specific field: All language requirements must be satisfied before students are advanced to\u00b7 candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. COURSE REQUIREMENTS Beyond the core series (Visual Studies 291, 292, 293A), students admitted with a B.A. are required to complete an additional 11 courses for a total of 14 courses. Out of this total, at least 10 courses (including the core series) must be within the program in Visual Studies (i.e., bearing Visual Studies, Art History, or Film Studies course numbers) and at least two courses are to be from outside the Visual Studies discipline. In order to establish a level of expertise in one convt;ntionally defined discipline, students entering with a B.A. must take (among their 10 courses noted above), at least three UC IRVINE - 2003-2004courses that have a strong component of art history or at least three courses that have a strong component of film studies. Courses bearing Art History or Film Studies numbers automatically satisfy this requirement for their respective fields. In addition, particular seminars offered as Visual Studies 295 may satisfy either the art history or film studies requirement; a list of qualifying seminars is available in the program office. Students admitted with an M.A. must complete an additional five courses beyond the core series, for a total of eight courses. While students may accrue units both for University Teaching (Art His\u00ad tory 399 or Film Studies 399) and Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298), these do not count toward the required number of courses. QUALIFYING EXAMINATION By the end of the second year for students entering with a B.A., or the end of the first year for those entering with an M.A., students must reach agreement with one of the program's professors to serve as prinCipal advisor. During the fall quarter of the following year-in most cases, the final quarter of standard course work-the student will work informally with the principal advisor to establish a five-person committee consisting of the principal advisor, addi\u00ad tional faculty members to bring the total of examiners up to four (at least three of these four must be members of the Visual Studies faculty), and a designated \"outside\" member who must be a mem\u00ad ber of the UCI faculty but cannot hold either a primary or joint appointment in Visual Studies, Art History, or Film Studies. Except in extraordinary circumstances (to be adjudicated by the program's Graduate Committee), students are required to include at least one member from Art History and one from Film Studies on their examination committee. The student and principal advisor define four areas to be examined by the faculty; no faculty member may supervise more than two of the four areas, and in no case may the \"outside\" member serve as a supervisor. The topics should combine historical breadth and some variety in media and special fields. Over the course of the follow\u00ad ing two quarters, students normally enroll in eight to twelve units per quarter of Reading for the Qualifying Examination (Visual Studies 298) during which time they prepare reading lists in close consultation with their principal advisor and area supervisors, and complete the reading of those lists. The examination takes place near the end of those two quarters of study, normatively at the end of the academic year. The first part of the examination consists of a written component, in which the student is called upon to respond to questions posed in three of the selected topics. The student's written responses are circulated to all committee members. An oral examination follows, normally within two weeks, and consists both of a set of questions posed orally about the remaining unexamined topic, and of ques\u00ad tions raised by the student's written responses to the initial three topics. Based on the student's written and oral performance, the committee will determine whether the student has successfully passed the examination; if so (and provided all language require\u00ad ments have been satisfied), the student is then advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D. degree. If the committee is not satisfied with the student's performance, it may also decide to reexamine the student on one or more topics after a specific interval. Except in extraordi\u00ad nary circumstances, no student will be given more than two chances to pass any given section of the examination. Visual Studies 291 DISSERTATION Within six months of advancement to candidacy, each student must submit a prospectus that defines the scope, approach, and rationale for a proposed dissertation. The student and the principal advisor consult to determine the composition of a doctoral committee of three members including the principal advisor, which then must unanimously approve the prospectus before the student proceeds with the dissertation. The doctoral committee, on the basis of the candidate's past academic performance and proposed dissertation topic, may require additional course work or other forms of prepa\u00ad ration for the dissertation. The doctoral committee, under the direc\u00ad tion of the principal advisor, supervises the student's research pro\u00ad gram and ultimately approves the dissertation. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. program is five to six years. Graduate Courses in Visual Studies Additional graduate courses satisfying the requirements of the Ph.D. program in Visual Studies are listed in the Department of Art History and the Department of Film and Media Studies sec\u00ad tions. Graduate students may also enroll concurrently in any upper\u00ad division lecture class with the approval of the instructor. 291 Theories of Vision and Visuality ( 4).

The Program's goal is to foster both critical and creative analysis of the various disci\u00ad plinary perspectives-historical, political, economic, representa\u00ad tional, technological, and scientific-that have (or have not) consti\u00ad tuted women, gender, and sexuality as objects of study. By emphasizing a rigorous interdisciplinary perspective in their teach\u00ad ing and research, the Women's Studies faculty seek to produce new knowledge about the social meanings of gender, race, class, and sexuality, and to equip students with a range of analytical and methodological skills. The field of women's studies has developed at a phenomenal rate from a handful of student-initiated courses in the early 1970s to more than 600 programs in colleges and universities across the United States offering degrees atthe B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels. UCI's Program in Women's Studies was founded in 1975 and has grown significantly since that time. The program offers a B.A.\u00b7 degree in Women's Studies, an undergraduate minor, and a gradu\u00ad ate emphasis in Feminist Studies. Women's Studies provides a unique intellectual community for undergraduate and graduate students, where faculty and students share a commitment to interactive teaching and learning. Students work closely with faculty and the program's academic coordinator to plan a coherent program of study and to anticipate work toward advanced degrees and a wide variety of career options. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Women's Studies prepares students for the expanding opportunities available in graduate programs and in numerous careers in both the public and private sectors. As more women work, business and corporations find the need for increased knowledge about women, and the growth of women's organizations and agen\u00ad cies-at the local, national, and global levels-is creating new opportunities for graduates with specializations in Women's Studies. Graduates bring unique skills and knowledge to the professions of UC IRVINE - 2003-2004law, medicine, social work, teaching, counseling, and to govern\u00ad ment service, all of which increasingly require expertise on issues concerning women and gender. A background in Women's Studies develops critical and analytical skills which prove valuable in the full range of life choices. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. In addition, the Women's Studies Office provides more specialized career counseling and information on graduate programs in Women's Studies and related fields.

GRADUATE EMPHASIS IN FEMINIST STUDIES The Program in Women's Studies offers an emphasis in Feminist Studies, which is available in conjunction with the Ph.D. programs in the Departments of Anthropology, East Asian Languages and Literatures, English and Comparative Literature, French and Ital\u00ad ian, German, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, Spanish and Portuguese: the program in Visual Studies; and the M.F.A. programs in Drama and Studio Art. Satisfactory completion of the emphasis is certified by the Director of Women's Studies and is noted in the student's dossier. Admission to the Program Applicants must first be admitted to, or currently enrolled in, one of the participating programs noted above. Applicants must submit to the Women's Studies Graduate Program Committee: (1) an application form listing prior undergraduate and graduate course work related to Feminist Studies, institutions attended, and majors(s); (2) a one-to two-page statement of purpose, including career objectives, areas of interest and research, record of research, teaching, community and/or creative work; and (3) a sample of written work related to Feminist Studies. Women's Studies 293 The Committee determines admissions, in consultation with the Women's Studies Core Faculty, based upon the extent to,which the applicant's research interests relate to Feminist Studies, the appli\u00ad cant's previous course work, and research or other experience related to Feminist or Women's Studies. Lack of prior course work does not preclude admission, so long as a compelling statement of research interests congruent with the graduate emphasis makes the case. Emphasis Requirements Minimum course work for the graduate emphasis in Feminist Stud\u00ad ies consists of four courses: two core courses, Women's Studies 200A-B, a coherent sequence normally taken in consecutive quar\u00ad ters; and any two courses selected from the list of courses in Femi\u00ad nist Studies approved by the Committee, as long as one of these is a graduate course in the student's own department or area of inter\u00ad est. In keeping with the interdisciplinary focus of this emphasis, it is highly recommended that the other be a course from a discipline outside that department or area. The course requirements for Ph.D. and M.F.A. candidates are the same. For doctoral students, the qualifying examination and dissertation topic should incorporate gender as a central category of analysis. One member of the candidate's qualifying examination committee and of the candidate's dissertation committee is normally a mem\u00ad ber of the Women's Studies and affiliate faculty. There are no requirements concerning qualifying examinations or theses for M.F.A. students. Courses in Women's Studies LOWER-DIVISION SOA Gender and Feminism in Everyday Life (4). What is gender?

This revolution is only a few decades old, but already futurists talk about the twenty-first century in terms of the \"infor\u00ad mation UCI's School of Information and Computer Science (SICS) is in the center of this revolution, with programs of instruc\u00ad tion and research in a variety of areas within computer and infor\u00ad mation technology. SICS faculty cover a broad spectrum of important topics in their research and teaching interests including: formal and mathematical methods for improving the performance and power of computa\u00ad tional systems; advanced processes for design and engineering of computer systems and communication networks; the software that makes the computer useful, with particular concern for the design and engineering of large software systems for critical applications; the fascinating area of intelligence, and the connections between natural and artificial intelligence; the economics, sociology, and application of the technology in modern organizations, and the use of interactive multimedia in computer systems that facilitate learn\u00ad ing. The faculty are concerned with more than just technology, however. The fundamental intellectual features of the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scien\u00ad tific fields. SICS is truly an interdisciplinary school, simultane\u00ad ously grounded in science and oriented toward application. The School of Information and Computer Science has two depart\u00ad ments, one of which has two separate divisions: The Department of Computer Science-Systems Division deals with physical and logical infrastructure of computing and commu\u00ad nication systems from computer and networking systems architec\u00ad ture through systems software and systems applications (including computer systems design, embedded computer systems, networked and distributed systems, Internet technology and ubiquitous net\u00ad working, and systems software). The Department of Computer Science-Computing Division encompasses the underlying theory and application of computing emphasizing a \"data-centric\" theme (including algorithms and data structures, graphics and visualization, artificial intelligence, bioin\u00ad formatics, information infrastructure, information access and man\u00ad agement, and Internet and ubiquitous computing). The Department of Informatics focuses on the development and evaluation of complex, inter-organizational software and informa\u00ad tion systems, emphasizing the people, the information, the soft\u00ad ware, and the information technology (including biomedical infor\u00ad matics, Internet and ubiquitous applications, software engineering, interactive and collaborative technology, human-computer interac\u00ad tion, computer-supported cooperative work, educational technol\u00ad ogy, and social aspects). Computer resources available for campuswide use include the Physical Sciences SGI Origin 2400, a Beowulf computing cluster, and facilities managed by the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) for the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI). Some NPACI systems are available to all campus researchers and graduate students; others require an appli\u00ad cation process. Commercial Internet service providers and campus dial-up lines provide support for home connections to many of these systems as well as systems within the School of Information and Computer Science. Windows and Macintosh systems are avail\u00ad able via laboratories open 24 hours a day. Additional information may be obtained by calling UCI Network & Academic Computing Services (NACS) at (949) 824-2222, e-mail: nacs@uci.edu, World Wide Web: http://www.nacs.uci.edu/. Information and Computer Science 297 Computer resources within the School of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science include a wide range of instructional and research machines. For instructional computing, these include numerous UNIX servers, 50 SPARC workstations, and more than 400 Pen\u00ad tium II/III PCs. For research computing, resources include more than 250 varying types of UNIX workstations, servers, and PCs. DEGREES Computer Science ...................................................................... B.S. Computer Science and Engineering* Science ...................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. * Offered jointly with The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Honors Honors at graduation, e.g., cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on criteria such as grade point average (including overall, ICS, mathematics); number of upper-division ICS courses completed beyond the mini\u00ad mum; courses taken outside ICS beyond required breadth; and research activities. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 51). CAREERS Graduates of the School of Information and Computer Science pur\u00ad sue a variety of careers. Many graduates specify, design, and develop a variety of computer-based systems comprised of software and hardware in virtually every application domain, such as aero\u00ad space, automotive, biomedical, consumer products, engineering, entertainment, environmental, finance, investment, Jaw, management, manufacturing, and pharmacology. Graduates also find jobs as members of research and development teams, developing advanced technologies, designing software and hardware systems, and speci\u00ad fying, designing, and maintaining computing infrastructures for a variety of institutions. Some work for established or start-up com\u00ad panies while others work as independent consultants. After a few years in industry, many move into management or advanced techni\u00ad cal positions. Some students also use the undergraduate major as preparation for graduate study in computer science or another field (e.g., medicine, Jaw, engineering, management). Undergraduate Program The School's undergraduate program prepares students for profes\u00ad sions and careers in industry and provides students with the tools for advanced education at the graduate level. Many graduates fol\u00ad low career paths immediately after graduation; others go on to advanced study in a variety of fields, including computer science, management, engineering, law, medicine, and so on. An ICS undergraduate education is a blend of scholarship, science, tech\u00ad nology, and practical application that forms an excellent foundation for professional life in the twenty-first century and prepares a stu\u00ad dent with serviceable skills useful for a lifetime. The basis of the undergraduate program is a set of fundamental courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by breadth requirements from other academic disciplines. A premium is placed on writing and quantitative skills. Students start early with hands-on experience with advanced computing systems, and intense use of computer and network technologies continues throughout the undergraduate program. Students study data organi\u00ad zation, algorithm design and analysis, design and organization of hardware and network systems, software engineering, artificial intelligence, social aspects of system design and use, and manage\u00ad ment of technology. In the process, students work with state-of\u00ad the-art hardware and software technologies, learn several contem\u00ad porary programming languages, and make extensive use of computer-based utilities such as electronic mail. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 298 UCI 2003-04 School of Information and Computer Science The School of Information and Computer Science offers three majors. The Information and Computer Science (ICS) major allows students considerable flexibility in focusing on various areas; the Computer Science (CS) major is more focused on areas related to the Computer Science Department within the School. The Com\u00ad puter Science and Engineering (CSE) major is a joint program with The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis, statistics, probability, or other applied mathematics areas. Students may also wish to consult the list of courses offered by the School of Engineering. Some Engineering courses can count toward intermediate-level and project course requirements for the ICS major. See the upper-division requirements for details. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer programming and the field of computer science will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Computer Science I (ICS 21) and continue in the programming sequence with Introduction to Computer Science II and Fundamental Data Struc\u00ad tures (ICS 22 and 23) as far as their interests require and their pro\u00ad grams permit. The SICS Student Affairs Office is staffed by professional acade\u00ad mic counselors and peer advisors. These individuals are available to assist students with program planning, questions on University and School policies and procedures, progress toward graduation, and other questions that arise in the course of a student's educa\u00ad tion. Faculty also are available for advising, generally for sugges\u00ad tions of additional course work in the student's area of specializa\u00ad tion and on preparation for graduate school. ADMISSIONS Freshmen In the event the School receives more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted to the majors. Transfer Student Policy Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the following requitements: 1. Completion of one year of college mathematics. Courses equiv\u00ad alent to Mathematics 6A-B-C (Discrete Mathematics) are pre\u00ad ferred as this facilitates scheduling after transfer to UCI. If these are not available, students should take first-year calculus. A semester of.pre-calculus and a semester of calculus may not be used to satisfy this requirement. 2. Completion of one year of computer science courses. The course work must contain one UC-transferable programming course involving concepts such as those found in C++, Java, Eiffel, or another object-oriented, high-level language. Pro\u00ad gramming-only courses in Basic, Fortran, Cobal, Pascal, and.C are not acceptable. It is strongly recommended that students select UC-transferab1e courses that do not focus strictly on learning a programming language but instead focus on topics such as object-oriented design, data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture, if such courses are available. Additional courses beyond the programming course required for admission must be taken to fulfill the lower-division degree requirement. Transfer students must enter UCl with knowledge of Java since it is used in the lower-division computer science requirement and serves as a foundation for upper-division pro\u00ad gramming-related courses. There is a limit on the number of applicants admitted to the major. NOTE: For both the ICS and CS majors, five lower-division courses are required and must be taken in a certain sequence. Stu\u00ad dents who transfer to UCI as juniors and must complete all or part of this sequence will therefore find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degree. To ensure admission consideration for the fall quarter, students should be sure to file their application by November 30 of the prior year. The selection criteria include grades, test scores, and other considerations. Note, however, that in cases where the number of incoming freshmen and advanced standing students who elect ICS or CS as a major exceeds the number of positions available, not all applicants will be accommodated. Change of Major Due to the high demand for admission to the School of Information and Computer Science, not all eligible continuing UCI stUdents who wish to change their major can be accepted into the ICS or CS majors. Interested students should contact the ICS Student Affairs Office for information about change of major requirements, proce\u00ad dures, and policies. NafE: Students who wish to graduate with the B.S. degree in ICS or CS must declare the major, be formally accepted by the faculty of the School to pursue the degree, and successfully complete the requirements for the major, as specified below. Students may not double major in ICS and CS. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE University Requirements: See pages 54--59.

Information and Computer Science 299 Honors Program in Information and Computer Science The honors program in ICS provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in ICS to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas in the School. Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the School in the spring. Appli\u00ad cations are available each year beginning May 1 and should be submitted by June 1 to ensure consideration. For an application to be considered, the following conditions must be met (although exceptions may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances): 1. The student must have completed the required lower-division ICS courses and Mathematics 6A-B-C by the end of the spring quarter in which the application is made. 2. The student must have the following grade point averages: a. an overall grade point average of at least 3.2; b. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in the required lower\u00ad division ICS courses; c. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in Mathematics 6A-B-C. . 3. Application must be made in the spring of the student's sopho\u00ad more year. Certain exceptions are available, for example, for transfer students whose completion of the lower-division courses is delayed and for Campuswide Honors students. In selecting students for the honors program, the School also con\u00ad siders evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admit\u00ad ted to the program participate in the ICS Honors Seminar (ICS H197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the School, foilowed by a minimum of two quarters of independent supervised research (ICS Hl98). Passing these two 198s counts for one of the project courses required for the major, provided that one other project course is taken in a different area. In order for the student to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be written up as a final report and certified to be of honors quality by the student's advisor and by the program advisor. THE 3-2 PROGRAM WITH THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for additional information.

EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. Additional information is avail\u00ad able in the Center for International Education section. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 300 UCI 2003-04 School of Information and Computer Science Undergraduate Major in Computer Science and Engineering The goal of the undergraduate major in Computer Science and Engineering is to provide students with an integrated background in both computer science and computer engineering. The program is designed to provide students with the fundamentals of hardware and software computer science and the application of engineering concepts, techniques, and methods to both computer systems engi\u00ad neering and software engineering. The program is administered jointly by the School of Information and Computer Science and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. ADMISSIONS High School Students: Students must have completed four years of mathematics and are advised to have completed one year each of chemistry and physics. One semester of programming course work is also advised. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is fundamental to success in the program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to the major during periods of restricted enrollments. Special atten\u00ad tion will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT I and three SAT II examination scores by mid-January, 2004. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Computer Science and Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. Transfer Students. Preference will be given to junior-level appli\u00ad cants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of engineering physics (with laboratory), one year of Java programming, and one additional approved course for the major. Students are encouraged to complete as many of the lower-division degree requirements as possible prior to transfer. Students who enroll at UCI in need of completing lower-division course work may find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees. For further information, contact the SICS Student Affairs Office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING University Requirements: See pages 54-59.

Sample Program of Study -Computer Science and Engineering FALL WINTER SPRING Freshman Mathematics 2A Mathematics 2B Mathematics 2D Physics 7 ECE104 CSE141 CSE142 CSE135B Breadth Breadth Breadth Track Track Graduate Program The School offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Information and Computer Science. Enrollments in the M.S. program are being lim\u00ad ited to those students with an undergraduate degree in computer sci\u00ad ence or a closely related field. Both M.S. and Ph.D. students may complete one of the following concentrations: Algorithms and Data Structures (Theory); Artificial Intelligence (AI); Computer Systems and Networks (CSN); Com\u00ad puter Systems Design (CSD); Informatics in Biology and Medicine (IBaM); Information Access and Management (lAM); Interactive and Collaborative Technology (ICT); Software (SW); Visual Com\u00ad (VC). concentrations are available to M.S. students\u00ad Embedded Systems; Knowledge Discovery in Data; and Arts, Computation, and Engineering (ACE). In addition, the Department also offers a general M.S. degree that does not identify with any specific concentration. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004ADMISSION Applicants will be evaluated on the basis of their prior academic record. Applicants for the M.S. degree are expected to have a bach\u00ad elor's degree in computer science or a related field. Those who do not have an undergraduate degree in computer science may take the Computer Science Advanced GRE test and must score in the top 80 percent to demonstrate sufficient background in the field. Ph.D. applicants will be evaluated in their potential for creative research and teaching in Information and Computer Science. Applicants are expected to have (1) skills in computer programming at least equivalent to those obtained in college-level courses in pro\u00ad gramming and language development; (2) skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained in complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra and modem algebra, or probability and statistics; (3) data structures, analysis of algorithms, automata theory, or formal languages; and (4) computer architectures. All applicants are evaluated on the materials submitted: letters of recommendation, official GRE test scores, official college tran\u00ad scripts, and personal statement. For more information, contact the ICS graduate counselor at (949) 824-5156 or send e-mail to gcounsel @ics.uci.edu. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to Ph.D. students in the form of scholarships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. Although assistance varies, it is the Department's goal to support all entering Ph.D. students, subject to availability of funds. Interna\u00ad tional students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominent language, as approved by Graduate Council, and who apply for teaching assistantships must take the Test of Spoken English (TSE) or the Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) examination and earn a minimum score of 50 to be considered for an award. Financial assistance may be available through teaching assistant\u00ad ships and corporate internships for ICS M.S. students. Students with a\u00b7 Previously Earned Master's Degree Credit for one or all required courses may be given at the time of admission to those students who have completed a master's degree in computer science or a closely related field. Course equivalency will be determined by the ICS Vice Chair of Graduate Studies fol\u00ad lowing a written recommendation from a sponsoring research advi\u00ad sor. Research advisors can require that a student take additional courses when this is appropriate. An additional M.S. degree willl}ot be awarded if the student cur\u00ad rently holds an M.S. degree in computer science or a related field from another university. Course Substitutions A student who has taken relevant graduate courses at UCI or another university may petition to have a specific course certified as equivalent to one which satisfies ICS requirements. The petition should describe the course and can be approved either by a com\u00ad mittee composed of the student's faculty advisor, the ICS Vice Chair for Graduate Studies, and a faculty member who is in the concentration area in which the course is taught, or by the ICS Grad\u00ad uate Policy Committee. Only two courses can be substituted. MASTER OF SCIENCE PROGRAM Course requirements for the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees are identi\u00ad cal and are determined by the concentration research track. Detailed course requirements are listed in the following pages under each concentration area. M.S. concentrations are available in the same areas as the Ph.D. concentrations. Information and Computer Science 301 In addition, M.S. students may. select a general degree, a concen-. tration in Embedded Systems, a concentration in Knowledge Dis\u00ad covery in Data, or a concentration in Arts, Computation, and Engi\u00ad neering. Students may select one of two options: thesis plan or comprehensive examination plan. The normative time for comple\u00ad tion of the M.S. program is two years. All study must be com\u00ad pleted within four calendar years from the date of admission. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The thesis option is available for graduate students who may wish to continue on to a Ph.D. program or those who wish to concentrate on a specific problem. To qualify for this optiori, the student must be in good academic standing with the Department. The student must enroll in at least two quarters of Thesis Supervision (ICS 298) that will substitute for two required courses as specified under the concentration area or specialization of choice. All required courses must be completed with a grade of B or better, and the student must write a research or thesis project. A committee of three faculty members (voting members of the Academic Senate) will guide the student and give final approval of the thesis. The committee will consist of an advisor (ICS faculty member) who is willing to supervise the thesis project, and two other faculty members (one of which must be from ICS) who are willing to serve on the committee as readers of the thesis. An oral presentation of the thesis to the committee will be required. Semi\u00ad nar courses such as 229, 239, 259, 269, and 279 cannot be applied to the required \"other graduate courses\" units. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes the required units as specified under the concentration area. Each course must be completed with a grade of B or better. Semi\u00ad nar courses such as 229, 239, 249, 259, 269, and 279 cannot be applied to the required \"other graduate courses\" units. The student must take a written comprehensive examination given by ICS fac\u00ad ulty. The examination covers the core requirements and is given twice a year (fall and spring quarters). ICS GENERAL M.S. DEGREE PROGRAM The ICS general M.S. degree program is designed for students who do not wish to specialize in any specific area. Students can explore many of the advanced fields in computer science. These areas include: embedded systems, networking, databases, computational geometry, neural networks, data mining, machine learning, graph algorithms, VLSI, parallel architectures, user interfaces, bioinfor\u00ad matics, graphics and visualization, security and cryptography, HCII CSCW, software engineering, data structures, and ubiquitous computing.

M.S. CONCENTRATION IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS The goal of the M.S. concentration in Embedded Systems is to pre\u00ad pare ICS students for the challenges in exploiting technologies that are driving computing-based systems into new and emerging appli\u00ad cation domains. The ever-increasing integration of communica\u00ad tions, multimedia, computing and relentless digitization of data continues to expand the scope and the complexity of embedded systems. To appreciate these advances, and to productively con\u00ad tribute to future advances of these systems, a critical appreciation of the underlying scientific principles is a must. The goal of this program is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the hard\u00ad ware and software technologies used in embedded systems. Stu\u00ad dents will develop an understanding of the technology capabilities and limitations and the methods to evaluate design trade-offs between different technology choices.

M.S. CONCENTRATION iN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATA The goal of the M:s. concentration in Knowledge Discovery and Data is to educate students in both the fundamental principles of computational methods for modeling data, as well as to provide. a broad foundation in emerging methods for knowledge discovery and data mining. Technological advances in digital data collection, memory capacity, and computational \u00b7power, have revolutionized our view of data analysis in the past 10 years. The volumes of data being collected in science, business, medicine, and government are truly vast in nature. Across all of these areas, t!Jere is a rapidly increasing demand for better theories and tools to provide users with improved understanding of their data and to leverage their data for decision support. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is an emerging disci\u00ad pline within computer science, focused on the principles of how patterns and structure can be inferred from large data sets. It is an area of significant academic interest and research opportunity. For example, a Special Interest Group in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (SIGKDD) was recently started by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to promote both research and pro\u00ad fessional activities in this area; a new journal called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery was started in 1997; and the field spon\u00ad sors an annual international conference with over 500 attendees. In addition, the National Science Foundation has recently begun a large interdisciplinary research program in Knowledge and Distrib\u00ad uted Intelligence (KDI), based in part on recent research and inter\u00ad est in KDD. Industry participation is also very active with broad demand for graduates in this area, across a wide variety of compa\u00ad nies engaged in leveraging scientific and business data for strategic purposes. Required Courses The following courses must be completed with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter: Principles of Data Management (ICS 214A), Machine Learn\u00ad ing (ICS 273), Probabilistic Learning (ICS 274), Data Mining (ICS 278), Descriptive Multivariate Statistics I (ICS 238A) and, any two courses from the Artificial Intelligence Core Course List and any two courses from the Statistics Core Course List.

CONCENTRATION IN ARTS, COMPUTATION, AND ENGINEERING {ACE) As digital technologies infiltrate increasingly diverse aspects of cultural practice, and human culture at large is influenced by the presence of digital technologies, there is a profound need for a new type of professional in the entertainment industry, in education, and in the arts, who can help to construct, manage, and monitor these changes. Such a professional must be technically skilled, artistically skilled, and theoretically skilled, all at an equally high and rigorous level. The goal of the M.S. concentration in Arts, Computation, and Engineering is to provide students with a broad\u00ad based and interdisciplinary training at the intersection of digital technology and cultural and artistic practices. The ACE program is coordinated across the School of Information and Computer Science, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, and places equal emphasis on technical, artistic, and critical proficiency. Strongly practical in composition, it provides students with the opportunity to explore in detail topics such as telematic performance, immersive and augmented environ\u00ad ments, embodied interaction, and the cultural impact of new technologies. Graduation is by publicly presented thesis project and written the\u00ad sis, in addition to completion of course work. Required Courses The ACE concentrations in all three fields consist of a two-year curriculum. The following courses are required: ACE Core: five ACE interdisciplinary theory seminars (Studio Art/Engineering 270), four ACE studio/labs (Studio Art/Engineer\u00ad ing 271-277), two ACE project internships (Studio Art/Engineer\u00ad ing 279), and one quarter of ACE thesis research (Studio Art/Engi\u00ad neering 278). (NOTE: A total of 48 units of Core courses must be completed. Any of the ACE core categories may be reduced by one and replaced with a different ACE core course or an elective, in consul\u00ad tation with the student's advisor.) Electives: a minimum of four ICS electives including one from each of the following three categories, passed with a grade of B or better: Theory: Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (ICS 260), Data Structures (ICS 261), Analysis of Algorithms (ICS 263); Architecture/CAD/Hardware: Embedded Computing Systems (ICS 212), Computer Systems Architectures (ICS 241A), Computer Net\u00ad works (ICS 243A), Introduction to Computer Design (ICS 252); Information and Computer Science 303 Software Systems: Human-Computer Interaction (ICS 205), Advanced Compiler Construction (ICS 211), Data Management (ICS 214A), Software Engineering (ICS 221), Distributed Com\u00ad puter Systems (ICS 242). Two additional breadth electives: that may be chosen by students in consultation with an advisor, and/or may be assigned by the ACE program committee in consultation with the student. These courses will compensate for lacunae in the student's background and may include upper-division undergraduate courses when appropriate and approved in advance by the candidate's advisor. A program faculty member from-the School of ICS will advise on elective selection and may be on the thesis committee. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY PROGRAM The Ph.D. program leads to a concentration in one of nine areas: Algorithms and Data Structure (Theory), Artificial Intelligence (AI); Computer Systems and Networks (CSN); Computer Systems Design (CSD); Informatics in Biology and Medicine (IBaM); Information Access and Management (lAM); Interactive and Col\u00ad laborative Technology (ICT); Software (SW); Visual Computing (VC). The program is research oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer sci\u00ad ence. The program is designed for full-time study and can be com\u00ad pleted in five to six years, depending upon the focus of research. Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program must maintain satisfactory academic progress. Course Requirements Course requirements for each concentration area are listed on the following pages. In addition, every student must complete the fol\u00ad lowing core course requirements with a grade of B or better. Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); one course in Theory selected from: Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algo\u00ad rithms (ICS 260), Data Structure (ICS 261), or Analysis of Algo\u00ad rithms (ICS 263); one course in Architecture/CAD/ Hardware selected from: Embedded Systems Concepts (ICS 212), Computer Systems Architectures and Languages (ICS 241A), Computer Net\u00ad works (ICS 243A), or Introduction to Computer Design (ICS 252); and one course in Software and Systems selected from: Human\u00ad Computer Interaction (ICS 205), Compiler Construction (ICS 211), Principles of Data Management (ICS 214A), Software Engineering (ICS 221), or Distributed Computer Systems (ICS 242).

The comprehensive examination and all course requirements must be satisfied prior to the student's application for advancement to candidacy. Informa\u00ad tion on the selection of committees, advancement to candidacy, development of a doctoral dissertation, and final examination on the dissertation is available from the ICS Vice Chair for Graduate Studies and the ICS Graduate Student Affairs Office. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 304 UCI 2003-04 School of Information and Computer Science CONCENTRATION IN ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES (THEORY) The goal of research in theoretical computer science is to produce results, supported by rigorous proof, about problems dealing with computers and their applications. The questions to be investigated are often motivated by practical problems, but the goal of under\u00ad standing the underlying combinatorial properties of the problem is often as important as producing a solution of immediate applicabil\u00ad ity. The actual problems to be solved are often very complicated, so researchers seek some abstraction that can be rigorously studied. In particular, they often seek to investigate the fundamental combi\u00ad natorial structure of a problem abstracted away from the original physical setting. For example, the problem of placing a set of files onto as few floppy disks as possible without exceeding their stor\u00ad age capacity is fundamentally the same as the problem of loading a set of items onto as few trucks as possible without exceeding their weight limit. Mimy problems, from a variety of application areas, fall into the category of efficient algorithm design. A key property of work in this area is its emphasis on the amount of resources required by a given algorithm; this is called the com\u00ad plexity of the algorithm. The resource most commonly considered is time, but other resources often considered are the amount of memory required and, in the case of parallel computation, the num\u00ad ber of processors required. For many problems, an efficient solu\u00ad tion has been obtained only after deep insights into the nature of the problem. For many problems, the efficiency of the best solution possible remains unknown. Research in algorithms and data structures grapples with such questions. It is a young science with an inherently interdisciplinary flavor. Problems to be investigated have come from a variety of sources, such as computer vision, scheduling, resource allocation, scientific computing, image processing, genetics, transportation, and artificial intelligence. Solution methods are brought to bear from areas such as discrete applied mathematics, probability the\u00ad ory, and a rich body of insights developed within theoretical com\u00ad puter science. The goal of the research, as in mathematics, is to produce results supported by rigorous proof; the emphasis on com\u00ad plexity gives this area its unique flavor. Results that first might appear to be only of theoretical value are sometimes of profound relevance to practical problems. Required Courses The following courses must be completed with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); Data Structures (ICS 261); Computational Complexity (ICS 262); Analysis of Algo\u00ad two courses from: Computer Security Algo\u00ad rithms (ICS 247), Topics in Online Algorithms (ICS 264), Graph Algorithms (ICS 265), Computational Geometry (ICS 266), Spe\u00ad cial Topics in ICS (ICS 280) taught by Theory faculty; at least three quarters of Seminar in Theory (ICS 269); and five graduate courses outside of Theory, at least three of which must be within ICS (for M.S. students pursuing the thesis option, two of the five courses must be substituted with two four-unit courses in Thesis Supervision, ICS 298); if the student has an optional minor, at least two of these courses must be outside the minor. Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write a survey paper and a research paper of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is aimed at understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie intelligent behavior, and at designing computational systems that exhibit it. The AI group at ICS is involved in research on machine learning and knowledge discovery; deductive and probabilistic reasoning; constraint satis\u00ad faction techniques; and cognitive architectures; sophisticated image and signal processing; scientific reasoning in domains such as molecular biology, medicine, and space science; intelligent Web-based agents; and the psychological investigation of human learners. The group is interested in basic research into the fundamental principles of intelligence; the methods by which knowledge is acquired, summarized, organized, and utilized to solve complex problems; the construction of computational arti\u00ad facts that support algorithmically, cognitively, or conceptually chal\u00ad lenging tasks and embody behavior associated with intelligent sys\u00ad tems; and applications that confront intelligent systems with real-world tasks. Within the general field of AI, ICS faculty spe\u00ad cialize in machine learning, knowledge discovery and data mining, automated reasoning, constraint-based and probabilistic-based rea\u00ad soning, and brain modeling. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); two courses in Special Top\u00ad ics in Information and Computer Science (ICS 280), one taught by AI area faculty; Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (ICS 270A); three courses selected from: Machine Learning (ICS 273), Proba\u00ad bilistic Learning (ICS 274), Reasoning/Belief Networks (ICS 276A), or Representa\u00ad tions and Algorithms for Molecular Biology (ICS 277 A); two additional courses from: Information Retrieval, Filtering, and Clas\u00ad sification (ICS 207), Advanced Artificial Intelligence Programming (ICS 270B), Network-based Reasoning/Constraint Networks (ICS 275A), Seminar in Models of the Brain (ICS 276B), Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience (ICS 276C), Probabilistic Modeling of Biological Data (ICS 277B), Data Mining (ICS 278), or Logic for Artificial Intelligence (Logic and Philosophy of Science 209); and five graduate courses outside of Artificial Intelligence, at least three of which must be within the ICS Department (for M.S. stu\u00ad dents pursuing the thesis option, two of the five courses must be substituted with two four-unit courses in Thesis Supervision, ICS 298). Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (CSN) This area of research and study is concerned primarily with the development of systems software, that is, the software infrastruc\u00ad ture that makes the development and use of applications possible. This includes compilers, operating systems, networking software, performance tools, and software development environments, which are studied from both theoretical and practical points of view. The CSN research group is particularly interested in systems soft\u00ad ware in the context of parallel or decentralized systems, that is, systems having multiple CPUs, including computer networks and both shared-and distributed-memory multiprocessor architectures, which offer great new opportunities in distributed computing and communication as well as performance-oriented scientific comput\u00ad ing, but also pose major technological challenges to researchers and developers of parallel/distributed computer systems. The spe\u00ad cific topics studied by the faculty members of this concentration area include: design and study of paralleling compilers; design and analysis of high-speed multimedia networks; object-oriented frameworks for distributed systems; approaches to portable and mobile programs; development of coordination paradigms for dis\u00ad tributed applications; support for distributed simulations; design and study of extensible and run-time adaptable operating systems and software environments; system support for high-performance scientific computing; and distributed algorithms.

Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN (CSD) New application areas are placing increasingly challenging demands on existing computer systems. At the same time, advanced tech\u00ad nologies are being developed that make the design and manufactur\u00ad ing of computer systems faster and cheaper. The current trend in computerization is toward application-targeted systems that solve specific problems well. The development of such systems requires an understanding of the complex interactions between applications, software, and hardware. The Computer Systems Design area addresses the various aspects of bridging the gap between the demands of new applications and available technology. It is designed to produce computer scientists with an increased awareness of the demands imposed on computers by the application domains which have traditionally been viewed as extrinsic to computer science. This application sensitivity will give students a unique advantage in the increasingly important area of integrated software/hardware computer and information systems and will prepare them to meet the challenges of real-world problems. Within the general area of computer systems, ICS faculty special\u00ad ize in hardware/software codesign for embedded systems; CAD VLSI, optimizing compilers; and system-specification and performance-analysis techniques. Information and Computer Science 305 Required Courses The following courses must be completed with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); at least three quarters of Seminar in Design Science (ICS 249 or 259); Computer Sys\u00ad tems Architecture and Languages (ICS 241A); five graduate courses outside of Computer Systems Design but within ICS, no more than three of which may be in one area (for M.S. students pursuing the thesis option, two of the five courses must be substi\u00ad tuted with two four-unit courses in Thesis Supervision, ICS 298); and four core courses selected from the following: Introduction to Embedded Computing Systems (ICS 212), Software. for Embedded Systems (ICS 213), Fault-Tolerant Computing (ICS 250), Digital System Verification and Testing (ICS 251), Introduction to Com\u00ad puter Design (ICS 252), Design Description and Modeling (ICS 253), VLSI System Design (ICS 254 or Engineering ECE251), Physical Design Automation (ICS 255 or Engineering ECE2~8), Design Synthesis (ICS 256), System Tools (ICS 257), Combmator\u00ad ial Algorithms for Design Synthesis (ICS 258). Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN INTERACTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE TECHNOLOGY (ICT) UCI enjoys an international reputation for its research on the human and social dimensions of computer system design and use. There are two principal strands to this work. The first concerns the interaction between people and computers, including novel forms of interactive experience beyond traditional desktop computing. The second concerns the role that computer systems can play in collaborative work between individuals, groups, and organizations. Examples of topics that ICT researchers investigate include: adop\u00ad tion and systems; universal interactive sys\u00ad tems; design principles for information visualization; and new patterns of computer-mediated work such as virtual teams. The approach used places equal emphasis on three areas of investi\u00ad gation---empirical, theoretical, and technical. The empirical work involves studying technology in use, using both laboratory tech\u00ad niques and fieldwork investigations oheal-world settings. The the\u00ad oretical research employs and develops analytic understanding of the relationships among technology, people, organizations, and social settings. Finally, in the technical work, ICT researchers develop new models and technologies for interaction with and col\u00ad laboration through technology. Students in the ICT program gain a thorough grounding in all three areas. The cornerstone of this approach is to study real use of technology, as it occurs in real-world settings. ICT researchers believe that the success or failure of technology depends on how people can fit that technology into real practice, balancing technical, cognitive, social, and cultural dimensions. Using an interdisciplinary approach, ICT research aims at a deeper understanding of interaction with and collaboration through technology, and at exploiting these insights for the design of better systems. Required Courses The following courses must be completed with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 200); f{uman-Computer Interaction (ICS 205); Social Analysis of Computing (ICS 230); at least three quarters of Seminar in Research on Social Analysis and Information Systems (ICS 239); two courses chosen from: Com\u00ad puterization, Work, and Organizations (ICS 234A), Theories .of . Computerization and Information Systems (ICS 234B), Quahtattve Research Methods in Information Systems (ICS 235A) or Social Ecology 217 or Management 290, Quantitative Research Methods in Information Systems (ICS 235B) or Descriptive Multivariate Statistics I and II (ICS 238A and 238B) or Social Science 201A-B; UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 306 UCI 2003-04 School of Information and Computer Science two courses chosen from: Knowledge-Based User Interfaces (ICS 206), Advanced User Interface Architectures (ICS 227), Computer\u00ad Supported Cooperative Work (ICS 233), or Special Topics (ICS 280); and five or six graduate courses outside of ICT, only one of which may be ICS 280 (for M.S. students pursuing the thesis option, two of the five or six courses must be substituted with two four-unit courses in Thesis Supervision, ICS 298). The five or six courses are chosen as follows. A student who does not elect to take an optional minor outside of ICS must take five graduate courses within ICS in at least two areas other than CORPS. A student who elects to take a minor outside of ICS must take three graduate courses within ICS in at least two areas other than CORPS, in addition to three graduate courses outside of ICS. The minor outside of ICS consists of three graduate courses which form a coherent area of study. Paper Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Each student must write a survey paper and a research paper of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN INFORMATICS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE (IBaM) Biology and medicine have become. data-intensive information sci\u00ad ences. Massive data acquisition technologies, such as sequencing, high-throughput drug screening, and DNA arrays, gen\u00ad erate information in quantities that overwhelm conven\u00ad tional approaches. Cost-effective health care and quality medical decision-making require integrating large amounts of up-to-date information and knowledge. Biological systems have also inspired computer science advances with new concepts, including genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, computer viruses and syn\u00ad thetic immune systems, DNA computing, artificial life, and hybrid VLSI-DNA gene chips. New computational opportunities such as these create a critical need for theoretical and algorithmic advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, analyzing, and visu\u00ad alizing biomedical information. Informatics in Biology and Medieine is an interdisciplinary con\u00ad centration.at the interface between computer sciences, biological sciences, and medicine. It addresses problems that are specific to the information technologies in biology, medicine, and health care. Research topics include gene finding, protein structure and func\u00ad tion prediction, structural and functional genomics, proteomics, electronic patient record systems, medical decision support sys\u00ad tems, guideline-based health care, medical information access, and human-computer interfaces for medical applications. To make advances in these areas, society needs people with knowledge and skills that bridge those taught in conventional biological, medical, and computer science curricula.

Torres, Ph.D. Claremont Graduate School, Associate Professor of Education, Social Ecology, and Political Science James Diego Vigil, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor of Social Ecology Chicano!Latino Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to examine the historical and contemporary experiences of Americans of Latin American origin. This diverse population includes people who trace their heritage to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and many other Latin American and Caribbean nations. The curriculum seeks to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the language, history, culture, liter\u00ad ature, sociology, anthropology, politics, social ecology, health, medicine, and creative (art, dance, drama, film, music) accomplish\u00ad ments in Chicano/Latino communities. The Program offers a B.A. degree in Chicano!Latino Studies and a minor. Center for Research on Latinos in a Global Society Interdisciplinary research in Chicano/Latino Studies is conducted under the auspices of the Center for Research on Latinos in a Global Society (CRLGS). Its multifold goals are: (1) to examine the emerging role of Latinos as actors in global economic, politi\u00ad cal, and cultural events; (2) to promote Latino scholarship; (3) to enhance the quality of research in Latino studies; ( 4) to provide a forum for intellectual exchange and the dissemination of research finding; and (5) to promote the participation of undergraduate and graduate students in research on Latino issues. The use of the term \"global society\" underscores the faculty's perception that, as a society, the United States is becoming \"globalized,\" meaning that it is increasingly- affected by worldwide economic, political, demo\u00ad graphic, and cultural forces and that Latinos are at the center of this. Latinos in the United States, individually and as a sociopoliti\u00ad cal group, play important roles in the multiple processes-immi\u00ad gration, trade, international capital flow, and international political movements-which are changing the traditional demarcation between domestic and foreign, and national and international poli\u00ad tics, economics, and society. Scholarship Opportunities The Jeff Garcilazo Fellowship/Scholarship Fund, in honor and memory of the late Chicano!Latino Studies and History professor, was established to provide opportunities for students to examine the historical and contemporary experiences of Americans of Latin American origin. Funds are awarded to current UCI students. The Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), formerly the National His\u00ad panic Scholarship Fund, awards scholarships annually to students enrolled in and attending an accredited college full-time from the fall through the spring (or summer) terms. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Many career opportunities exist for students who graduate with a B.A. degree in Chicano/Latino Studies, such as service with national and international organizations which seek knowledge of American multicultural society in general, and of Chicano!Latino peoples and cultures in particular; positions as area specialists with state and federal government agencies; careers in the private sector with corporations or private organizations which have a significant portion of their activities in the U:S. and Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, and other Latin American coun\u00ad tries; and positions of service and leadership within Chicano/ Latino communities such as education, human services, law, health fields, journalism, and public policy. Students may also continue their education and pursue professional or graduate degrees. Employers and admission officers understand that many of their employees and graduates will one day work in communities with significant Chicano/ Latino populations, and for this reason they give due consideration to applicants who have in-depth knowledge of Chicano/Latino culture. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. Requirements for the Major A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statisti\u00ad cal tools underlying modern social sciences.

Spanish 2A or its equivalent; students are encouraged to con\u00ad tinue their Spanish language education through Spanish 2C. E. One comparative ethnic studies course selected from either African-American Studies or Asian American Studies. (An interdepartmental list of approved courses is available from the School of Social Sciences Counseling Office.) F. Four upper-division electives, one from each of the following areas: Literature, Arts, Media, Culture (Chicano/Latino Studies 110-129); History (Chicano/Latino Studies 130-139); Society, Labor, Politics, Law, Gender, Race, Ethnicity (Chicano/Latino Studies 140-159); Globalization, Transnationalism, Immigration, U.S.-Mexico Border (Chicano/Latino Studies 160-169). G. Three additional elective courses, two of which must be upper\u00ad division, selected from Chicano/Latino Studies courses. Elec\u00ad tives may include Field Research/Independent Studies courses (Chicano/Latino Studies 190-199). Students may request, by petition to the Chicano/Latino Studies Program Committee, to have Special Topics courses count as electives. Residence Requirement for the Major: A minimum of five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Courses taken through the UC Education Abroad Program will be counted toward satisfaction of the resi\u00ad dence requirement by student petition and upon prior approval of course content by the Chicano/Latino Studies Program Committee. Optional Senior Research Project Students are encouraged to pursue field research and write a sub\u00ad stantial research paper on topics of their choice under the guidance of Chicano/Latino faculty members. Often, this project will grow out of issues examined in the Chicano/Latino Research Seminar (lOOC). Research projects typically involve a combination of library research and fieldwork in one of the local Chicano/Latino communities. Methods and analytical frameworks vary depending on the student and faculty advisors. Interested students should enroll in Chicano/Latino Studies 196 (Field/Research Senior Pro\u00ad ject), which may be taken for credit three times. Honors Program in Chicano/Latino Studies The Honors Program in Chicano/Latino Studies is designed to allow undergraduates to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Chicano/ Latino Studies faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research and field research. The \u00b7 program is open to all senior Chicano/Latino Studies majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Chicano/ Latino Studies courses (at least five courses). Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Although course work for the Honors Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve Chicano/Latino Studies 317 as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually accept\u00ad able abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their pro\u00ad ject. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, students should enroll in Chicano/Latino Studies 196. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Chi\u00ad cano/Latina Studies H190A and write a proposal describing their research question, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project may begin during this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue their research by enrolling in Chicano/Latino Studies H190B. In the spring quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Chicano/ Latino Studies H190C and complete a senior honors thesis that is typically 40 to 80 pages long. Honors theses aie read and evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member chosen by the Director of the Chicano/Latino Studies Program in consultation with the advisor. Requirements for the Minor Completion of four core courses: Chicano/Latino Studies 61, 62, 63, lOOC; four upper-division courses selected from Chicano/ Latino Studies 100-169, 190-199; and Spanish 2A or its equivalent. Residence Requirements for the Minor: Other than the language requirement, no more than two courses taken at other academic institutions may be used toward satisfaction of minor. While students will be responsible for designing their minor according to the above requirements, the curriculum should be planned in consultation with Chicano/Latino Studies Program (CLSP) faculty. Curricula must receive approval from one faculty member in CLSP as well as the Director or designated representa\u00ad tive. Students must also file intent to pursue the minor with the CLSP office. In addition to satisfying the requirements for the major or minor, students are encouraged to take advantage of the variety of unique educational opportunities available at UCI. Through the Education Abroad Program (EAP), students receive academic credit while studying at universities in Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, or Spain. Internship opportunities with private and public institutions concerned with the Chicano/Latino communities are available in Orange County, Sacramento, and Washington, D.C. Independent research with faculty on Chicano/Latino issues is also encouraged. Student research is conducted and given academic credit through independent study or group research courses offered in each acade\u00ad mic unit. The Summer University Research Fellowship (SURF), the Summer Academic Enrichment Program (SAEP), and the Pre\u00ad graduate Mentorship Program (PGMP) are examples of programs at UCI which allow students to work as research assistants with professors.

Weinberger, Ph.D. Case Western Reserve University, Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior and of Cognitive Sciences Peter Woodruff, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science is intended for students who wish to study the history of science, the philosophical foundations of scientific inquiry, and the relationship between sci\u00ad ence and other fields. The history of science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history. This may involve tracking down an idea's source or its influences, evaluating the cul\u00ad tural forces at work in the generation of a scientific theory or the reaction of culture to science, or taking a detailed look at the work of a particular scientist or movement within science. The philosophy of science is concerned with determining what sci\u00ad ence and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. Philosophy of science courses cover such topics as the role of logic and language in science and in mathematics, scientific explanation, evidence, and probability. These courses may also cover work that has been done on the philosophical problems in specific sciences-for example, the direction of time in physics, the model of mind in psychology, the structure of evolution theory in biology, and the implications of GOdel's incompleteness theorems for mathematics. The minor is available to all UCI students. Course descriptions may be found in the academic department sections of the Catalogue. Requirements for the Minor Completion of seven courses as follows: 1. Two courses selected from: Logic and Philosophy of Science 31, 40; History 60. 2.

Minor in Global Sustainability 321 Steinhaus Hall; (949) 824-6006; Fax (949) 824-2181 Peter J. Bryant and Peter A. Bowler, Co-directors Core Faculty Peter A. Bowler, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Director of the UCI Arboretum, UC Natural Reserve System Academic Coordinator, and Lecturer with Security of Employment, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Environmental Analysis and Design Peter J. Bryant, Ph.D. University of Sussex, Director of the Developmental Biology Center and Professor of Developmental and Cell Biology and of Biomedical Engineering Michael Burton, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Anthropology and Social Ecology William S. Reeburgh, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Department Chair and Professor of Earth System Science Susan E. Trumbore, Ph.D. Columbia University, Professor of Earth System Science The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. As a result of population growth and the pursuit of higher stan\u00ad dards of living, humanity has initiated many global trends that can\u00ad not be sustained indefinitely. Some of these trends are physico\u00ad chemical in nature, such as the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing pollution of our environment, including the accumu\u00ad lation\u00b7 of ozone-depleting chemicals with consequent increase of ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, and the buildup of car\u00ad bon dioxide that is almost certainly causing global warming. Other trends are biological ones including the degradation of agricultural land, the destruction .of many kinds of wildlife habitat with associ\u00ad ated high rates of species extinction, and the depletion of wildlife populations by over-exploitation. Global changes are also taking place in the human situation including loss of cultural diversity, a growing income gap between rich and poor nations leading to deepening poverty and additional pressure for biological resource exploitation, accelerating urbanization with associated social prob\u00ad lems, and regional population and economic imbalances leading to escalating political tensions and potential for conflict. This program examines the causes of, and interrelationships between, these prob\u00ad lems and considers new approaches to solving them. Its goal is to provide broad, interdisciplinary training that will allow students to better understand and effectively deal with the serious environmen\u00ad tal problems that we will face in the twenty-first century. The minor is open to all UCI students. Course descriptions are available in the academic department sections of the Catalogue.

The Master's degree is professional in nature and is intended to provide future managers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques; the Ph.D. in Management is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modem management, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. Educational Objectives The Graduate School of Management offers a generalist M.B.A. degree and a learning experience that prepares graduates for a life\u00ad time of professional and personal growth with increasingly impor\u00ad tant enterprise-wide responsibilities. The rigorous curriculum, combined with extensive professional and interpersonal training and opportunities made available through the School's Career Ser\u00ad vices Office and Center for Leadership Development, allows stu\u00ad dents to gain theoretical perspectives that are in tum tested and affirmed with practical application. The result is an environment that fosters the development of professional and personal skills vital to contemporary executives or managers. Students are encour\u00ad aged to develop their ability to lead .change by mastering commu\u00ad nication skills, to work productively and actively within a team-ori\u00ad ented environment, to gain a solid grasp of quantitative skills, and to appreciate and effectively employ those solutions that involve the integration and implementation of information and technology to offer creatively viable business options. GSM has developed a strategic focus on Information Technology for Management (ITM), a theme that is incorporated in many areas of the curriculum. Although a solid grounding in basic business disciplines provides the foundation for effective management, GSM's graduates are encouraged to aim higher. They learn about change as it takes place within the context of a knowledge-based, technology-driven society where information and its effective use are vital to establishing a competitive edge. GSM students, whether they are interested in finance, marketing, general management, strategic planning, accounting, operations, health care, human resources, international business, or other areas, will be thoroughly imbued and comfortable with the nature, importance, and handling of information in all of these and other fields. Further, they will understand the technology and the technological processes that enable the gathering, analysis, dissemination,. and use of informa\u00ad tion to change the way business is done. The strategic focus of the School is to provide skills that will enable its graduates to be effec\u00ad tive managers who are no~ only proficient in business procedures but have the leadership qualities and know-how to affect change by transforming conventional business practices or perhaps even inventing new business processes and management techniques. The Graduate School of Management has created an information\u00ad rich environment that cuts across all business disciplines by pro\u00ad viding its students, faculty, and staff with technological tools that enable each member of the School to retrieve and analyze informa\u00ad tion that can be used to develop new processes or solve complex problems. Five ITM laboratories in the core disciplines are a criti\u00ad cal part of the learning experience, and students' familiarity and ease with Information Technology for Management serve as back- drop for many other courses. \u00b7 Additionally, GSM has also achieved a national reputation for excellence in graduate management education in the health care industry through the Health Care Executive M.B.A. (HCEMBA) program. Industry managers and health care professionals learn about managerial challenges and issues in the health care industry where hundreds of health care providers, medical device and instrumentation companies, and biosciences firms are headquar\u00ad tered. A joint M.D./M.B.A. program also is available. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Master's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The Univer\u00ad sity admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 600 for all M.B.A. programs. Substantive work experi\u00ad ence is considered for applicants to M.B.A. programs. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Irvine, Graduate School of Management, Office of Admissions and Marketing, 202 Graduate School of Management, Irvine, CA 92697-3125; e-mail: gsm-mba@uci.edu, or gsm-phd@gsm.uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.gsm.uci.edu/. Doctor Philosophy h1 Management GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only. The deadline for application is January 15. The Ph.D. program requires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other require\u00ad ments, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to submit a previously pre\u00ad pared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004GSM offers the Ph.D. in Management to students with back\u00ad grounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is pre\u00ad ferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate under\u00ad graduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, politi\u00ad cal science, business or public administration, mathematics, com\u00ad puter sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precur\u00ad sors for management (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) ate encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organization and strategy, operations and deci\u00ad sion technologies, management information systems, finance, accounting, and marketing. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core management disciplines. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. program is divided into two phases: qualification and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for dis\u00ad sertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the can\u00ad didacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original . research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. Students are expected to complete the Ph.D. in four to five years. Requests for information should be addressed to the University of California, Irvine, Graduate School of Management, Doctoral Pro\u00ad gram Admissions Office, 418 Graduate School of Management, Irvine, CA 92697-3125; e-mail: gsm-phd@ gsm.uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www.gsm.uci.edu/doctoral/. Master's Degree Programs GSM offers a variety of programs leading to the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree. These include a two-year, full-time M.B.A. program, and three part-time M.B.A. programs: a 21-month Executive M.B.A. program, a two-year Health Care Executive M.B.A. program, and a three-year Fully Employed M.B.A. program. A five-year joint M.D./M.B.A. program is offered in conjunction with the College of Medicine. M.B.A. PROGRAM GSM admits students to the two-year, full-time M.B.A. program in the fall quarter. Students from a variety of undergraduate disci\u00ad plines, including liberal arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering, are encouraged to apply. The final deadline for completion of all phases of the appli\u00ad cation procedure is May 1. In addition to the general University rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: 1. Completion of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). 2. Completion of a course in both introductory calculus and statis- tics with probability with a grade of B or better. The evaluation of an applicant's file for admission consists of an integrated assessment of all materials submitted including test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements on appli\u00ad cation forms, and letters of recommendation. Above and beyond these factors, substantive work experience is given serious consid\u00ad eration in the evaluation process. The full-time M.B.A. program requires a minimum of92 units with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The curriculum consists of courses divided into two groups designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as Management 327 follows: 13 required Common Core Courses (50 units) and 42 units of elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and educational interests. A thesis is not required. Required Course Work. Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Management Science or Operations Manage\u00ad ment, Organizational Analysis for Management, Financial and Man\u00ad agerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics, Macroeco\u00ad nomics for Management or Government and Public Policy, Information Technology for Management, Marketing Management, Managerial Finance, Business Strategy. International Requirement. Students must fulfill the international requirement in one of the following ways; completion of a GSM international elective in a functional area; participation in a GSM international exchange program; or completion of an upper-division or graduate international course offered by a University of Califor\u00ad nia school, with the approval of the GSM Associate Dean. ITM Electives. Students must complete 12 units of ITM course work, which can be fulfilled by successful completion of ITM-des\u00ad ignated laboratory or non-laboratory electives. Non-laboratory electives (typically four-unit courses) are special topic courses (some numbered 294, others with specific numbers, such as 271 and 275). ITM laboratories are numbered 295A, B, C, D, E, G. Students may meet the ITM requirements by successfully complet\u00ad ing any combination of the above special topic courses and disci\u00ad pline-based ITM laboratory electives totaling at least 12 units. Electives. In addition to the ITM electives, 30 more units of elective courses are required. The major emphasis in the elective courses is to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. Students select their electives in light of their educational and career goals and interests. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the full-time master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree, outstanding UCI undergradu\u00ad ate students may apply to enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram constitutes advanced admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of their junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degree. Successful completion of the require\u00ad ments in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and the M.B.A. degree after the fifth year. Students should consult with their academic counselor in their major school early in their academic careers for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of their junior year for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. M.D./M.B.A. Degree Program The M.D./M.B.A. program requires five or six years for comple\u00ad tion. It is aimed at individuals who are exceptional in ability and motivation and who seek a career as physicians with major respon\u00ad sibility for administration and management in health care organiza\u00ad tions and institutions. Students in this program pursue a combined curriculum for an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and an M.B.A. degree from the Graduate School of Management. Students must be currently enrolled in the M.D. program and in good academic standing in order to apply to the combined UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 328 UCI 2003-04 Graduate School of Management M.D./M.B.A. program. During their second or third year of med\u00ad ical school, interested students submit an application to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management Admissions Committee, after review by the College of Medicine. Final acceptance to the program is granted by the Graduate School of Management, and M.B.A. course work begins following completion of the student's third year of medical school. Students should be aware that enrollment in the M.D. program does not guarantee acceptance into the M.B.A. program. The MCAT, along with the completion of three years of medical school training in good standing and passage of USMLE Step I, currently serve as a waiver for the GMAT entrance examination usually required for application to the M.B.A. program. The total number of units required to graduate for each program separately are satisfied in the M.D./M.B.A. program. Contact the M.D./M.B.A. Advisor at (949) 824-5388 for more information. Special Opportunities Within the M.B.A. program, GSM created an underlying curricu\u00ad lum in Information Technology for Management that provides stu\u00ad dents with sophisticated, state-of-the-art knowledge and practical experience in this rapidly evolving arena. Students take the cus\u00ad tomary M.B.A. core courses, augmented by a set of ITM applica\u00ad tion courses in various functional areas. In addition, many of the electives are specialized courses that reflect the changing nature of organizational management. Representative electives are: Networks and Telecommunications, Management of Information Systems, Electronic Business, Strategic Information Systems, Database Mar\u00ad keting, Marketing on the Internet, and Change Management. Addi\u00ad tional activities designed to supplement this innovative curriculum include seminars given by industry leaders and relevant internships. In addition to the standard admissions criteria, the Admissions Committee is particularly interested in how prospective candidates envision the current role and future potential of information tech\u00ad nology in business. The Graduate School of Management offers course work in health care management within the M.B.A. program. The courses provide training not only in health care and related issues, but also expose students to professionals in the areas of management, finance, mar\u00ad keting, and strategic planning. Skills in these areas are critical to the success of health care organizations as we face the new millennium. In today's interconnected global business world, it has become increasingly important for management students to learn to operate in an international environment. M.B.A. students in the full-time program can gain first-hand knowledge of the culture and manage\u00ad ment practices of other industrialized countries by participating in an academic .exchange with universities located abroad. This expe\u00ad rience, combined with GSM course work in international manage\u00ad ment, prepares students for the demands and complexities of the growing global economic environment. Currently, GSM has exchange relationships with the ESSEC Graduate agement, Cergy-Pontoise, France; Economic Sciences (BUES), Budapest, Hungary~ Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, Wirtschafts Universitat, Wien, Vienna, Austria; ITESM (The Monterrey Higher Educa\u00ad tion), Monterrey, Mexico; Bocconi University, Milan, Italy; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong; National University of Singapore, Singapore; and Chinese European International Business School, Shanghai, China. Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), which was recently designated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as one of six industry-Univer\u00ad sity Information Research Centers in the United States. CRITO is a consortium of corporations working together with faculty at UCI and elsewhere to better understand the evolving fabric of the infor\u00ad mation society and its implications for the design, use, and man\u00ad agement of information and technology in various user environ\u00ad ments. These environments range from the individual user's environment to work-groups, organizations, social communities, and society. The aim is to determine how organizations can more effectively use information and better design and manage new technology for improving organizational performance and society more generally. CRITO faculty associates are recognized internationally for their excellence in the study of information technology as it applies to complex organizations. This tradition of excellence has been estab\u00ad lished by faculty from the Graduate School of Management, the School of Information and Computer Science, and the School of Social Sciences. These associates have collaborated since 1974 on theoretical and empirical research projects studying a broad array of questions about the relationship between information technology and organizational structure, society, political behavior, productiv\u00ad ity, and performance. Research conducted through CRITO focuses on the management, use, and impact of information technology in the emerging global, competitive marketplace and the policy issues raised by such use. CRITO facilitates a match between the techni\u00ad cal and organizational dimensions and between academic researchers and information technology professionals, and also assists organizations in exploiting the potential offered by informa\u00ad tion technology. CRITO's goals are to conduct theoretical and empirical research, bring multiple intellectual perspectives and methods to bear on interdisciplinary research, and facilitate the collaboration of faculty, students, and the professional community utilizing the expertise, facilities, and activities provided by CRITO. Qualified GSM students are encouraged to participate in the various CRITO research activities and to avail themselves of this unique opportunity to interact with scholars from allied disciplines and to study in-depth the effects of the information technology revolution.

UC IRVINE - 2003-2004SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Ronald J. Stem, Dean 180 Rowland Hall Academic Counseling: (949) 824-6507 World Wide Web: http://www.physsci.uci.edu/ The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy. The fac\u00ad ulty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of stu\u00ad dents ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scien\u00ad tists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will pre\u00ad pare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the depart\u00ad mental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical uni\u00ad verse provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civiliza\u00ad tion, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. Earth system science is grounded in the traditional physical sciences while breaking new paths in the quantitative study of changes in the global environment. DEGREES Chemistry ............................................................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Earth and Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candi\u00ad dates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately 1 per\u00ad cent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research, cumulative grade point average, and performance in upper-division courses in the major. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other impor\u00ad tant factors are considered (see page 51). The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distin\u00ad guished themselves by their work in their major subject. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to complete a coordinated set of courses beyond the introductory level in Mathematics and in Earth and Atmos\u00ad pheric Sciences may pursue minors in these areas. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students who choose a major in the School of Physical Sciences have a variety of academic advising and counseling resources avail\u00ad able to them. In addition to faculty advisors, there is a Chief Acade\u00ad mic Advisor in each department who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements, reviewing student petitions, and assisting with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff, employed in the Associate Dean's Office, is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In consultation with their faculty advisor or an academic counselor, students should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, students may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-divi\u00ad sion work in each major. A student interested in any of the physi\u00ad cal sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry usually will include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be accomplished by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21, Chemistry 5, Engineering CEElO, MAElO, or Physics 53. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The majority of graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engi\u00ad neering, or postsecondary education. Other students will complete a secondary education credential in order to prepare for careers teaching high school mathematics and science. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business administration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, marketing, or sales. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni\u00b7 including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career Center section for addi\u00ad tional information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Preparation for Teaching Science and Mathematics Students interested in teaching science and mathematics should consider the programs in science and mathematics education offered by the Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to sat\u00ad isfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C (or the Honors sequence Chemistry H2A-B-C) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the var\u00ad ied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond the introductory level. In order to enroll in Chemistry 1A, students must pass the Chem\u00ad istry Placement Examination, which is given in late spring, sum\u00ad mer, and during Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter. A preparatory course, Chemistry 1P, is offered in summer and fall for those who do not pass the Chemistry Placement Exam\u00ad ination or who need additional preparation prior to entering Chem\u00ad istry 1A. A grade of Cor better in Chemistry 1P automatically qualifies the student for Chemistry 1A. Completion of a one-year sequence in organic chemistry, either Chemistry 51A-B-C or H52A-B-C, is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of interest to others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department empha\u00ad sizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direction of a faculty member. A handout describing the procedures for arranging an undergraduate research opportunity is available from the Chem\u00ad istry Undergraduate Program Office, 248/250 Rowland Hall. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consider completing the optional con\u00ad centration in Chemistry Education. A two-year post-baccalaureate program for the M.S. in Chemistry and a California Secondary Chemistry 339 Teaching Credential is described in the Chemistry Graduate Pro\u00ad gram section. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Counseling about preparation for a career in the health sciences is provided by the health science advisors in the School of Biological Sciences. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with a faculty member no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Chemistry major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of general chemistry with laboratory and one year of approved calculus. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None, Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-D, Chemistry 107 and 107L, Chemistry 131A-B-C (or 130A-B-C), Chemistry 151 and 151L.

At least three laboratory courses chosen from Biological Sciences 114L (Biochemistry Laboratory), 116L (Molecular Biology Labo\u00ad ratory), Chemistry 128L (Introduction to Chemical Biology Labo\u00ad ratory Techniques), 152 (Advanced Analytical Chemistry), 153 (Physical Chemistry Laboratory), 156 (Advanced Laboratory in Chemistry and Synthesis of Materials), 160 (Organic Synthesis Laboratory), 170 (Radioisotope Techniques), 180 (Undergraduate Research), Engineering CBEMS140A-B (Chemical Engineering Laboratory), Physics 120 (Electronics for Scientists), and 121 (Advanced Laboratory). (Chemistry 180 can be counted toward this requirement no more than once.) At least four of the courses used to satisfy the Elective Require\u00ad ment must be courses-offered by the Chemistry Department. Optional American Chemical Society Certification: For ACS Certification the program must include Biological Sciences 98; Chemistry 127, 152, 153; and at least two courses beyond the degree requirement chosen from Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3A, and 3D. Optional Concentration in Biochemistry: The program must include Biological Sciences 97, 98, 99; Chemistry 128, 128L; and three advanced biology electives chosen from: Biological Sciences 108, 109, 110, 111L, 112L, 114, 114L, 116, 116L, 121, 121L, 122, UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 340 UCI 2003-04 School of Physical \u00b7\u00b7 Optional Concentration in Chemistry Education: The program must include Education 173 (or 176), Physical Sciences 114 (two quarters), and three science breadth electives offered by one department from the following list: Earth System Science 122, 130, 164; Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3A, 3D, 7; Physics 20A, 51A, SIB. One quarter of Physical Sciences 114 can be replaced by one quarter of Chemistry 191 or 192. The Chemistry elective requirement is reduced for students in this concentration to three lecture courses and two laboratory courses. Of these, three must be courses offered by the Chemistry Department. HONORS PROGRAM IN CHEMISTRY The Honors Program in Chemistry is a research-based program offered to selected Chemistry majors during their final year. Appli\u00ad cants to the program must have completed their junior year with a grade point average of at least 3.3 overall and in their Chemistry courses. They must also have demonstrated the potential. of carrying out research of honors quality, as judged by the Chemistry faculty member who will supervise their research. Students in this program enroll in Honors Research in Chemistry (Chemistry H180A-B-C) throughout their senior year and submit a formal thesis late in the spring quarter. They also enroll in the Honors Seminar in Chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry H181), in which they receive instruction in scien\u00ad tific writing and present a formal research seminar. Successful completion of Chemistry H181 satisfies the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who complete these requirements, whose grade point average remains above the 3.3 standard, and whose research is judged to be of honors quality will graduate with Departmental Honors in Chemistry. The Department also offers an Honors General Chemistry sequence, H2A-B-C. This course in general chemistry is designed for mem\u00ad bers of the Campus wide Honors Program (CHP) and other highly qualified students. It covers the same material as Chemistry lA-B\u00ad C, but in greater depth. Additional information is available from the Chemistry Undergradu\u00ad ate Program Office. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY. The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of lat\u00ad itude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue inter\u00ad ests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coin\u00ad cide with those of the School of Biological Sciel;lces. For this rea\u00ad son a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences is popu\u00ad lar. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not mandatory, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses must be included in the program of study: Biological Sciences 98; two courses from Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3A, 3D; Chemistry 127, 152, and 153. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry lA-B-Cor H2A-B-C and lLB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-D, and required writ\u00ad ing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 5, SIA-B-C, and SILA-LB-LC (or H52A-B-C and H52LA-LB-LC); the Physics 7 sequence should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in a yeat sequence of physical chemistry and in Chemistry 1511151L (fall), 107 (winter), and 107L (spring). Chemistry 130A-B-C and 131A\u00ad B-C are equivalent courses in physical chemistry. They have the same prerequisites and expect the same level of chemical and mathematical rigor. Both are acceptable to satisfy the physical chemistry requirement for the major. Chemistry 131A-B-C devel\u00ad ops the topic beginning from a molecular or microscopic point of view and proceeds to the macroscopic description of matter; appli\u00ad cations may address primarily gas phase systems. Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C, on the other hand, commences with the macroscopic descrip\u00ad tion; this approach may be of particular interest for applications of physical chemistry in biology, materials science, and engineering. Students should choose between the two courses on the basis of their interests. Because of significant differences in the sequence of topics, students starting in one series may not switch to the other in subsequent quarters. During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Departm!!nt elec\u00ad tives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University and departmental requirements. \u00b7 Sample programs for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Soci\u00ad ety-certified Chemistry majors, the Biochemistry concentration, the Chemistry Education concentration, and Chemistry-Biological Sci\u00ad ences double majors are shown in the accompanying charts. Sam\u00ad ple programs for Chemistry majors wishing to emphasize chemical physics, computational or theoretical chemistry, chemical synthesis and reactivity, or materials or polymer science in their undergradu\u00ad ate programs are available from the Chemistry Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram Office, 248/250 Rowland Hall. The faculty encourages Chemistry majors to enhance their educa\u00ad tion by studying abroad for one or more quarters, or during the summer. In most cases, the Chemistry EAP advisor can help stu\u00ad dents plan a program of study that will not extend the time it takes to graduate. Also, study abroad can enhance students' applications for admission to graduate and professional schools. For more infor\u00ad mation about opportunities to study abroad, see the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue or visit the Phys\u00ad ical Sciences Student Affairs Office.

Lab Breadth/Elective The Department offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to ca'rry outindependent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of gradu\u00ad ate course work and a comprehensive oral examination (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units), in chem\u00ad istry. The M.S. Plan II (Non-Thesis) program requires that the stu\u00ad dent complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses (or 40 units) and a comprehensive oral examination. Graduate studen~s are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic stand\u00ad ing. The comprehensive oral examination assesses the competence of the candidate in the areas of chemistry covered by the chosen course work, with unanimous agreement among the three examina\u00ad tion committee m\\!mbers required for satisfactory completion. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree during the first year is assessed by a written examination administered after completion of the first year of study. This examination covers either research accomplish\u00ad ments during the first year or comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work. The time and content of the examination depends upon the student's specific area of interest. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least four quarters during their gradu\u00ad ate career. Participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examination for for\u00ad mal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's second or third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 342 UCI 2003-04 School of Physical Sciences research project, and an original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time\u00b7 on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit' of chemical research. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doc\u00ad toral dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a fac\u00ad ulty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a'quality suitable for pub\u00ad lication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, follow\u00ad ing which the candidate will be examined on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modern laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics arid Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the M.S. program includes a summer session to assimilate students with different undergraduate. backgrounds; for\u00ad mal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop communication skills. The required courses include thirteen core courses and three electives (subject to advisor approval) as follows: Core: Chemistry 206, 208, 229A, 231A-B-C, 232A-B, 266; one course from each of the following four groups: Chemistry 139 or Physics 129 or 273; Chemistry 229B or Physics 223; Chemistry 228 or 230; Chemistry 236 or Physics 133 or 238A. Electives: Chemistry 225, 226, 232C, 233,248, MSE259A, Physics 134, 213C, 233A-B, 238A. Iri addition to the required courses, M.S. students complete a master's thesis. The M.S. pro\u00ad gram prepares students to compete for high-tech jobs or to begin research leading to a Ph.D. Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. Ph.D. students must also pass a qualifying examination by the end of their second year of graduate study. A candidacy examination consisting of an original research proposal and a research progress report is expected to be com\u00ad pleted within a year of starting the Ph.D. program. CONCENTRATION IN PROTEIN ENGINEERING SCIENCE Several faculty in the Department of Chemistry, in conjunction with faculty in the School of Biological Sciences and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, participate in the joint graduate program in Protein Engineering. This interdisciplinary graduate program offers students the opportunity to work with faculty in any of the participating academic units; take course work in the areas of protein structure, function, and molecular biology; and earn the Ph.D. in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, or Engineering with a concentration in Protein Engineering Science. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Catalogue and through the graduate program in Protein Engineer\u00ad ing office in the Biological Sciences Administration Building. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Chem\u00ad istry Department sponsors a coordinated two-year program for the M.S. degree in Chemistry and the California Single Subject Teach\u00ad ing Credential. The M.S. degree may be obtained under either Plan I or Plan II described below. Prospective graduate students inter\u00ad ested in this program should so indicate on their graduate applica\u00ad tion and should request a detailed description of the program from the Chemistry Department Graduate Affairs Office or the Depart\u00ad ment of Education. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry.

Sherwood Rowland, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Bren Research Professor of Chemistry and Earth System Science (atmospheric and analytical chemistry, and radiochemistry) The goal of the Department of Earth System Science is to increase the scientific understanding of the Earth as a coupled system of atmosphere, ocean, and land. Earth System Science is inherently interdisciplinary in scope, linking the fields of oceanography, atmospheric and terrestrial sciences, climatology, hydrology, biol\u00ad ogy, physics, and chemistry to understand the climate system and global biogeochemical cycles. These fields have traditionally been taught in different departments, which has hindered students who want to learn about all of the disciplines that interact to control the global environment. At the undergraduate level, courses are designed to educate both science and non-science majors in the basic processes driving the Earth system, including elemental cycling, Earth's climate, and global environmental problems. Undergraduates can pursue a major in Earth and Environmental Sciences or a minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. The Department also offers a group of lower-division breadth courses appropriate for non-science majors. At the graduate level, the Earth System Science 347 Department offers the M.S. and Ph:D: degrees in Earth System Sci\u00ad ence. Graduate study emphasizes laboratory, field, and modeling studies of global change in the environment through study of phys\u00ad ical, chemical, and biological processes within and between the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial systems. Undergraduate Program The objective of the major is to prepare students to understand the rapidly evolving field of Earth System Science. Students work with faculty and graduate students to obtain a quantitative understanding of the Earth system. Both the major and the minor consist of a set of required core courses and a group of elective courses drawn from offerings in Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineer\u00ad ing, and Social Ecology. The core courses provide a broad scien\u00ad tific foundation of the physical, chemical, and biological principles needed to understand the complex interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, and land that drive the Earth's climate and biogeochemical cycles. Majors develop the analytical and quantitative skills needed to understand sensitive environmental issues. In their junior and senior years, ESS students are encouraged to focus on a particular area within Earth System Science and to choose electives within ESS and campuswide that build a coherent core of knowledge. Focus areas include but are not limited to cli\u00ad matology, biogeochemical cycles, oceanography, hydrology, terres\u00ad trial sciences, atmospheric sciences, environmental policy and planning, and resource management. Alternatively, the focus could be on .chemical, physical, or biological processes across these dis\u00ad ciplines. This flexible program is designed to accommodate the particular interests of each student. Majors are encouraged to become directly involved in scientific research working with a fac\u00ad ulty member by taking Earth System Science 199 for several quar\u00ad ters, typically in the senior year. The UCI upper-division writing requirement may be fulfilled by taking Earth System Science 199 and 198 in the senior year. Many ESS students go on to graduate school programs and careers as research scientists in academic, public, or private institutions. Students are prepared to enter the workforce directly as scientists in a diverse array of fields including environmental policy and planning, environmental consulting, air quality monitoring and assessment, laboratory analysis, scientific research, science education, natural resource management, wildlife management, conservation and environmental protection, and water resource management. The minor is open to all students (except Earth and Environmental Sciences majors), but it is primarily designed for students in the natural sciences and engineering who wish to explore interdiscipli\u00ad nary problems and broaden their studies to include the application of their fields to understanding the Earth system. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Earth and Environmental Sciences major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of . major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities~ Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Student Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus and one year of either general chemistry (with laboratory) or calculus-based physics (with laboratory).

Graduate Program Applicants to the Earth System Science Ph.D. program should have a broad quantitative scientific background, with an undergraduate degree in natural science or related fields such as applied mathe\u00ad matics and engineering. Undergraduate preparation should involve mathematics including differential equations, a year-long sequence of physics and of chemistry, and courses in general biology, ecol\u00ad ogy, or geology. Entering graduate students plan their courses and research with the help of the Earth System Science Advisory Com\u00ad mittee of academic and research faculty. Students are admitted to the Ph.D. program only; the Master's degree is awarded upon progress to the Ph.D. To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. program, a mini\u00ad mum of 10 approved graduate-level courses, including the core cur\u00ad riculum, must be completed with an average grade of B or better. All courses must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee. The core curriculum consists of Earth System Science 200, 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 218, and 298. These courses are described below. Students are also expected to participate in the Earth System Science seminar. Additionally, Ph.D. students are required to com\u00ad plete a teaching assistant training program and to have a minimum of two quarters of experience as a teaching assistant, provided opportunities are available. Academic Senate regulations specify a minimum period of residence of six quarters for Ph.D. candidates. Enrollment in a minimum of 12 units of graduate/upper-division course work per quarter is required. Registration in every regular academic session is neces\u00ad sary until all requirements for the degree have been completed, unless a formal Leave of Absence is granted by the Office of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. All Ph.D. requirements must be completed within 15 quarters in residence, excluding summer quarters. Exceptions must be put to a vote of the Earth System Science faculty. A single departmental Qualifying Examination for all eligible Earth System Science students is administered during the fall quar\u00ad ter. This examination determines the student's readiness to begin research for the dissertation and should be taken following comple\u00ad tion of the core course work and summer research, during the fall quarter of the second year. The Qualifying Examination consists of both written and oral parts. The written portion of the examination emphasizes breadth, general knowledge, and the ability to integrate and use information covered in the core curriculum and other course work. The oral examination provides an opportunity to clar\u00ad ify questions arising from the student's performance on the written examination. Following completion of the Qualifying Examination, those stu\u00ad dents who receive a recommendation to continue Ph.D. work will pursue research on a potential dissertation topic and then take the Advancement to Candidacy Examination. This oral examination is given by a faculty committee, including extra-departmental faculty. Concurrent with this examination, the Ph.D. candidates present a research seminar to the entire Earth System Science Department outlining their proposed dissertation work. A dissertation based on original research and demonstrating critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and clarity in written communication is required for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation must summarize the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Depart\u00ad ment. The criterion of acceptability of a dissertation is that its con\u00ad tents be judged by the committee as suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal of high editorial standards. The dis\u00ad sertation may be a compilation of published papers or manuscripts accepted for publication, so long as a major proportion of the mate\u00ad rial has been produced independently by the candidate. The format and content are approved by the Dissertation Committee, and Uni\u00ad versity requirements for style, format, and appearance are met. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The Master's degree is awarded only to students admitted to the Ph.D. program who have completed a total of 10 courses, met the three-quarter residency requirement, and completed the Qualifying Examination.

The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and col\u00ad loquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. Undergraduate Program The Department offers a B.S. degree in Mathematics. Within this program, students have the option of completing a concentration in Mathematics for Economics, a specialization in Applied and Com\u00ad putational Mathematics, a specialization in Statistics, or a special\u00ad ization in Mathematics for High School Teaching. In addition, the . Department offers a minor in Mathematics. Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts students and those planning to enter the teaching field. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Mathematics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the required course work of one year of approved calculus.

HONORS PROGRAM IN MATHEMATICS The Honors Program in Mathematics is open to all junior and senior Mathematics majors who meet the minimum academic qual\u00ad ifications of a 3.5 GPA in Mathematics courses and a 3.2 GPA overall. In addition to satisfying the requirements for the major in Mathematics (in any one of its tracks), participants must complete at least one of the two series Mathematics 205A-B-C (Introduction to Graduate Analysis) or 206A-B-C (Introduction to Graduate Algebra) with a grade of C or better. If Mathematics 205A-B-C is not taken, then 140A-B-C-D must all be completed. If Mathemat\u00ad ics 206A-B-C is not taken, then l20A-B and 121A-B must all be completed. In terms of satisfaction of the Mathematics major requirements, Mathematics 205A-B-C counts as the equivalent of four upper\u00ad division courses, specifically 140A-B-C-D; and 206A-B-C counts as the equivalent of four upper-division courses, specifically, l20A-B and 121A-B. The graduate sequences may be taken in place of or in addition to the undergraduate courses named. Students must apply for the Honors Program no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Those who are accepted enroll in the Honors Seminar (Mathematics H195A-B) during the winter and spring quarter of their senior year. At the end of the spring quarter students submit an Honors thesis, which is designed and completed under the supervision of the Honors Seminar faculty. (Mathematics H195B may be counted toward the major requirements as one of the five additional courses in area H.) Upon approval of the thesis by the Department's Honors Committee and completion of all other requirements, students graduate with Honors in Mathematics, and this distinction is noted on their transcript \u00b7 Requirements for the Minor One course selected from Mathematics 13, 120A, or 140A, plus six additional upper-division lecture courses in Mathematics (plus the associated laboratories, where applicable) numbered 100-188. NOTE: Nearly all upper-division courses in Mathematics have Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B-J as prerequisites, and many courses have additional prerequisites such as Mathematics 2D, 2E, 3A, and/or 3D. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY There is a variety of career patterns the UCI Mathematics major may select. In many instances, a double major (in Mathematics and an appropriate related field) provides the strongest preparation for the career desired. Assistance in planning a program of study is available from faculty advisors and the Mathematics Department Undergraduate Advisor.

Among the fields cov\u00ad ered are analysis, algebra, applied and computational mathematics, functional analysis, geometry and topology, probability and statis\u00ad tics, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathematical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the instructor in charge. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS\u00b7 The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some students it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course and resi\u00ad dency requirements, and pass Comprehensive Examinations admin\u00ad istered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. The total number of required courses for the M.S. degree is 12 courses, completed with satisfactory performance. Students are required to complete at least one series of the following courses: Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, or 230A-B-C. At most one undergraduate course may count as an elective course, provided it is sponsored by rank faculty and approved by the Graduate Advi\u00ad sor. At most one elective course (of at least three units) is allowed outside the Department. Students will take Advisory Examinations in Algebra and Analysis upon entrance to the graduate program. The Advisory Examination in Algebra is based on the courses Mathematics 120A and 121A-B plus some advanced topics in group theory and linear algebra; stu\u00ad dents who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 206A-B-C sequence. The Advisory Examination in Analysis is based on the courses Mathematics I40A-B-C-D; stu\u00ad dents who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 205A-B-C sequence. Mathematics 355 Students must pass two Comprehensive Examinations, one in Algebra and one in Analysis, before the beginning of their second year in the graduate program and will be given, at most, two chances to pass each examination. Students who have passed the Advisory Examination will be exempted from taking the corre\u00ad sponding Comprehensive Examination. Mathematics 199, 297, 298, 299, and 399 may not be used to fulfill course requirements. The residency requirement ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics sponsors a coordinated two-year program for the M.S. degree in Mathematics and the California Single Subject Teaching Credential. This option requires 12 courses, at least eight of which must be graduate courses. Three thesis courses (Mathe\u00ad matics 299) may be used as part of the course work for this option. The Advisory and Comprehensive Examination requirements are the same as for the regular Master's degree. Prospective graduate students interested in this program should so indicate on their appli\u00ad cations and can request a detailed description of the program from the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Education. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN MATHEMATICS When accepted into the doctoral program, the student embarks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. Qualifying Examinations, Advancement to Candidacy Examination, and dissertation. \u00b7 All students will take Advisory Examinations in Algebra and Analysis upon entrance to the graduate program. The Advisory Examination in Algebra is based on the courses Mathematics 120A and 12IA-B, plus some advanced topics in group theory and linear algebra; students who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 206A-B-C sequence. The Advisory Examina\u00ad tion in Analysis is based on material covered in Mathematics 140A-B-C-D; students who do not pass this examination will be asked to take the Mathematics 205A-B-C sequence. All students who take Mathematics 205A-B-C (Analysis) and 206A-B-C (Alge\u00ad bra) must pass, at the beginning of their second year in the gradu\u00ad ate program, the corresponding Comprehensive Examination, which covers the material of the Advisory Examination plus Mathematics 205 or 206, respectively. Each student must choose at least two series of the following three series of courses-Mathematics 2IOA-B-C (Real Analysis), 220A\u00ad B-C (Complex Analysis), or 230A-B-C (Algebra)-and pass two written Qualifying Examinations from these courses before the end of their third year. Each examination may be taken twice. A stu\u00ad dent who passes the examination prior to taking the corresponding course will be exempted from taking the course. The Department will offer the Qualifying Examinations twice each year, during ori\u00ad entation week before the fall quarter and during the second week of winter quarter. By the end of their second year, students must declare a major specialization from the following areas: Algebra, Analysis, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Geometry and Topology, Logic, or Probability. Students are required to take two series of courses from their chosen area. (Students who later decide to change their area must also take two series of courses from the new area.) Addi\u00ad tionally, all students must take two series of course outside their declared major area of specialization. Special topics courses within certain areas of specialization and courses counted toward the .. \u00b7 UC IRVINE - 2003-2004356 UCI 2003-04 School of Physical Sciences M.S. degree, other than Mathematics 205A-B-C and 206A-B-C, will count toward the fulfillment of the major specialization requirement. By the beginning of their third year, students must have an advisor specialist in their major area. With the advisor's aid, the student forms a committee for the Advancement to Candidacy oral exami\u00ad nation. This committee will be approved by the Department on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council and will have five faculty members. At least one, and at most two, of the members must be faculty from outside the Department. Before the end of the third year, students must have a written pro\u00ad posal, approved by their committee, for the Advancement to Candi\u00ad dacy examination. The proposal should explain the role of at least two series of courses from the student's major area of specializa\u00ad tion and of additional research reading material, and should have a plan for investigating specific topics under the direction of the stu\u00ad dent's adviser(s). The courses Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and 230A-B-C cannot double count for both Qualifying and Advancement to Candidacy Examinations. After the student meets the requirements, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students should advance to candidacy by the begin\u00ad ning of their fourth year. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the Department's teaching program. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in Mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the candidate's area of concentration. Upon advancement to candidacy a student must form a Thesis Committee, ideally a subcommittee of the Advancement Examination Committee, consisting of at least three faculty members and chaired by the student's advisor. The commit\u00ad tee guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writ\u00ad ing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Physicists study the smallest particles of matter (quarks and leptons), nuclei, and atoms; the fundamental forces; the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engi\u00ad neering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses for stu\u00ad dents of various interests, from those in the humanities and social sciences, to those in biological sciences, and to those in physics, engineering, and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as ele\u00ad mentary particles, plasma physics, astrophysics, and condensed UC IRVINE - 2003-2004matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. The fac\u00ad ulty is vigorous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-fac\u00ad ulty interaction. Undergraduate Program The goal of the undergraduate major in Physics is to develop expert problem solvers with a broad understanding of physical principles. The program is flexible and prepares students for careers in industrial research, applications programming, education, law, or business, as well as for graduate study in astronomy, biomedical physics, engineering, or physics. Annual mandatory meetings with faculty advisors assist students in selecting a program that matches their aptitudes and interests. In addition to the core Physics courses, students complete either a standard track (such as the track for future Ph.D. physicists), or one of the formal concentra\u00ad tions or specializations (in Applied Physics, Biomedical Physics, Computational Physics, Philosophy of Physics, Physics Education, or Astrophysics). In addition, Physics majors may find the minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, offered by the Department of Earth System Science, to be of interest. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized as follows: Physics 3: Intended audience: Premedical students, Biological Sci\u00ad ences Prerequisites: algebra and concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2A. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 7D with permission. Physics 7: Intended audience: Physical Sciences and Engineering majors. Prerequisite: concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics 51A. Physics 16-21: Intended audience: Nonscience majors. Prerequi\u00ad sites: none. Preparation for Advanced courses: none. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Physics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer stu\u00ad dents from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of approved calculus and one year of calculus\u00ad based physics with laboratory for engineering and physics majors. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Physics or 197; and six additional coherently related four-unit courses.

Honors Program in Physics The Honors Program in Physics provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in Physics to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas of the Department. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on an application normally submitted by the sixth week of the spring quarter of the junior year. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.4 and a grade point average in physics courses of 3.5 or better. (Exceptions to these procedures and standards may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances.) In selecting students for the program, the Department considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admitted to the program participate in a year-long course, Physics H196A-B-C, which includes two quarters of research and a final quarter in which a written thesis is submitted. If this work and the student's final GPA are deemed of honors quality by the pro\u00ad gram advisor, the student then graduates with Departmental Honors in Physics. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical students, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 16 through 21. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 should meet with the Department Undergraduate Advisor for placement information. Physics 7 is an intensive four-quarter course for students in Physi\u00ad cal Sciences and Engineering who are interested in a careful quan\u00ad titative approach to macroscopic physics. Laboratory work accom\u00ad panies the course. Students ~ith an advanced background in physics may begin the sequence with 7B upon satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of the Physics Placement Examination. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 362 UCI 2003-04 School of Physical Sciences Physics courses numbered between 16 and 21 are general educa\u00ad tion courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and for\u00ad mat of Physics 21 may vary from year to year. The introduction to mathematical methods (Mathematics 2E, 2J, 3D, and Physics 50), microscopic physics (Physics 51A-B), and experimental physics (Physics 52A-B-C) are normally tak;en in the sophomore year. \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Courses numbered 111 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. Courses numbered between 111 and 115 empha\u00ad size the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. It should be noted that multi-quarter courses such as lllA-B rnust be taken and passed in sequential order. Any student who is so inclined may take more than the min\u00ad imum one quarter of advanced laboratory work. Courses numbered between 132 and 149 introduce active subdisciplines in current research. Independent research (195, 196) is strongly encouraged. Physics 196C, H196C, and 197 stress the written and verbal com\u00ad munication of research findings. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with the Depaqment Undergraduate Advisor before deciding on a program of courses. All Physics majors must complete the core course~ listed below. By the end of the junior year, each student must also select a con\u00ad centration or track. Note that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. Furthermore, exceptionally prepared students are allowed to enroll in graduate-level courses; to do so requires the approval of the Department Undergraduate Advisor.

The Applied Physics concentration is designed to provide appro\u00ad priate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the techni\u00ad cal knowledge obtained from engineering courses. A student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics and Astronomy Department. Examples of appropriate courses include Engineering ECE70, ECE113A Upon completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. \u00b7 Sample Program -Applied Physics Concentration FALL WINTER SPRING Junior The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the student who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medi\u00ad cine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required as are nine quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coordination of a program in the second year is essential.

Students take courses in deductive and inductive logic, the philosophy and history of physics, and quantum mechanics. The emphasis on careful argu\u00ad ment makes this concentration useful for anyone who wishes to pursue a graduate degree in philosophy or law, or for other careers that employ both verbal and quantitative analysis. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The Physics Education concentration is for students who plan a career in secondary education. An Education course, five general science courses, and two quarters of classroom experience com\u00ad plete the requirements for the concentration. The Astrophysics specialization is primarily for students planning graduate work in astronomy or astrophysics. It also is a suitable focus for students who do not plan to pursue a graduate degree but anticipate a career in science journalism, teaching, science admin\u00ad istration, or public relations. The course work includes three courses in astrophysics (Physics 137, 144, 145) and two courses in related branches of physics (selected from Physics 132, 134, 135, and 136).

These degrees are awarded in recognition of demonstrated knowl\u00ad edge of the basic facts and theories of physics and of a demon\u00ad strated capacity for independent research. Active programs of research are underway in high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, low-temperature physics, plasma physics, gravitational physics, and astrophysics. In general, graduate study in the physics Ph.D. program is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Completion of the Ph.D. typically requires six years of full-time study. Students may pursue the M.S. degree on either a full-time or part-time basis. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. Graduate students are members of an intellectual community and are expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high-energy, and plasma physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in Physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. Students admitted into the graduate program in Physics and Astronomy may elect to pursue the M.S. or Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics, as described in a later section. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PHYSICS The requirements for the M.S. degree are (1) at least three quarters of residence; (2) mastery of graduate course material, which must be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or better, a mini\u00ad mum of eight quarter courses including: Physics 211, 213A-B, 215A, 223, at least one other course numbered between 200 and 259, and two other courses approved by the graduate advisor; and (3) either Option A, a research project and written thesis, or Option B, a comprehensive written examination. A typical program of study for the M.S. degree consists of the fol\u00ad lowing nine courses: Physics 211 (Classical Mechanics), 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), 215A (Quantum Mechanics), 223 (Numerical Methods), 224 (Discoveries and Inventions of Modem Physics), 206 (Laboratory Skills) for experimentalists or 212 Physics and Astronomy 363 (Mathematical Physics) for theorists, plus two electives chosen from Physics 215B or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. (The requirements for the M.S. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics differ from these.) DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHYSICS The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a disserta\u00ad tion reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement. Course Requirements. Students are required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences-Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic The\u00ad ory, Quantum Mechanics, Mathematical Physics, and Statistical Physics. A minimum of 12 quarter courses including 211, 212A, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, 223, at least two other courses numbered between 200 and 259, and two other courses approved by the grad\u00ad uate advisor, must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strongly encouraged to take Physics 211, 212A, 213A-B, 214A, 215A-B, 223, and 206 (for experimentalists) in their first year of study. It is expected that students, having selected a research spe\u00ad cialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (236A-B\u00ad C, 237A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) in their second year of study. (The requirements for the Ph.D. degree with a concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics differ from these, as outlined on the next page.) Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part, covering a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate levels, is normally taken in the fall following the student's first year. The first oral examination is administered along with the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be from the Department of Physics and Astronomy. A second attempt at this set of examinations will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordi\u00ad nary circumstances. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approxi\u00ad mately one year after successful completion of the written exami\u00ad nation and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty mem\u00ad bers from outside the Department. The second oral will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all Ph.D. students are required to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. All new teaching assistants are required to enroll in Physics 269. To receive a TA appointment, students who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council must pass either the Test of Spoken English (TSE) or the UCI SPEAK (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) examination by the time they advance to candidacy. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original re\u00ad search performed by the student under the supervision of a doctor\u00ad al committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, will be required for the Ph.D. degree. A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 364 UCI 2003-04 School of Physical Sciences in a scientific journal. The dissertation must not have been submit\u00ad ted to any other institution prior to its submission to the UCI Physics and Astronomy Department. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. CONCENTRATION IN CHEMICAL AND MATERIALS PHYSICS This is an interdisciplinary program between condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, which is designed to eliminate the barrier between these two disciplines. Students with B.S. degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science and Engineering, are encouraged to apply to the program. The goal of the concentration in Chemical and Materials Physics (ChaMP) is to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary education in the applied physical sci\u00ad ences that emphasizes modem laboratory and computational skills. The program accepts students for both the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees. Upon admission to the program, students are assigned two faculty advisors, one from the Department of Physics and Astron\u00ad omy, and one from the Department of Chemistry, to provide guid\u00ad ance on curriculum and career planning. The curriculum for the M.S. program includes a summer session to assimilate students with different undergraduate backgrounds; for\u00ad mal shop, laboratory, and computational courses; a sequence on current topics to bridge the gap between fundamental principles and applied technology; and a course to develop communication skills. The required courses include thirteen core courses and three electives (subject to advisor approval) as follows: Core: Physics 206, 207, 229A, 266; Chemistry 231A-B-C, 232A-B; one course from each of the following four groups: Physics 228 or Chemistry 230; Physics 223 or 229B; Physics 133 or 238A or Chemistry 236; Physics 129 or 273 or Chemistry 139. Electives: Physics 134, 213C, 224, 233A, 233B, 238A, Chemistry 213, 248, 249, Engineering ECE278, Engineering MSE201, MSE259A. In addition to the required courses, M.S. students com\u00ad plete a master's thesis. The M.S. program prepares students to compete for high-tech jobs or to begin research leading to a Ph.D. Successful completion of the M.S. degree requirements qualifies students for the Ph.D. program. Ph.D. students must also pass a qualifying examination by the end of their second year of graduate study. A candidacy examination consisting of an original research proposal and a research progress report is expected to be com\u00ad pleted within a year of starting the Ph.D. program.

The School is comprised of the Departments of Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; Psychology and Social Behavior; and Planning, Policy, and Design. It has approxi\u00ad mately 60 full-time faculty members, 2,100 undergraduate majors, and 170 graduate students. Social ecology applies scientific methods UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 370 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Ecology to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences ,on human develop\u00ad ment over the life cycle, and effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. In summary, while ecology is the science of the relationship between organisms and their. environments, social ecology is the science of the relationships between human popula\u00ad tions and their environments. The faculty is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists with a variety of specialties (e.g:, developmental, clinical, social, and environmental); sociologists; program evaluators; urban and regional planners; environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and environmental design specialists. Faculty members con\u00ad duct research and teach courses that integrate concepts and perspec\u00ad tives of the several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that societal problems are so complex that their analy\u00ad sis requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). A number of faculty members are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and corrimu~ nities function. A number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The Social Ecology Buildings I and II feature many facilities for experimental research, such as wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environmental health sciences and behavioral assessment laboratories for research in human development, social relations, and legal studies. Wet laboratories. are used for studying air and water pollution. Behavioral assessment laboratories are used for studying social phenomena such\u00b7 as parent-child interac\u00ad tion, cooperation among children, hyperactivity, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The School also offers students up-to-date computing facilities and assistance to ensure that their skills prepare them for either advanced (graduate) work or for the changing needs Of today's workplace, which increasingly demands skills in computing and information technology.

Eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average (GPA). A minimum overall GPA of 3.5 is required. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Dean for Students. Other important fac\u00ad tors are also considered (see page 51). Undergraduate Pro'gram The School of Social Ecology offers either a general interdiscipli\u00ad nary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through degree programs in Applied Ecology; Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; and Psychology and Social Behavior. Continuing-Student Applicants. Due to the high demand for admission to the School of Social Ecology, not all eligible continu\u00ad ing-student applicants may be accommodated at the time they may wish to change or declare a major within the School. Interested students should contact the Social Ecology Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office for information about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies. HONORS PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportunity for selected School of Social Ecology students to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal invitation and application in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the follow\u00ad ing requirements: completion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper\u00ad division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Acceptance into the program is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Successful completion of the program requires two quarters of supervised, independent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H190A-B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology H190W). CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates of the School of Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job \u00b7market. The School pro\u00ad vides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in plan\u00ad ning departments, rriental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management. The School also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administra\u00ad tion, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminol\u00ad ogy, and urban planning. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional information is available iii the Career Center section. FIELD STUDY An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social-environmental problems as they occur in community settings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the classroom; and to conduct naturalistic observations and investigations at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students have the opportunity to test their skills in the community, to evaluate procedures and problem-solv\u00ad ing strategies used in the work place, and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas and issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of prob\u00ad lem-oriented institutions and agencies in both the private and the public sector (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office; Irvine UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Medical Center; California Coastal Commission; American Red Cross; primary and secondary schools; Fairview Development Cen\u00ad ter; planning, legal, and design corporations). Students must select a placement site from those listed and approved by the School of Social Ecology. Unlisted or inappropriate placements, as well as those that could give the appearance of nepotism or preferential treatment, will not be approved. Departmental approval for field study will be determined by the Field Study Coordinator. Field study is open only to upper-division School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy students who are in good academic standing and have com\u00ad pleted all prerequisite course work. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass grading basis. Further information, including field study sign-up procedures and prerequisites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. Planning a Program of Study Because there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with the Undergraduate Counseling Office, 102 Social Ecology Building I, to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the majors in the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy in their freshman year might begin by taking the introductory courses required by their major. It is a good idea to take these courses early because they include fundamental concepts that are widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (cat\u00ad egory I) should be completed during the first year. In the sopho\u00ad more year, the student might complete three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in their major, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, statistics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the stu\u00ad dent should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation.

Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology 102 Social Ecology I; (949) 824-6861 101 Biological Sciences Administration; (949) 824-5318 The School of Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences offer a B.S. degree program in Applied Ecology. The inter\u00ad disciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate founda\u00ad tion in human-environment interactions, and develops skills in resource quality and management, molecular and genetic method\u00ad ology for environmental protection, and field sampling techniques for data collection. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisci\u00ad plinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. Transfer Applicants: See page 41. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office or the Biological Social Ecology 373 Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. CAREERS IN APPLIED ECOLOGY Careers in the fields of environmental and resource management and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology back\u00ad ground. Many graduates hold technical or administrative positions in, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Depart\u00ad ment of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for graduate or profes\u00ad sional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiology, public health, law, medicine, dentistry, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a comprehen\u00ad sive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with related inter\u00ad ests should explore other environmental program options within The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Biological Sciences. REQUIREMENTS FORTHE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN APPLIED ECOLOGY University Requirements: See pages 54-59. Requirements for the Major General: Economics 1; Inform!ltion and Computer Science lOA, Biological Sciences 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, lOOL, 107, 108 or 109, and 194S; Environmental Analysis and Design E5; three courses from E103, EllO, E160, E168, and Bio\u00ad Sciences and Design E180 and E180L. Laboratory Courses: Two courses E166L. Research or Field Study: Either eight units of Biological Sciences 199, Environmental Analysis and Design E196, or Social Ecology 199 (research), or Social Ecology 194 plus four units of Social Ecology 195 (field study). Applied Ecology Elective Areas: A minimum of three courses selected from the following list. At least two of the three courses must be from the same category. Students should note that some courses have prerequisites. Environmental Analysis and Design E103, EllO,E160, and Biological Sciences 179 may be used to fulfill the General Requirement or the Applied Ecology Elective Area but may not be used to fulfill both requirements. Environmental Biotechnology: Biological Sciences 122, 123, 124, 129, 137A, 137B, 189; Environmental Analysis and Design E105U, Environmental Health Science: Biological Social Ecology Resource Management-Terrestrial Environments: Biological Sci\u00ad ences 174, 175, Management: Biological Sciences 122, 178, 179, 189; Environmental LAW AND SOCIETY Valerie Jenness, Department Chair The Department of Criminology, Law and Society focuses, first, on the manifestations of criminal behavior and the methods for con\u00ad trolling that behavior, and second, on the relationships and interac\u00ad tions between social processes and legal systems. Basic courses present overviews of American legal systems with particular emphasis on criminal and juvenile justice, the forms of criminal behavior, the role of law in understanding social and psychological phenomena, and the applications of sociological theory in under\u00ad standing law and legal systems. Subsequent course work provides understanding of the theoretical structures used to explain criminal behavior, the effects of crimes from the perspectives of victims, the operations of systems of justice and their underlying institutions, the goals of governmental regulation and the methods used to achieve those goals, and more advanced issues in the interactions of law and such fields as psychology, sociology, and planning. In addition, substantive areas of law, such as criminal, environmental, and family law, are introduced. The Department offers a B.A. degree program in Criminology, Law and Society~ Students are provided with opportunities to become acquainted with the varieties of behavior that society chooses to control or regulate, the methods and institutions used to achieve that control or regulation, and the approaches aimed specifically at altering unacceptable behavior. In addition, there is provision for students to use their increasing knowledge of the law, its procedures, and institutions to enhance their understanding of the social sciences. The course of study provides excellent preparation for law school and for graduate study in sociology, criminology, and criminal jus\u00ad tice. Careers for students who terminate their University education at the baccalaureate level may be developed through placements in criminal justice and regulatory agencies, in organizations determin\u00ad ing public policy, and in programs that deliver services to people who have difficulties with some aspect of the legal system. Students are strongly encouraged to select electives in a variety of departments. Courses in areas such as Psychology, Sociology, Eco\u00ad nomics, and Political Science can provide a further context for the understanding of crime, law, and criminal justice, while courses in areas such as art history, theater, and music can enhance the quality of the student's entire life. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the State juvenile detention sys\u00ad tem, the Orange County Victim/Witness Assistance Program, juve\u00ad nile shelters, legislative offices, and in private legal firms.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING, POLICY, AND DESIGN World Wide Web: http://www.seweb.uci.edu/urp Marlon G. Boarnet, Department Chair The Department of Planning, Policy, and Design utilizes an inter\u00ad disciplinary approach to the study of urban and regional planning, public policy issues, and the built environment. The Department faculty devote their scholarly and teaching efforts to theory-driven and empirically oriented urban research and their interests include urban and community development, environmental policy, health promotion and policy, and urban design and behavior. The faculty focus on educating persons interested in urban, social, public pol\u00ad icy, and environmental problems. The Department offers the Ph.D. degree in Planning, Policy, and Design; the Master of Urban and Regional Planning professional degree (fully accredited by the national Planning Accreditation Board); and an undergraduate minor in Urban and Regional Plan\u00ad ning within the Environmental Analysis and Design program. The Department's graduate degree programs feature small class sizes, innovative teaching often involving students in community pro\u00ad jects, and a significant degree of accessibility by students to faculty members. The 17 full-time faculty members in the Department are productive and influential scholars. The Department's teaching, research, and graduate training utilize UCI's proximity to both urban centers and planned communities, as well as the University's location within the dynamic and multicultural Southern California and Pacific Rim regions. Collaborative academic and research ties are maintained UC IRVINE - 2003-2004386 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Ecology with UCI's Institute of Transportation Studies, Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies, Newkirk Center for Science and Soci\u00ad ety, Focused Research Group on International Environmental Pol\u00ad icy, Center for Community Health, and the Urban Water Research Center. The common mission linking the Department's undergraduate, master's, and doctorate-level instruction and faculty research efforts is to bring applied research to the cause of bettering individ\u00ad uals, neighborhoods, communities, and regions. Southern Califor\u00ad nia has grown dramatically over the past four decades and will soon become the nation's largest urban corridor. The challenges to maintain the quality of life, provide employment opportunities, and reduce the deep socioeconomic disparities of this bi-national and multicultural metropolitan region are enormous; Extremely diverse, multiethnic communities face the necessity of solving their prob\u00ad lems in ways that are acceptable to their populations. Older central city areas that are vital to the region face issues of social and eco\u00ad nomic sustainability. The need to create employment opportunities, through the application of new technologies in industries and ser\u00ad vices, will be a constant feature of an urban region undergoing such population increases. At the same time, urban growth and transportation will have to meet increasingly ~tringent environmen\u00ad tal regulations that can safeguard the population's health and qualc ity of the natural environment. The urban design and landscape .of most communities stand to be reshaped as never before, as the building stock ages and the need to redevelop intensifies. Faculty members are grouped into four major clusters, each addressing sets of important issues to contemporary society. Fac\u00ad ulty members who study urban and community development examine contemporary planning approaches to managing local, community, and regional development and explore the spatial dynamics of urbanization in diverse settings and how public policy can guide urban and regional growth to balance environmental and economic concerns. Faculty members engaged in design-behavior research investigate the interrelationships of people and their socio-physical environments at all scales, from micro to macro, with emphasis on urban design and community-scale issues. Those scholars who examine environmental policy focus on the environ~ ment and natural resources as important policy and planning issues and provide a clear understanding about how politics, economics, ethics, and institutions affect planning and policy choices. Finally, faculty members who study health promotion and policy investi\u00ad gate issues at the interface between ( 1) urban planning and policy and (2) community and individual health. They examine the public welfare, psychological, and health implications of social and physi\u00ad cal planning, and the techniques arid goals of public health policy making. Ph.D. in Planning, Policy, and Design: See page 390. Master of U~:ban and Regional Planning: See page 387. Urban and Regional Planning Minor Requirements Nine courses (36 units): EnvironmentaJ Analysis and Design E8, E107U, and seven additional upper-division Environmental Analy\u00ad available in the Department of Environ- mental Analysis and Design section. \u00b7 \u00b7 NOTE: A maximum of three courses may be counted toward both the minor in Urban and Regional Planning and the majors in Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design or Social Ecology. (Environmental Analysis arid Design E8 is by necessity one of the three.) GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate training in the School of Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in .the social and phys\u00ad ical environment. Emphasis is placed primarily upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Prob\u00ad lems are investigated from the complementary perspectives of a multidisciplinary faculty' that includes specialists in social, devel\u00ad opmental, clinical, environmental, and health psychology; urban and regional planning and architecture; urban sociology; law; crim- inology; and environmental health. \u00b7 Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society,\u00b7 social influences on health and human develop\u00ad ment over the life course, and the effects of the physical environ\u00ad ment on health and human behavior. The graduate curriculum emphasizes an interdisciplinary orientation, training students to draw upon the knowledge offered by several of the traditional aca\u00ad demic fields in order to examine important social, legal, and envi\u00ad ronmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. The School offers M.A., M.S., M.U.R.P., and Ph.D. degree pro\u00ad grams. Doctoral students have the opportunity to pursue an individ\u00ad ualized course of study in the principles and methods of social \u00b7 ecology for the Ph.D. in Social Ecology, or a specialized course of study for the Ph.D. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design. Additional degree programs offered are: Ph.D. in Criminology, Law and Society; Ph.D. in Envi\u00ad ronmental Health Science and Policy; Ph.D. in Planning, Policy, and Design; and Ph.D. in Psychology and Social Behavior. Mas\u00ad ter's degree students may elect to pursue the M.A. in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy, the M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demo\u00ad graphic and Social Analysis, the M.A.S. in Criminology, Law and Society, the M.S. in Environmental Health Science and Policy, or the Master of Urban and Regional Planning. In addition, many stu\u00ad dents in the Ph.D. programs in Criminology, Law and Society and in Psychology and Social Behavior obtain an M.A. in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy on the way to their Ph.D. Social Ecology faculty members apply diverse methods of scien\u00ad tific inquiry to social and environmental problems. Evaluation research, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental tech\u00ad niques receive emphasis along with laboratory experimentation. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important com\u00ad ponent of graduate education in the School.

Master's Programs M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY At the graduate level, the emphasis in the School of Social Ecology is on the Ph.D. program, with the exception of the M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis; the M.A.S. in Criminology, Law and Society; the M.S. in Environ\u00ad mental Health Science and Policy; and the Master of Urban a:nd Regional Planning. In very rare circumstances a student may be admitted directly to the M.A. degree program in Social Ecology. Students interested in this option only must call the Social Ecol\u00ad ogy Graduate Office at (949) 824-5917 before submitting their applications. Master's degree students are assigned a faculty advisor withwhom the student discusses an individual program of education. The pro\u00ad gram leading to the M.A. degree in Social Ecology requires a the\u00ad sis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (Social Ecology 298, 299, or 295). A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for. the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee is appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by afaculty committee. \u00b7 M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRA\u00ad TION IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS The M.A. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers training in the practical research skills needed to address analytical problems confronting society, busi\u00ad ness, government, and the nonprofit sector. The concentration emphasizes the Pacific Rim and issues defining Southern Califor\u00ad nia's population, such as immigration, changing household and family structure, racial and economic inequalities, and the impact of local and regional population growth. Informed by the interdis\u00ad ciplinary field of demography, the program draws on faculty and courses in the Schools of Social Ecology and Social Sciences. Social Ecology 387 The concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis offers the option of additional professional certification for doctoral students already admitted to the School of Social Ecology. Admission, core course, and thesis requirements are identical to those for the gen\u00ad eral M.A. in Social Ecology. In addition, students must complete 12 units of designated electives in population issues or research methods. Up to two upper-division undergraduate courses may be approved to fulfill the elective requirement. Students interested in this concentration should call the Graduate Counseling Office at (949) 824-5924 for more information. M.A.S. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The Master of Advanced Study (M.A.S.) in Criminology, Law and Society, the first online program of its kind in the University of California system, prepares professionals for leadership positions in the criminal justice and legal communities. The curriculum emphasizes theoretical and practical applications on topics that are central to crime and its control, social policy, and the law. In keep\u00ad ing with one of the main tenets of the School of Social Ecology, faculty and students approach topics from a multidisciplinary perspective. This program is ideally suited for professionals interested or work\u00ad ing in the criminal justice or legal fields who are seeking a gradu\u00ad ate degree for career advancement. The program consists of 52 units of course work completed over a two-year period (six quar\u00ad ters) plus a one-week in-residence requirement during the first summer. In lieu of a thesis, students are required to take a capstone course in the winter quarter of the second year of study. A degree is awarded upon completion of 10 required courses, plus three elective courses. One traditional face-to-face course taken on the UCI campus, in an accelerated format (five days), is required at the beginning of a student's course of study. M.S. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY The Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) trains environmental professionals for applied ana\u00ad lytical and administrative positions in environmental businesses, government, and the nonprofit sector. In common with the doctoral program in EHSP, training focuses on the integration of natural and social science knowledge for the promotion of human health within a sustainable ecosystem. M.S. students must complete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, Ill; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analy\u00ad sis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252); and three electives. Students must also complete a field study of about six months in duration, resulting in a defended Master's thesis and degree completion within two to three years. MASTER OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING The Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) program trains researchers and professionals in contemporary methods of planning and policy analysis. The program is fully accredited by the national Planning Accreditation Board and has 16 core full\u00ad time faculty. Students gain familiarity with planning problems and practices through a series of courses on the growth and develop~ ment of metropolitan areas, and the environmental, economic, and social challenges that modem communities face. This program views planners as mediators between the market-driven forces of metropolitan change and the environmental, economic, and social impacts of such change. The M.U.R.P. degree program-Master of Urban and Regional Planning-requires the completion of 72 units, distributed be.iween core and elective courses. Required courses are History of Urban UC IRVINE - 2003-2004388 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Ecology Planning (U202), Theoretical Foundations of Planning (U203), Microeconomics Analysis for Urban Planning (U206), Quantitative Analysis for Planners (U214), Development Control Law and ~ol\u00ad icy or Environmental Law and Policy (U207 or U252), Analytical Methods for Planning (U215), Regional Analysis or Housing or Demographics for Planners (U223 or U246 or U275), and two quarters of Urban Planning Studio (U280A-B). Master's.degre7 specializations include community development and social policy, economics and public policy, land use policy, environmental policy and planning, transportation policy, community health planning, and urban design and behavior. In addition, a written comprehen\u00ad sive examination or a professional report is required during the last quarter of residency in the program. Successful completion of the examination or professional report is required before the degree can be awarded. A thesis is not required. Some of the specific planning issues addressed include the envi\u00ad ronmental, social, health, and economic impacts of urban and regional development; regional growth management; state a?d municipal fiscal policy; poverty-related concerns; urban design; the operation housing markets; land-use law and regula\u00ad tion; transportation planning; and planning for urban development in newly industrialized countries. Students are provided not only with a rigorous foundation in the tools that public and private sec\u00ad tor planners use, but also with the intellectual wherewithal to use them effectively in addressing these concerns. Practical experience in community planning in the form of part\u00ad time planning internships is strongly encouraged and supported as part of a student's education. Additionally, a two-quarter Planning Studio in the second year of study links classroom learning to work on a community-based and client-based planning project. Students have access to drafting stations and computers for use in planning studies, geographic information systems (ARC-VIEW) courses, and research. Students also have full access to computer laboratories in the two Social Ecology buildings which are equipped with word processing, statistical, spreadsheet, and data\u00ad base programs; electronic mail, and World Wide Web browsers. The range of employment opportunities for professional planners in the public and private sectors is expanding due to rapid metro\u00ad politan growth, rising concerns over health and environmental issues, and the continuing need for redevelopment and social ser\u00ad vices in older communities. Career paths exist in government agen\u00ad cies dealing with urban planning, economic development, trans\u00ad portation planning, regional growth management, air quality and water treatment, public utilities, health care organizations and public hc::alth agencies, and conservation organizations and agen\u00ad cies. Many employment possibilities also exist with private con\u00ad sulting firms specializing in environmental impact assessment, with residential and commercial development firms, and many engineer\u00ad ing and architectural firms. Ph.D. Programs The doctoral programs offered by the School of Social Ecology prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching. Graduates also are well qualified for employment in private or gov\u00ad ernment agencies, where they can bring advanced academic train\u00ad ing, strong methodological and statistical skills, and special exper\u00ad tise to such issues as environmental health and design, urban and regional planning, criminal justice, and social policies affecting mental and physical health across the life course. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. in four to five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to dis\u00ad cuss an individualized program of graduate education. The follow\u00ad ing core courses are required of all Ph.D. students except those enrolled in the Environmental Health Science and Policy doctoral program and the Planning, Policy, and Design doctoral program: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Meth\u00ad ods (Social Ecology 201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, and one additional approved research methods course. In addition to these five required core courses, doctoral students take additional required and elective courses, as summarized in subsequent sections that describe the individual Ph.D. programs. This additional course work is exclusive of any field study, . directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (Social Ecology 297, 298, 299, or 296). School faculty believe that Ph.D. students should become involved in research very early in their graduate careers. To encourage such involvement, doctoral students are encouraged to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The method of research may include experiments, ques\u00ad tionnaire and interview studies, systematic field observation, sec\u00ad ondary analysis, computer simulations, legal research, and other methods. It is expected that students will begin their project during the first year in residence and will complete it during the second year. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree when all requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the School of Social Ecology, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thor\u00ad ough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation, its current status, the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge, a detailed specification of the pro\u00ad posed method of investigating the problem, and a description of the planned methods for analyzing the data collected. It is strongly recommended that students advance to candidacy during their third year of study. In no case will students be allowed to advance to candidacy after the end of their fifth year of study. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree will be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alter\u00ad natively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral com\u00ad mittee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doc\u00ad toral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years; and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy. All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by members of the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D. degree, complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the School. Evaluation of Ph.D. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibil\u00ad ity of the student's doctoral dissertation committee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D. degree, each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Ph.D. program in Social Ecology allows students to develop a tailored course of graduate study that draws upon the knowledge of several traditional academic disciplines. This is a small distin\u00ad guished program intended for genuinely interdisciplinary doctoral students. The emphases of this training program are in keeping with the academic mission of the School, namely, its emphases on UC IRVINE - 2003-2004an ecological approach to research and policy, an interdisciplinary approach to research and community intervention, and the applica\u00ad tion of theory and research to community problem solving. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to integrate the diverse theoretical and methodological insights of several disciplines in order to analyze important social and environmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. In doing so, students gain familiarity with the classic and contemporary literature in social ecology and with the application of the ecological paradigm, as it has evolved in the natural and behavioral sciences. This program is ideally suited for independent students who wish to develop a unique interdepart\u00ad mental program of study in consultation with faculty from several departments. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted above, and six elective courses, chosen in consultation with the faculty advisor. The normative time for com\u00ad pletion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are encouraged to become involved in research in their first year of study by participating in the research projects of the faculty. Stu\u00ad dents complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. Research is broadly construed to include experimental methods, questionnaire and interview stud\u00ad ies, systematic field observation, secondary analyses, and legal analyses. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence and must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students complete the breadth requirement during their third year of study. This is accomplished through successful completion of either a written comprehensive examination or the submission of a major paper or series of papers that intensively examine specific substantive problems and bodies of research. Preferably, the per\u00ad spective taken should be multidisciplinary, but a single disciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecol\u00ad ogy faculty members. Students are encouraged to meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and imple\u00ad mented, the examining committee will determine whether the breadth requirement was successfully completed, and will recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN The doctoral concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design prepares students to conduct research on questions of vital impor\u00ad tance to professionals in environmental analysis and evaluation, in environmental design and behavior, and on related questions ()n the formulation of environmental and health policy. These questions reflect an overarching concern with the effects of the natural and built environments on the health and social well-being of humans. This doctoral concentration particularly focuses on insights from a social ecological perspective. One of the concentration's strengths is its research sequence which spans the discl.plines within the Department of Environmental Analysis and Design and the Depart\u00ad ment of Planning, Policy, and Design. Students typically choose the majority of their graduate classes from those two departments, although students are encouraged to take classes across the campus to improve their knowledge of related fields as well. Social Ecology 389 Students conduct analyses of sociocultural, behavioral, biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence health and well-being of humans, including public and private sector policy as well as the environment as a whole. They are also trained to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance the health of individuals and the community as a whole. The curriculum and diversity of faculty within the concentration afford unique opportu\u00ad nities for multidisciplinary research and training. Potential employment sources for graduates include academic and research institutions; state and federal agencies; policy-making organizations; national, community, and workplace health-promo\u00ad tion programs; and a diverse range of consulting firms ranging from engineering to design. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted earlier, and eight elective courses drawn from the focal areas within this concentration: Environmental Analysis, Environmental Design and Behavior, Environmental Policy, Earth\u00ad quake Geology and Environmental Hazard, Social Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Health Promotion. The elective courses cover topics such as environmental and urban design, environmen\u00ad tal health risks, urban planning, behavioral epidemiology, demog\u00ad raphy, urban and regional analysis, technological hazards and change, international environmental policy, environmental psychol\u00ad ogy, and geographical information systems. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are expected to become involved in research activities in their first year of graduate study. Students complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence (preferably by the end of the winter quar\u00ad ter of the second year). The research project must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students com\u00ad plete the breadth requirement, described earlier, during their third year of study. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The study of crime, institutional responses to illegal behavior, and the interaction of Jaw and society are the foci of the doctoral pro\u00ad gram in Criminology, Law and Society. Students examine issues related to the etiology of crime, the process of changing criminal behavior, social regulation, the civil justice system, and the social and cultural context of law. Students gain familiarity with a number of subjects including sen\u00ad tencing; crime rates; modes of modifying criminal behavior; police behavior; white collar and organized crime; hate crimes; behavior of courts, juries, and regulatory agencies; environmental law; immigration law; Native American justice issues; and the interac\u00ad tion among law, culture, and identity. In general, students are intro\u00ad duced to the leading classical and contemporary issues in criminol\u00ad ogy, Jaw and society and to ways of understanding them through interdisciplinary research. The program aims to develop theoretical sophistication and to prepare the graduate student for faculty positions at major universities; and for research and administrative work in institutions in the legal system, the criminal justice system, and related organizations. In addition to the five core courses required of most Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents, noted earlier, students take at least four required courses, Crime and Public Policy (C230), Theories of Crime, (C235), Law and Society, (C239), Legal Reasoning, (C237), and three elective courses in Criminology, Law and Society. These elective courses should be chosen in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. Students become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and complete an independent, supervised research project during the second year of graduate study. Methods UC IRVINE - 2003-2004390 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Ecology of research may include questionnaires and surveys, systematic field observation, computer simulation, legal analyses, and archival research. Students complete a written comprehensive examination during year three, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of major theoretical, substantive, and methodological issues in crimi\u00ad nology, law and society. The fourth and, possibly, fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation pro\u00ad posal and completing dissertation research. Opportunities for field placements in legal and criminal justice settings also are available. Ph.D. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY Human health and the integrity of the natural environment are interdependent. More now than ever, challenges in public health and the environment must be faced using knowledge both from the social and the natural sciences. The graduate program in Environ\u00ad mental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) is rooted in existing dis\u00ad ciplines, but emphasizes cross-disciplinary research that is emerg\u00ad ing from common bases that span both the social and the natural sciences. To optimize flexibility, including options for primary emphasis on laboratory and field work, the curriculum is organized around four concentrations. The concentration in Environmental Biotechnology provides training in the use of microbial, genetic, or molecular applications for environmental monitoring, environ\u00ad mental cleanup, and public health prevention and diagnostics of environmental hazards. The concentration in Environmental Health Science expands the conventional focus of this discipline to approach research questions in an ecological context. The con\u00ad centration in Environmental Management and Policy explores the linkages between physical environmental problems and the social institutions that are both their cause and solution. The con\u00ad centration in Epidemiology and Public Health embeds tradi\u00ad tional approaches in these fields within a framework of physical, natural, and social systems. Within each concentration, students are expected to develop inter\u00ad ests in particular substantive problems, for example, those of the core faculty, including water quality monitoring and bioremedia\u00ad tion, toxic metals in the environment (their characterizations, expo\u00ad sure levels, and health effects), international conflict and coopera\u00ad tion in resource management, habitat restoration and conservation biology, epidemiology of environmental cancers as well as of vio\u00ad lence and injury-prevention. Students are prepared to become active researchers, able to assume positions in higher education, government, commerce, or the nonprofit sector-wherever environ\u00ad mental quality is of concern. Students must elect one of the four EHSP concentrations within their first year. For all concentrations, students must complete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analy\u00ad sis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252). In addition, students must complete six approved electives relating to their respective concentrations. Consistent with the program's multidisciplinary nature, elective courses may be drawn not only from within the Department of Environmental Analysis and Design but (with approval) from throughout the School of Social Ecology and the campus (including, for example, the College of Medicine, Schools of Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering). After the second year, students must submit a written doctoral research proposal. Advancement to doc\u00ad toral candidacy is achieved upon successful defense of the proposal during an oral, comprehensive qualifying examination. Degree completion should occur in four or five years. In addition, doctoral students must serve a minimum of three quarters as a teaching assistant. Ph.D. IN PLANNING, POLICY, AND DESIGN The Planning, Policy, and Design doctorate program trains scholars to have national and international prominence in the analysis of social problems related to the built and natural environments. Fac\u00ad ulty strengths span planning, policy, and design, and faculty are at the cutting edge of teaching and research that examines the inter\u00ad play of these three currently distinct approaches. There is a growing recognition that many pressing social problems require perspectives that combine an understanding of planning, policy process, and the environment. For example, efforts to con\u00ad trol transportation problems by building neighborhoods that encourage alternatives to the automobile require an understanding of travel behavior and human interactions with the built environ\u00ad ment. Understanding how to reduce tobacco use requires an appre\u00ad ciation of how behavior is shaped by programmatic interventions, community settings and norms, and policy tools. Environmental cooperation across national borders often requires understanding of political processes, infrastructure systems, and metropolitan struc\u00ad ture and governance in regions, such as the U.S.-Mexico border, where population is concentrated in urban settlements that span the border. And, issues of public safety are increasingly related to the design of public and private spaces, and how those spaces are used and regulated. In all of these areas, public and private officials are increasingly working on topics that span the boundaries of several traditional academic disciplines. The PPD program is designed to give stu\u00ad dents a strong background in one of four specializations and thus to produce scholars and practitioners capable of responding to the complexity of problems facing contemporary society. The PPD program offers four specializations-urban and commu\u00ad nity development, design-behavior research, environmental policy, and health promotion and policy. Urban and Community Devel\u00ad opment examines contemporary planning approaches to managing local, community, and regional development. Students explore the spatial dynamics of urbanization in diverse settings and how public policy can guide urban and regional growth to balance environ\u00ad mental and economic concerns. Design-Behavior Research inves\u00ad tigates the inter-relationships of people and their socio-physical environments at all scales, from micro to macro, with emphasis on urban design and community-scale issues. The School of Social Ecology is an international leader in Design-Behavior research since the field's earliest developments. Environmental Policy focuses on the environment and natural resources as important pol\u00ad icy and planning issues. A clear understanding about how politics, economics, ethics, and institutions affect planning and policy choices is the emphasis of this specialization. The School has among the largest concentrations of environmental policy faculty of any planning department in the United States. Health Promo-. tion and Policy focuses on the interface between planning and community and individual health, examining the public welfare, psychological, and health implications of social and physical plan\u00ad ning; and the techniques and goals of public health policy making. The Ph.D. curriculum is composed of three parts: (1) Planning, Policy, and Design core (required of all students); (2) area cores (each student affiliates with one of four areas of specialization and is required to complete the core courses for that area); and (3) elec\u00ad tives. All doctoral students take a total of 16 four-unit graduate courses, distributed across these three types of courses. Required courses in the Planning, Poiicy, and Design core are Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200); Research Design (Social Ecology 201); two courses in research methods/data analy\u00ad sis chosen from among the following: Data Analysis A (Social Ecology 264A), Data Analysis B (Social Ecology 264B), and Qualitative Research Methods (Social Ecology U209); and two UC IRVINE - 2003-2004courses selected in consultation with a faculty advisor that provide . disciplinary/theoretical orientation. In total, PPD students complete 84 units of study in their first two years (64 units of seminar classes, six units of Planning, Policy, and Design Seminar, six units of area seminar, and eight units of Independent Study.) Participation in a faculty-supervised research project is required during the second year of study. The third year includes preparation for, and completion of, a comprehensive examination. Following this, dissertation proposals and research begin. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. in Planning, Policy, and Design is five years. Graduates with a doctorate degree in Planning, Policy, and Design are employed in a wide array of activities, ranging from university teaching and research, to administrative and research-.oriented posi\u00ad tions in governmental agencies, international organizations, non\u00ad profit organizations, and private consulting practices. Ph.D. IN PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR The Department of Psychology and Social Behavior offers a Ph.D. program in Psychology and Social Behavior. The main goal of this program is to train behavioral scientists to apply theory and meth\u00ad ods in psychology, together with perspectives and knowledge from allied disciplines, to the analysis of human behavior and health across the life span and in diverse sociocultural contexts. This pro\u00ad gram values both basic and applied research that is relevant to the improvement of individual, community, ai::td societal functioning. A particular emphasis is placed on the integration of knowledge from several subspecialties in psychology in order to understand the \u00b7 antecedents and developmental course of adaptive or maladaptive behavior, and to conduct research that has implications for social policies, programs, and interventions. Training in this program emphasizes four core areas of psychology. The specialization in Developmental Psychology focuses on the development of individuals at various periods in the life course and the effects of the varying social and cultural contexts on cognitive, social, and health outcomes. Health Psychology focuses on identi\u00ad fying, evaluating, and enhancing the psychosocial and behavioral factors that promote mental and physical health, prevent disease, and optimize medical treatments. The specialization in Psycho\u00ad pathology and Behavioral Disorder focuses on psychological, biobehavioral, and socjal environmental mechanisms that influence the development, expression, and amelioration of psychopathology and behavioral disorder. Social and Personality Psychology focuses on the effects of social and personality variables on indi\u00ad vidual behavior, attitudes, perceptions, motives, and intergroup relations. In addition, several faculty are doing research in the area of psychology and law. Students will learn to understand human behavior from a social ecological, contextual perspective. They will be exposed to the major theories in each specialization and learn various social sci\u00ad ence research methods. An important feature of the curriculum is a two-course sequence on the application of psychology research to social needs and problems, Applied Psychological Research (P209A) and Applied Psychological Research in Community Set\u00ad tings (P209B). In the first course, students learn about non-acade\u00ad mic venues for their research skills and consider significant intel\u00ad lectual issues, including the ethics of research and practice. In the second (optional) course, students may take a supervised internship position in a non-academic setting. All students are encouraged to become actively involved in research from the earliest stage of their training. Through close association with faculty members and participation in the faculty's research Social Ecology 391 projects, students learn to conduct methodologically sophisticated research that addresses contemporary psychological and social issues. Current research teams are investigating stress, coping, and social support; biobehavioral mechanisms of cardiovascular reac\u00ad tivity; personality factors that increase resilience to health threats; child care and its effects on child development; transitions across the life course; the effects. of divorce and custody arrangement; adaptive aging; end-of-life medical decision making; culture and adolescent psychosocial development; culture, self, and well-being; relations between cognitive and emotional development; emotion \u00b7 regulation; memory and eyewitness testimony; violence and anger management; the development of health behavior during childhood and adolescence; economic stress and psychopathology/behavioral disorders; and assessment of and responses to environmental and health risks. Students take five core courses required of most Ph.D. students in the School of Social Ecology (as noted in a previous section) and Applied Psychological Research (P209). Additional courses are required for each specialization: Health Psychology (P258) and Biobehavioral Bases of Health and Illness (P273) for the Health Psychology specialization; Social Psychology (P214) and Personal\u00ad ity (P233) for the Social and Personality Psychology specialization; Psychopathology and Behavioral Disorder (P239) and Ecological Context of Behavioral Disorder (P243) for the Psychopathology and Behavioral Disorder specialization; and, for each of these spe\u00ad cializations, two elective courses from a specified list .. The Devel\u00ad opmental Psychology specialization requires the Developmental Psychology course (P220) plus three elective courses from a speci\u00ad fied list. Finally, all students are required to select a minor specialization and complete one required specialization course and two elective courses in this area.

The classic subject areas of anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are in\u00ad cluded in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following emphases. First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behav\u00ad ior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics ori\u00ad ented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refine\u00ad ment of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modem social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross ortho\u00ad dox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cognitive anthropology, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are bUilt around these interdisciplinary social sci\u00ad ence phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School emphasizes the design of hypotheses and of sys\u00ad tems of interrelated ideas as an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the develop\u00ad ment of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Educational opportunities for students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members or may investigate social science applications via off-campus internships. They are invited to participate in the quar\u00ad terly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School commit\u00ad tees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-stu\u00ad dent interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory, used for both faculty and student research, occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms and several specialized facilities including a vir\u00ad tual reality facility and infant cognition laboratory. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in chi!\u00ad dren and how they learn. Undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. Three Computer Laboratories provide access to networked IBM\u00ad compatible systems, where students can work on assignments using full-featured word-processing, database, graphics, and statistical UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 402 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Sciences packages. In addition, these computers provide students with access to e-mail, Internet services, and the World Wide Web. The new Social Science Plaza facility contains state-of-the-art, high\u00ad tech lecture halls and is fully Internet accessible. The Social Sciences Academic Resource Center (SSARC) pro\u00ad vides personal assistance to all Social Sciences students on finding research opportunities, off-campus internships, and graduate and professional programs. The Center maintains a library -of graduate school catalogues, Statement of Purpose tips and handouts, and GRE, GMAT, LSAT, and CBEST registration booklets and test preparation information. In addition, it offers a database of commu\u00ad nity and professional internships for students to attain hands-on experience in their field of study. SSARC is fully staffed and pro\u00ad vides Internet access to students, disseminates information on schol\u00ad arships, and conducts workshops on graduate school and other related post-baccalaureate opportunities. A Recommendation Coor\u00ad dination Service for obtaining letters of recommendation is available t6 School majors. The service provides assistance for students apply\u00ad ing to graduate and professional programs. The Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) continues the work of the UCI Focused Research Program on Democratization that was founded in 1991 and sponsors research and training on.the process of democratic transition and the expansion of the. democratic process in already established democracies. CSD includes a multidisciplinary faculty from four UC campuses. CSD's activities are focused on three areas. First, faculty administer a graduate training program on empirical democratic theory. The National Science Foundation selected UCI in 1995 as a national cen\u00ad ter for the training of doctoral students in democratization issues; the five-year NSF grant provides funding for graduate fellowships and other training activities. Second, the Democracy research program aims at improving the democratic process in the United States and other established democracies as we enter the next century. The program focuses on reforms to increase the ability of citizens to express their preferences and have these preferences represented within the democratic process. Third, CSD supports research on the development of sustainable democracies in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and other new democra\u00ad cies. The New Democracies Initiative contributes to the promotion of democracy in these formerly authoritarian systems. For more information visit the Center for the Study of Democracy's Web site at http://www.democ.uci.edu/democ. Visiting Distinguished Professorships The School sponsors a program of Visiting Distinguished Professor\u00ad ships that exposes students to seminal thinkers in the social sciences. The professorships normally are of a quarter's duration. Participants have included Martin Bronfenbrenner, Professor of Economics (Duke University) and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (University of Michigan), President of the American Political Science Association, imd member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sci\u00ad ences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology and Education Emeritus, Graduate School of Education (Harvard University), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whit\u00ad ing, Professor of Social Anthropology (Harvard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; James Coleman, Professor of Sociology (University of Chicago) and mem\u00ad ber of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Acad\u00ad emy of Arts and Sciences; and Robin M.

Of the \u00b7graduating seniors, no more than 12 percent will receive honors: approximately 1 percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. The selection for these awards is based on winter quarter rank\u00ad ordered grade point averages. To be eligible for honors at gradua\u00ad tion, the student must, by the end of winter quarter of the senior year, have submitted an Application for Graduation; be officially declared a Social Sciences major; have completed at least 72 units while in residence at a UC campus;.have all corrections to the aca\u00ad demic record processed by the Registrar's Office; if completing the Language Other Than English breadth requirement with a language exemption test, pass the test by the end of winter quarter; and be able to verify completion of all course work by the end of the spring quarter of the senior year. Other factors are also considered (see page 51). Dean's Honor List. The quarterly Dean's Honor List is composed of students who have received a 3.5 grade point average while car\u00ad rying a minimum of 12 graded units. Departmental Honors Programs. Most depl\\11ments in the School of Social Sciences offer an Honors Program (refer to the depart\u00ad mental information). Upon successful completion of the Honors Program, students graduate with Honors in their respective majors and their transcripts note that they were in the Honors Program. Honor Societies. Several departments in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences belong to a national honor society. Eligibility is based on satisfying the requirements of the specific honor society. In the School of Social Sciences, these national honor societies include: Lambda Alpha Kappa (Anthropology), Omicron Delta Epsilon (Economics), Pi Omicron of Pi Sigma Alpha (Political Science), Psi Chi (Psychology), Pi Gamma Mu (International Studies and Social Science), arid Alpha Kappa Delta (Sociology). Order of Merit. The Dean of the School of Social Sciences' Order of Merit award recognizes the most outstanding graduating undergraduates and graduate students for their academic achieve\u00ad ments, contributions to the School, and service to the campus and community.

Williams Award. This award is given to an undergradu\u00ad ate student and a graduate student for the best research paper in the field of sociology. Undergraduate Program PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the School of Social Sciences Under\u00ad graduate Counseling Office to design an appropriate program of study. Students who select one of the School majors in.their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study \u00b7through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Social Sciences 403 Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, major and school requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathe\u00ad matics, computer technology, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematiCs and computer courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in Psychology and Anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or 21, or Social Science 3A, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-divi\u00ad sion courses rriust be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Mathematics and Social Sciences The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modem social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocab\u00ad ulary. Basic knowledge Of these tools is necessary to an under\u00ad standing of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, how\u00ad ever, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should con\u00ad sult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statisti\u00ad cal tools underlying modem social sciences. This requirement is met by passing a three-course sequence in mathematics (Anthropology IOA-B-C, Economics lOA-B, 30, Mathematics 2A-B, 7, Psychology lOA-B-C, Social Science lOA-B-C, Social Science lOOA-B-C, or Sociology lOA-B-C). (NOTE: School of Social Scien\u00b7ces majors may not take Social Science 9A-B-C to fulfill the mathematics requirement.) Computer education is essential for a complete social science education. This require\u00ad ment can be satisfied by passing Information and Computer Science lOA, lOB, or 21, or Social Science 3A. Departments may have preferences for specific courses. See your major department for acceptable courses. This course requirement should be taken during the student's first year. B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing two four-unit introductory courses in the School of Social Sciences bearing a orie-digit course number. (Such courses include Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D; Economics 1; Linguis\u00ad SA, 5B, 5C, 5D; Sociology 1.) These courses normally should be taken during the student's first year. C. An understanding of important advanced areas in social science. This requirement is met by passing satisfactorily nine four-unit UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 404 UCI 2003-Q4 School of Social Sciences upper-division courses in the School of Social Sciences, where at least three of these courses comprise core courses or a mod\u00ad ule. For modules which are listed with more than three courses, the student may normally elect to take any subset of three courses in the module. Appropriate substitutions may be made upon petition. D. Four additional four-unit social science courses from any level. Students are reminded that the Pass/Not Pass option is not applica\u00ad ble to course requirements A through D above or to any additional requirements listed for specific major programs. However, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science lOA, lOB, 21, and Social Science lOOA are exceptions to this rule and may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Courses used to meet requirements B through D above are included in fhe computation of the grade point average in courses required in the major program. Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing both a major and a minor within the School of Social Sciences may count courses taken to fulfill the School's mathematics and computer science requirement toward satisfaction of both the major and the minor. No other course overlap is allowed. TRANSFER STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS The School recommends that students wishing to transfer to UCI do the following: 1. Complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) prior to transfer to UCI. 2. Refer to http://www.assist.org/ for information about community college courses that will fulfill UCI lower-division major requirements. Specific course recommendations: Prospective Economics majors: complete a second semester of calculus (in addition to the courses required for transfer-student admission; see the Department of Economics section). Prospective International Studies majors: complete two semesters of foreign language at the intermediate level. Prospective Psychology majors: complete a three-course sequence in introductory, physiological, and either social or abnormal psychology. TRANSFER STUDENTS Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Following review by the School of SocialSciences, it may be determined that junior transfer students electing to major in one of the School's degree programs, who have good records at other accredited colleges and universities, have satisfied School requirement Band the University requirements. However, all transfer students must fulfill the upper-division writing breadth requirement (category I) while at UCI. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year should plan their curriculum so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirement .(School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in back- . ground, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two\u00ad year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satis\u00ad fied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. SERVICE LEARNING, COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND INTERNSHIPS Service learning is a meaningful activity that integrates service within the curriculum. It is an opportunity for students to make positive contributions to underserved and marginalized communi\u00ad ties through academic courses, field studies; and internships. Ser\u00ad vice learning provides out-of-class experiences to reinforce under\u00ad standing of academic theory while addressing serious community concerns. When combined with a structured curriculum having research components, students can explore the role of the social scientist and help seek solutions to problems affecting society. The School of Social Sciences' philosophy is to practice research, ser\u00ad vice, and good citizenship. The School actively supports service learning through its philoso\u00ad phy of enhancing the learning process by motivating, inspiring, and teaching students how to recognize and accept their civic responsi\u00ad bilities. The goal is to educate students about social issues and pro\u00ad vide them with the necessary tools to solve the difficult problems society faces. Under the guidance and supervision of faculty and staff, students are offered the opportunity to experience personal, professional, social, and intellectual growth through the following School of Social Sciences programs: public-and private-sector internships, community service, field studies, and the specialization in Public and Community Service within the major in Social Science. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN K-12 EDUCATION Undergraduate students who wish to pursue a career in the field of K-12 education are well-served in the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Education. The following interrelated pro\u00ad grams provide opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in this important area. Minor in Educational Studies The minor in Educational Studies allows students to explore a broad range of issues in the field of education and provides a strong foundation for K -12 teaching. Both introductory and advanced courses are included, giving students a solid preparation for later teacher credential programs and many related occupations. NOTE: A Statement of Intent is required of all students wishing to enroll in this minor. See the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for more information. Multiple Subject and Single Subject (Social Science) Preparation Course work in the Social Science major (Social Sciences for Sec\u00ad ondary School Education specialization) provides excellent prepa\u00ad ration for students wishing to obtain a multiple subject teaching credential. Students who take additional course work can satisfy the subject matter requirement for a single subject teaching creden\u00ad tial in social science. NOTE: Official enrollment in the single sub\u00ad ject program is required to satisfy this requirement. The Counsel\u00ad ing Office in 370D Social Science Tower can provide details. Department of Education Programs The Department of Education provides many other opportunities for prospective educators, including: a mentoring program which provides students with valuable experience while they work with credentialed teachers; UC Links, a program in which undergradu\u00ad ates tutor K-8 students in after-school settings; and advising ser\u00ad vices provided by counselors who assist students in planning future careers in education. Further information about these programs is UC IRVINE - 2003-2004available from the Department of Education counselors at 2001 Berkeley Place. Students interested in obtaining a teaching credential should see the Department of Education section of the Catalogue for information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for additional information. Campuswide Honors Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students from all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. For more information contact the Campus\u00ad wide Honors Program, 1200 Student Services II; telephone (949) 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu; World Wide Web: http://www. honors.uci.edu/. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. Additional information is avail\u00ad able in the Center for International Education section. Interdisciplinary Minors A variety of interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI stu\u00ad dents. The minor in Conflict Resolution, sponsored by the Interna\u00ad tional Studies program in the School of Social Sciences, provides skills in conflict analysis and resolution and a useful understanding of integrative institutions at the local, regional, and international levels. Information about the following minors is available in the Interdis\u00ad ciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The minor in Asian Studies creates opportunities for students to explore Asian topics in a variety of fields, to develop advanced lan\u00ad guage skills, and to acquire broader perspectives. The minor in Chicano/Latino Studies is designed to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of the language, history, culture, literature, sociology, anthropology, politics, social ecology, health, medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments in the Chicano/ Latino communities. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history, and is concerned with determining what science and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. The minor in Native American Studies focuses on history, culture, religion, and the environment. The three core courses serve as an introduction to the Native American experience from the perspective of different historical periods and frameworks of analysis. The minor in Religious Studies focuses on the comparative study of religions in various cultural settings around the world and seeks to provide a wide-ranging academic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society. Social Sciences 405 Information about the following interdisciplinary minors is avail\u00ad able in the School of Humanities section. The minor in African-American Studies offers undergraduate . students an opportunity to study those societies and 9ultures estab\u00ad lished by the people of the African diaspora and to investigate the African-American experience from a variety of disciplinary per\u00ad spectives and theoretical approaches. The minor in Asian American Studies examines the historical and contemporary experiences of Asians after their arrival in the United States and seeks to provide an awareness of the history, cul\u00ad ture (e.g., literary and creative art accomplishments), psychology, and social organization of Asian American communities. The minor in Latin American Studies is designed to develop in students an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of Latin Ameri\u00ad can issues in the areas of language, history, culture, literary studies, sociology, anthropology, political science, health, folk medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments. The minor in Women's Studies offers a curriculum drawing from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts to examine \u00b7contributions of women from different backgrounds to culture and society and to explore women's and men's lives in the context of changing gender relations. CAREERS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Business and industry often look to social science graduates to fill positions in management, finance, marketing and advertising, per\u00ad sonnel, production supervision, and general administration. In the public sector, a wide variety of opportunities are available in city, county, state, and federal government. Teaching is a frequently chosen career at all levels from elementary school teacher to pro\u00ad fessor. In addition, many graduates enter professional practice, becoming lawyers, psychologists, researchers, or consultants in various fields. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational pro\u00ad gram that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to under\u00ad stand quantitative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well-positioned for research and analysis careers at all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excellent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and pro\u00ad fessional programs. The UCI Career Center provides services to students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional\u00b7information is available in the Career Center section. Graduate Program The School of Social Sciences offers graduate training in the fol\u00ad lowing areas: Anthropology (Ph.D. in Anthropology), Cognitive Sciences (Ph.D. in Psychology), Economics (Ph.D. in Economics), Logic and Philosophy of Science (Ph.D. in Philosophy), Mathe\u00ad matical Behavioral Sciences (Ph.D. in Social Science), Politics and Society (Ph.D. in Political Science), and Sociology (Ph.D. in Soci\u00ad ology). (The Linguistics program is not admitting students at this time.) In addition, an interdisciplinary concentration in Public Choice is offered within the programs in Economics and Political Science, a specialized concentration in Transportation Economics is offered within the program in Economics, an emphasis in Social Networks is offered within the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences concentration, and a concentration in Political Psychology is offered within the program in Political Science. When an appli\u00ad cant's interests lie outside of or across these areas, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 406 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Sciences occasions, appoint a three-member faculty committee to guide an independent course of study for the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. The M.A. degree in Anthropology, Economics, Philosophy, Social Science, or Sociology may be conferred upon students in Ph.D. programs after. completion of the necessary requirements. Additionally, the M.A. degree program in Social Science with a concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis is supervised by faculty from the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecology. Students may apply directly to this M.A. program. The M.S. and Ph.D. degree program in Transportation Science is supervised by an interdepartmental faculty group: Information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, students enrolled in a School of Social Sciences graduate program may choose to pursue a teaching credential while working toward their degree. After completion of requirements for an M.A. degree, stu\u00ad dents may apply for admission into the credential program admin\u00ad istered by the Department of Education. As required by law, the applicant must pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), obtain a Certification of Clearance, and successfully complete the appropriate subject area examination or an approved subject-matter program. A detailed description of the program may be obtained from the Social Sciences Graduate Office or the Department of Education. ADMISSION Potential graduate students should apply by January 15 to receive fullest consideration for financial aid. Applicants should indicate the title of the degree sought (Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area of concentration (see above). All applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination General Test scores. Letters of rec\u00ad ommendation and the applicant's statement of interest are impor\u00ad tant factors in the admission decision. In addition to the University admission requirements described in the Research and Graduate Studies section, individual graduate programs may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants, subject to the approval ofthe Graduate Council. Such requirements are minimum standards only; successful applicants typically must exceed them by a substantial margin. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Many students receive financial support in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Before accepting an offer of admission with financial support for the first year, applicants should inquire about the likelihood of such support in future years: Occasionally, a newly admitted student may receive a multiyear commitment of some specified financial support, but this is not the rule. Students are also advised to seek aid from sources external to the University. (NOTE: Teaching assistantships do not include remission of fees or nonresident tuition.) LENGTH OF STUDY AND RESIDENCE Students who enter with normal academic preparation should be able to earn the Ph.D. within five to seven years. Students admitted to the M.A. concentration in Demographic and Social Analysis should be able to earn the M.A .. within one to two years. Because the intellectual training offered by the School requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 4229 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-7602 James G. Ferguson, Department\u00b7Chair Anthropology is the comparative study of past and present human societies and cultures. The Department of Anthropology emphasizes contemporary theory, field research, and a variety of methods for analyzing anthropological data. The Department has a strong inter\u00ad disciplinary bent, with research and teaching interests in economic anthropology, political economy, social history and social change, culture and health, identity and ethnicity, gender and feminist stud\u00ad ies, cognitive anthropology, social networks, modernity and devel\u00ad opment, religion, and the arts and expressive culture. The Depart\u00ad ment also has a strong emphasis on the study of contemporary issues and modem problems, such as international flows of goods, peoples, images, and ideas; the relationship between global processes and local practices; immigration, citizenship, and refugees; population politics; violence and political ethnic\u00ad ity and gender family; medicine; law; development and economic transformation; urban studies; and environmental issues. While the program gives students a breadth of knowledge in classical anthropology, the faculty do not merely pursue research on the traditional subjects of anthropological study, but bring anthropo\u00ad logical analyses to bear on pressing contemporary social issues. Geographic regions of expertise include Latin America, southern Africa, east Africa, Micronesia and Oceania, the Caribbean, China, South Asia, and diasporic and transnational communities in the United States and abroad. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 403-404. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 12 courses (48 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Anthropology 30A or 30B. D. Three topical courses (12 units) from Anthropology 120-159, 170-179). E. Two courses (eight units) on a geographical area, from Anthro\u00ad pology 160-169. F. Four additional elective courses (16 units) from Anthropology 30A, 30B, 40-179, 180A. Students are strongly encouraged to take Anthropology 180A after they have had at least three courses beyond Anthropology 2A and 2B, 2C, or 2D. Students are also strongly encouraged to take both Anthropology 30A and 30B. The faculty encourages Anthropology majors or minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Inter\u00ad national Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities. For example, EAP offers excellent opportunities to study anthropology at many univer\u00ad sities abroad and courses taken for departmental requirement C, D, and E would be excellent choices to take. Study abroad also can pro\u00ad vide opportunities for cross-cultural experience, field research, and foreign language training. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue for additional information. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Honors Program in Anthropology The Honors Program in Anthropology is designed to allow under\u00ad graduates to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Department of Anthro\u00ad pology faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research, exploratory ethnographic inter\u00ad views, participant observation, and systematic data collection and analysis. The program is open to all senior Anthropology majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Anthropology courses (at least five courses). Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Although course work for the Honors Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually accept\u00ad able abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their pro\u00ad ject. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, students enroll in Anthropology 199. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H190A and write a proposal describing their research question, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project may begin during this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue enthnographic field research by enrolling in Anthropology H190B. Field research typically combines exploratory field research with fixed format data collection methods. In the spring of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H191 and complete a senior honor thesis that is typically 40 to 80 pages long. Honor theses are read and evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member chosen by the chair of the undergraduate committee in consultation with the advisor. Anthropology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Anthropology are met by taking seven anthropology courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Anthropology 30A or 30B. D. Two topical courses (eight units) from Anthropology 120-159, 170-179). E.

(Ted) Wright, Department Chair The Department of Cognitive Sciences is committed to the investi\u00ad gation of the abstract, complex structures that underlie human cog\u00ad nition: language, thought, memory, learning, sensorimotor integra\u00ad tion and perception. The main areas of research strength within the Department are visual and auditory perception, experimental psy\u00ad chology, cognitive psychology, and mathematical psychology. Undergraduate Program Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in general psychology including the areas of development, clinical, perception, learning, memory, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Cognitive Sciences section. These courses are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in general psychology. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course list\u00ad ings in the School of Social Ecology section. In anticipation that the number of students who are qualified to elect Psychology as a major will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 2004 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 2003. Continuing-Student Applicants: Students who were not admitted to the Psychology major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major during the first five weeks of any quarter after their freshman year. Information about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies is available in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office.- Excellence in Esychological Research: Psychology majors doing independent research under Psychology 199 may be eligible for participation ip the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Participants can obtain research funding and have the opportunity to have their research papers published in a peer\u00ad reviewed student journal or to present them at a special conference of UCI student research. Guidelines for the program are available from the Department of Cognitive Sciences office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 403-404. Departmental Requirements for the Major in Psychology School requirements must be met and must include 18 courses (70 units) as specified below: A. Psychology 9A-B-C. B. Two introductory courses (eight units) in the social sciences chosen from Anthropology 2A or 2B, Economics 1, Linguistics 3, Political Science 6A, 6B, or 6C, Sociology 1, or, by petition, one or two quarters of Social Science HIE, H1F, or H1G, when topic is not psychology. C. A one-quarter course and laboratory in experimental psychol\u00ad ogy or research methods selected from Psychology 112A and 112LA, 112G were previously numbered 115A and 115LA.) NOTE: These courses have as prerequisites Psychology 9A-B-C and one year of mathematics/statistics (see course listings). These prerequisites are strictly enforced. Psychology 112A, 112LA are the first quarter of a multi-quarter sequence that UC IRVINE - 2003-2004satisfies the upper-division writing requirement and allows stu\u00ad dents to plan and conduct research projects. Students taking these courses should plan to continue in them through at least the second quarter. Students who intend to fulfill the upper-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement in some other way should consider tak\u00ad ing Psychology 112M, 112LM, or 112P, 112LP to fulfill the lab\u00ad oratory requirement. D. Four upper-division Psychology core courses are required (16 units). These courses are designated with the ending number \"0\" and courses (four or more units each) with empha\u00ad sis in psychology, distributed as follows: (l)No more than one of the seven may be lower-division. Psy\u00ad chology 7 A, liE, 46A, 56L, 76M may not be used to fulfill\u00ad this requirement. (2) Three of the upper-division courses used to satisfy require\u00ad ments D and E must be taken from one of the following modules: Psychology 110-119 (Research Methodologies), 120-129 (General Psychology), 130-139 (Perception and Sensory Processes), 140-149 and 150-159 (Learning and Cognition and Semiotics and 160-169 (Cognitive Neuroscience), and 170-179 (Interdisciplinary Studies). (3)Certain courses offered in the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Ecology may be used in partial sat\u00ad isfaction of this requirement. Such courses must be chosen from the approved list of psychology-related courses in these disciplines. ( 4) No more than two of the courses (each of four or more units) may be numbered 190-199. NOTE: Psychology majors are strongly encouraged to take Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences lA-B and 35 in satisfaction of the natural sciences portion of the breadth requirement (Category II). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that students who intend to pursue postbac\u00ad calaureate work in psychology take the Psychology 112A-B-C sequence. Most psychology graduate programs require statistics (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Social Science lOA-B\u00ad C, Psychology lOA-B-C, or Social Science lOOA-B-C), but some require calculus (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B-C). Honors Program in Psychology The two-year honors program in Psychology is open to selected juniors who are majoring in Psychology. It provides thorough grounding in research methods and culminates with the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty super\u00ad vision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the program is based on a formal application that is normally sub\u00ad mitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychology courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. During the junior year, students who participate in the program are expected to enroll in Honors Experimental Psychology (HlllA-B\u00ad C), and in the fall quarter of the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HlOlA). As seniors, following successful completion of these junior-year requirements, Psychology honors students are enrolled in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (HlOlB.:C) in the fall and spring quarters. Participants in the honors program are expected to complete course work beyond the breadth requirement in one or more of the following areas: biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, physical science, linguistics, philosophy. The Cognitive Sciences 413 honors seminar may be used to satisfy two of the courses required by Part E of the Psychology major requirements. To graduate with Honors ih Psychology, a student must successfully complete the requirements for the B.A. degree in Psychology with an overall grade point average of 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in Psychology courses. In addition, Honors students must success\u00ad fully complete a senior honors thesis as part of the senior-year course work.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences in the first year. One is a three-quarter proseminar sequence cover\u00ad ing areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics (Psychology 202A-B-C). The other is a research methods sequence covering the areas of probability, statistics, and experimental design (Psychology 203A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the D~partment's Director of Graduate Studies. Completion of the research methods sequence may be extended over two years if warranted by the background or needs of the stu\u00ad dent. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Psychology 201A-B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to passage of the advancement-to-candidacy examination. In addition, students must take at least six more courses prior to advancement to candidacy. These courses are normally taken from at least three of the following seven modules: Foundations (Psy\u00ad chology 200-209); Human Cognition (Psychology 210-229); Methodologies and Models (Psychology 230-239); Virtual Reality (Psychology 240-249); Human Performance (Psychology 250-259); Cognitive Neuroscience (Psychology 260-269); and Sensation and Perception (Psychology 270-289). Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each stu\u00ad dent should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that is potentially publishable in a professional journal. Every student is assigned a faculty advisor, and the advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are required to write a paper based on their research project and to present a talk to the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. (Another forum for the second\u00ad year talk may be substituted with the written approval of the Grad\u00ad uate Director.) UC IRVINE - 2003-2004At the end of each academic year the faculty of the Department meet to discuss and provide feedback on the progress of each stu\u00ad dent in the program. Formal permission to begin a Ph.D. dissertation research project (a step known as \"advancement to candidacy\") is contingent on pas\u00ad sage of an examination, normally taken at the end of the third year or the beginning of the fourth year in the program. The advance\u00ad ment-to-candidacy examination is based on a written dissertation proposal prepared by the student, and consists of an oral examina\u00ad tion and, at the faculty's option, a written examination as well. Each student is required either (1) to establish proficiency in read\u00ad ing social science technical material in one appropriate foreign lan\u00ad guage or (2) to demonstrate proficiency in computer programming considerably beyond that of the standard computer skills require\u00ad ment. Because of the constantly changing nature of computer lan\u00ad guages and other software, the conditions for fulfilling this com\u00ad puter expertise requirement will be left to the judgment of the Department's subcommittee on computers. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the stu\u00ad dent is expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium.

Garfinkel, Department Chair Kenneth A. Small, Department Vice Chair Economics is concerned with the way individuals or societies allo\u00ad cate scarce resources and distribute goods and services. Any situa\u00ad tion requiring choice among competing alternatives can be viewed as an economic problem. Economics courses enable students to study the way individuals make these choices (microeconomics), the way governments make these choices (public choice), and the aggregate consequences of these choices (macroeconomics). Iil addition, the economics curriculum addresses international trade, money and banking, and economic development of the less devel\u00ad oped nations. The Department of Economics is composed of faculty with inter\u00ad ests in a broad range of areas within micro-and macroeconomics, and the evaluation of public policy. It is especially strong in econo\u00ad metrics (both Bayesian and classic), public choice, and empirical microeconomics including transportation, energy, industrial organi\u00ad zation, labor, and urban development. Members of the Department maintain close ties with members of the Department of Political Science and the Graduate School of Management. Undergraduate Program In anticipation that the number of students who want to major in Economics will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 2004 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 2003. In the event the major in Economics receives more qualified appli\u00ad cants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Economics at the time of admission will be encouraged to opt for the Undeclared major within the School of Social Sciences or for any other open major for which they qualify. However, lower-division courses pre\u00ad requisite to upper-division major study are available to all students, and selection to the Economics major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Economics major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major. Infonilation about change of major requirements, procedures, and policies is available in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office. Transfer-Student Applicants: For transfer-student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall and who satisfactorily complete course prerequi\u00ad sites. All applicants must complete the following required courses: one year of microeconomics and macroeconomics with a minimum average grade of B, and one semester or two quarter courses of approved calculus with a minimum average grade of B. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 403-404. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Economics 20A-B-C; this course sequence is a prerequisite for almost all upper-division Economics courses. B. All majors must demonstrate competence in probability and sta\u00ad tistics prior to enrolling in any upper-division economics course, or they must be concurrently enrolled in an approved probability and statistics course. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing Economics lOA-Band Economics 30, or equivalent courses. C. All majors must demonstrate competence iil calculus by com\u00ad pleting Mathematics 2A-B or equivalent courses. Students must complete at least Mathematics 2A or an equivalent course prior to enrolling in Economics lOOA, and both Mathematics 2A and 2B or equivalent courses prior to enrolling in Economics lOOB. D. Economics lOOA-B-C. E. Four additional four-unit upper-division economics courses. At least one of the four must be research-oriented and involve the production of a significant research paper. This required paper may be approved by any Economics faculty member. Strongly recommended: either Economics 121A-B-C or 123A-B-C. Honors Program in Economics The Honors Program in Economics provides outstanding students an in-depth study of economic theory and an opportunity to work more closely with faculty members in smaller honors-designated courses. In their junior year, students complete an honors thesis devoted to the collection and rigorous analysis of data, demonstrating their achievement of an advanced level of research and analytical skills. The program is open to selected students who are majoring in Eco\u00ad nomics and admission is based on a formal application that is nor\u00ad mally submitted in the spring quarter after students have completed two quarters of calculus and Economics 20A-B. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.0 and a grade point average of at least 3.0 in Economics and calculus classes. In the first year of the program, students enroll in Honors Intermediate Eco\u00ad nomics I, II, ill (Economics HlOOA-B-C), and in the second year, Econometrics I, II, ill (Economics 123A-B-C). The honors thesis is usually completed while taking Economics 123C. Upon successful completion of an approved thesis, students graduate with Honors in Economics and their transcript notes that they have completed the Honors Program in Economics. Successful completion of the thesis also satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. To graduate with Honors in Economics, School requirements must be met and must include 20 courses (80 units) as specified below: A. Economics 20A-B-C. B. Mathematics 2A-B-J must be completed prior to taking Eco- nomics HlOOA. C. Mathematics 3A or an equivalent course. D. Economics lOA-Band Economics 30, or equivalent courses. E. Economics HlOOA-B-C. F. Economics 123A-B-C or equivalent. G. An honors thesis. H. A minimum of four additional upper-division Economics courses, with a grade point average of at least 3.0. I. Achievement of a grade point average of at least 3.0 in upper\u00ad division economics courses taken to fulfill requirements.

Uhlaner: Comparative political participation, formal models of political behavior R. Bin Wong: Modern Chinese history and comparative history The Department of Economics offers a Ph.D. degree program in Economics. Drawing upon the School's strong quantitative tradition, it specializes in public choice, transportation economics, urban eco\u00ad nomics, econometrics, and applied microeconomics. Admission is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of over\u00ad lap between faculty and student research interests, the program offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Moti\u00ad vated and well-qualified students find the graduate program highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-dis\u00ad cipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. ADMISSION The deadline for application for admission is January 15 for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are considered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadline. Foreign applicants must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. To be considered for a teaching assistantship, stu\u00ad dents who are not citizens of countries where English is either the primary or dominant language as approved by the UCI Graduate Council must pass either the Test of Spoken English (TSE) or the UCI SPEAK (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) exam\u00ad ination by the time they advance to candidacy. REQUIREMENTS All students must show competence in the core areas of microeco\u00ad nomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. This is done by tak\u00ad ing the three-quarter required course sequences in microeconomics and macroeconomics, and the four-quarter required course sequence in econometrics. All of these required courses must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students also must master two fields of applied economics by taking a two-course sequence (pos\u00ad sibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each field. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Economics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 422 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Sciences discussion of the papers presented and additional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current eco\u00ad nomic research early in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. Knowledge of one foreign language is required; a computer language may be substi\u00ad tuted at the discretion of the faculty. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon com\u00ad pletion of an oral examination on a written dissertation proposal. Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also pursue a Ph.D. in Economics with a concentra\u00ad tion in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the transportation researchers on the campus within the School of Social Sciences, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Trans\u00ad portation Studies, which facilitates student research by providing research assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those described above with the following three exceptions: (1) instead of the third quarter of microeconomics and macroeconomics, students may substitute specified courses such as Discrete Choice Econometrics (Economics 223A), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineer\u00ad ing CE220A), or Operations Research for Management (Manage\u00ad ment 201B); (2) one of the student's two required fields of compe\u00ad tence must be transportation economics; the other must be a related field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organi\u00ad zation, or a transportation-related field from outside economics (such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transportation policy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning) subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economies; and (3) students must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. Concentration in PL!blic Choice Students can also pursue a Ph.D. degree in Economics with a con\u00ad centration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of Economics and Political Science, which draws on quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management are involved in research that supports the concentration. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the nor\u00ad mal procedures for the program in Economics and must fulfill all the requirements for the Economics degree with the following modifications: (1) one of the student's two required fields of com\u00ad petence must be public choice; included is a three-quarter core course in public choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Departments of Economics and Political Science. (A background in economic theory equivalent to Economics HIOOA-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a prerequisite to this sequence.) The requirement for competence in a second field may be met with a one-quarter course, instead of two, if it provides sufficient fluency in the field; and (2) students must obtain a background knowledge in political science equivalent to that provided by a one-year undergraduate survey course, if they do not already have it. RESEARCH FACILITIES UCI is a major research university with an excellent library, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of California libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a com\u00ad puter laboratory. The Economics Department has a small library with current journals and unpublished working papers from other universities. Students also have access to advanced computing resources as well as PC and UNIX laboratories. Three Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, provide research opportunities for graduate students. Courses in Economics NOTE: Students are reminded that each quarter of a sequential course (i.e., Economics 20A-B-C, IOOA-B-C) must be taken in order. Priority for admission to upper-division Economics courses is given to Economics majors and International Studies majors. LOWER-DIVISION 1 Introduction to Economics (4) F, W, S.

Center Program, or the Social Science Internship Program (Social Science 197) with an international focus may be substituted. HONORS PROGRAM IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES The Honors Program allows International Studies majors to engage in research leading to the completion of an honors thesis. The topic for the honors thesis is selected by the student, in consultation with a faculty advisor, and should reflect a theme consistent with the student's module in the International Studies major. The Honors Program is open to all junior and senior International Studies majors with an overall GPA of 3.0 and a 3.5 GPA in the major. Successful completion of a written senior thesis in the International Studies 190 course satisfies the upper-division writing breadth requirement. During the spring quarter of the junior year or during the summer before the senior year, students formally apply to the Honors Pro\u00ad gram. Students will be notified of their selection to the Honors Program by September 1. In the fall quarter of the senior year, stu\u00ad dents enroll in International Studies H180, Honors Research Semi\u00ad nar. In this course, each student formulates a written research plan (i.e., prospectus) for the honors thesis. Students also select a fac\u00ad ulty member who agrees to supervise the research, evaluate the written work, and approve the honors thesis. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students enroll in International Studies H190, Senior Thesis, with their faculty advisor. The faculty advisor super\u00ad vises and evaluates data collection and analysis and reads and edits chapter drafts. In the spring quarter of the senior year, students enroll in a second quarter of Senior Thesis, with their faculty advi\u00ad sor. The thesis is to be completed by the student and approved by the advisor prior to the end of the quarter. Honors students must also demonstrate a high level of language proficiency by completing two courses beyond the 2A level in language, literature, or culture taught in their chosen international language. International Studies majors are also required to pursue some form of international experience, as explained in detail in major require\u00ad ment F.

Wheeler, Assistant Professor of History Susan K. Wierzbicki, Assistant Professor of Sociology Mei Zhan, Assistant Professor of Anthropology The minor in Conflict Resolution, sponsored by the International Studies Program, is an interdisciplinary curriculum that can help students both discover and prepare themselves for professional careers. The course of study provides skills in conflict analysis and resolution and a useful understanding of integrative institutions at the local, regional, and international levels. Conflict plays a key role in all areas of our lives, and has placed a shaping role in the history of nations. It can have destructive or constructive potential. This program explores how conflict arises, how it is represented and discussed, how it is prevented, mitigated, managed, and used for change in interpersonal relations, within and between organiza\u00ad tions and other kinds of groups inside nations, and between nations. The minor consists of seven four-unit courses and two two-unit courses. Course descriptions are available in the academic department sec\u00ad tions of the Catalogue. Requirements for the Minor Three core courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Con\u00ad flict), Political Science 43D (Global Security and Cooperation), and Political Science 154G/Anthropology 136D (Conflict Manage\u00ad ment in Cross-Cultural Perspective).

DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS 5221 Social Science Plaza B; (949) 824-7504 Language is one of the most fundamental human instincts. It is an extraordinarily intricate system that all of us master as young chil\u00ad dren without special teaching, and that gives us the ability to com\u00ad municate, tell stories, and express our deepest feelings. Linguistics is the scientific study of this human language. It is concerned with understanding the nature of language and our kllowledge of it, how we acquire it, and how that knowledge is put to use. It is connected to many other fields of study, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, philos\u00ad ophy, and literature. The availability of the B.A. in Linguistics is currently under review. Please contact the Associate Dean of Social Sciences for details. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 54-59. School Requirements: See pages 403-404. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 14-15 courses (56-63 units) as specified below: A. Six core courses: Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 100, 111, and 121. B. Six linguistics courses, at least four of which must be upper\u00ad division. One of these four upper-division courses must be 112, 122, or 143. C. Natural/Forma1language requirement. One of the following three groups of courses: (1) Three courses in a single language other than English, or equivalent. Courses taken to satisfy breadth requirement cat\u00ad egory VI do not qualify. (2) Two linguistics courses on the structure of foreign languages (e.g., Linguistics 165A, 165B, 165C, 166A, and as the topics might apply, 160, 164A, and 169). UC IRVINE - 2003-2004(3)Two courses in logic (selected from Logic and Philosophy of Science 30 or 104, 105A-B-C) or computation (selected from the Information and Computer Science series 21-22). Residence Requirement for the Linguistics Major: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Honors Program in Linguistics The Honors Program in Linguistics is designed for selected junior and senior Linguistics majors who have shown interest in moving beyond the material covered in the regular undergraduate program and demonstrated their readiness for more advanced Work than is usually expected at the undergraduate level. An overall grade point average of 3.0 with 3.5 in Linguistics courses is required. Participating students design their program in consultation with the faculty and complete a specified set of courses, culminating in the production and oral defense of a senior thesis. Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Four one-quarter courses are required, including Linguistics H195 (Honors Research Workshop) and Hl90 (Senior Thesis). Students also select one or two courses from Linguistics 114, 119, 124, 129, 139, 149, 159, and Hl92. Students also may choose to take either Linguistics 198 or 199. Each of these courses will normally require a term paper, and satisfactory completion of these papers with a grade of A-or better is required for Honors students. These term papers usually are closely connected to the senior thesis topic and contribute to its final form. Two of the courses taken toward fulfilling the Honors Program requirements will also count toward the requirements for the major in Linguistics. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Linguistics 3, 10, and 20. B. Four additional linguistics courses, three of which must be upper-division. Residence Requirement: At least three upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI.

Mann: Speech perception, psycholinguistics Robert May: Semantics, syntax, philosophy of language Robin Scarcella: Sociolinguistics, second-language The Linguistics graduate program is not admitting students at this time, and many of the courses are not available. The doctoral concentration in Linguistics, administered by a group of faculty specializing in the field, is focused on theoretical lin\u00ad guistics and its role in the cognitive sciences. The research empha\u00ad sis is directed toward the core areas of theoretical work in syntax, semantics, phonology, and psycholinguistics with a concentration Linguistics 429 on the formal analysis of natural language. Additional emphasis is on the study of a broad range of languages and language families, including East Asian and Romance. Students are further expected to gain expertise in other areas of the cognitive sciences, especially as this pertains to the study of language. The program offers a Ph.D. in Social Science with a concentration in Linguistics. ADMISSION While at least some undergraduate training in theoretical linguis\u00ad tics is desirable, applications are also welcomed from students with backgrounds in other areas, e.g., philosophy, psychology, language studies, computer science. Decisions on admissions are based on students' undergraduate performance, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and any written research materials submitted by the candidate. Applicants must submit Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) scores; applicants whose first language is not English must also submit Test\" of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. REQUIREMENTS Course requirements consist of eight core courses (Phonology I, II, III; Syntax I, II, III; and Semantics I, II), four additional Linguistics courses, a proseminar in Cognitive Sciences or an appropriate sub\u00ad stitute, research seminars, and a research workshop. The minor area requirement can be met with two courses in a single minor area (e.g., cognitive sciences, computational linguistics, philosophy) or a critical literature survey in a non-core area of language research. For the qualifying examination, students must write two papers of publishable quality in different core areas (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics). A dissertation proposal is required for the advancement to candidacy examination. Students are required to demonstrate mastery of a foreign language on the basis of a written examination. The quantitative methods requirement is fulfilled by a course on symbolic logic or formal language theory. Students are expected to defend the dissertation and to give a public presentation of their doctoral research. Courses in Linguistics LOWER DIVISION 1 Languages of the World (4).

Barrett, Department Chair The Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science (LPS) brings together faculty and students interested in a wide range of topics loosely grouped in the following areas: general philosophy of sci\u00ad ence; philosophy of the particular sciences; logic, foundations and philosophy of mathematics; and philosophy of mathematics in application. LPS enjoys strong cooperative relations with UCI's Department of Philosophy; in particular, the two units jointly administer a single graduate program which offers the Ph.D. in Philosophy. LPS also has strong interconnections with several sci\u00ad ence departments, including Mathematics and Physics, as well as the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Information and Computer Science, the Departments of Cognitive. Sciences and Economics, and the graduate concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences. Graduate Program Faculty Aldo Antonelli: Logic, philosophy of mathematics, history of analytic philosophy Jeffrey A. Barrett: Philosophy of science, philosophy of physics, philosophy of quantum mechanics, epistemology Kent Johnson: Philosophy of language, philosophy of mind Penelope Maddy: Philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of logic, philosophy of science, history of analytic philosophy David Malament: Philosophy of physics, foundations of geometry, foundations of relativity theory Robert May: Semantics, syntax, philosophy of language Brian Skyrms: Philosophy of science, decision theory, game theory, philosophy of biology, epistemology, metaphysics Kyle Stanford: Philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, history of modern philosophy, metaphysics Kai F. Wehmeier: Logic, philosophy of mathematics, history of analytic philosophy Affiliated Faculty Francisco Ayala, Bren Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and of Philosophy: Evolutionary biology, philosophy of science, philosophy of biology Patricia Churchland, UC President's Professor of Philosophy, UCSD: Philosophy of neuroscience and psychology Paul Churchland, Professor of Philosophy, UCSD: Philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence and cognitive neurobiology, epistemology, and perception Paul Eklof, Professor of Mathematics: Mathematical logic Matthew Foreman, Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy: Mathematical iogic Steven Frank, Professor of Biological Sciences: Evolutionary biology Donald Hoffman, Professor of Cognitive Sciences and of Infonnation and Computer Science: Human and machine vision Duncan Luce, UCJ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Cognitive Sciences and Economics: Mathematical behavioral science D.A. Martin, Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy, UCLA: Logic, set theory, philosophy of mathematics James McGaugh, Research Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior and of Cognitive Sciences: Neurobiology of learning and memory Yiannis Moschovakis, Professor of Mathematics, UCLA: Set theory, recursion theory Louis Narens, Professor of Cognitive Sciences: Measurement, logic, and metacognition Riley Newman, Professor of Physics: Experimental particle physics and gravitational physics Terence Parsons, Professor of Philosophy, UCLA: Philosophy of language, metaphysics UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Donald Saari, UCI Distinguished Professor of Economics and Mathematics: Mathematical economics, mathematical behavioral science, celestial mechanics Jonas Schultz, Professor of Physics: Experimental particle physics Norman Weinberger, Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior and of Cognitive Sciences: Neural bases of attention and learning Martin Zeman, Assistant Professor of Mathematics: Logic and combinatorics The Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science and the Department of Philosophy jointly administer a Ph.D. program in Philosophy with two independent tracks: the Philosophy track and the LPS track. Both tracks begin from a common core of require\u00ad ments in standard philosophical fields (e.g., history of philosophy, logic, ethics, metaphysics/epistemology) and branch off thereafter; both tracks offer the Ph.D. degree in Philosophy. Applicants are advised to apply to the unit whose faculty, areas of specialization, and curriculum correspond best with their interests. Students are expected to reside in the same unit as their primary advisor, but faculty in both units are available for all other academic purposes (course work, independent studies, committee membership, and more). See the Department of Philosophy in the School of Human\u00ad ities for a description of the Philosophy track. The M.A. degree in Philosophy may also be awarded to Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents who complete the necessary requirements. ADMISSIONS Applicants for the LPS track must have a bachelor's degree, but there is no formal requirement as to the field of that degree. The most natural undergraduate majors for LPS graduate students would be philosophy, mathematics, or the sciences, but those with other degrees who are interested in the LPS fields should feel free to apply. Complete applications must include GRE scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and a writing sample. The deadline for appli\u00ad cation is January 15. Several forms of incoming fellowships are available on a competi\u00ad tive basis; these include a stipend, student fees, and tuition (for out-of-state students). In subsequent years, some additional fellow\u00ad ship funding is available, but students in good standing are most often supported with teaching assistantships. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LPS TRACK All required courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. The History of Philosophy Requirement provides a broad per\u00ad spective. Graduate courses in three out of the following areas-Modem Rationalism, Modem Empiricism, Kant, and Twen\u00ad tieth Century-must be completed by the end of the seventh quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Logic Requirement acquaints students with the fundamentals of modem logic: elementary set theory, metalogic, and 205C must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. The Field Requirement provides exposure to a range of philo\u00ad sophical disciplines. One graduate course in moral philosophy and one graduate course in metaphysics/epistemology must be com\u00ad pleted by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. (These courses may not also be used to satisfy the History Requirement.) The Philosophy of Science Requirement provides exposure to a range of philosophy of science, from general philosophy of science to the philosophies of particular sciences (e.g., physics, biology), to the philosophies of mathematics and logic. Three selected courses from LPS 240-247 must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. (These courses may be repeated as topics vary.) Courses used to satisfy the Philosophy of Science Logic and Philosophy of Science 433 Requirement may also be used to satisfy the History or Field Requirements. The Tools of Research Requirement provides some flexibility for students with various levels of interest in pursuing the philosophy of a particular science. So, for example, a student most interested in historical issues in the philosophy of mathematics might benefit most from the study of German, while a student most interested in the philosophy of quantum mechanics should take a series of grad\u00ad uate courses in physics. (Students wishing to specialize further in the philosophy of a particular science might wish to pursue more demanding options; see the Mathematics and Physics emphases, below.) To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an exami\u00ad nation on an appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in three appropriate graduate courses in a discipline or disciplines outside philosophy by the end of the ninth quarter in residence. Though the discipline(s) here must be outside philoso\u00ad phy, they might be taught by Philosophy or LPS faculty. The two\u00ad hour language examination will be administered by an LPS faculty member and will require the student to translate (with the aid of a dictionary) a passage or passages from philosophical or scientific authors. The Portfolio Requirement ensures that students have acquired dissertation-level skills in the writing of philosophy: e.g., the abil\u00ad ity to isolate, understand and evaluate arguments in the philosophi\u00ad cal literature; the ability to assimilate secondary literature; the abil\u00ad ity to formulate and defend an original philosophical thesis. The portfolio is designed to display these skills. To satisfy this require\u00ad ment, a student must submit an extended writing sample, most often consisting of several individual papers, that demonstrates the skills necessary to write a Ph.D. dissertation. (A successful portfo\u00ad lio typically consists of several papers totaling around 80 pages. These may be revisions of term papers. Each paper should present and defend a definite thesis and should be accessible to faculty members unfamiliar with the literature in question. The papers in the portfolio need not be of publishable quality, but they must, col\u00ad lectively, demonstrate the specified skills.) Portfolios will be evalu\u00ad ated by the entire LPS faculty. (LPS track students may request that relevant Philosophy Department faculty also be present at the evaluation meeting.) Portfolios must be submitted by the end of the fourth week of the seventh quarter. The Candidacy Examination demonstrates that the student has a viable dissertation topic and an adequate grasp of related literature. To satisfy this requirement, a student must prepare and be examined on a reading list of canonical literature in the area of the disserta\u00ad tion and a brief (15-20 page) dissertation proposal. The reading list should in effect define the context of the proposed dissertation. The examination must be completed by the end of the tenth quarter in residence. Dissertation Defense. Students must pass a final oral examination focussing on the content of the dissertation administered by the Dissertation Committee. LPS TRACK EMPHASIS IN MATHEMATICS In addition to the LPS track described above, there is a more demanding option open to LPS students wishing to specialize in the foundations and/or philosophy of mathematics. Faculty in the UCI and UCLA Departments of Mathematics participate in the Mathematics emphasis. Students in the emphasis take courses and receive advising from these participating Mathematics professors, as well as from the faculty of LPS and the Philosophy Department. Mathematics emphasis students must satisfy the following require\u00ad ment in addition to the usual LPS track requirements: Mathematics Requirement. A student must receive a grade of B or better in six graduate courses in mathematics. (Some of these UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 434 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Sciences courses may also be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Require\u00ad ment.) In addition, the student's Candidacy and Dissertation Com\u00ad mittees must include an active member from the UCI or UCLA Departments of Mathematics. LPS TRACK EMPHASIS IN PHYSICS In addition to the LPS track described above, there is a more demanding option open to LPS students wishing to\u00b7 specialize in the foundations and/or philosophy of physics. Physics emphasis students must satisfy the following requirement in addition to the usual LPS track requirements: Physics Requirement. A student must receive a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter in three sections of LPS 241 whose topics are Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, Geometry and Spacetime, and Probability and Determinism, as well as in three additional graduate courses in Physics or Mathematics. (Students in the Physics Emphasis may also use these courses to satisfy the Tools of Research Require\u00ad ment, but not the Philosophy of Science Requirement.) SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM LPS and the Department of Philosophy jointly administer an Exchange Program with the University of Salzburg. The program has two parts. The Scholarly Exchange provides opportunities for faculty and graduate students in LPS and Philosophy to visit Salzburg and for faculty and graduate students from Salzburg to visit one or the other of the UCI units. The Program also sponsors joint conferences, held alternately in Irvine and in Salzburg; these are co-sponsored by Salzburg and the UCI Interdisciplinary Pro\u00ad gram in the History and Philosophy of Science. To be eligible for the Salzburg Exchange, a graduate student must have advanced to candidacy. The selected student spends one semester in Salzburg, usually teaching one course in the general area of the thesis topic. An upper-division course may be taught in English, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typi\u00ad cally, a Salzburg visitor will receive a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg will also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). Applications from LPS graduate students (including a curriculum vita and syllabi for courses that might be taught) should be sent to the LPS Salzburg Exchange Director by November 1.

Uhlaner: Comparative political participation, formal models of political behavior Robert Uriu: International relations, international political economy, Japanese political economy\u00b7 Martin Wattenberg: American political behavior and institutions The Department of Political Science offers a Ph.D. degree program in Political Science. The graduate program emphasizes empirical democratic theory, with an emphasis on the United States and other industrialized and industrializing nations, within a comparative context. Faculty interests include political behavior, political psy\u00ad chology, public choice theory, political economy, international rela\u00ad tions, systems theory, mass media, and authority relations. Institu\u00ad tions of interest include the executive branch, bureaucratic politics, political parties, and representation and electoral systems. The strengths of the Political Science graduate program include its small size, its personalized attention to students, and its location within an interdisciplinary school. Three Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences, offer opportunities for participation in ongoing faculty research. One group of Political Science faculty share interests in applied Public Choice with faculty members in both Economics and Philosophy; another group is involved with the Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies; and others are involved in the Center for the Study of Democracy. ADMISSIONS The deadline for application for fall quarter admission is January 15. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Additional information is available in the general section on admission to Social Science graduate pro\u00ad grams. Please note especially the required examinations. REQUIREMENTS First-year students must take a core program of graduate seminars, focusing on major substantive areas\u00b7 as well as research methods. Students are required to complete one year of statistics, preferably before enrollment but no later than their first year. Competence in a foreign language is required. Students may substitute mastery of an advanced research skill in place of a foreign language. To acquire such a skill (which could involve course work in such dis\u00ad ciplines as economics, mathematics and computer science, or sta\u00ad tistics), students could take courses in econometrics, advanced multivariate regression, or computer science. Attendance in a col\u00ad loquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year, a review of per\u00ad formance in the graduate program will be conducted for each stu\u00ad dent by the Political Science faculty. A set of three papers, normally completed by the third year of study, tests the student's competence in a set of major domains for intel\u00ad lectual inquiry. These domains are determined by the student and the Political Science Graduate Director. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of these papers and demonstration of competence in mathemat\u00ad ics and a foreign language or an advanced research skill, a candi\u00ad dacy committee is appointed to oversee the qualifying examination Political Science 437 and the formal advancement to candidacy. Students are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral committee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, reviews a dissertation prospectus and supervises work toward completion of the dissertation. Within six months of the oral quali\u00ad fying examination (the formal advancement to candidacy), students are expected to meet with their doctoral committee, in order to dis\u00ad cuss with the members a dissertation prospectus. Concentration in Public Choice Public Choice is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of political science and economics, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Public Choice examines such areas as theories of voter and party choice; the theory of constitutions; the theory of committees and elections; models of regulation; problems of public goods and externalities; rent-seeking models; and issues in social choice, social welfare, and demand revelation. This concentration is administered by an interdisciplinary commit\u00ad tee of faculty from the Departments of Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the normal procedures for the program in Political S.cience and must fulfill all the requirements for the Political Science degree, with the following modifications: (1) Students must complete the three-quarter core sequence in Pub\u00ad lic Choice, which is taught jointly by Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics faculty. This sequence is usually taken in the student's sec\u00ad ond or third year. (2) Students must complete three additional graduate-level, four\u00ad unit courses in related fields with the consent of their graduate advisor, chosen from a set of courses designated by the interdisci\u00ad plinary committee. The courses chosen are to be tailored to the individual interests and academic background of the student and usually will include at least two Economics courses (such as Econometrics, Game Theory, and Law and Economics) and one Political Science course (such as those on electoral systems, party systems, constitutions, courts). (3) Students are expected to write their dissertation on a topic related to Public Choice. Usually the dissertation advisor will be a Political Science member of the interdisciplinary committee. Concentration in Political Psychology The last two decades have seen an explosion of interest in the field of political psychology. UCI's graduate concentration is part of this development, but enjoys a rather distinctive place. The concentra\u00ad tion offers students a broader education than is typically available at other institutions. In this vein, the program aims to provide: (1) a strong background in both political science and psychology; (2) an emphasis on theoretical and conceptual issues as well as empiri\u00ad cal and methodological ones; and (3) a familiarity with research being done outside of the United States as well as within it. In this context, a number of research concerns central to the participating faculty are considered, including: social change and democratiza\u00ad tion, ideology, altruism, social and political identity, public policy, community building, mass media effects, voting behavior, and international integration. Believing in academic community, the concentration's sponsoring faculty offer a host of activities includ\u00ad ing colloquia, reading groups, and joint research opportunities to facilitate contact between students and fac11lty and among the stu\u00ad dents themselves. Requirements. The purpose of the concentration is to provide a course of study which supplements the Ph.D. degree in Political Science. Therefore, students are required to complete all degree requirements for the Ph.D. stipulated by the Department of Politi\u00ad cal Science. As part of or in addition to these requirements, students UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 438 UCI 2003-04 School of Social Sciences must take five courses: Introduction to Political Psychology I and II (Political Science 285A and 285B), and three graduate psychol\u00ad ogy courses which provide a strong background in psychology (selected from an approved group which includes courses such as Personality in Development, Society and Pathology, Personality Assessment, Proseminar in Cognitive Science, and Human Infor\u00ad mation Processing). These courses are taught in the Department of Cognitive Science in the School of Social Sciences and the Depart\u00ad ment of Psychology and Social Behavior in the School of Social Ecology.

Yellott: Mathematical psychology and vision perception The concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences offers a program of interdisciplinary and mathematical approaches to the study of human behavior, providing high levels of training in cur\u00ad rent mathematical modeling and in mathematics and software use and programming. The program is administered by an interdiscipli\u00ad nary group of faculty. Within the concentration, an emphasis in Social Networks is available; specific requirements are detailed below. ADMISSION Admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences requires evidence of appreciable mathematical skill and knowledge. As an absolute minimum, a candidate should have taken one full year of calculus, including calculus of several vari\u00ad ables, and one course in linear algebra, and should also provide evidence of additional mathematical depth. This depth can be man\u00ad ifested in a number of different ways including, but not restricted to, an undergraduate degree in mathematics or physical science, a high score on the mathematics portion of the GRE, or a strong undergraduate minor in mathematics. In addition, students should have some exposure to a behavioral science field. Especially useful is some experience with behavioral science modeling. Those students interested in the emphasis in Social Networks should make this clear in their application. A student is free at any time after admission to move into or out of the emphasis in Social Networks, but will be subject to the requirements in effect at the time of original admission to the concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences. REQUIREMENTS Four major classes of requirements must be fulfilled. Since a num\u00ad ber of options are available, the student will, in consultation with an advisor, develop a plan of study. Quantitative/Mathematical. To be completed by the end of the third year: (1) one course each in analysis beyond calculus (or dis\u00ad crete mathematics for the Social Networks emphasis), abstract algebra beyond linear algebra (or graph theory for the Social Net\u00ad works emphasis), and logic; and (2) two quarters of mathematical statistics, with calculus as a prerequisite and covering the funda\u00ad mentals of probability and random variables. Language/Computer. All students must be sufficiently familiar with various computer programs and languages to be able to conduct seri\u00ad ous research in their field of interest and must submit either pro\u00ad posed courses or some demonstration of competency as part of their plan of study. In addition, students must either (1) attain proficiency in reading social science technical publications in one foreign lan\u00ad guage with a substantial relevant technical literature or (2) demon\u00ad strate proficiency in computer programming considerably beyond that of the standard computer requirement. Because of the continu\u00ad ally changing nature of computer languages and software, the condi\u00ad tions for fulfilling this additional computer expertise requirement is left to the judgment of the faculty subcommittee on computers of the Ph.D. program. Substantive Minor. Students are expected to develop considerable expertise in some substantive field and in the application of models to it. This requires the completion of three courses at the upper\u00ad division or graduate level that do not necessarily entail extensive modeling, and three courses or seminars in which the primary thrust is mathematical modeling. Research Papers and Colloquia. At the end of the second year, a 10-20-page paper reporting original research or a penetrating analysis of some subtopic of mathematical behavioral science (or social networks with a formal or mathematical component) is expected. An oral presentation will be given to faculty and gradu\u00ad ate students. Two faculty members are assigned to read and evalu\u00ad ate the paper and talk. Students are required to take for credit four quarters of the Mathe\u00ad matical Behavioral Sciences Colloquium, Social Science 211A-B\u00ad C, during their first three years. (Although not a formal require\u00ad ment, students are expected to attend the Colloquium on a regular basis whenever in residence.) Students in the Social Networks emphasis are required to attend about 75 percent of these colloquia, including all that are designated as Social Networks colloquia. Social Networks students also must attend occasional colloquia, usually of local faculty and graduate students, which are separate from the general Mathematical Behavioral Sciences Colloquia. Master of Arts Degree The M.A. degree is awarded to UCI Ph.D. students who complete necessary requirements or to students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program (or equivalent) at another institution who are direCtly admit\u00ad ted for graduate study leading only to the master's degree at UCI. Such applicants must provide evidence that their Ph.D. program agrees to this one-year arrangement. Requirements include the sub\u00ad mission of a petition to the Graduate Committee along with a pro\u00ad posed plan of study consisting of 36 units of relevant Mathematical Behavioral Science courses, normally including the core requirement in mathematical statistics, and the satisfactory completion of a com\u00ad prehensive examination.

Stern, Chair 4800 Berkeley Place General Information: (949) http://www.stat.uci.edu/ Faculty Hal S. Stem, Ph.D. Stanford University, Department Chair and Professor of Statistics (Bayesian methods, model diagnostics, statistical computing, applications to biological and social sciences, sports and statistics) Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data. Statistical principles and methods are important for addressing questions in public policy, medicine, industry, and vir\u00ad tually every branch of science. Equally as important is that prob\u00ad lems in such areas help drive the development of new statistical methodology. A variety of skills in mathematics and computing are utilized in modern statistical sciences. The Department of Statistics, established in July 2002, plans to develop core strength in statistical theory and to focus on the development of statistical methods for solving problems in a vari\u00ad ety of fields. It is anticipated that the Department will grow to a faculty of six to eight full-time members within five years. In addi\u00ad tion, to support the Department's mission of supporting collabora\u00ad tive interdisciplinary research, the Department also anticipates joint appointments shared with other departments at UCI. Proposals for M.S. and Ph.D. programs are being developed. Interested students should contact the Department for up-to-date information. Course in Statistics 225 Bayesian Statistical Analysis (4).

Medical Student Advisor System The College's formal advisor system includes basic science advi\u00ad sors, clinical science advisors, and career specialty advisors. Basic Science Advisors Leslie M. Thompson, Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-6756 There are 12 basic science advisors. Six advisors are assigned on an every other year rotational basis to each incoming class and fol\u00ad low that class through their basic science years. The basic science advisors meet on a monthly basis to review students academic Medicine 473 progress, and to initiate interventive programs for students in acad\u00ad emic difficulty and at academic risk. They also serve as a source of support and guidance for first-and second-year medical students. Clinical Science Advisors Lloyd Rucker, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Curricular Affairs (949) 824-4609 The Clinical Science Advisors (CSA) combine teacher, advisor, and mentor into a single individual. By starting in the teaching role, the CSAs develop mentoring relationships with students that carry over into their role as advisor. When fully involved, each CSA will work with groups of eight-ten students from the second-, third-, and fourth-year classes, roughly 27 students in total. Stu\u00ad dents and CSAs first meet during the second year when the CSA serves as the facilitator for the problem-based learning small groups of the Patient-Doctor course. Toward the end of the second year, CSAs begin to provide scheduling and career advice for their students. In the third year, the faculty meet with students in groups and individual sessions to provide further career advice, to monitor progress in the third year, and to advise students about fourth year schedules. In the fourth year, advisors monitor the students' sched\u00ad ule for progress and review any requested changes. Career Specialty Advisors Michael Prislin, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Student Affairs (949) 824-5932 Career specialty advisors are generally full-time College of Medi\u00ad cine faculty who are identified as knowledgeable about career and residency options in their field. They are available to students as career-choice consultants. Peer Review and Peer Counseling Program Michael Prislin, M.D., Chair Associate Dean Student Affairs (949) 824-5932 The College of Medicine has an informal peer review process, aimed at early detection and assistance for medical students who are experiencing difficulty such as professional conduct problems, suspected impairment, violation of the honor code, or violation of any University policy, regulation, or rule. The Peer Review Com\u00ad mittee is comprised of two representatives from each class, the stu\u00ad dent body co-presidents, and two advisory faculty members. The committee operates within guidelines set jointly by the College of Medicine administration and the student body. Cases involving serious professional misconduct are referred to the Dean's Office. The Peer Review Committee conducts hearings and may impose sanctions or provide assistance to the student. Medical Scholars Program Geraldine Codd Academic Skills Coordinator (949) 824-3415 The Medical Scholars Program (MSP), a student-driven effort, is an innovative, collegial study support program which was implemented in the fall of 1993. This program benefits all students in the College of Medicine and provides a special sense of community for first-year students. A great deal of the informal knowledge concerning medical school is communicated through the components of MSP. Small groups of first-year students are led by second-year co-le!!ders who develop clinically relevant case-based problems for discussion cov\u00ad ering material learned in first-year basic science courses. Fourth\u00ad year students serve as co-leaders for similar groups of second-year students. First-year discussion groups meet every other week, and groups for second-year students meet once per month. First-and second-year students also receive MSP study packets, which contain test questions and answers from the previous year, and are distributed prior to each examination. Another component of MSP is designed to meet the needs of stu\u00ad dents as they face the challenges and transitions of their third year. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004I 474 UCI 2003-04 College of Medicine During their various clerkships, third-year students are assisted in four basic areas by fourth-year students: oral examinations, presen\u00ad tation of cases, written examinations, and clinical skills. These fourth-year students not only share their knowledge of the subjects, but also share information about appropriate study material, and what to emphasize in studying for their various test experiences. Both third-and fourth-year students benefit from participating in this program. Medical Scientist Training Program (M.D./Ph.D.) Alan Goldin, M.D., Ph.D., Chair (949) 824-5264 Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in acad\u00ad emic medicine and with demonstrated research accomplishments may be considered for admission to the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Students in this program pursue a combined cur\u00ad riculum for an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from any of the graduate programs at UCI. The pro\u00ad gram requires a minimum of seven years for completion, and stu\u00ad dents holding either degree are not eligible for MSTP. Additional information is available from the MSTP Coordinator's ucihs. uci.edu/mdphd/. Applicants must submit a supplementary application (available from the College of Medicine Office of Admissions) to the Medical Sci\u00ad entist Training Program when they are submitting their secondary application information to the College of Medicine. Students accepted into the program have the option of pursuing graduate study in any of the graduate programs at UCI. Although a specific graduate department need not be chosen at the time of admission, students are expected to have selected a field for their graduate stud\u00ad ies. Financial support in the form of a fellowship, which includes a stipend as well as tuition and fees, is provided. Applicants not accepted into MSTP may be considered separately for admission to the College of Medicine. M.D./M.B.A. Degree Program Maria Chandler, M.D./M.B.A. Faculty Advisor (949) 824-7133 The M.D./M.B.A. program requires five or six years for comple\u00ad tion. It is aimed at individuals who are exceptional in ability and motivation and who seek a career as physicians with major respon\u00ad sibility for administration and management in health care organiza\u00ad tions and institutions. Students in this program pursue a combined curriculum for an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and an M.B.A. degree from the Graduate School of Management. Students must be currently enrolled in the M.D. program in order to apply to the combined M.D./M.B.A. program. During their sec\u00ad ond or third year of medical school, interested students submit an application to the Graduate School of Management Admissions Committee, after review by the College of Medicine. Final accep\u00ad tance to the program is granted by the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment, and M.B.A. course work begins following completion of the student's third year of medical school. Students should be aware that enrollment in the M.D. program does not guarantee acceptance into the M.B.A. program. The MCAT, along with the completion of three years of medical school training in good standing and passage of USMLE Step 1, currently serve as a waiver for the GMAT entrance examination usually required for application to the M.B.A. program. The total number of units required to graduate from each program separately are satisfied in the M.D./M.B.A. program. The M.D. Curriculum The UCI medical curriculum continues to undergo revisions within all four years of instruction. Indeed, the College of Medicine fac\u00ad ulty views curriculum development as a continual process and feels that medical education and teaching innovations must be encour\u00ad aged and supported. The curriculum is designed to encourage med\u00ad ical students to become participants in their education process, to be active rather than passive learners, to become lifelong learners, and to use cooperative and team-learning principles. UCI is dedicated to the nurturing of humanistic, caring physicians with top-notch clinical expertise and skills. The College strives for this through a curriculum that is not only anchored in the science of medicine but also provides meaningful experiences in the humanistic dimensions of medicine. In this context, the faculty endeavors to provide students with experiences in areas such as communications and empathy, ethics aild professionalism; diversity awareness; and cultural sensitivity and medical humanities. The faculty also feels that the curriculum should strive to integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into the early phases of medical education. The College has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of a series of \"Patient-Doctor\" courses. The Patient-Doctor courses are longitudinal multidisciplinary experi\u00ad ences broadly designed to prepare students for their future careers in medicine through the application of experiential and self\u00ad directed learning principles. First-and second-year students begin to prepare for their clerkships through clinical exposures featuring standardized patients and clinical tag-along experiences. These courses also utilize small group learning sessions to reinforce core concepts of patient-physician interactions and introductory clinical reasoning skill development. During the Advanced Patient-Doctor course (years three and four) students explore many of the crucial issues first presented during the introductory Patient-Doctor course. During this segment greater emphasis is placed on advanced skill acquisition and more mature professional role development. To satisfy the requirement for the M.D. degree, each medical stu\u00ad dent must successfully complete the full curriculum. Students must also pass both Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical \u00b7 Licensing Examination (USMLE) and successfully pass a Clinical Practice Examination (CPX) prior to graduation. An ongoing academic monitoring program is coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs, which identifies students early who might be experiencing academic difficulty and provides them with resources to successfully complete their course work. Faculty advi\u00ad sors are assigned to students during their first and second years. Students have advisory sessions with M.D. faculty prior to the scheduling of their third-and fourth-year course work. A Learning Resources Program is available to provide tutorial assistance and study skills training. USMLE reviews are also provided. CURRICULAR POLICIES The curricular policies of the College of Medicine are the responsi\u00ad bility of the faculty committees on Curriculum and Educational Policy and on Promotions and Honors. A listing of these policies, as well as information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, and requirements for academic advancement, are contained in the College of Medicine Handbook, which is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/ medstudents/studentaffairs/.

Residents spend time at the UCI Medical Center, private facilities, LBVAMC, and Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, all of which provide a broad base and mix of experience in psychopathology. A wide variety of elective courses and experiences are available in this flexible, eclectic program. All residents are expected to complete a research project of high quality prior to completion of the program. RADIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY) . The Department of Radiological Sciences has 22 residents training for certification in diagnostic radiology. The program is based at the UCI Medical Center and integrated with LBVAMC, and MHMC. Residents rotate through all three institutions. The objectives of the program are (1) to provide individuals with a solid background in all modalities of imaging, (2) to provide an atmosphere conducive to research and to encourage opportunities for residents to participate in research work with physicians and scien\u00ad tists, and (3) to provide elective periods in which residents can work in given areas of the Department to increase their expertise or work on research projects during their residency training. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004The residency program includes specialized training in interven\u00ad tional radiology, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, as well as opportunities to participate in major research programs conducted in the Department. All residents are encouraged to com\u00ad plete at least one major paper during the program. Candidates are accepted only at the postgraduate-2 level for a four\u00ad year program. Fellowships are available for an additional year in specialized areas following the successful completion of the resi\u00ad dency. The newest technologies in the field of radiological sciences are available at UCI Medical Center and the College's affiliated institutions. RADIATION ONCOLOGY The Residency Training Program in Radiation Oncology is designed to prepare suitably qualified applicants for academic and clinical practice careers in radiation oncology. Candidates enter a four-year program which includes clinical experience, didactic lec\u00ad tures, and integrated research experience. Unique opportunities exist for training in the use of interstitial and intracavitary treat\u00ad ment using radionuclides and specially designed applicators. An elective rotation may be taken in related branches of medicine (e.g., medical oncology, surgical pathology, gynecologic oncology) or at other radiation oncology departments. The Program includes rotations at three participating hospitals: UCI Medical Center, LBVAMC, and MHMC. SURGERY The philosophy underlying all aspects of surgical training is that surgery is best learned, taught, and practiced as applied clinical physiology. Operative techniques and applied anatomy receive appropriate attention. Major portions of clinical experience, teach\u00ad ing, conferences, research, and patient care are oriented toward understanding and correcting disordered human biology. The surgi\u00ad cal specialty involves more years of training than other medical disciplines due to the breadth of diseases and complexity of patho\u00ad physiology involved in surgery. The Department offers residencies in general surgery, plastic surgery, and urology. GRADUATIE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS The College's basic medical science departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics participate jointly with the School of Biological Sciences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences.

The program in Environmental Toxicology provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary and appropriate to teach and/or conduct basic and applied research programs in inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, environmental carcinogenesis, biochemical neurotoxicology, chem\u00ad ical pathology, phototoxicity, of natural products, and toxicokinetics. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004Toxicology involves scientific study of the entry, distribution, bio\u00ad transformation, and mechanism of action of chemical agents harm\u00ad ful to the body. The program interprets environmental toxicology as the study of the effects and mechanisms of action of hazardous chemicals in food, air, water, and soil, in the home, workplace, and community, and considers experimentally and theoretically such. diverse research problems as: (1) new scientific approaches to toxi\u00ad cological evaluation of environmental chemicals\u00b7 such as air and water pollutants, food additives, industrial wastes, and agricultural adjuvants; (2) mechanisms of action in chemical carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; (3) the molecular pathology of tissue injury in acute toxicity; and (4) scientific principles involved in extrapolat\u00ad ing from laboratory animal data to expected effects on human health in environmental exposures. Students entering the program have varied backgrounds, including chemistry, biology, and physiology. The curriculum is based on a foundation of basic and health sciences with applications of scien\u00ad tific principles to environmental problems. Formal course work is enriched by a strong commitment to student-professor interaction throughout the program. An important and integral part of the learning process is an early.and intensive involvement of the stuc dent in ongoing original research projects in environmental toxicol\u00ad ogy, especially inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, chemical carcino\u00ad genesis, biochemical toxicology, chemical pathology, and neurotoxicology. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements set by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, applicants must be admitted by an Admissions Committee composed of faculty mem\u00ad bers from the Department of Community and Environmental Medi\u00ad cine.

Most graduates of the program join academic or hospital-based genetics teams providing clinical ser\u00ad vices, teaching, and research. Others work for local, state, or fed\u00ad eral genetics programs, for commercial genetics laboratories, or in education. The graduate program is fully accredited by the Ameri\u00ad can Board of Genetic Counseling. Division faculty and staff are engaged in teaching, research, and providing patient service. Clinical activities center on diagnostic evaluation, management, and genetic counseling for genetic disor\u00ad ders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling conditions. Fac\u00ad ulty tesearch interests include: gene mapping and linkage analysis using molecular and quantitative methods; characterization and management of malformation of unusual cancer; psychosocial and cultural issues associ\u00ad ated with genetic conditions, birth defects, prenatal diagnosis, and genetic tests; delivery of genetics services; and ethical and public policy issues in genetics. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, students complete a sequence of core courses covering medical, quantita\u00ad tive, biochemical, molecular, and research methodol\u00ad ogy; ethical issues; and community resources. All but one of these courses are taught by Division faculty specifically for students in the program. Experiential professional training occurs concurrently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center and satellite facilities, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories, and in vari\u00ad ous community agencies. Student participation in these and other divisional and departmental professional and educational activities such as lectures, seminars, journal club, Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Oncology Grand Rounds, cytogenetics conferences, and vari\u00ad ous research, counseling, and patient management conferences is expected throughout the program. While not required, some stu\u00ad dents choose to arrange optional clinical rotations at other acade\u00ad mic or private genetics units. Degree requirements include a minimum of 75 quarter units, com\u00ad pletion of a research thesis that should be publishable, and demon\u00ad stration of appropriate professional skills in genetic counseling. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students, although teaching and supervision of professional experiential training are shared by all Division faculty and staff, who frequently review student progress. In the second year, development of profes\u00ad sional skills can be individualized according to the trainee's needs and interests. Successful completion of the program fulfills the cur\u00ad ricular and clinical training requirements for eligibility to sit for examination by the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological and behavioral sciences-particularly in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, psychology, and human develop\u00ad ment. Course work in statistics is desirable. Fluency in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language confers a considerable advantage. Extracurricular or employment experiences that provide evidence of the student's maturity, interpersonal skills, and promise as a genetic counselor figure prominently in the admissions decision. References should speak to these qualities as well as to the acade\u00ad mic qualifications of the applicant. The GRE General Test and Writing Assessment are required. Subject Test scores in any area will also be considered if they are available. Since there is no GRE code for the Department of Pediatrics, applicants should use the UCI institution code: R4859. Applications are accepted for the fall quarter only and must be complete by February 1. Because of keen competition for places in the program, a two-stage admissions process is employed. Follow\u00ad ing initial review of applications by the faculty admissions com\u00ad mittee, approximately one-fifth of applicants are invited for inter\u00ad views. These are usually conducted during March and April. If invited, it is greatly to the candidate's advantage to have an on-site interview, although in difficult circumstances it may be possible.to arrange an out-of-town interview with a program graduate or a traveling faculty member. Any candidate planning to be in the Southern California area is encouraged to inquire in advance regarding the likelihood of an interview. Final selection from the interviewed candidates occurs in late April or early May. Five stu\u00ad dents are usually admitted each year.

Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures; and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions, and from the charter of the University of California which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the pro\u00ad tection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchal\u00ad lenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diver\u00ad sity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Educa\u00ad tion and clear, rational, and vigorous challenges are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Information concerning these policies is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ucop.edu/. Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Univer\u00ad sity policy. All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs. Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner \u00b7compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. A handbook is \u00b7available which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students lists rules concerning conduct and related mat\u00ad ters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the President of the University and also incorporates campus regulations. Copies are available from theDean of Students, located in the UCI Student Center; the University Ombudsman, located in 437 Administration Building; and on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/judicial/uci_policy.html. Academic Honesty The UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty were approved by the Irvine Division on June 2, 1988. Revised December 12, 1996; October 12, 2000; and November 21, 2002. A. PREAMBLE The University is an institution of learning, research, and scholarship predi\u00ad cated on the existence of an environment of honesty and integrity. As mem\u00ad bers of the academic community, faculty, students, and administrative offi\u00ad cials share responsibility for maintaining this environment. It is essential that all members of the academic community subscribe to the ideal of academic honesty and integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine. Cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest activities erode the University's educational, research, and social roles. They devalue the learning experience and its legiti\u00ad macy not only for the perpetrators but for the entire community. B. RESPONSIBILITIES All members of the academic community have a responsibility to ensure that scholastic honesty is maintained. Faculty have primary responsibility for: 1. Upholding and enforcing universitywide principles of academic honesty and integrity and explaining clearly these principles including any qualifi\u00ad cations which may be operative in the classes they are teaching. 2. Minimizing opportunities for academic misconduct in their courses. 3. Confronting students suspected of academic dishonesty in a way that respects student privacy. 4. Affording students accused of academic misconduct the right to appeal any resulting disputes to disinterested parties for hearing and resolution. 5. Assigning an appropriate grade to a student who engages in academic dishonesty. 6. Reporting all instances of academic dishonesty to appropriate Associate Deans. 7. Protecting the anonymity of any student reporting an incident of acade\u00ad mic dishonesty to the extent permitted by due process required for the accused and other legal requirements. Students have responsibility for: I. Refraining from cheating and plagiarism. 2. Refusing to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty. 3. Notifying professors and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct. The anonymity of a student reporting an incident of academic dishonesty will be protected. C. WHAT IS ACADEMIC DISHONESTY? Academic dishonesty applies equally to electronic media and print, and involves text, images, and ideas. It includes but is not limited to the follow\u00ad ing examples: Cheating I. Copying from others during an examination. 2. Communicating exam answers with other students during an examination. 3. Offering another person's work as one's own. UC IRVINE - 2003-20044. Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself. 5. Sharing answers for a take-home examination or assignment unless specifically authorized by the instructor. 6. Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected, then returning it for more credit. 7. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes or infor\u00ad mation concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. 8. Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Dishonest Conduct 1. Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. 2. Changing or attempting to change academic records without proper sanction. 3. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. 4. Forging add/drop/change cards and other enrollment documents, or alter\u00ad ing such documents after signatures have been obtained. 5. Intentionally disrupting the educational process in any manner. 6. Allowing another student to copy off of one's own work during a test. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: 1. To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words, images, or other cre\u00ad ative works of another. 2. To use a creative production without crediting the source, even if only minimal information is available to identify it for citation. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summa\u00ad rizing a work (in whole, or in part, in one's own words), and for information which is not common knowledge. Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student perform any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to discipline for academic dishonesty. D. PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH INCIDENTS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Many, perhaps most, incidents of academic dishonesty involve accusations which are based on clear evidence and which are not contested by the accused student. In such cases, if the infraction is relatively minor and there is no indication that the accused student has previously been involved in such incidents, it is most appropriate that the matter be resolved between the stu\u00ad dent and the faculty member. When this occurs, it is nevertheless important that a written report of the incident be filed to ensure that penalties assessed are commensurate with the offense and that repeated infractions be detected and dealt with appropriately. More serious incidents and repeat offenses which call for stronger discipli\u00ad nary action, may result in campuswide sanctions, in addition to the actions imposed by a faculty member. In such cases, these sanctions, as described in . Section 105.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, will be administered by the Academic Associate Deans or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies. Finally, whenever an accusation of academic dishonesty or a grade given by a faculty member is contested by an accused student, the student has recourse for mediation of the dispute. Processes for mediation, resolution, and/or an investigation may\u00b7 be reques!ed by the student or the Associate (Undergradu\u00ad ate or Graduate) Dean of the faculty member's school through the Office of the Ombudsman. In incidents where a campuswide sanction has been imposed, the student can request a hearing with the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty which will be convened by the Office of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, depend\u00ad ing on the status of the accused student. Appendix 495 The procedures outlined here are designed to institute a system that recog\u00ad nizes that many cases of academic misconduct are best resolved between the student and faculty member involved, while it provides for appropriate record keeping and handling of serious and repeated offenses and guarantees a fair hearing to a student who has received a campuswide sanction. Authority of Faculty Members When a faculty member has evidence of student academic dishonesty, the faculty member \u00b7must present the evidence to the student in a private meeting or communicate with the student by some other means. The faculty member must initiate this communication with the student within 15 calendar days of discovering evidence of academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work. The faculty member then may follow up with one or more of only the following actions: I. To issue a reprimand to the student with letter of explanation to the stu\u00ad dent's file. 2. To require repetition of the questionable work or examination with letter of explanation to the student's file. 3. To reduce the grade to an 'F' or zero, if appropriate, on the questionable work or examination with written notification to the student and a letter of explanation to the student's file. 4. To assign the student a failing grade in the course or otherwise lower the grade in the course with a letter of explanation to the student's file. It is essential that any such action be reported in writing to the student in a letter from the faculty member. Copies of this letter must also be sent to (a) the Associate Dean of the faculty member's school, (b) the Associate Dean of the student's school, who will maintain a file of cases of academic misconduct involving students enrolled in that school, and (c) the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appro\u00ad priate. The faculty member is strongly encouraged to consult with the Asso\u00ad ciate (Undergraduate or Graduate) Dean of his or her school before the letter is drafted. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Honesty should be included in the letter. If action (4) is taken, the faculty member is responsible for making certain that the failure is recorded by the Registrar on the student's permanent academic record. Careful docu\u00ad mentation of the incident must be maintained by the faculty member in the event that his or her actions in the case should later be subject to review. Responsibilities of the Academic Associate Deans 1. The Associate (Graduate or Undergraduate) Dean of either the accused student's school or of the faculty member's school may impose cam\u00ad puswide sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Associate Deans are final \u00b7unless the student requests a hearing within 15 calendar days of notifica\u00ad tion. The 15-day period starts from the time the Associate Dean has noti\u00ad fied the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the heating and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. It is recommended that each\u00b7 case be brought to a final resolution within 90 days of instruction. 2. The Associate Dean (or equivalent official) of each school is responsible for maintaining confidential records concerning academic dishonesty of students enrolled in that school. All letters reporting faculty-imposed aca\u00ad demic penalties for academic misconduct will be included in these files. 3. The Associate Dean of the accused student's school will be responsible for identifying all incidents which represent repeated offenses by a stu\u00ad dent and may impose a campuswide sanction because of repeat offenses. 4. Associate Deans are required to notify the student of the hearing and appeal process and provide the student a copy of this policy or explicitly refer the student to it. If an Associate Dean suspects grounds for a griev\u00ad ance involving discrimination, the student should be referred to Part 3 of The Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, \"Student Academic Grievance Procedures\" (which is limited to allegations of discrimination). 5. In those classes where academic dishonesty continues to be a problem and the faculty member or another university official has already been approached by the student(s) from the class, the Associate Dean will con\u00ad sult with the appropriate faculty member to address the problem. 6. Students who have on file recorded acts of academic dishonesty, as defined by the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, may be excluded by the Associate Deans from consideration for academic honors at graduation. Exclusion from consideration for honors is not for the purposes of this policy to be considered a campuswide UC IRVINE - 2003-2004496 UCI 2003-04 Appendix sanction. Students excluded from such consideration under this policy therefore are not eligible to request a formal hearing. 7. In those situations where a campuswide sanction is imposed and the stu\u00ad dent requests a hearing, the Associate Dean will forward to the Commit\u00ad tee on Academic Honesty the materials which led him or her to impose the sanction. In addition, the Associate Dean will appear before the Com\u00ad mittee to discuss the case upon request of the Committee. Student Hearings When any student accused of academic dishonesty wishes to contest an action by a faculty member, the student may, within a 15-day period, request mediation by writing to the Associate Dean of the faculty member or to the Ombudsman. However, it should be understood that all grades are ultimately the responsibility of faculty. The period is 15 calendar days and starts from the time the Associate Dean has notified the student of the discipline or has notified the student of the hearing and appeal process by providing a copy of this policy, whichever comes later. When a campuswide sanction is imposed, the affected student may, within 15 days of notification, request a hearing before the Committee on Academic Honesty. Students considering a hearing in response to campuswide sanctions for alleged academic misconduct are urged to contact the Associate Dean of their academic school and/or the University Ombudsman concerning possible sources of advice and assistance. Students should be advised regarding the grounds for appeal as specified in section I 03.11 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. Role of the Ombudsman The services of the Ombudsman may be requested at any time by the student, the faculty member, or the Associate Dean. The role of the Ombudsman is to assist in conflict resolution, mediate the dispute, perform an informal investi\u00ad gation of the case, and clarify policies and procedures for anyone involved. In those incidents where imposition of a campuswide sanction is a considera\u00ad tion and the student has requested a hearing, the case will be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate. An investigation may be conducted by the Ombudsman who will then confer with the Associate Dean and the accused student. However, the findings of the Ombudsman will not be for\u00ad warded to the Committee on Academic Honesty. The case may be referred by either the student or the Ombudsman to either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate, who will be responsible for convening the Committee on Academic Honesty. Students should always be informed by the Associate Dean of their school of their right to secure the assistance of the Ombudsman in understanding and addressing the problem or issue. Role of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Graduate Studies Whenever an incident of academic misconduct is referred to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies by the student or the Ombudsman, a representative of the appropriate offices will meet with the student and, if requested, explain the process and arrange the time and place of a hearing before the appropriate (Undergraduate or Gradu\u00ad ate) Committee on Academic Honesty. The appropriate Dean will maintain a record of all cases of academic dishonesty reported by the respective Associ\u00ad ate Deans. Formal resolution by the appropriate Committee on Academic Honesty may result in the imposition by the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies of one or more of the sanctions described in section 105.00 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, including suspension or dismissal from the University. E. COMMITIEE ON ACADEMIC HONESTY 1. Jurisdiction of the Committees on Academic Honesty There will be two Committees on Academic Honesty. One Committee will hear cases of campuswide sanctions on undergraduate students while the other will hear graduate student cases. The Committees can reduce, affirm, or increase sanctions. 2. Composition of the Committees on Academic Honesty The Committees on Academic Honesty will be standing administrative committees composed of two faculty, two students, and a representative of either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Dean of Graduate Studies, as appropriate. Terms of faculty members will be two years. One faculty member will be appointed annually by either the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies, as appropriate for the particular committee. To ensure continuity, terms will be staggered; during the first year of opera\u00ad tion only, one faculty member will be appointed for a one-year term. One additional faculty member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. The two students shall serve for one year and will be appointed by either ASUCI or AGS as appropriate to the specific committee. One additional student member will be appointed to serve as an alternate to each of the Committees. 3. Role of the Associate Dean The Associate Dean will forward to the committee the evidence which led to his or her decision to impose the campuswide sanction. In addition, the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean will appear before the Connnittee to comment on the case if the Committee wishes. 4. Hearings a. If the student requests a hearing, the Dean of Undergraduate Education or the Dean of Graduate Studies shall schedule a hearing of the case before the appropriate Committee. Written notice must be given to the parties involved regarding the date, time, and place of the hearing. b. The chair will be elected by the membership of the committee. The chair will rule on all questions of procedure, the admission or exclusion of evi\u00ad dence, and the need to call witnesses for additional testimony. Hearings shall be held in accordance with generally accepted standards of proce\u00ad dural due process. c. Hearings will be closed unless the parties involved agree to an open hear\u00ad ing. Every effort must be made by all parties to maintain confidentiality during the process. d. Hearings shall be held following the provisions in sections 103.11. (5, 6, and 8) of the Policy on Student Conduct and Discipline in the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, except that the role of the Dean of Students shall be filled by the Dean of Undergrad\u00ad uate Education or Graduate Studies, depending on the status of the student. 5. Report of the Committee on Academic Honesty After the hearing the Committee shall arrive at a decision. When a decision is reached, the student and the appropriate Academic Associate Dean will be informed of the judgment. 6. Final Appeal If the campus wide sanction is upheld by the Committee, the report of the Committee and all supporting evidence can be sent for a final level of review at the request of the student. If the accused student is an undergraduate, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. If the accused student is a graduate student, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of Undergradu\u00ad ate Education. This final review process can only result in decreasing the sanctions imposed on the student or leaving them unchanged. There are no further appeals or processes. 7.1mplementation Once the judgment has been rendered the Dean of Undergraduate Education or Graduate Studies will implement the judgment in the form of a letter to the student as well as initiate any other necessary administrative actions. F. MAINTENANCE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS Records relating to academic dishonesty will be maintained by the Associate Deans and the Offices of the Deans of Undergraduate Education and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies to promote consistency of penalties for a given offense and to ensure appropriate action against repeat offenders. Records will normally be destroyed after five years, unless the Associate Dean determines in any par\u00ad ticular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. In order to ensure that minor and nonrecurring infractions do not negatively impact a student's career beyond UCI, any student may petition to the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean of his or her academic school to have \u00b7relevant academic discipli\u00ad nary records expunged after the record is two years old or upon graduation, whichever comes first. The Associate Dean has sole authority to consider and to grant or deny such petitions. The University will release a student's disci\u00ad plinary records to potential employers, governmental agencies, other educa\u00ad tional institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law. Any record expunged UC IRVINE - 2003-2004by the Associate Dean will also be erased in the Dean of Undergraduate Edu\u00ad cation or Graduate Studies Offices. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION This policy is intended to focus solely on issues related to academic dishon\u00ad esty. Certain details of the implementation of procedures specified here can be found in the UCI publication Policies Applying to Campus Activities. Organizations, and Students, available free of charge from the Office of the Ombudsman, located in 437 Administration; the Office of the Dean of Stu\u00ad dents, located in the UCI Student Center; and on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/judicialluci_policy.htmll. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and welfare of the indi\u00ad viduals involved. In January 1988, the Education Code of the State of Cali\u00ad fornia was modified to reflect changes to the State's anti-hazing statute. In accordance with the revised Education Code, students are advised of the following: Education Code 32050 As used in this article, hazing includes any method of initiation or preinitia\u00ad tion into a student organization or any pastime or amusement engaged in with respect to such an organization which causes, or is likely to cause, bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physi\u00ad cal or mental harm, to any student or other person attending any school, com\u00ad munity college, college, university, or other educational institutions in this state; but the term \"hazing\" does not include cusiomary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions. Education Code 32051 No student, or other person in attendance at any public, private, parochial, or military school, community college, college, or other educational institution, shall conspire to engage in hazing, participate in hazing, or commit any act that causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to any fellow student or person attending the institution. The violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($1 00), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. Education Code 32052 Any person who participates in the hazing of another, or any corporation or association which knowingly permits hazing to be conducted by its members or by others subject to its direction or control, shall forfeit any entitlement to State funds, scholarships, or awards which are enjoyed by him, by her, or by it, and shall be deprived of any sanction or approval granted by any public educational institution or agency. Copies of Sections 32050 through 32052 as well as UCI's policies regarding hazing are available from the Office of the Dean of Students, UCI Student Center. See Appendix F on the World Wide Web at http://www.dos.uci.edu/ judicial/uci_policy.html. Computer- and Network-Use Policy The University of California, Irvine (UCI) provides computing resources and worldwide network access to members of the UCI electronic community for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate, access knowledge, and retrieve and disseminate information. All members of the UCI community (faculty, staff, students, and authorized guests) sharing these resources also share the rights and responsibilities for their use. Rights and Responsibilities Worldwide, open-access electronic communication is a privilege and contin: ued access requires that users act responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from violation, destruction, theft, or other abuse. Users sharing computing resources must respect and value the rights and privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regula\u00ad tions, and contractual obligations. Users are responsible for refraining from acts that waste resources, prevent others from using them, harm resources or Appendix 497 information, or abuse other people. To help protect files, users are responsible for setting passwords appropriately and for keeping passwords confidential by not giving them to another person. Most UCI-owned computers are under the control of a system administrator or lab manager. These administrators are expected to respect the privacy of computer system users. However, UCI computer system administrators may access user files or suspend services on the systems they manage without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use, misuse, or have been cor\u00ad rupted or damaged. This includes temporarily locking vulnerable accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource intensive jobs, and such. Many UCI departments have their own computing and networking resources and policies. Wben accessing computing resources, users are responsible for obeying both the policies described here and the policies of other depart\u00ad ments. Student responsibilities are also described in the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. In addition, all users are responsible for obeying policies of off-campus network services accessed using UCI resources. Examples of Misuse Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to: Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended solely for the purpose of dam\u00ad aging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bots, flash programs, or password cracking programs. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent of the system administrator. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data. Using computers or electronic mail to act abusively toward others or to provoke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of vio\u00ad lence, or other hostile or intimidating \"fighting words.\" Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize or stigmatize individu\u00ad als on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disabil\u00ad ity, and other protected characteristics. Posting on electronic bulletin boards or Web pages materials that violate the University's codes of conduct (faculty, student). This includes posting information that is slanderous or defamatory in nature or displaying graphically disturbing or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that are in view of other individuals. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communi\u00ad cations or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Using campus networks to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to any computer system. Using a computer account or obtaining a password without appropriate authorization. Facilitating or allowing use of a computer account and/or password by an unauthorized person. Employing, either directly or by implication, a false identity when using an account or other electronic resources. This includes sending unautho\u00ad rized mail that appears to come from someone else. Performing an act without authorization that will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, networks, or will interfere with others' ability to make use of th~ resources. Using an account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to work at UCI, such as consulting services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commercial enter\u00ad prises for personal financial gain. Deliberately wasting computing resources, such as playing games (for example, MUDS or IRC) while someone else is waiting to use the com\u00ad puter for UCI-related work, sending chain letters, spamming, treating printers like copy machines, storing or moving large files that could com\u00ad promise system integrity or preclude other users' right of access to disk storage, and the like. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004498 UCI 2003-04 Appendix Consequences of Misuse Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privileges and/or Federal or State legal prosecution. Appropriate corrective action or discipline may be taken in conformance with applicable personnel policies, student policies, collective bargaining 'agreements, and procedures established by the Academic Senate. California Penal Code, Section 502 makes certain com\u00ad puter abuses a crime, (such as illegal reproduction of software protected by U. S. copyright law) and penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment. Files may be subject to search under proper authorization. Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, overload\u00ad ing systems, excessive disk space consumption, are typically handled inter\u00ad nally to the department in an informal manner. More serious infractions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to circum\u00ad vent system security, and the like are handled formally through the Office of the Dean of Students or by other appropriate officials. Contact Information For additional information, contact Network & Academic Computing Ser\u00ad vices (E2130 Engineering Gateway Building) by calling (949) 824-6116, or by sending electronic mail to nacs@uci.edu. Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records per\u00ad taining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as medical records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students\u00ad include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disci\u00ad plinary records, and financial aid records. At UCI, an \"applicant\" becomes a \"student\" at the time of submission of the Statement of Intent to Register form. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large mea\u00ad sure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and proce\u00ad dures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit stu\u00ad dents access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Infor\u00ad mation from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; \u00b7 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202-4605; World Wide Web: http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/ fpco/aboutus.html; 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further; confidential information can be disclosed without prior written con\u00ad sent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of cenain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or sub\u00ad poena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supponed educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose informa\u00ad tion. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Stu\u00ad dents for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Photo; Address (e-mail, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, number of course units in which enrolled, degrees and honors received; Grade level; Enrollment status, e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these cate\u00ad gories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any hon\u00ad ors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers with\u00ad out the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that stu\u00ad dent and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the University Ombudsman, 437 Administration. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office cur\u00ad rently informed as changes to personal data occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, copies of which are avail\u00ad able in the Office of the Dean of Students and on the World Wide Web at http://www.students.uci.edu/-students/JUDICIAUuci_policy.htrnl.

UCIPD and UCI administra\u00ad tion make continual efforts to reduce crime on campus and at the Medical Center. The following information is excerpted from the Crime Awareness Bulletin, which is published annually in Septem\u00ad ber and distributed to new and continuing students, as well as to faculty and staff, at both the campus and the Medical Center. SAFETY TIPS Day and night, no matter where you go, you should be aware of your surroundings, should exercise good common sense, and should use safety precautions as\u00b7 you would elsewhere. Theft is the most common security problem. Property theft is preventable if you keep your personal belongings (backpack, laptop computer, cellular phone) in sight, within arm's length, or secured in a locked place. Students living on campus should keep their doors locked at all times. Faculty and staff should keep valuables locked up while they are in their workplace. The last person to leave a laboratory or building should lock the doors. Report the presence of unknown visitors or suspicious persons to the UCI Police Department or UCI Medical Center Security as soon as possible. Use the UCI Safety Escort Service (949-824-SAFE) if you are out at night, don't walk alone-walk inpairs, and learn the location of the Emergency Call Boxes (Blue Light Phones). EMERGENCY CALL BOXES (~LUE LIGHT PHONES) Both the campus and the Medical Center have emergency call boxes (Blue Light Phones). Use them to report emergencies, crimes, suspicious persons or activities, accidents, safety hazards, and to call for a Safety Escort. The campus has 57 Blue Light Phones scattered around the ring mall and in parking structures and lots. (See the campus map for locations.) The blue light on the box easily identifies them, and the boxes detect all sounds within a 15-foot radius. To use the phone, just push the button located on the front of the call box. You are then automatically connected to the UCI Police Department. The Medical Center has 21 emergency call boxes located throughout the complex and in the southeast comer of the Manchester parking lot. These phones are connected to the UCIPD dispatcher. SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICIES UCI is designated a drug-free environment, and only under certain conditions is the consumption of alcohol permitted. The sale, man\u00ad ufacture, distribution, or possession of any controlled substance is illegal under both state and federal laws. Such laws are strictly enforced by UCIPD. All members of the UCI community-students, faculty, and staff-who violate these laws are subject to disciplinary action, criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment. Sales, consumption, and the furnishing of alcohol on the UCI cam\u00ad pus are restricted by UCI's Alcohol Policy and California State law and are controlled by the California Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control (ABC). However, ABC and UCIPD share enforcement of alcohol laws on campus. It is unlawful to sell, fur\u00ad nish, or give alcohol to a person under the age of 21 years (this includes the Anthill Pub & Grille). The possession of alcohol by anyone under 21 in a public place, or in a place open to the public, is illegal. It is also a violation of UCI's Alcohol Policy for anyone under the age of 21 to consume or possess alcohol in any public or private housing area on campus. Students and employees found violating alcohoVsubstance policies or laws could be subject to sanctions by the University. WEAPONS POLICY It is a serious violation of the law to possess a firearm on Univer\u00ad sity property. Section 626.9 of the California Penal Code makes it a felony to bring or to possess a firearm on the grounds, or within buildings (including private residences) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia, without the written permission of the Chancellor or the Chancellor's designee. Please report to the UCI Police Department anyone who has stated that they have a gun on campus or who has made a threat to use a firearm on campus. You can ask to be anonymous when reporting. UC IRVINE - 2003-2004TO REPORT AN INCIDENT To build a safe community UCIPD needs your help. If you become suspicious about unknown visitors or someone's actions appearing unusual for the time and place, call UCIPD. They will assess the situation and take the appropriate action. Please report crimes; you can ask to be anonymous. On campus, dial 9-1-1 or (949) 824-5222 for a police, medical, or fire emergency. For non-emergency police services dial (949) 824-5223. The UCI Police Department's campus office is open 24 hours a day and is located on the ground floor of the Public Ser\u00ad vices Building, at the corner of East Peltason and Pereira Drives. At the Medical Center, dial 9-1-1 or (714) 456-5222 for a police emergency, (714) 456-6123 for a fire or medical situation. The Medical Center Security office is located in Building 2 adjacent to the Emergency Department's ambulance ramp. Crimes occurring off campus should be reported immediately to the city/state law enforcement agency where the crime occurred. UCI CRIME STATISTICS Pursuant to the Federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Secu\u00ad rity Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1999, the Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine annually makes available to all students, faculty, and staff statistics on the reported occurrences of criminal activity on and off campus and at the UCI Medical Center. The University of California, Irvine's annual security report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings owned and controlled by UCI, at the UCI Medical Center, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus and Medical Center. The report also includes insti\u00ad tutional policies concerning alcohol and drug use, criine prevention, the reporting of crimes, sexual assault, and other matters. To obtain a copy of this report go to the UCI Police Department Web site at http://www.police.uci.edu/studentright.html, or visit the Depart\u00ad ment in person.
