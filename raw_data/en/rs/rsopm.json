Whether you're trying to ward off infection or simply want to feel great, it all starts with how you treat your body.", "sitename": "Moringa Vinga", "date": "2022-10-10", "cleaned_text": "The immune system is a network of cells, organs, and tissues that work together to help protect the body from diseases, inflammation, and other infections. While genetics play a role, we know from studies that the strength of our immune system is largely determined by our lifestyle factors. So is \"boosting\" the health of your immune system really a thing? Although there isn't any one single thing we can generally do to all of a sudden turn our immunity on against disease and infection, there are things within our control that can work together to actually support the balance and harmony of a healthy immune system and its response. Restoring Balance and Harmony In Your Body The following is a list of some healthy-living strategies (along with some intriguing studies) that may be able to help take your immune system response to the next level. Additionally, we'll share with you why the thoughtfully selected ingredients in our Elderberry & Holy Basil Vinga are always a smart choice for any health and wellness plan. - Sleep more - Decrease your stress levels - Increase your vitamin D levels - Include fermented foods in your diet - Make our Elderberry & Holy Basil Vinga part of your daily practice #1: Sleep More It all starts with sleep. Simply put, an immune system deprived of sleep just doesn't work as well. One study took a group of subjects willing to be exposed to the cold virus. [This study showed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531403/) that while not all subjects got sick, the short sleepers (subjects who slept less than 6 hours a night) were 4.2 times more likely to catch the virus than those who got over 7 hours a night. #2: Decrease Your Stress Levels We all know how it feels to be stressed out. But did you know that stress can also make you more susceptible to respiratory illness? [A study by Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1713648) exposed subjects to the cold virus and then quarantined them for continued observation. Surprisingly enough, the individuals who reported less stress in their lives were actually less prone to developed cold-like symptoms. Another study from Ohio State University took a look at the impact of conflict between married couples (as it pertained to the immune system). Researchers inflicted small wounds on the arms of the subjects before proceeding to ask the couples to discuss unpleasant and stressful topics. The [researchers found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330726) that when the couples argued, their wounds took (on average) a full day longer to heal then after the sessions in which they discussed something pleasant. Why would these individuals sign up to participate in such a study? We were asking ourselves the same thing - we can't really say. However, the proof is there. Decrease your stress levels! #3: Increase Your Vitamin D Levels Supplementing with vitamin D could help improve your immune system, making it stronger in fighting off respiratory illness and disease. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543548/) conducted over the course of a year found that elderly patients that supplemented with high doses of vitamin D had 40 percent fewer respiratory infections compared to individuals who supplemented with a standard dose. #4: Include Fermented Foods In Your Diet Did you know that leaky gut syndrome may lead to a weakened immune system? This is why it's important to consume fermented foods and raw probiotic supplements to improve the health and strength of your gut microbiome. Probiotics are good bacteria that help you digest nutrients that boost the detoxification of your colon and support your immune system. Probiotics [have been thought](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539293/) to restore the composition of the gut microbiome and introduce beneficial functions to the gut microbiome in general. [One study found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499072) that supplementing with probiotics in infancy could improve the gut immune system and increase the number of immunoglobulin cells and cytokine-producing cells in the intestines, leading to a healthier immune system. #5: Make Our Elderberry & Holy Basil Vinga a Part of Your Daily Practice Moringa Vinga supplies you with a number of different benefits. But when it comes to ingredients that strengthen your body's immune response, one of our infusions stands out. Yep, that's right, our Elderberry and Holy Basil Vinga. Also, if you have any little ones in your home you may want to read our post on [Is Moringa Safe for Kids](https://moringavinga.com/is-moringa-safe-for-kids/). So What's So Special About the Ingredients Found in Our Elderberry & Holy Basil vinga? - Unpasteurized Apple Cider Vinegar (with Mother) - Raw Wild Honey - Moringa (vitamins, minerals, and ALL of your essential amino acids-but focus on Vitamin C) - Elderberry - Holy Basil - Hibiscus - Rose Hips - Ginger Root - Orange Peel Apple Cider Vinegar (with Mother) We've all heard of it. It's been used around the world for a number of powerful health benefits for centuries. Some of these benefits include:[ [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788933/)][ [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426415/)][ [16](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602197)] - Help [kill harmful [reducing blood pressure](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) - May help [lower blood sugar levels and manage diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426415/) - Aids in [lowering cholesterol](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) - Supports [skin health](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) - May aid in [weight loss](https://moringavinga.com/is-your-gut-health-hurting-your-weight/) - Help [detoxify the liver](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) - May aid in [cleansing the lymph nodes](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) - Support the [immune system](https://moringavinga.com/21-uses-for-apple-cider-vinegar-with-research-and-studies/) But how does it help the immune system, exactly? Unpasteurized Apple Cider Vinegar (with mother) ACV is fermented by yeast and bacteria, which turns the sugar into alcohol. It then undergoes a second fermentation which actually converts all of the alcohol into acetic acid. This fermentation process accounts for the many health benefits of ACV. Our Vinga infusions are only made with raw, unheated and unfiltered ACV made with organic apples from southwestern Colorado. That means that the \"mother\" is intact. The \"mother\" is a dense group of proteins, enzymes and beneficial bacteria that can enhance the health of your digestive system and supply your body with some amazing gut bacteria benefits like increased immunity and an improved capacity to digest and absorb nutrients. Fermentation adds another valuable piece to the puzzle. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (some of the most widely studied microorganisms today) synthesize different vitamins and minerals, producing peptides with enzymes such as proteinase and peptidase. Compounds known as biologically active peptides, which are produced by the bacteria responsible for fermentation, are also [well known for their health benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945458). Raw Wild Honey Raw, unpasteurized honey is a strong source of antioxidants and antibacterial properties that help improve the digestive system and support the immune system. [One study showed](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20040330/honey-sweetens-your-health) a direct link between honey consumption and levels of disease-fighting antioxidants in blood for some 25 participants that consumed 4 tablespoons of honey per day for 29 days in addition to their regular diets. Our Elderberry and Holy Basil infusion contains raw, Wildflower honey from Colorado bees. The top health benefits of this honey include its ability to increase energy levels, ease allergies, aid in chronic diseases prevention, and improve skin health. This raw honey has been believed to: - Provide a good [source of antioxidants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5424551/) - Help wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941901/) - the \"tree of life,\"supplies anti-inflammatory and healing compounds that your body will thank you for. [Moringa](https://moringavinga.com/blog-1/2020/2/28/moringa-the-adaptogen-you-should-know-about) provides a number of different health benefits and has been used in treatments for various conditions [including](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1713648): [Inflammatory diseases](https://moringavinga.com/moringa-the-adaptogen-you-should-know-about/) [Arthritis](https://moringavinga.com/moringa-the-adaptogen-you-should-know-about/)and other joint pain [Allergies This plant is a nutritional powerhouse that is loaded with a number of vitamins, minerals and all of your amino acids. When used in combination with rose hip and orange peel, this infusion has high levels of vitamin C and also provides anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties. One of the main reasons people love adding vitamin C to their supplements is to [improve their immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157026). Vitamin C helps improve the production of white blood cells known as lymphocytes and phagocytes, which help protect the body against infection such as the common cold and flu. Vitamin C Vitamin C helps the immune system fight off inflammation and out of control cells. A diet [rich in this vitamin can help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492638/) reduce oxidative stress in your body. Vitamin C is also [known to help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6071228/) beat depression and the ill effects of stress, making it an important factor in keeping you mentally, as well as physically healthy. This vitamin is found in orange peels as well and is highly concentrated in immune cells. Surprisingly enough, it is [quickly depleted during an infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16373990). In fact, a vitamin C deficiency significantly weakens immunity and [increases the risk of infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29099763). [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295174/#__ffn_sectitle) took a look at a 20-year-old woman diagnosed with ARDS (a virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome). When mechanical ventilation in the hospital had failed, the doctors resorted to administering a high dose of vitamin C to the patient that was associated with \"rapid resolution of lung injury.\" She made a full recovery by the seventh day of supplementation. For this reason, getting enough vitamin C during infection may be a good idea. Elderberry The elderberry is measured as one of the highest berries in antioxidant power. It has been used in different cultures around the world for thousands of years in medical practice. However, ancient medicine isn't the only proof of this plant's health benefits. Several studies have shown just how powerful elderberries can be. [One study found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080016) that when elderberry was consumed within the first 48 hours of onset of flu-like symptoms, the extract decreased the time period of the flu, with symptoms being relieved on an average of four days earlier. Holy Basil Holy Basil is a key player in supporting a healthy immune system as well as reducing stress. In fact, [some studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2329804) that this plant prevents stress-induced ulcers in rat subjects with a decrease in stress comparable to antidepressant drugs. Holy basil plays an important role in immunity as well. A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology gave participants capsules of extracts of basil leaves or a placebo. After 4 weeks, blood from the participants was taken and the samples were analyzed for Th1 and Th2 cytokines (immune system mediators that generate responses against bacteria and viruses). [The results showed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21619917) an increase in the levels of these mediators compared to the placebo group. Hibiscus Hibiscus may be helpful with a number of things including treating loss of appetite, colds, heart diseases, upper respiratory pain, fluid retention, upset stomach, and inflammation. Supplementing with hibiscus tea [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22331521) to increase antioxidants found in the bloodstream and reduce compounds that can contribute to oxidative stress that damages cells. Rose Hips Rose hips are another ingredient in our Elderberry & Holy Basil Moringa Vinga. Rose hips are high in antioxidants, especially vitamin C. These particular compounds offer various benefits for your health including:[ [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403209/)][ [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892499/?tool=pmcentrez&report=abstract)] - Improve [aging](https://moringavinga.com/a-mindful-approach-to-holiday-stress-with-the-help-of-moringa-vinga/) - Reduce [arthritis [weight loss](https://moringavinga.com/is-your-gut-health-hurting-your-weight/) - May improve [heart health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892499/?tool=pmcentrez&report=abstract) Ginger Root Ginger is extremely popular among health gurus and individuals alike and it's no secret why. The benefits this root provides are truly endless. Ginger root provides individuals with anti-inflammatory properties to help fight off harmful disease. Not only that, but ginger has been shown to help improve chronic indigestion. When it comes to indigestion, it is thought that the cause is due to delayed emptying of the stomach by the body. Ginger [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18403946) to speed up this emptying of the stomach.
