This is a very unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of Faith and Science. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff who have chosen to be part of this experience we call Loma Linda. They have chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We emphasize what we call mission-focused learning. This means that what we offer centers on more than producing knowledgeable professionals because we believe that who you are is even more important than what you know. To assist in this lifelong process, we are encouraging the enculturation of our seven core values, known by the acronym JCHIEFS. These values are Justice, Compassion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and find ways to strengthen these virtues in everything you do. You also will find an incredible mixture of cultural diversity on our campus. Revel in our similarities and differences, and use each interaction to help you understand the issues that separate us. With understanding comes acceptance. And with acceptance come peace and fellowship. Use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures from whom you can learn and gain greater understanding. We will all be better as we tear down those barriers that often separate us.All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, active in the lives and experiences of each of us. Through our weekly University at Worship, the prayers of faculty in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me in getting to know Him better. Place your future in His hands. Have confidence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowship and grow in His love. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 45,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P.H. President Loma Linda University10 Programs, Degrees, and Certificates Programs, Degrees, and Certificates The degree and certificate curricula at Loma Linda University are under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improvement without prior notice, as the need occurs. The University also offers nondegree and short courses throughout the United States and globally to meet the continuing education and extension program needs of alumni, health professionals, and lay persons in the church and in the community. Most degree courses are approved for continuing education credit. School-specific certificates are awarded upon completion of organized programs of study at the postsecondary level. Students register for courses through the Office of University Records; but the certificate is issued by the school, which maintains records of the certificate and its awarding. Financial aid is not available to students registered in school- specific programs. See school programs in each school for a listing of school-specific certificates available. The Faculty of Graduate Studies oversees Ph.D. and research master's degrees, as well as combined degrees programs.

Affirmative Action The University routinely monitors its educational and employment practices regarding women, minorities, and the disabled to ensure compliance with the law and University policy. The University's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violationLoma Linda University 2017-2018 13 of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the Title IX coordinator. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; as well as with local and state requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential. Nondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies; and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races; and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of veteran status, handicap, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventistsin admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of Sec. 12926 (d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article 1, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh- day Adventist church.14 The Academic Calendar The Academic Calendar Academic dates for Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) and the Schools of: AH Allied Health Professions BH Behavioral Health SD Dentistry SM Medicine SN Nursing SP Pharmacy PH Public Health SR Religion 2017 January 3 SP Winter Quarter begins 3 SD Winter Quarter begins (all programs) 3 U Winter Quarter begin date: Last day to register without a late fee (standard term programs) 4 SD Winter Quarter instruction begins (DDS, IDP, DH) 4 U First day of $200 late registration fee (standard term programs) 4-10 PH Late registration begins (late fee of $200 assessed) 5-January 3PH Registration without late fee 8 SD Clinic with a Heart 9-13 U Week of Renewal 16 U Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday 17 U Last day to drop without a \"W\" (standard term courses) 29 U University-wide open house February 4 SN Nursing Dedication Service 10 SR Winter Vespers 17 SM First-year family day and dedication service 20 U President's Day holiday 28 U Last day to drop with a \"W\" (standard term courses) March 1 U Last day for schools to submit academic variances to University Records for Autumn graduates 2-6 SD University-wide Homecoming Convention 3-6 SM Alumni Postgraduate Convention 3 PH Deadline for submission of completed dissertation;

In 1905, the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care\u2014a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility \u2014a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health sciences university\u2014part of a complex that includes Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (Summer 2017) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,877 full-time teachers.

Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise in an environment permeated by religious values benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of a person's life, unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.\" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. Winslow, Ph.D., SCOPE , Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted definition of wholeness in the Loma Linda University Wholeness Inventory. Core Values of Loma Linda University The University affirms these values as central to its view of education: COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM\u2014 The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. JUSTICE\u2014 The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL\u2014 The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY\u2014 The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. Institutional Learning Outcomes Loma Linda University's institutional learning outcomes (ILOs) for students are assessed throughout the degree programs within the University appropriate for the discipline and degree. The Office of Educational Effectiveness works with these programs to guide their20 University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal assessment. For more in-depth information about LLU's ILO assessment, please see: http://www.llu.edu/central/assessment Critical thinking: Students demonstrate critical thinking through examination of ideas and evidence before formulating an opinion or conclusion. Information literacy : Students demonstrate the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, utilize, and share information. Oral communication : Students demonstrate effective oral communication skills in English. Quantitative reasoning : Students demonstrate the ability to reason and develop evidence-based decisions using numerical information. Written communication : Students demonstrate effective written communication skills in English. Mission-focused learning outcomes Loma Linda University's three mission-focused learning outcomes (MFLOs) are firmly rooted in its mission, vision, and values (p. 19). Because mission-focused learning is LLU's culture, the University is developing specialized assessment processes to ensure integration of these outcomes over time. Wholeness : Students integrate wholeness in their personal and professional lives: Loved by God, growing in health, living with purpose in community. Values : Students integrate LLU's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally, the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest officer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful oval that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University \u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the Christian cross\u2014a universal symbol\u2014acknowledges the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer. The lighted torch\u2014part of our logo since 1959\u2014suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the central role of the Holy Spirit in teaching andhealing. It also references the institution's call to serve as a light to the world. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine\u2014and part of our logo since the 1920s\u2014represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the branch of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the laurel branch, presented to honor personal achievement. Shown together, the oak and laurel branches form a wreath\u2014suggesting that the life-saving and life- enhancing work of the health sciences brings with it an obligation to act honorably, courageously, and selflessly. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this institution\u2014\"To Make Man Whole.\" A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"To make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. Seventh-day Adventist heritage Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. Students come from many different faiths, and respect and sensitivity for all people\u2014regardless of their culture or ethnicity\u2014are viewed as a part of true Christianity. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from those of this academic community. The various perspectives of spiritually committed students are considered to be enriching to this campus and its educational environment. Our unique features Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of the Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours, University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-and-fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well-Loma Linda University 2017-2018 21 prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. University at Worship services In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as University at Worship attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. These programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. Religion classes Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and of themselves as members of its community. Learning Environment Loma Linda University is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to mankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda University interweaves its vision, mission, and core values with its student learning outcomes. The University's mission of wholeness gives focus to the learning environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual) and gives meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health-care institution, critical and analytical thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development. Loma Linda University pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the local and global communities its commitment to upholding integrity, valuing diversity, engaging with the community in service learning scholarship, and honoring the process of ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The University and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly defined student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The University is engaged in systematic academic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment between student learning outcomes and planned academic activities.Program review follows carefully developed schedules as outlined in school-specific assessment matrices. Loma Linda University is committed to using assessment data to guide academic and fiscal master planning for the University. The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas; as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. University student mission-focused learning opportunities SAC Health System (SACHS) Social Action Community Health System (SACHS) is a federally qualified health center affiliated with Loma Linda University Health. It provides low-cost health services at several sites in the Inland Empire, including the new San Bernardino Campus and the established SAC Norton campus. These clinical facilities provide educational opportunities for students and residents from Loma Linda to become involved with patient care and community initiatives. Providing a wide spectrum of primary and specialty medical services, dental care, and mental health\u2014this clinic network is an ideal site to work cross-culturally and develop an understanding of diverse populations. The San Manuel Gateway College is also part of the San Bernardino Campus and provides certificate-level programs to high school graduates entering the health-care work force. Loma Linda University students interact and assist in these training programs. Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) is a Loma Linda University program directed by the Institute for Community Partnerships. The program serves as the on-campus hub for connecting students and staff with volunteer opportunities in the San Bernardino area that are mutually beneficial and sustainable, that meet needs expressed by the local community, and that develop in students a lifelong passion for service. The numerous short-term and long-term community- engagement opportunities range from mentoring high school students, after-school tutoring, health education, college preparation, adult job skills, children's ministry, and a family soccer league. In addition to directly coordinating several programs, CAPS also works closely with local organizations to provide volunteer support for programs and events, and also facilitates students' service learning and community service placement needs. To serve, students create a volunteer interest profile and list interests and availability on the CAPS online volunteer system. They can sign up for upcoming service opportunities, or they will be notified when opportunities in line with their interests are available. More information on volunteer opportunities can be found by visiting the CAPS Web site: caps.llu.edu; by calling (909) 651-5011; or by visiting the CAPS office in the Councilors Student Pavilion, Room 1402.22 Learning Environment Del E. Webb Memorial Library The main library supporting LLUH is the Del E. Webb Memorial Library. The library began in 1907 as a small collection in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium, and the growing collection moved to its own building in 1953. In 1981, funded by a Del E. Webb Foundation grant, construction increased the total floor space of the library to 87,670 square feet. As of June 2016, the library had a total collection of 292,169 print books and bound journals; 10,832 electronic books; and 7,254 currently received print and electronic journal titles. For more detailed statistical information, consult the library's Web site at https://library.llu.edu/about/statistics. Library mission The mission of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of the University's instructional, research, and service programs. To this end, the library provides a full range of information support services and resources including, but not limited to: collaborative and flexible information literacy instruction, information technology training, reference, specialized research support, document delivery, traditional print and digital book and journal collections, computer laboratory, and welcoming physical spaces for group and individual study. Access to resources The Del E. Webb Memorial Library catalog (http://catalog.llu.edu) provides access to all of the library's resources. In addition to the collections of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, other collections included are the Ethics Library, Religion Library, and those belonging to the Geoscience Research Center. The catalog also provides access to the combined book collections of nearly sixty libraries throughout California and Nevada through Link+ (http://linkencore.iii.com), a book- request service and union catalog of contributed holdings. The library participates in national and regional networks such as the National Network of the Libraries of Medicine (NNLM), founded by the National Library of Medicine. The national network is divided into eight regions, one of which is the Pacific Southwest Region. The library is the designated Resource Library for the NNLM in this area of the Pacific Southwest Region. As a resource library for the NNLM, the library maintains deep information resources in the health sciences and further expands its offerings through multiple cooperative agreements with varied local and national groups such as Southern California Electronic Library Consortium (SCELC), and the Inland Empire Academic Library Cooperative (IEALC). Department of Archives and Special Collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository for information on the history of Loma Linda University, Adventist health work around the globe, the history of the health sciences, and the history and development of the Seventh-day Adventist church. Included in the department's collections are the congressional papers of Jerry L. Pettis and Shirley N. Pettis. Jerry Pettis was our first Seventh-day Adventist congressional representative and former College of Medical Evangelists employee. Shirley N. Pettis assumed her husband's congressional seat after his tragic death in 1975. Through departmental purchases and donations large and small, the department now houses one of the significant research collections of Adventist source materials worldwide. Recent collecting efforts made possible by the generous James F. Barnard Endowment have focused on building on an already substantial collection related to biblical prophecy. Thecollections house materials in all formats: print, microform, sound recordings, photographic, manuscript, and digital. The department houses significant collections of materials in all areas of the health sciences, in multiple languages, including a significant collection in the history of nursing that came as a donation from the New York Academy of Medicine. Recent years have focused on the areas where Loma Linda University, the history of the health sciences, and the Seventh-day Adventist church intersect\u2014nineteenth century health reform, diet, vegetarianism, the development of Adventist sanitariums, hydrotherapy, and the like. University Archives The purpose of the original Historical Records Office was to preserve those archival records deemed important to the founding and history of the College of Medical Evangelists. This work is being continued by the official University Archives, which is also under the direction of and housed within the Department of Archives and Special Collections. Loma Linda University Archives houses the official documents and files for all Loma Linda University schools, departments, administrative offices, and other entities. This includes board minutes, president's papers, provost/ chancellor files, University committees, departmental files, photographs of University events, people, buildings, and more. The archives collects and preserves copies of all University publications, such as bulletins, course catalogs, journals, periodicals, departmental newsletters, flyers, posters, and more. Additionally, the archives maintains the copy of record of all theses and dissertations produced by Loma Linda University students. The archives actively seeks the papers of current and former faculty, staff, and students that add to the story of Loma Linda University Health. Ellen G. White Estate Branch Office The Ellen G. White Estate Branch Office, while a separate organizational entity, is physically located within the University Libraries, Del E. Webb Memorial Library; and with the Department of Archives and Special Collections and University Archives, forms part of the Heritage Research Center. The branch office has the mission to preserve, promote, guide, and facilitate an understanding of Ellen G. White's life, writings, and role within the general history of the Seventh-day Adventist church and Loma Linda University. Ellen G. White was one of the founders of the College of Medical Evangelists and was firmly committed to seeing the Adventist medical institution grow, thrive, and fulfill our mission of continuing the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ. Thus, her legacy is an important part of the University's history and future developments. The branch office houses and makes accessible Ellen White's letters, manuscripts, articles, and published works.

Background check After students are accepted and confirmed, they will receive a link on their New Student Portal that will allow them to get a required University- specific background check. Other background checks will not be accepted. Advisement Upon admission into a degree program, each student is assigned an academic advisor who serves as the student's first line of communication in addressing professional and personal successes and potential challenges. Academic advisors are prepared to discuss career opportunities, academic policies, academic problems, curriculum, and personal circumstances. It is the student's responsibility to consult with his/her advisor in planning the program of study. Thereafter, advisees should schedule counseling sessions with their advisors to monitor progress and assure completion of degree requirements. When questions arise relating to curriculum or policy requirements, students should always refer first to the CATALOG and their own program curriculum outline. Next, they may seek counsel from their academic advisor. Questions arising after discussion with the advisor should be referred to the department chair or the academic dean. Orientation and advisement sessions are scheduled for all new students. These sessions provide general guidance regarding student services, health care, library resources, safety and security, registration procedures, and academic policy. International students International applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program before an offer of acceptance can be issued. This includes all official postsecondary transcripts (or mark sheets) and degree certificates, official evaluations of non-U.S. course work, English proficiency, and admission examination requirements, as detailed below. After acceptance into the chosen program, the Office of International Student and Scholar Services will contact international applicants and guide them through the appropriate procedures for obtaining student visas, which includes providing evidence of their financial ability to meet estimated living expenses and all financial obligations to the University that will occur during their program. For questions, please contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955.Pre-entrance examination results All official pre-entrance test scores (e.g., TOEFL, GRE) as required by each program must be sent directly to the Office of University Admissions by the testing organization. International evaluations All international (non-U.S.) transcripts, including high school, must be submitted to one of the LLU-approved evaluation services. See <llu.edu/ central/apply/intltrans.page> for a list of the approved companies. Finances and employment United States immigration regulations and Loma Linda University require that international students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his/her program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce. The student should contact the Loma Linda University Financial Aid office and speak with a financial aid advisor regarding availability and application information. F- and J-visa international students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or fewer per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if a student's program allows summer quarters off). For questions, please call International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Visas F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates and internships). Degree-earning students are subject to study load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: has been accepted into a program and all official transcripts (mark sheets) have been appropriately evaluated and received by the University; has paid the advance deposit, as required by his/her program; and has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding the F-1 student visa and the regulations governing this visa. J-visa exchange program Loma Linda University has an approved exchange visitor program under the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegreeLoma Linda University 2017-2018 27 (continuing education) students, student interns, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. A J-visa application form (i.e., DS-2019) is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for the J-1 and all J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over these exchange visitors since the authority resides with the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can either be degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the exchange visitor program. Other visas International students may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international advisor at each school as soon as the acceptance letter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of every academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student advisor in International Student and Scholar Services. Division of General Studies General education requirements The Division of General Studies offers general education courses that contribute to the fulfillment of requirements that apply to the Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, and Nursing. In addition, these schools offer a variety of general education courses that are open to students across all schools. The Division of General Studies also provides oversight for courses that may be selected to enrich a student's academic experience but that do not fulfill Loma Linda University general education requirements.Loma Linda University philosophy of general education As a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. With its rich spiritual heritage, the University places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University consists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and diversity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultivating their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian principles and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical thinking skills into personal and professional experience. 4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health sciences professions. 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as well as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of University life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless others.

Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. From University to student Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as a professional institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance \u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's section of the Student Handbook . Grievances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published grievance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grievance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recommends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospective students who have questions concerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. Whole person health The University regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bonds and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole person health\u2014balanced30 Student Life development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglecting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interdependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda University may congregate and participate in the multifaceted programs offered that involve the holistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the student to further develop rich, personal spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and desert, the University provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide variety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A variety of University-, school-, and group-sponsored events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable association with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. Mental health The University promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, body building, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to encourage each student to engage in some recreational and health-building activity that may be carried over to enhance future life. Immunizations As a member of a health science university, whether we are directly involved in patient care or not, we are responsible for the wellbeing of others. As a result, Loma Linda University requires that all students receive the flu vaccine annually.

All information is confidential. Community therapists and LLSAP clinicians will not release information without the written consent of the student, with the exception of matters that fall under mandatory reporting laws.The LLSAP, the only nationally accredited student assistance program in California, has provided state-of-the-art services to students since it was established in 1990. Appointments may be scheduled Monday through Wednesday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., by calling on-campus extension 66050 or 909/558-6050; Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Additional appointment times may be available upon request. The program is located in the Hartford Building, 11360 Mountain View Avenue, Suite A, in Loma Linda. Governing practices At Loma Linda University, nonacademic policies have been established that help foster a fulfilling University experience. Students are expected to uphold these policies, which govern nonacademic student life on and off campus. Information in this section of the CATALOG, as well as in the Student Handbook (http://www.llu.edu/student-handbook), pertains to requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed of the general and specific requirements of his/her school and program. Identification number and card All accepted students will be assigned a unique University identification number. This seven-digit number will be used on all correspondence and noted on all payments to the University. A University identification card using this identification number and a bar code will be issued to each student after s/he completes initial registration and financial clearance. The identification card allows access to various student services, including the libraries, Student Health, recreation facilities (i.e., the Drayson Center), parking, etc. Also, the bar code on the card allows currently enrolled and financially cleared students to charge against their accounts at the Campus Bookstore and campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales available through the Student Services office. In subsequent quarters, the card's bar code is automatically reactivated at each registration upon financial clearance. For further information regarding these identification cards, please contact Student Services. Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students. Any single student who prefers to live on campus may do so. Students are expected to live on campus unless they are: married, twenty-one years of age or older, in a graduate program, or living with their parents. Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet one of the foregoing requirements may petition the vice president for student services for a possible exception. This should be done well in advance of registration to allow the student adequate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing Web site at <llu.edu/central/housing>. The student must keep the University informed of his or her current address and telephone number and other contact numbers.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 33 Marriage A student who marries or changes marital status during the academic year must provide the school with advance written notification of the change in status in order to keep school records correct and up to date. It is wise for students to make every effort to schedule their wedding ceremonies during academic recesses. Name change Currently enrolled students may change their names on University records when they provide evidence (e.g., certified copy of a marriage certificate) that the name change is official. In addition to filing with the Office of University Records on University Records forms a request for change of name, the student must present a current ID card or other form of picture ID with his or her name as it appears on University records, along with official documentation of the name change. Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma. Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive articles of dress specified by the department or school and are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specified in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on the required professional dress is provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health-care institution, the profession, the school, and the University. Specific guidelines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook . Personal property The school assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, fire, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transportation arrangements and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car. The University enforces traffic rules and regulations as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Drivers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled \"Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations\" are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Parking. Returning students must renew the registration of their vehicles online with the Department of Parking annually in September. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health-care professionals maintain the highestlevel of confidentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see \"Introduction to HIPAA\" at <home.mc.llumc.edu/Departments/LLUHS-Departments/HIPAA- Information/HIPAA-Help/Introduction-to-HIPAA/Index.html (http:// home.mc.llumc.edu/Departments/LLUHS-Departments/HIPAA- Information/HIPAA-Help/Introduction-to-HIPAA/Index.html) >. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus environment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational or illegal mind-altering substances. Possession or use of these substances may be cause for dismissal. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment\u2014as well as information regarding prevention, detection, assessment, treatment, relapse prevention, confidentiality, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, or careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, students should contact the office of the dean of the school in which they are enrolled. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding sexual harassment and sexual standards can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strength from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the office of the dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on- campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or fewer per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or fewer per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For34 Student Life questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Academic authority The office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of general education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Academic integrity The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments. \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University. Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and their attitudeshave an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment or other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . Grievance procedure Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request that the Office of the Provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Center, etc., may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the student within fourteen days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may\u2014 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council, and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint. An individual may contact the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education for review of a complaint. The bureau may be contacted at 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833; e-mail, http:// www.bppe.ca.gov; telephone, 926/ 431-6924. Copyright violations The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specific conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.\"Loma Linda University 2017-2018 35 If a user requests for or later uses a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use,\" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. Communication devices All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" during class, laboratory, clinic, or chapel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or laboratory unless specifically a part of that activity and approved by the faculty member in charge. Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this section (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school and program. Academic residence A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. Academic standing The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the University: regular standing or academic probation. Catalog in effect for degree requirements Subject to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who failed to register without leave of absence (consult office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled regarding number of quarters), may be required to re-enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. Course numbers Courses are numbered as: 001-099 nondegree-applicable credit 101-299 lower division 301-499 upper division graduate 601-699 graduate: seminar, research, thesis, or dissertation 701-899 professional or clinical 901-999 extension with credit; continuing education units, if preceded by letter prefix ending with \"CE\" (e.g., ASCE 916); without academic credit; or undergraduate certificate clinical affiliation/practicum courses 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approves it and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student isenrolled) give permission, and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. Grade change Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the change of grade form after the initial grade has been entered. Privacy rights of students in academic records Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to students online at <llu.edu/ central/ssweb>. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release directory information concerning students. The University has classified the following as student directory information that may be released: name, address (permanent and local), picture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number\u2014unless the student specifically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will be released only by the academic dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled. Requests for directory information received by other offices of the University will be transferred to the appropriate school office. Repeating a course Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. Transcripts The University provides Loma Linda University transcripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon written request of the student or graduate. The University reserves the right to withhold all information concerning the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of accounts or other charges, including student loans. No transcripts will be issued until all of the student's financial obligations to the University as defined in this CATALOG have been met.36 Academic Policies and Information Scholastic standing Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Nursing or the School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy, or the School of Public Health. D+ 1.3 D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted, except as indicated above. F 0.0 Failure\u2014given when course work was attempted but when minimum performance was not met. FA/UA 0.0 Failure to attend (U/A for S/U graded courses)\u2014given when a student discontinues attendance without withdrawing. Last date attended is to be noted on instructor grade report. S none Satisfactory performance\u2014counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work, as determined by the school in which the student is enrolled. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit-hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit-hour course. CR none Credit for credit by examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for credit by examination. Does not count for any purpose.W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week for standard-term courses. Withdrawals during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice president for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, a W notation will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available online at http://www.llu.edu/ central/ssweb/registration.page\u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade report form, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records along with the grade report form. The I notation is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five-quarter time limit, a grade of UW will be given.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 37 AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the five-week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not met. Student level Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional year 1]). Undergraduate students enrolled in nonblock programs are classified based on the transfer credits accepted that fulfill LLU degree requirements at the time of matriculation. Subsequent updates to classifications will include units earned at LLU. Undergraduate classifications are as follows: 0 - 44.9 quarter units Freshman 45 - 89.9 quarter units Sophomore 90 - 134.9 quarter units Junior 135+ quarter units Senior Academic credit College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having received their initial degree compliance report. A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examinations in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. Course waiver Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which anunsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. Credit by examination For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. Extension study To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Linda University, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Independent study Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request (https:// myllu.llu.edu/apps/studproc/istr/Start.php) form in addition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The office of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study.38 Academic Policies and Information Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. Transfer credit Applicants must file with the Office of University Admissions complete records of all studies taken on the college/university level. Transfer credit is defined as credit completed at another college or university accredited by a U.S. regional association (including all regularly transferable credit earned from a degree-granting institution awarded \"candidacy\" status by its regional accrediting body during the period the institution held this status), credit earned at an institution accredited by the Seventh-day Adventist educational system, or credit earned at an international institution recognized by its government. The University reserves the right to require an applicant to satisfactorily complete written and/or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Remedial, high school-level courses, and courses identified by the transfer institution's catalog as not applicable toward a baccalaureate degree are not accepted for transfer into an undergraduate program. Graduate transfer courses must be equivalent to courses appropriate to degree requirements. Junior colleges A maximum total of 70 semester units or 105 quarter units of credit will be accepted from regionally accredited junior colleges. Subject and unit requirements for admission to the respective programs are outlined in Section III. International Credits submitted from a college outside the United States are evaluated on an individual basis by an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda University, which reports the evaluation results directly to the Office of University Admissions. It is the applicant's responsibility to contact an approved evaluation service and supply the required documents for evaluation. Professional schools Credits earned in a professional school are accepted only from a school recognized by its regional or national accrediting association and only for a course that is essentially the equivalent of what is offered at this University or is substantially relevant to the curriculum. Military schools Credit for studies taken at a military service school is granted to veterans according to recommendations in the Guide of the American Council on Education . Correspondence/distance course work Course work taken at a regionally accredited school is ordinarily accepted. Griggs University (formerly Home Study International) is the officially affiliated correspondence school for Loma Linda University. Unit of credit Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents a minimum of ten class hours in direct instruction (e.g., lecture) or thirty hours in laboratory practice. Enrollment Registration Standard term registration dates are published on the Web at <http:// www.llu.edu/students/university-records/registration-dates.php>. For programs that do not operate on standard term dates, the Registration Portal should be checked for specific registration dates and deadlinesper student since these dates can vary depending on where students are in their program. Deadlines for courses taught in a condensed or extended format may differ from standard term or program deadlines. Course-specific deadlines can be found by going to the Course Schedule <http://www.llu.edu/students/university-records/course-schedule.php>, selecting a course, and clicking on the Course Reference Number (CRN) link. Posted deadlines for registration on the Web and in the Registration Portal are in effect and binding. Students register online using their Registration Portal. Registration procedure includes clearing holds, entering classes, and clearing finance. Upon completion of his or her first registration, the student must obtain an ID card at the University Office of Student Affairs. All future interactions in the Student Services Center will require presentation of a valid student ID card. For standard term programs, a late registration period of five business days after the term begins is provided. If the course is offered as an intensive, it is possible that registration will be required before the end of the five days. During these five business days for standard term courses, a late registration fee of $200 will be charged. Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any term without registration. Change in registration If financial clearance has been obtained and registration is still open for the student's program, a change in registration requires a reversal of financial clearance in the Registration Portal. Students have until 11:59 p.m. PST (Pacific Standard Time) the following day, or until the end of registration (whichever is earlier), to complete registration changes and to request financial clearance again. If financial clearance is not obtained by the end of the following day, any changes made in the Registration Portal will be reversed. Students are advised of this process via their LLU email account. A student may add courses that follow the standard term University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the standard term University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic penalty. Standard term course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record with a \"W\" grade indicating withdrawal. Students may withdraw from a standard term course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an academic load validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment and for living expenses forLoma Linda University 2017-2018 39 aid-eligible students or to maintain immigration status for international students. The primary faculty mentor who is primarily responsible for the student's research is required to sign the load validation form (electronic workflow) verifying that the student will be working on his/her research, thesis, or dissertation for a minimum of 18 hours per week (half-time status) or a minimum of 36 hours per week (full-time status). This is a projection each quarter. The faculty mentor before signing the load validation form for the current quarter must determine that the student indeed qualified for load validation in the previous quarter. Attendance Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, University at Worship) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and/or unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the office of the dean. Continuous enrollment A student who has not enrolled for any classes, or paid the continuous registration fee for courses still in progress from a previous term, will be inactivated at the beginning of the second quarter of nonenrollment, unless s/he is on an approved leave of absence (maximum of four academic quarters, including Summer Quarter). (Example: A student who enrolled for Autumn Quarter but who does not enroll for Winter Quarter will be inactivated at the close of registration [two weeks into the quarter] for the subsequent Spring Quarter). Inactivated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree program are required to reapply with sufficient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements. The reapplication process also requires the submission of official transcripts from all colleges/universities attended since the student last attended this University. Official transcripts from colleges/universities the student attended while enrolled at this University must also be submitted if they were not submitted prior to inactivation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. All graduates are expected to have documented current knowledge in their field of study as of the date of graduation (date on diploma).Personal leave of absence A leave of absence is defined as being away from school for the remainder of the quarter, to a maximum of one year, with the intent to return. The appropriate program withdrawal form (https://myllu.llu.edu/ apps/studproc/pw/Start.php) is an online workflow. This form is to be approved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the office of the dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage and continuous registration during the leave period. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete an Add/Drop Registration form (http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/ssweb/documents/ regchange.pdf) . If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by filing a Program Withdrawal form (https://myllu.llu.edu/ apps/studproc/pw/Start.php) which is a workflow available on the University Web site. The Program Withdrawal form and/or the Add/Drop Registration form should be completed as soon as possible after the student determines that s/he cannot complete the quarter. These forms must be filed no later than fourteen days prior to the end of the quarter. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Section III of this CATALOG. Administrative withdrawal Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence or continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. After one quarter, if the student has not re-enrolled, s/he will be inactivated. Satisfactory academic progress For the purposes of financial aid eligibility, federal regulations governing Title IV HEA program funds require the University to establish a standard of satisfactory academic progress (SAP), and to monitor students' progress toward completion of a degree or certificate. Information relevant to the University's SAP standard is provided below. Students' academic progress is evaluated at least once annually. For students in programs that are less than one academic year in length, academic progress is evaluated at the end of each enrollment period. Failure to meet the University's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) standard requirements may result in financial aid suspension. Financial aid will be reinstated only after eligibility is re-established. The satisfactory academic progress requirements below apply to all University students and are consistently applied, whether or not a student is receiving financial aid.40 Academic Policies and Information Evaluation measures Satisfactory academic progress is evaluated based on three measures: qualitative, quantitative, and maximum time frame. Qualitative. The qualitative measure specifies the grade point average (G.P.A.) that must be achieved at each evaluation. If the G.P.A. is not an appropriate qualitative measure, a comparable assessment measured against a norm will be used. Calculation of the G.P.A. does not include incompletes (I), withdrawals (W), or transfer courses; however, courses repeated for additional credit (such as seminars and research) will be included. Courses repeated for a better grade will include only the most recent grade in the G.P.A. calculation. Quantitative. The quantitative measure specifies the pace at which a student should progress through his/her educational program in order to successfully complete a sufficient number of units at a rate that ensures program completion within the maximum time frame. The pace at which a student is progressing is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of units the student has successfully completed by the cumulative number of units the student has attempted. Units (credit hours) transferred from another institution that are accepted toward the student's educational program will be counted as both attempted and completed units. Maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for an undergraduate program measured in units cannot exceed a period longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program. The maximum time for completion of a master's degree is five years; the maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years. Calculation of the time frame begins with the term in which the first LLU course applicable toward a degree or certificate is taken. Program requirements Undergraduate programs. Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of at least 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Maximum time for completion of an undergraduate program is a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the academic program, as measured in credit hours or in clock hours required and expressed in calendar time. Graduate programs. Graduate students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of at least 3.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. For programs with a limited or no research component, the number of units per term needed to complete the program on time will be determined by dividing the total number of units required for completion by the length of the program\u2014expressed in academic quarters (e.g., five years for a master's degree equals twenty academic quarters, etc.). Research-intensive programs will provide information regarding the number of units that must be completed by the midpoint and three- quarters point of the program. Maximum time for completion of a master's degree is five years; maximum time for completion of a doctoral degree is seven years\u2014except in the case of block programs. Professional practice doctorates. All professional practice doctoral degrees (D.P.T., Pharm.D., D.D.S., M.D.) are block programs requiring students to enroll full time. See specific programs below for SAP policy information. Doctor of Physical Therapy (entry-level D.P.T.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0\u2014with no grade less than C (2.0) in any required course\u2014and must demonstrate satisfactory clinical performance. In addition, they must receive a grade of B or better in AHCJ 510 HumanGross Anatomy (taken during the first quarter of the program). Students must maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or greater than two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in three years; however, if a leave of absence becomes necessary, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is seven years. Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). The G.P.A. required for graduation is 2.30. Students must maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. In addition, students must hold a valid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license. Six years is the maximum time allowed to degree completion, which is also the maximum time intern pharmacist licensure is granted by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.). Students must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 2.0. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Students are expected to complete the program in four years; however, the maximum allowable time to degree completion is six years. Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). In order to progress to the next academic year, students must not receive a U (Unsatisfactory) grade in any course. They must also maintain a cumulative completion rate equal to or exceeding two-thirds (67 percent) of the units attempted. Although students are expected to complete the program in four years, they are allowed to complete the first two years (basic sciences) within three years before progressing to the clinical years (third and fourth years of the program). The two clinical years must be completed within three years. Loss of eligibility for financial aid On the basis of the SAP evaluation, Title IV HEA program funds may be suspended for any of the following reasons: Student fails to achieve the required G.P.A. Student is not successfully completing his/her education program at the required pace. Student is unable to complete the program within the allotted time frame. The student is suspended from federal financial aid eligibility only and may not receive additional financial aid funds. However, s/he may continue enrollment at this University either without any financial assistance or, if eligible, with the assistance of private loans. The Financial Aid Office can supply the student with additional information regarding these loans. Suspension letter A student who fails to meet the University's satisfactory academic progress standard will be informed in writing by the Financial Aid Office that financial aid has been suspended until such time as the student is again in compliance with SAP guidelines. The letter will include instructions regarding the appeal process. Appeal process Students may appeal loss of eligibility for financial aid. Instructions for submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal are available on the Web for students wishing to have their aid reinstated. The appeal must be filed by the deadline specified in the letter of suspension, even if the student believes an error has been made in his/her case. The completed appeal must be submitted to the director of financial aid, who will present it to the SAP Appeals Committee. The Financial Aid Office will notify theLoma Linda University 2017-2018 41 student in writing within five business days following the decision by the appeals committee. The student is required to submit his/her appeal in writing. The appeal must include the following information: A full explanation of the circumstances that led to his/her inability to meet the minimum progress requirements. Supporting documentation verifying the circumstances. A personalized academic plan. With the assistance of his/her academic advisor, the student is expected to explore options available to eliminate the deficiencies; as well as to develop a realistic term-by-term listing of specific courses to be taken towards graduation; and noncourse requirements to be completed (e.g., advancement to candidacy, qualifying examinations, dissertation defense, etc.). This plan is designed to ensure that the student will be able to meet the satisfactory academic progress standard by a specified point in time. The academic plan is signed by the academic advisor, department chair, and school academic dean. If the appeal is approved, the student will be expected to adhere to the units and courses specified in the academic plan portion of the appeal. The academic plan will be closely monitored by the Financial Aid Office staff. Failure to follow the courses and units outlined may constitute the basis for future denial of financial aid. The progress of students on an academic plan will be reviewed at the end of one payment period, and then according to the academic plan; but not less frequently than the rest of the institution's population. Financial aid eligibility reinstatement A student who has failed to make satisfactory progress but who has appealed financial aid suspension and has had eligibility for aid reinstated is placed on financial aid probation. Clear financial aid eligibility will be regained when s/he is again in compliance with the satisfactory academic progress standard. Graduation The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CATALOG and consult carefully with their advisor to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the requirements listed in the University CATALOG at the time of admission; however, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an Undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is available online at <llu.edu/ssweb/documents/intgrad.pdf>. Commencement exercises The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the commencement exercises and receive the diploma in person. Permission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled to the provost and can be granted only by the provost. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements, theUniversity reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. Diploma When the profession is named in the degree title, or when the degree is indicated by the school name, no other designation is included on the official diploma issued to the graduate. When the profession or major is not named in the degree title, the profession or specialization is also indicated on the official diploma.42 Financial Policies and Information Financial Policies and Information The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Accounts with other schools or with this University must be settled before enrollment will be allowed or services offered. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic year. Tuition and fees may vary from amounts shown. Please refer to the Student Account Disclosure statement for additional student account financial information (<llu.edu/assets/central/ssweb/ studentfinance/documents/disclosure.pdf>). Student fees Enrollment fees Students attending this University will be charged an enrollment fee, based on the criteria indicated below. Neither the fee in total nor any portion of the fee will be waived under any circumstance. Other school- specific charges\u2014such as technology fees, laboratory fees, etc.\u2014may also appear on the student account. The following criteria govern the enrollment fee: 1. Students who are accepted into a degree program and are registered will be charged the enrollment fee, regardless of the number of units for which they are registered. 2. Students who are not accepted into a degree program but who are registered as nondegree students for more than four units (five units for School of Allied Health Professions) will be charged the enrollment fee. 3. Students who are working on \"In Progress\" courses and who are not registered for any other units will be charged the enrollment fee. 4. A student who is charged the enrollment fee but who drops all units before the deadline for a full refund (generally one week after the first day of classes) will receive a full refund of the enrollment fee and will have no access to any University benefits. Please refer to the refund policy. 5. LLU HEALTH employees who are \"full-time, benefit eligible\" will not be charged the enrollment fee, whether they are using their education benefit or not. Spouses of employees who are using the employee benefit will be charged the enrollment fee. 6. Students participating in an off-campus or online program will not be charged the enrollment fee unless the program specifically requires this fee. 7. Other school-specific fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. Other fees Late payment fee (term) $100 Late registration fee $200 Returned check fee $25 Lost check reissue fee $15 Returned direct deposit fee $15 General practices Tuition payments/refunds Students who have not paid the balance due for registration, or who have not been awarded financial aid sufficient to cover the balance prior to registration, will be charged a late payment fee. Tuition andfees are due and payable in full to complete registration each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or program, or from a block program up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses will not receive a refund (please refer to the refund percentages and dates attached to individual courses). Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and payable in full upon presentation or notification of statement availability. A student unable to meet this requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student finance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a finance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per year). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respective school administrator and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take final examinations. Students may also request that monthly statements be sent to a parent or sponsor. Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained\u2014 each term in order to complete registration; before obtaining access to University services; before marching for graduation; before receiving a certificate or diploma; before requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board. All University registration holds must be cleared before financial clearance can be granted. To obtain financial clearance from the Student Loan Collections Office, students with campus-based student loans must be current on all scheduled loan account payments and must have fully completed a loan exit interview after ceasing to be enrolled for at least half time at this University. If the student's loan accounts are not current, or an exit interview has not been fully completed, a hold will be placed by the Student Loan Collection Office on transcript, diploma, or degree verification; and P1E requests and other services may be denied. Please note that all student loans are reported to a credit bureau organization on a monthly basis. If a student fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note, the Student Loan Collection Office will accelerate the loan(s), place the student loan(s) in collection with an outside agency, and demand immediate payment of the entire unpaid balance\u2014including principal, interest due, late fees, other fees, collection costs, attorney costs, and legal costs. Account charges Students who are currently enrolled on campus in a degree or certificate program are allowed to charge items and services to their accounts. Campus services that permit student account charges include the Campus Store, Student Affairs, the food service locations on campus, and other providers. Payments Bankcard, ACH, check, wire transfer, International to US funds conversion, and cash payments are accepted. Checks should be made payable to Loma Linda University and should indicate the student's ID number to ensure that the correct account is credited. International studentsLoma Linda University 2017-2018 43 can also make payments in their local currency through the Flywire Service (https://www.flywire.com) . In case a payment is returned, a $25 returned-item fee will be assessed. Payments are accepted in person at Student Finance, by mail, through the Student Service Center drop box, and online at <http://www.llu.edu/students/student-finance/>. Account refunds resulting from financial aid, tuition refunds, or other payments may be credited back to any bankcard used\u2014to the extent of the card payment made\u2014before a refund check or direct deposit will be issued. Please note that student identification cards are required for enrolled students to obtain service at the Student Service Center. (LLU HEALTH employees may present their employee ID cards in lieu of student ID.) Account withdrawals Students who have credit balances on their accounts after all University charges are covered may request a withdrawal of these funds. Each account withdrawal must be requested by the student. Withdrawals will be processed as checks or direct deposits; no cash withdrawals or automatic account withdrawal services are available. Student withdrawal requests made in person at the Student Finance cashier's window, by fax during office hours, or online before midnight on Tuesday of each week will be processed on Thursday of that week. Students may also request rush withdrawal processing for next business day service. A $20 processing fee is charged. Checks will be available for pickup after 11:00 a.m. at the Student Finance cashier's window each business day, or they can be mailed. Direct deposit authorization and online account withdrawals can be initiated by logging in on <http://ssweb.llu.edu/loginsso> and going to the Student Finance menu. If direct deposit funds are returned to the University due to the entry of inaccurate bank account information, a fee will be charged. Direct deposits may take two days or more after processing to appear in bank accounts. It is the student's responsibility to verify the receipt and availability of direct deposit funds before initiating any transactions. Students are cautioned to budget the use of withdrawn funds carefully because additional funds may be needed to cover education and living expenses for current and/or future terms. The Financial Aid Office should be contacted with questions about student budgeting and the use of funds available for withdrawal. Deposits Acceptance deposit Upon notification of acceptance, the student makes the required deposit (see school or program for specific deposit amount). This amount is deducted from the tuition and fees due at registration, or is forfeited if the student does not enroll. Room and key deposit Residence hall room and key deposits for Daniells Complex and for Lindsay Hall are forfeited after August 15 if occupancy does not follow for the Autumn Quarter. At the close of the term of residence, both the room deposit and the key deposit are refunded after the dean's inspection and clearance and the student's return of the key. International student deposit Loma Linda University requires that international students be prepared to provide an advance deposit and provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will beheld by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the final quarter's tuition and fees. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his/her program. Housing If a student is interested in on-campus/residential housing, application may be made online at <llu.edu/central/housing>. International students International applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program before an offer of acceptance can be issued. This includes providing evidence of their ability to meet estimated living expenses and all financial obligations to the University that will occur during their program. After acceptance into the chosen program, the office of International Student and Scholar Services will contact international applicants and guide them through the appropriate procedures. For questions, please call International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Health service A student enrolled in an on-campus certificate or degree program may be covered by the Student Health Plan provisions. Nondegree students taking more than 4 units (5 units for School of Allied Health Professions) may also be covered by the plan. Please view student registration portal for notice of coverage. A nondegree student may request and pay for health plan coverage if s/he is a part-time student who has been accepted into a board-approved (degree or certificate) program and is currently registered for up to and including four units. For further information, see the Student Health Plan in the Student Life section of this CATALOG. Student aid The Office of Financial Aid strives to provide prospective and enrolled students with information and resources to financially support their educational goals. Through the administration of federal student aid programs, state grant programs, and University-based institutional loans and scholarships, the financial aid office assists students in removing financial barriers to obtaining a higher education. It is the responsibility of LLU to ensure that funds are administered according to federal and state law. Applying for aid To apply for financial aid, citizens and eligible noncitizens must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov) . The FAFSA was available October 1, 2016, for the 2017-2018 academic year. Application as soon as possible is urged. The results of the FAFSA, called the Student Aid Report (SAR), will be electronically sent to Loma Linda University if the student listed the institution on the application. The school code for LLU is 001218. The FAFSA must be completed for each academic year. International students are not eligible for government assistance. International students may receive private funding, such as private educational loans, from a lending institution or bank. Lenders may require international students to have a cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Please contact the lending institution for more44 Financial Policies and Information information on the application process and the terms and conditions of the applicable loans. Students must be in an eligible degree or certificate program to receive financial aid. Additionally, most financial aid programs require a student to be attending at least half time in eligible units/hours. Eligibility Eligibility for need-based financial aid is determined by many factors, including the family's income, assets, family size, and number in college. All information is used to calculate expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC formula is found in Part F of Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended; and updates are published in the Federal Register. Eligibility for need-based funds is calculated by subtracting a student's EFC from the estimated cost of attendance. Non-need-based aid is financial aid that is not based on one's EFC. If a student requires additional aid, s/he may apply for other non-need-based forms of aid to supplement the cost of attendance. Non-need-based aid may not exceed a student's estimated cost of attendance minus any other assistance s/he has been awarded. Students must apply for need- based funding and complete a FAFSA to receive most forms of non-need- based assistance. Merit-based aid is awards given without regard to financial need. Merit- based aid is typically awarded based on academic achievements, talents, demographic characteristics, and other criteria. Students seeking merit- based aid may apply to outside agencies or contact their program to inquire about availability. The Office of Financial Aid does not select recipients for merit-based aid. For more information on eligibility and general requirements students must meet, please visit http://www.llu.edu/students/financial-aid/ eligibility.php. Financial aid awards If a student is eligible for financial aid, his/her need may be funded by various sources. Students who met the priority funding deadline (March 20, 2017, for the 2017-2018 academic year) were given greatest consideration during the awarding process. After priority funding deadline consideration, most funds are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis due to the limited availability of certain awards. Types of aid For detailed information on the types of aid available through the Office of Financial Aid, please visit: http://www.llu.edu/students/financial-aid/ types-of-aid.php. Aid available to undergraduate students: Federal PELL Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Cal Grant (California residents only) Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Aid available to undergraduate and graduate students: Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Direct PLUS Loan (parent and graduate) Federal Perkins Loan Federal Work Study (FWS) Institutional loans and scholarships Private educational loans from outside lenders Reporting outside assistance Students are required to report any outside financial aid assistance to the Office of Financial Aid. Outside assistance must be coordinated with any federal, state, or institutional funds to prevent an overaward. Failure to report outside assistance may result in owing back funds to either the institution or the U.S. Department of Education. Veterans benefits Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, Loma Linda University is approved for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/ GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the Veterans Administration (VA) and may be done via the Web at <www.gibill.va.gov> (http://www.gibill.va.gov) . The Office of University Records serves as the certifying official for Loma Linda University. Students should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification. A veteran cannot be certified until s/he registers. Payments are usually received thirty days after certification. Students receiving veteran's benefits who fail for three consecutive quarters to maintain the cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) required for graduation will have their benefits interrupted, and the VA office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satisfactory grades for all required courses for the year in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certified VA until s/he progresses to the next academic year. For more information, open links to the Veterans Information site under the \"Student Life\" section on the University Web page at <www.llu.edu/ students>. WICHE The University participates in the student exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Eligibility requirements vary among states. Interested students should apply to their state's certifying officer for further information. The name and address of the certifying officer can be obtained from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, 3035 Center Green Drive, Suite 200, Boulder, CO 80301. Web page: <wiche.edu/psep (http:// wiche.edu/psep) >. Inquiry may also be made at the Office of Student Financial Aid. The application deadline is October 15 prior to the year aid is needed.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 45 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS Dean's welcome Welcome to the School of Allied Health Professions, where your future begins. If you are considering a new Allied Health career or returning to advance your current one, we are committed to providing you a quality professional education and fostering your personal and spiritual development while you are attending our school. We encourage all of our students to learn not only in the classroom but through mission and service both locally and globally. We are glad you are here and we are ready to help you achieve your academic goals. Craig R. Jackson, J.D., M.S.W. Dean, School of Allied Health Professions School foundations The School of Allied Health Professions was established in 1966 (under the name School of Health Related Professions, 1966-1971) to consolidate the administration of individual curricula initiated earlier in the University: medical technology, 1937; physical therapy, 1941; medical radiography, 1941; occupational therapy, 1959; health information management (formerly medical record administration), 1963. Curricula added since the school was established are nuclear medicine technology, 1970; radiation therapy technology, 1970; cardiopulmonarysciences (formerly respiratory therapy), 1971; nutrition and coding specialist, 1987; physical therapist assistant, 1989; emergency medical care, 1993; physician 2000; cardiac electrophysiology technology, 2009; health professions education, 2010. The curriculum in speech- language pathology and audiology, renamed communication sciences and disorders in 2009, was initiated in 1965 under the auspices of the College of Arts and Sciences of La Sierra University (formerly Loma Linda University, La Sierra campus). The program was transferred to the School of Allied Health Professions in 1987. Particulars governing programs currently offered are detailed in this section of the CATALOG following information that pertains to all School of Allied Health students. Mission and goals Our mission The School of Allied Health Professions is dedicated to fulfilling the mission of Loma Linda University through academic and clinical training of allied health professionals. The school prepares competent health professionals in a Christian environment that emphasizes the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to make man whole.\" To meet local, national, and international allied health-care needs, the school seeks to serve: 1. Students choosing to become health-care professionals. 2. Individuals in need of medical care or health promotion programs. 3. Faculty and staff committed to working with students in a Christian educational setting. Our goals The goals of the School of Allied Health Professions are to: 1. Provide an environment in which the student may develop responsibility for integrity, ethical relationships, and empathic attitudes that contribute to the welfare and well-being of patients. 2. Help the student accept responsibility for integrity, ethical relationships, and empathic attitudes that can contribute to the welfare and well-being of patients. 3. Help the student develop a background of information and attitudes conducive to interprofessional understanding and cooperation. 4. Encourage the student to cultivate habits of self-education that will foster lifelong growth. 5. Engender and nurture in the student the desire to serve humankind \u2014and, in particular, to serve as needed, in the medical centers sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, both in this country and elsewhere. The School of Allied Health Professions has adopted the University's institutional learning outcomes (p. 19). Evaluation of mission and institutional learning outcomes\u2014Wholeness Portfolio In Wholeness Portfolio courses, students achieve mission-focused learning outcomes as established by Loma Linda University. Portfolio courses integrate the concept of wholeness and service into the lives of students and assess the outcome of their educational process. Each portfolio course continues for three-to-four quarters, during which time46 School of Allied Health Professions students complete assignments based on the goals below.

General regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Admissions policies and information The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance of the applicant into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. Most programs require an interview with faculty. Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethicaland moral standards as a basis for their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health professions and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not expect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualified persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give preference in student admissions to qualified Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admission is not limited exclusively to Seventh-day Adventist applicants. Application and acceptance Where to write Correspondence about admission to all programs and requests for application information should be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. Apply early One class is admitted annually to most of the professional programs. Most programs begin with the Autumn Quarter. Exceptions are noted in the respective programs of this CATALOG. Late applications are considered as long as space is available. Notifications are generally sent between January 1 and May 15, depending on the completeness of information provided and the date of application. Applicants should inquire at the Office of Admissions and Records if notice of action is not received by March 15 for occupational therapy and physical therapy, and by July 15 for other programs. Application review process All completed applications are first reviewed by the department chair and faculty. A recommendation on each application is then submitted to the school's Admissions Committee, which makes the final decision regarding acceptance. Procedure The procedure for application and acceptance is given below. All correspondence is to be sent to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. All official transcripts, international evaluations, and test scores are to be sent to Admissions Processing, Loma Linda University, 11139 Anderson Street, Loma Linda, CA 92350. 1.

Upon receipt of the notice of acceptance, submit the required deposit to confirm acceptance.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 47 4. Send health records or certificates to Student Health Services, 24785 Stewart Street, Evans Hall, Suite 111, Loma Linda, CA 92354. Entrance requirements Subject/Diploma requirements High school and college subject requirements are outlined in the respective programs. Students are required to furnish evidence of completion (official transcript) of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs in any of the schools of the University. Applicants who have completed either an associate or bachelor's degree are exempt from submitting a high school transcript unless course work in high school is used to satisfy a subject requirement. A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. Grade requirement Eligibility for consideration by the Admissions Committee is based on a G.P.A. of at least 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) for all course work (science and nonscience subjects computed separately), presented in fulfillment of entrance requirements for all programs in the school. A G.P.A. considerably higher than the minimum is expected because of the nature of the studies in many professional programs and the competition for the limited number of openings. In general, G.P.A.s between 2.5 and 3.0 are considered minimal, depending on the program. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses. Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Professional standards Good taste indicates that haircut, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical so that the student can perform assigned duties without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes, and dreadlocks are not acceptable. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse student population. Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Male students are not allowed to wear ear ornaments. If worn by women, ear ornaments are limited to simple studs and should not drop below the bottom of the earlobes. Such ornaments are limited to one per ear. Rings or ornaments in other anatomical sites are not acceptable. Fingernails should be maintained in a professional manner, closely trimmed, and should not interfere with patient safety and comfort during treatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of a subdued color. Academic policies and information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school or program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes his or her standing in a degree or certificate program. Academic residence In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this University. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. Graduation ceremonies Graduation events include formal ceremonies identified as conferring of degrees, awarding of diplomas, and recognition of candidates for degrees. Other related graduation events include the baccalaureate and vespers services. The conferring of degrees ceremony(ies) occurs at the close of the Spring Quarter and includes an academic procession, the formal conferring of degrees by the president, and the presentation of diplomas by the dean of the school. Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certificates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these important and colorful events. To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specified by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who: Have only clinical experience requirements to complete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year; Can complete remaining degree requirements by the end of the Summer Quarter; or Are in a block program. The still in-progress course work may not exceed 8 units for graduate students or 12 units for undergraduate students. A student who completes the requirements for a degree or certificate (other than clinical experience) at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which the requirements for a degree are completed. Superior academic performance and achievement in scholarship and leadership are recognized in the printed graduation program for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their final term have acquired a cumulative grade point average for all college work (includes course work taken at other colleges/universities, except for remedial courses), as follows: 3.5 Graduation cum laude 3.8 Graduation magna cum laude48 School of Allied Health Professions 3.9 Graduation summa cum laude Although the official commencement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade point average as of the end of the quarter preceding their final term, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indicate graduation with honors if the student's final quarter record has increased the grade point average sufficiently to qualify for honors at that time. Scholastic standing Repeating a course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan, the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 2. Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged, whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must reregister and pay the applicable fee. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the grade point average. A course may be repeated only once. Promotion and probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade point average: 2.0 Associate and baccalaureate degree programs 3.0 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program A student whose grade point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the school for final action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning assistance plan within the first two weeks of the following quarter and to meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic advisor. The learning assistance plan should: identify theproblem, identify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and advisor signatures and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade point average after two quarters will have disqualified him-/herself from the program. Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following time frames: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years Additional requirements For additional policies governing Loma Linda University students, see general policies of the University (p. 35) , as well as the University Student Handbook . Students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Financial policies and information The Office of the Dean is the final authority on all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. General Financial Practices The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled.

Herrmann A student who is interested in science, has an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications; and analyzes and discusses test results with the medical staff. Opportunities Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other health-care occupations through the year 2018, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment76 Clinical Laboratory Science \u2014 B.S. opportunities are excellent, with current vacancy rates of 14 percent. The twenty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new avenues for test development, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' offices, and private medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical product development, and customer and patient education.

Program director Margaret A. Tavares Medical director Pamela J. Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory sciences. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discovering its existence by alternate methods. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained technologists exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. The program The two-year Cytotechnology Program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The Bachelor of Science degree program requires completion of two years of prerequisites at an accredited college or university. Accepted students transfer to the program at the junior year level. The program of study begins in the Fall Quarter. Upon satisfactory completion of the program, the student is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree;and is eligible to take the national board of certification examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. The junior year includes lecture and laboratory, with an emphasis on basic cytology courses. The senior year includes an eleven-week clinical practicum and advanced courses in histology, pathology, and laboratory management. Program objectives The primary objectives of cytologic education are to prepare individuals to perform with competency in the following areas: 1. Use the microscope to identify, evaluate, and diagnose with a high level of accuracy the cytologic nature of any existing pathological process. 2. Recognize the significance of symptoms, treatments, and/or pertinent clinical data that can be used in the evaluation of cellular morphology and the development of the differential diagnosis. 3. Follow laboratory procedures for preparation, acceptance and rejection of specimens, problem solving, and implementation of new procedures. 4. Read, evaluate, prepare, and present scientific research. 5. Implement measures that contribute to quality control of specimens, laboratory safety and regulation, and the practical aspects of laboratory organization and management. 6. Understand the responsibilities and ethical role of the profession. Program learning outcomes 1. Evaluate cellular abnormalities with a level of accuracy by applying differential diagnoses in the framework of patient outcome management. 2. Demonstrate knowledge of the ethical role and responsibilities of the cytotechnologist. 3. Assess the results of quality assurance measures and institute proper procedures to maintain test accuracy. 4. Comprehend and apply sound principles of scientific research. 5. Advocate rules and regulations, with emphasis on patient and workplace safety.

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) evaluate and treat children and adults who have communication, swallowing, and/or cognitive communication disorders. Difficulties in the areas of speech, language, fluency, swallowing, and voice are associated with a variety of disorders, including developmental delay, hearing impairment, cleft palate, cerebral palsy, stroke, and head injury. Audiologists are involved in prevention, identification, assessment, and rehabilitation of hearing disorders. Students who choose these professions should be interested in working with people. Opportunities The entry level for speech-language pathology is the master's degree. The entry level for audiology is the doctoral degree. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathologists and audiologists are found in speech and hearing clinics, public schools, hospitals, universities, health departments, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, rehabilitation centers, industry, research institutes, and private practice. These environments allow for considerable flexibility. There is ample opportunity for employment as a speech-language pathologist. Employment opportunities for speech-language pathology assistants (SLPAs) include working under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist. Although SLPAs work primarily in schools, there are also employment opportunities in hospitals and private clinics. Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science degree may work towards meeting eligibility requirements for registration in the state of California as a speech-language pathology assistant. Student professional association Students are eligible for membership in the National Student Speech- Language-Hearing Association (NSSLHA). Students are also encouraged to become members, read the journals, and participate in the many activities sponsored by the local chapter.

Program director Terry Douglas The curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders begins with the Autumn Quarter of the junior year. The freshman and sophomore years, which are taken at an accredited college or university prior to coming to Loma Linda University, provide the fundamentals of a liberal arts education. The emphasis in the junior and senior years is on preprofessional courses and may include practical experience. Full-time enrollment in the graduate program is required; therefore, one of the considerations for acceptance into the bachelor's degree program is the student's ability to manage a full load of course work. There is no option to enter the program on a part-time basis; neither will a student be allowed to change from full-time to part-time status at any time during program progression. Courses are completed sequentially\u2014with prerequisite courses offered in a given quarter, followed by subsequent courses in a later quarter. Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science degree, students are prepared to seek admission to a graduate program in speech-language pathology or related disciplines. Students are encouraged to take CMSD 267 Speech-Language Pathology Assistant Fieldwork during their senior year in order to qualify for the speech-language pathology assistant license, issued by the California Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Board. Program learning outcomes Students who graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders will meet the University outcomes (p. 19). Students will also meet the following program-specific outcomes: 1. Demonstrate knowledge of basic human communication processes. 2. Demonstrate introductory knowledge of the major types of human communication and swallowing disorders. 3. Demonstrate introductory knowledge of assessment procedures for the major types of human communication and swallowing disorders. 4. Demonstrate a commitment to ethical and compassionate service. 5. Demonstrate introductory knowledge of processes used in discipline- related research.82 Communication Sciences and Disorders \u2014 B.S. Minimum grade required for graduation A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for a course to count towards graduation. Clinical experience Supervised clinical practicum is recommended but not required in the curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. Completion of specific courses precedes placement for practicum. Clinical practicum is available for students who have a G.P.A. of 3.0 or above in the major courses. Wholeness portfolio Undergraduate students in the School of Allied Health Professions develop a portfolio during the junior and senior years. Students register for AHCJ 328 Wholeness Portfolio I during the junior year and AHCJ 498 Wholeness Portfolio II during the senior year. The purpose of the portfolio is to allow students to demonstrate their work towards achieving the outcomes set forth by the University. These outcomes were developed to aid the student in achieving personal and professional balance in the spiritual, intellectual, social/emotional, and physical domains. CLEP CLEP tests must be taken within one quarter of receiving the degree compliance report; otherwise, the course must be repeated. Student progress review Students must maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0 to ensure regular standing in the program. If the student's G.P.A. drops below 3.0 by the end of an academic quarter, s/he will be placed on academic probation for the following quarter. If the student's G.P.A. does not improve to at least 3.0 by the end of that quarter, s/he will be dismissed from the program. Each student's progress in the bachelor's degree curriculum is reviewed quarterly. Students are provided written feedback with recommendations for remediation if there are concerns about academic or clinical performance. Speech-language pathology assistant Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science degree may work towards meeting eligibility requirements for registration in the state of California as a speech-language pathology assistant (SLPA).

Program director Karen Mainess The Master of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders offers preparation for careers in the professional practice of speech- language pathology. It provides a basis for graduate study and research at a more advanced level and encourages growth towards independence. The clinical services of the department, Loma Linda University Medical Center, and affiliated practicum sites provide opportunity for supervised clinical experiences that represent the breadth and depth of the profession in a variety of settings. Upon completion of the Master of Science degree, graduates are eligible to: receive the preliminary speech-language pathology services credential (California Commission on Teacher Credentialing); receive the temporary license in speech-language pathology (California Department of Consumer Affairs); and seek employment as clinical fellows, working towards the certificate of clinical competence (through the Council for Clinical Certification of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association). Two tracks lead to the Master of Science degree: Individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree in speech- language pathology or in communicative disorders may apply for admission to the two-year master's degree program. Postbaccalaureate foundational course work completed at an institution other than Loma Linda University by applicants who have a bachelor's degree in a field other than speech-language pathology84 Communication Sciences and Disorders \u2014 M.S. or communication disorders is considered on an individual basis. In general, foundational course work completed at California state schools where undergraduate courses in communication sciences and disorders are required is acknowledged. Prior to admission or within the first quarter of study (see Program of Study below), CBEST scores are required. Individuals who have a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university, with a major in a field other than speech-language pathology or communication disorders and who meet minimum requirements may apply for admission to the transitional three-year Master of Science degree curriculum. The program The curriculum consists of completing required graduate-level courses, supervised clinical practice, capstone research, and clinical presentations. The traditional Master of Science degree curriculum is two years in length. Full-time students will complete the curriculum in seven quarters, including the summer between the first and the second years. Students begin the curriculum in the Autumn Quarter and go through the program as a cohort. Classes are scheduled in the late afternoon or early evening, and on one Friday per month. During the Winter Quarter and Spring Quarter of the second year, students take the full-time public school and medical fieldwork. *Note: Students may be required to go out of state for their full-time fieldwork and, therefore, should be prepared financially. Students enrolled in the three-year transitional master's degree curriculum will begin their program in the Autumn Quarter and go through as a cohort. During the first year, students complete course work that provides the necessary foundation for the second- and third- year disorders courses and clinical practice. In the summer following the first year, all students may be required to take the clinical practicum. Beginning with the second year, the transitional master's degree students join the cohort of new students in the two-year master's degree program; the two groups complete the remaining two years simultaneously. University student learning outcomes Students who graduate with a Master of Science degree in communication sciences and disorders will meet the University outcomes (p. 19). Program learning outcomes Students will also meet the following program-specific outcomes: 1. Demonstrate knowledge of human communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders. 2. Demonstrate skill in assessment and intervention for human communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders. 3. Demonstrate knowledge of the role of the school-based speech- language pathologist. 4. Demonstrate knowledge of processes used in discipline-related research. 5. Demonstrate knowledge of counseling principles and practices applied to the practice of speech-language pathology with diverse populations and across the lifespan.California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing requires that all students pursuing a credential pass the California Basic Education Skills Test (CBEST). The CBEST must be passed before beginning the graduate curriculum, or within the first quarter. The CBEST is a measure of reading, writing, and mathematics proficiency; and is required by law for anyone applying for a credential in the public schools of California and Oregon. This test is given by National Evaluation Systems, Inc., Box 340880, Sacramento, CA 95834-0880, 916/928-4001. Additional information may be found at <http://www.cbest.nesinc.com/>. Praxis examination The Praxis (administered by a national testing service) is a multiple choice examination designed to evaluate students' broad-based knowledge across the disorders and is required for ASHA certification, for the California license, and for the California school credential. It is a nationally standardized and publicly administered test. A passing score of 162 must be achieved, and the test may be taken multiple times. Information about the Praxis may be obtained by going to <http://www.ets.org/praxis>. Students in the Master of Science degree curriculum in communication sciences and disorders are not required to take the Praxis while in the graduate program. However, taking the Praxis before graduation is a good idea. Remediation Alumni and graduate students who do not achieve a passing score on the Praxis may take any course and/or seminar offered by the department free of charge in order to refresh knowledge or remediate areas of concern. Graduate students who demonstrate unsatisfactory performance in the clinical courses CMSD 567 Clinical Practice in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, Advanced , CMSD 586 Educational Fieldwork I, CMSD 588 Educational Fieldwork II, CMSD 596 Medical Fieldwork I, or CMSD 597 Medical Fieldwork II will be required to repeat the clinical experience and to register for CMSD 589 Remediation/Advanced Directed Teaching and/or CMSD 599 Remediation/Externship, respectively. Student progress review Each student's progress in the Master of Science degree curriculum in communication sciences and disorders is reviewed quarterly.

Nutrition and Dietetics \u2014 Coordinated Programs Advisory committee Adleit Asi Betsy Cline Bertrum Connell Georgia Hodgkin Craig Jackson, officio Adrine Noal Jerome Rafoth Paula de Walters Patty Watts Ralph Watts Maryellen Westerberg Grenith Zimmerman The registered dietitian (RD) is a vital member of the health-care team in the field of health promotion and medical nutrition therapy. This profession focuses on the field of health promotion; and medical nutrition therapy focuses on the science of nutrition, the art of food presentation, and management in providing nutrition care\u2014as well as instruction in proper food choices throughout life. Individuals and groups benefit from the work of the registered dietitian, which leads potentially to better health and longer life. Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, and behavioral and social sciences; as well as the artistic presentation of food to achieve and maintain health, prevent disease, and facilitate recovery from illness. The coordinated program\u2014a joint effort of the School of Allied Health Professions and the School of Public Health\u2014offers students the option to pursue one of three degrees: B.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.P.H. degree in public health nutrition (described in the Nutrition Program of the School of Public Health section of the CATALOG) Each of these degrees culminates in eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians.The student obtains the credential in dietetics upon successful completion of the registration examination offered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The coordinated program in dietetics combines didactic and supervised professional practice experiences to developprofessional competencies concurrently with cognitive and technical skills that enable the graduate to establish eligibility to become a registered dietitian. The M.S. degree prepares entry-level dietitians to join the profession in areas of advanced practice and in specialty areas that will allow them to contribute to the wholeness of humankind. The graduate is awarded an M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics. The curriculum comprises didactic and supervised professional practice experiences in a health-sciences, liberal arts environment to prepare an educated graduate. This curriculum includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Twelve hundred hours of supervised professional practice experiences are scheduled in medical nutrition therapy, community, and administrative nutrition. Students participate as active members of the nutrition-care team in clinical settings. Four choices are available to earn a Master of Science degree in nutrition and dietetics at Loma Linda University. Opportunities Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments \u2014including hospitals and other health-care facilities, schools and universities, government and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physicians' offices, clinics, home health-care agencies, mass communications, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examination for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, administrative dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014 with emphasis on fitness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The dietitian in administration is accountable for the food service system. In a health-care institution, s/he is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health-care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Opportunities may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 97 Professional registration Upon satisfactory completion of the program and upon recommendation of the faculty, the graduate will receive a verification statement and be eligible to take the registration examination for dietitians in order to become a registered dietitian. Professional association Students and graduates are eligible for membership in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The association grants student membership at a nominal rate to students in accredited programs. The national office of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60606-6995. Along with membership in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, students become members of the California Dietetic Association. Students are encouraged to join the California Dietetic Association-Inland District and, where possible, the Seventh-day Adventist Dietetic Association. Goals of the coordinated program SAHP Program Goal 1 The program will prepare students to be competent graduates who are eligible to write the registration examination for dietitians to become entry-level practitioners. SAHP Program Objectives for Goal 1 1. Eighty percent (80%) of graduates who write the registration examination for dietitians will pass within the first year. 2. Eighty percent (80%) of students who enter the B.S., M.P.H., or M.S. degree program will complete program/degree requirements within 150% of the program length. SAHP Program Goal 2 Provide professionally trained registered dietitians with either an emphasis in medical nutrition therapy or public health nutrition who may be employed by or contribute to the health-care and educational systems of the Seventh-day Adventist church; or local, national, or international entities. SAHP Program Objectives for Goal 2 1. Seventy percent (70%) or more of coordinated program graduates who seek employment in dietetics will be employed within twelve months of program completion.* 2. Sixty percent (60%) of coordinated program graduates will contribute to the community and/or provide professional leadership in the field of dietetics within five years of graduation. Students admitted into the B.S. + M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics program satisfy CP requirements when the B.S. degree is completed. They continue their graduate education and do not typically seek employment until conclusion of the M.S. degree.

Through the therapeutic use of everyday activities or occupations, occupational therapists help people across the lifespan\u2014from infancy through older adults\u2014to participate in the things they want and need to do. Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing support for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes. Our practice settings are diverse\u2014ranging from hospital settings, to school systems, to behavioral health clinics, to outpatient clinics, to community sites with at-risk youth and survivors of domestic violence. Occupational therapy services may include comprehensive evaluations of the client's home and other environments (e.g., workplace, school), recommendations for adaptive equipment and training in its use, and guidance and education for family members and caregivers. Occupational therapy practitioners have a wholistic perspective focusing on adapting the environment to fit the person, and the person is an integral part of the therapy team. Following the mission of this University, students immerse themselves in community, exploring emerging areas of practice in some of the following areas: aging, at-risk youth, domestic violence settings, lifestyle medicine, obesity, and trauma-exposed children. Opportunities Occupational therapy is an exciting field with its broad population areas and diverse settings. The American Occupational Therapy Association has identified eight areas of focus: children and youth; evidence- based practice; health and wellness; mental health; productive aging; rehabilitation, disability, and participation; work and industry. Occupational therapy fosters entrepreneurship that promotes health and wellness and meaningful occupational participation. Occupational therapists are moving into areas such as health promotion, obesity, telehealth, and domestic violence. Professional associations Students are eligible for membership in the American Occupational Therapy Association and Occupational Therapy Association of California, two organizations that foster development and improvement of service and education. Students are encouraged to become members, read the journal, and attend local professional meetings.

Radiographers image body structures utilizing ionizing radiation; and they can specialize in CT, MRI, imaging informatics, mammography, nuclear medicine, sonography, or radiation therapy. While CT and MRI both produce cross-sectional images of the body, MRI utilizes a magnetic field rather than ionizing radiation. Nuclear medicine employs the nuclear properties of radioactive and stable nuclides to make diagnostic evaluations of the anatomic or physiologic conditions of the body. Sonography uses sound waves to image the human body; and radiation therapy employs medical use of ionizing radiation to treat cancer and control malignant cell growth. Professionals in these areas are able to communicate effectively, think critically, demonstrate professionalism by treating all persons with respect, assume responsibility and accountability for their actions, and adhere to the rules of confidentiality.

Davis The Medical Dosimetry Program is designed to educate personnel in the discipline of dosimetry within a radiation oncology environment, and to prepare them to take the Medical Dosimetry Certification Board (MDCB) examination. Medical dosimetry is a dynamic, exciting field involving a combined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment dose calculations for a variety of external beam as well as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent analytical skills, the ability to critically evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in medical dosimetry throughout the United States, there is a shortage of medical dosimetrists in many areas of the country. Thus, this program aims to provide a supply of well-trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet the needs of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond. Mission statement The mission of the certificate program in medical dosimetry is to prepare professionals in the field through broad education and training in all aspects of the profession. This will include critical thinking, clinical competence, effective communication, and professionalism as they apply to the field of medical dosimetry. The program encourages intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual development by emphasizing these goalsin its curriculum, which is reflected in the motto of Loma Linda University Health\u2014\"To Make Man Whole\". Program learning outcomes (PLOs) 1. Students will demonstrate critical thinking by performing hand calculations, utilizing software tools to optimize isodose distributions to achieve treatment goals through maximizing target coverage, minimizing hot/cold spots, and sparing critical structures as per prescription. 2. Students will be clinically competent at creating deliverable treatment plans with considerations of machine and patient constraints, calculating monitor units for clinical set-ups, and minimizing systematic and random errors by checking plan parameters. Students will throughly follow hospital policies and procedures while performing all dosimetry activities. 3. Students will be able to communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing. 4. Students will demonstrate professionalism by treating everyone with respect and courtesy, abiding by all HIPPA rules. They will demonstrate a responsible attitude and be accountable for their actions. 5. The program will achieve the following outcomes: Students will complete the program, pass the MDCB examination, have a job within six months after passing their MDCB examination, and maintain an attrition rate of more than 25 percent. Program design The program for both tracks is five quarters in length. Instruction includes a mixture of lecture, laboratory, and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. The majority of instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medicine Department of Loma Linda University Medical Center. There are also short clinical rotations to Long Beach Memorial and City of Hope medical centers. The program faculty consists of physicists, dosimetrists, and radiation therapists who are extremely experienced in their field\u2014 many in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. Accreditation The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) strongly supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility for the certification in medical dosimetry. This qualification is considered to be the gold standard in dosimetry education. The program is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT).

Normal time to complete the program 4 years \u2014 Based on full-time enrollment, a student who is a radiologic technologist (ARRT) completes the LLU portion of the program in 7 quarters. A student who is not a radiologic technologist (Non-ARRT) starts one quarter earlier and will complete in 8 quarters. Radiography Advanced Placement \u2014 Certificate Program director William J. Edmunds The purpose of the Radiography Advanced Placement Program is to prepare candidates to take the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) examination if they need to requalify due to failingthe registry examination; or to enable candidates to complete the ARRT didactic and clinical requirements for the first time if they graduated from a program outside the United States. The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists distinguishes three types of candidates eligible for this program: 1. One who received radiologic technology education more than five years prior to enrollment in the program\u2014which makes him or her no longer eligible under ARRT's three-year rule; 2. One who is no longer eligible under ARRT's three-attempt, three-year rule; 3. One who received his/her professional education in a country without an ARRT-recognized accreditation mechanism at the time of program completion. Individual courses may be taken on a case-by-case basis if a candidate wishes to review a certain registry section in-depth prior to taking the test, or has failed the ARRT examination fewer than three times and wants to review certain areas to obtain the remediation hours needed. Details are provided in the following Web site: https://www.arrt.org/ education/advanced-placement School certificate Students interested in enrolling in this certificate program register through the Office of University Records for the courses, but the certificate is issued by the School of Allied Health Professions, not Loma Linda University.

This Catalog describes who we are and what we have to offer. It will familiarize you with the philosophy and structure of our programs, and will provide you with a listing of the participating faculty. Loma Linda University is a religious, nonprofit institution that welcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualified members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people.\" Since several of the professions\u2014for which programs within the School of Behavioral Health (SBH) prepare students\u2014have a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, faculty, and staff demonstrate their acceptance of and willingness to assist those in our society who are less privileged. The University actively sponsors several programs that move the institutional health-care personnel resources and expertise into the local, national, and international communities to work with otherwise underserved populations. This component of service is an integral partof the statement of mission and a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a central position on the campus. The School of Behavioral Health, as part of the University, has expectations of students, faculty, and staff in the areas of conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involved in school or University activities. The school does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, age, ethnic or national origin, or handicap. Enrollment of students in SBH programs is not conditioned on their political or sexual orientation; in these areas, the school's policy is directed towards conduct or disruptive behavior, not orientation. In support of this position, we expect our students, faculty, and staff to demonstrate unwavering respect for the diversity of others and to interact with integrity\u2014never forgetting the standards that guide professional actions. Further, we expect our programs through their faculty to develop competent, compassionate, ethical professionals who possess the knowledge, skills, and values to equip them for a life dedicated to service to all those in need\u2014regardless of their lifestyles. You will find vigorous academic programs that will stretch your mind as you take time to make new discoveries, get to understand our world, and apply Christ-centered values to your life and profession. Our administrators, faculty, and staff are here to work with you and help you prepare for your future as a caring, Christian professional in the world of service to mankind. If you would like to know more about us, you can call us toll free at 800/422-4LLU. Beverly J. Buckles, D.S.W. Dean, School of Behavioral Health 152 School of Behavioral Health School foundations The School of Behavioral Health includes the Departments of Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology; and the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies. The school offers master's and doctoral degree programs, as well as a number of postbaccalaureate and postdegree certificates. These programs equip graduates with the leading-edge knowledge and practice experiences necessary for careers in behavioral health practice, research, or administration. Philosophy The School of Behavioral Health is grounded in a deep commitment to the University's mission to further the teaching and healing ministries of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is viewed as a lifelong journey of faith and learning underpinned by a bio-psycho-social-spiritual perspective, which assumes that wholeness is achieved when all subsystems affecting human needs are understood and in balance. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, and human relationships that enable individuals to experience resiliency and live meaningful lives. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity and to God. In the School of Behavioral Health, these purposes are achieved through academic programs\u2014including research, clinical practice, and global learning experiences that engage faculty and students in the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and quest for wholeness. Because these pursuits are served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their fields of study and participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is created and applied. The end result is firm adherence to the global traditions of Loma Linda University through scholarly and practice pursuits that aim to strengthen the effectiveness of behavioral health practice and research to improve the quality of life for individuals and communities around the world. Goals The School of Behavioral Health attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly and professional careers in the behavioral health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Fostering the integration of science and practice in the service of humankind. Learning outcomes and assessment Supporting these goals, the School of Behavioral Health has adopted Loma Linda University's institutional learning outcomes (p. 19) (ILOs). The School of Behavioral Health supports the realization of the University's learning outcomes through the curricula of its degree programs by providing students with content and active learning experiences that reflect the current practice and professional knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes needed for competent practice in behavioral health, including, but not limited to: Professional and personal self care Ethical and professional standards of conduct and behavior Legal and statutory mandates affecting practice Clinical knowledge shared and specific to disciplines Therapeutic and reflective use of self Analytical methods supporting scholarship and the integration of science and practice in the development of new knowledge and improved services Professional communication and presentation skills Strengths perspectives supporting wellness, recovery, and antistigma Integration of spirituality and cultural competency Integration of behavioral health into primary health care Global context of behavioral health practice Collegial and collaborative team practice Commitment to continuous professional development, service, and lifelong learning The assessment of the University's student learning outcomes is integrated into the specific program and department criteria and methods used to address professional accreditation assessment requirements. Where possible, these data are used to support the development of school-wide metrics. Mission Operationalizing this philosophy, the mission of the School of Behavioral Health is to provide graduate-level education that prepares competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals who possess the knowledge, values, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole person care in behavioral health practice, research, and servant leadership. General regulations Application and acceptance Application procedure 1. The application instructions, available on the Web at <llu.edu/central/ apply>, allow students to apply online and begin an application. Applications and all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references should be submitted by the deadline posted on the application, per degree. 2. Complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools must be provided for official acceptance into a program. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts\u2014including official English translations, if applicable\u2014sent directly to Admissions Processing by the issuing institution. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and is required by some programs. The interview should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. Acceptance procedure 1. When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made its recommendation, the dean of the School of Behavioral Health takes official action and notifies the applicant. The applicant must respond affirmatively before becoming eligible to register in the School of Behavioral Health. 2. As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with Student Health Service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3. Transcripts of records and all other application documents are retained by the University and may not be withdrawn and used for any purpose. Records of students who do not enroll or who withdrawLoma Linda University 2017-2018 153 prior to completion are retained for two years from the date of original acceptance to a School of Behavioral Health program. 4. New students are required to pass a background check before they register for classes. Admission requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Behavioral Health's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students with an overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with application for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Web site at <http://www.ets.org/gre/>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an evaluation of critical essay-writing skills, the Miller Analogies Test, the results of a structured interview, or other specified program criteria. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Behavioral Health may request transfer to a different program or a more advanced degree level by contacting the School of Behavioral Health Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. English-language competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensive American Language Institute prior to entering their program, because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. Graduate degree requirements Minimum required grade point average Students must maintain a grade point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a gradebetween C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. From Master's to Ph.D. degree Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Behavioral Health Admissions Office. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Behavioral Health and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Behavioral Health program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs discussed in the next paragraph. Combined degrees Students may not be admitted to a School of Behavioral Health program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs. Certificate programs The School of Behavioral Health offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an advisor who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B (3.0) grade point average, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). Master of Arts/Master of Science/Master of Social Work Advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation.154 School of Behavioral Health Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. However, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but these must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Behavioral Health to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their advisors to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as well as degree completion options and timelines. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in program guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to securethe committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter. Candidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Behavioral Health for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Behavioral Health. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (courses numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Behavioral Health or to a program in the School of Behavioral Health and to a professional school in the University is required. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG. Thesis and dissertation The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school office inLoma Linda University 2017-2018 155 final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University Library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. Doctor of Philosophy The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Advisor and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Behavioral Health requires advisors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually at the beginning of the graduate experience at this University. Study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Behavioral Health. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullified eight years from the date of course completion. To assure currency in the content, nullified courses may be revalidated\u2014upon successful petition\u2014through reading, conference, written reports, or examination.Residence The School of Behavioral Health requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue for limited periods at special facilities studies not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Behavioral Health. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the field or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CATALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final year of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until they have: Demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; Completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees)156 School of Behavioral Health All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done during the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done during the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee to be paid during registration each quarter. A continuing registration fee is also assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Behavioral Health does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Behavioral Health Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's advisor and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion.Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Behavioral Health and a professional school in the University. The combined degrees programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Behavioral Health; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Behavioral Health requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Behavioral Health or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. The following combined degrees programs are offered in conjunction with the School of Behavioral Health. Marital and Family Therapy with Clinical Ministry (M.S./M.A. (p. 453) ) Social Policy and Social Research with Biomedical and Clinical Ethics (Ph.D./M.A. (p. 460)) Social Work with Criminal Justice (M.S.W./M.S.

(p. 463) ) Social Work with Social Policy and Social Research (M.S.W./Ph.D. (p. 461)) Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Behavioral Health prepares the school-specific Policies and Procedures Manual , which is provided to all School of BehavioralLoma Linda University 2017-2018 157 Health students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this manual. Academic information Conditions of registration, residence, attendance Academic residence A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree, which is never less than one academic quarter. A year of residence is defined as three quarters of academic work. A student is in full-time residence if registered for at least 8 units. A maximum of 12 units may be taken without special petition to the dean of the School of Behavioral Health, unless the student is enrolled in an approved block- registration program or the program requirements specify otherwise. Transfer credits Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this University that earns less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. A candidate who holds a master's degree or presents its equivalent by transcript may receive credit up to 20 percent of the total units for the degree, subject to the consent of the dean and the department chair involved. In such instances, the transfer student is not relieved of residence requirements at this University. Students should also review the requirements of in their program of study as some professional degree programs require grades higher than a B (3.0) for transfer courses, and may restrict the courses and/or experiences that may be transferred from other academic institutions. If permitted for transfer, credit for practicum experiences is allowed only where university credit has been received for equivalent experiences. Credit for life and/or work experiences cannot be used to meet the requirements in any degree or certificate program in the School of Behavioral Health. Advanced standing Advanced standing is a designation used in specific professional degree programs to address possible content redundancy between levels of degrees available within those professions. Evaluation of eligibility for advanced standing is program specific when specific conditions are met. Students should review the availability of advanced standing in their program. Academic variances are used to document the availability of advanced standing. Academic, professional, and clinical probation Continued enrollment in a professional degree program or certificate is contingent upon a student's continued satisfactory academic, professional, and clinical performance. Any student whose performance in any of these three areas falls below the requirements of their program, the school, or university will be placed on one or more of these types of probation. Academic probation Degree students whose overall grade point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation who fail to earn a 3.0 for the next quarter or who fail to have an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 after two quarters may be dismissed from school. Students enrolled in postbaccalaureate certificate programs should review theG.P.A. requirements of these programs, which may differ from G.P.A. requirements for degree programs. Professional performance probation All students enrolled in professional programs are required to adhere to the professional and ethical standards set forth by their disciplines, the school, and university. Any student whose performance is evaluated to fall below these requirements will be placed on professional performance probation. The continued enrollment for the next quarter of a student on professional probation is subject to the recommendation of the department and approval by the school's Academic Standards Committee. Any student whose professional performance falls below these minimum requirements for two quarters (consecutive or dispersed) will be dismissed from the school.

Program director Michelle Minyard-Widmann Clinical coordinator Alisha Saavedra The Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers high-quality academic education and clinical training leading to a master's degree in the Child Life Specialist Program. This degree prepares individuals to provide child life services in a health-care setting. In addition, practice experiences within the United States and in other countries will provide students with child life practice in diverse environments. The child life profession Child life specialists are professionals in the field of child development. They promote effective coping through play, preparation, education, and self-expression activities. Child life specialists provide emotional support for families and encourage optimum development of children facing a broad range of challenging experiences, particularly those related to health care and hospitalization. Understanding that a child's well-being depends on the support of the family, child life specialists provide information, support, and guidance to parents, siblings, and other family members. They also play a vital role in educating caregivers, administrators, and the general public about the needs of children under stress (Association of Child Life Professionals <http:// www.childlife.org>). The program Certification for the child life profession Through the Association of Child Life Professionals, the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential was developed to increase the proficiency of child life professionals by identifying a body of knowledge, uniform and improved standards of practice, and ethical conduct while enhancing the status and credibility of the profession. The requirements for certification are based on academic and internship experience and successful completion of an examination process (Association of Child Life Professionals <http://www.childlife.org>). Learning outcomes Upon graduation, students will:160 Child Life Specialist \u2014 M.S. Demonstrate the ability to represent and communicate child life practice and psychosocial issues of infants, children, youth, and families. Utilize theories of child development, stress and coping, and family systems in pediatric health environments. Demonstrate the ability to work collaboratively in diverse settings. Be eligible to obtain the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential administered by the Association of Child Life Professionals. Apply the concepts of ethical and legal standards of the profession. Be knowledgeable of the impact of health and health issues in the global setting. Professional experience Students will participate in supervised clinical training at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital and various hospitals located in the United States. A 100-hour practicum and 600 hours of internship are required to complete the master's degree. These experiences will provide an opportunity to help students build on course work and put theory into practice. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in various events such as grief camps, health fairs, global health trips, and other various activities on campus to broaden their clinical experiences.

The M.S. degree curriculum in counseling is designed to give students a broad academic background in mental health counseling, advanced course work in one or more selected counseling specializations, and supervised field experience. Candidates must choose one (and may choose both) of the following specializations: licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) or pupil personnel services credential in school counseling (PPS). Degree requirements include completion of 90 quarter units of academic course work and field experience, as stipulated in the curriculum for the chosen specialization(s). Clinical placements range from working as a trainee in University clinics, such as the Behavioral Health Institute (BHI) and the Behavioral Medicine Center (BMC), to off-campus sites of various types. School placements range from elementary, middle, and high school levels. Graduates who complete Loma Linda University's M.S. degree in counseling and LPCC specialization meet all educational requirements to treat individuals, couples, families, and groups. Graduates who complete the M.S. degree in counseling and PPS specialization meet all educational requirements for the school counseling credential. Licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) specialization Professional clinical counseling (LPCC) is a broad-based mental health profession throughout the United States that qualifies LPCCs for work in a variety of settings. Loma Linda University graduates of the M.S. degree in counseling program with LPCC specialization are educationally qualified to treat individuals, couples, families, and groups of all ages. They are also uniquely prepared to address education and career counseling issues and to work with families of children with special needs. When licensed, they may choose to set up a private practice or work in mental health clinics, substance abuse rehabilitation centers, in-patient and out-patient medical facilities, religious organizations, family court, employee assistance programs, retirement homes, higher education, and K-12 schools as mental health counselors. The California Business and Professions Code Section 4999.20 defines professional clinical counseling as \"the application of counseling interventions and psychotherapeutic techniques to identify and remediate cognitive, mental, and emotional issues\u2014including personal growth, adjustment to disability, crisis intervention, and psychosocial162 Counseling \u2014 M.S. and environmental problems. Professional clinical counseling includes conducting assessment for the purpose of establishing counseling goals and objectives to empower individuals to deal adequately with life situations, reduce stress, experience growth, change behavior, and make well-informed rational decisions.\" The California Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) regulates all master's- level licenses in mental health. State standards for LPCC are consistent with national standards, making it easier for graduates to be granted reciprocity throughout the country. Equivalent licensure in other states may be titled licensed professional counselor (LPC), licensed clinical mental health counselor (LCMHC), or similar titles. Complete information regarding scope of license for LPCC is located on the Board of Behavioral Sciences Web site <http://bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lpc/ lpc_scope_practice.pdf>. Pupil personnel services credential (PPS): school counseling specialization School counselors serve as leaders of counseling programs within the educational system who address academic, career, and personal/ social needs of students. They serve as counselors and advocates for students, collaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Combining the school counselor certification with clinical counselor licensure is an excellent professional path that enhances counseling competence and professional opportunities. Additional information about the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling is found at the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing Internet address <http://www.ctc.ca.gov/>. LPCC clinical training and PPS field experience All LPCC and PPS school counseling candidates must complete field experience as advised throughout their program. LPCC completion requires 450 clock hours of clinical training, of which 300 must be face- to-face counseling with clients. PPS school counseling requires 600 clock hours of field experience, 400 of which must be completed in public schools at two different grade levels. Additional details related to hours and supervision will be available upon admission.

The marriage and family therapy profession Marriage and family therapy is a distinct international mental health profession based on the premise that relationships are fundamental to the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) evaluate and treat mental and emotional disorders and other health and behavioral problems; and address a wide array of relationship issues within the context of families and larger systems. The federal government has designated marital and family therapy a core mental health profession\u2014along with counseling, social work, psychiatry, psychiatric nursing, and psychology. All fifty states also support and regulate the profession by licensing or certifying marriage and family therapists. Mission statement The D.M.F.T. degree curriculum is consistent with Loma Linda University's vision of transforming lives through whole-person health care. The mission of this curriculum is to bring health, healing, wholeness, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, clinical training, and community service. The D.M.F.T. degree curriculum accomplishes this by focusing on developing, evaluating, and administering intervention programs that benefit individuals, couples, families, and communities.Ongoing program review The M.S. degree and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F.T.) degree engage in ongoing review of student outcomes and use this information to improve program effectiveness. Data on student outcomes are collected through aggregate scores on the following: quarterly evaluations of clinical competency, results of qualifying examinations and clinical demonstrations, client session and outcome data, and exit surveys and interviews of students at graduation. Alumni surveys are also conducted every two years to track graduates' attainment of marital and family therapy licensure, data on employment, and feedback regarding how well the program prepares graduates for their job responsibilities. The program faculty also maintains regular contact with community agencies and educational institutions in the region to obtain input into curriculum planning and improvements in clinical training. Core ideas guiding the marriage and family therapy doctoral program Relational systems : People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change, therefore, occurs in the context of family, community, and interpersonal relationships. This program focuses on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness : The program encourages wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at every level. Social forces : The program is guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on: research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the Southern California region; the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, and the effects of the changing health-care system and of medical technology; as well as collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Healing power of relationships : As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and healing are enhanced; and the opportunity for making positive contributions is maximized. Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relationship and community involvement skills such that they can cocreate an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity : Congruent with an appreciation of the importance of social forces is an interest in and respect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts\u2014such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic status\u2014result in a wide variety of meanings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The program seeks to create a diverse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involved to learn from the richness of multiple perspectives. Empirical process : The program encourages clinical work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to develop their capacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning; as well as166 Marital and Family Therapy \u2014 M.S objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in therapy, program development and evaluation, and research. Education and prevention : Connections at family, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The program emphasizes helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality : This program sees spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The program places strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Global focus : The mission of the program reaches beyond the local and national levels to the international community. This includes collaboration and experience with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families. Advanced standing policy National accreditation and certification processes ensure that degrees are comparable across institutional boundaries. This advanced standing policy recognizes the value of these professional review processes on the part of the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences and facilitates cooperation in professional training within the marital and family therapy discipline. The policy assures that at least 60 percent of doctoral academic credit will be earned at Loma Linda, while enabling cooperative relationships with other accredited programs. Guidelines Advanced standing may be granted for previous course work equivalent in content and scope to required counseling and family sciences (CFS) courses. This reduces the number of units to be taken at LLU. Determination of advanced standing is based on the following guidelines: 1. Residency requirements a. Doctoral degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 60 units for a Ph.D. degree in systems, families, and couples with marital and family therapy specialty, or below 40 units for a Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F.T.) degree. 2. Determination of equivalency a. Courses applied to advanced standing must be graduate-level courses earned at an accredited institution. No credit may be applied for grades lower than B-. b. Courses completed in programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marital and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) or certified family life education (CLFE) programs approved by the National Council on Family Relations will be reviewed as a whole in relation to CFS program requirements. It is anticipated that comparable course content from these schools may be divided into different course configurations than that of LLU. Students wishing advanced standing based on units earned at other institutions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with COAMFTE or NCFR standards. c. Advanced standing is not granted for religion courses. d. Doctoral courses taken more than five years previously may be considered for advanced standing only if the content hasbeen used professionally on a regular basis and the student can demonstrate current knowledge in the field. e. Approved prior client contact hours may also be applied. See CFS doctoral handbook for approval process. 3. Approval process Students seeking advanced standing should meet with their program director prior to admission or within the first two quarters of study and supply copies of each syllabus of prior course work. Following course review, the program director will write a letter to the School of Behavioral Health that outlines which courses from previous institutions qualify for advanced standing and which equivalent CFS courses will be waived. The letter will specify how many units and client contact hours the student will need to complete the degree. Rather than completing separate academic variances for each course, the student will submit one academic variance accompanied by the program director's letter outlining the advanced standing. Financial assistance Students who are accepted into the M.S., Ph.D., or D.M.F.T. degree curriculums may apply for work-study and department-funded research, teaching, and administrative assistantships awarded by the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences. Departmental awards are contingent on the availability of funds. Students may also apply for need-based financial aid, such as a loan or other work-study programs on campus. Students accepted into the Ph.D. or D.M.F.T. degree curriculum in marital and family therapy are eligible for and encouraged to apply for the AAMFT minority fellowships.

Moline The Master of Science degree curriculum in marital and family therapy is designed to give students an excellent COAMFTE clinical and academic background; as well as professional practice for working with individuals, couples, groups, and families in a variety of settings. The program emphasis is systemic and relational practice, and couples and family therapy. These include but are not limited to medical, legal, educational, mental health, managed care, public and private agencies, church settings, and private practice.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 167 Mission, vision, and values The program's mission: Educating MFT students to provide effective and competent care to diverse families in local, national, and international communities. The program's vision: MFT students will learn how to \"make diverse families whole.\" The definition, configuration, and experience of family vary widely; and students are trained to regard, respect, and value human difference and family types so as to work successfully with all those who seek the services of a marital and family therapist. The program has adopted five Loma Linda University values as central to the values of this program: Compassion\u2014 The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan. Integrity \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Excellence\u2014 The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. Freedom\u2014 The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. Justice\u2014 The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. Licensure and program accreditation Marriage and family therapy is established in California by law as a profession requiring state licensure. Persons who desire to enter the profession must have the academic and clinical preparation and must pass required licensing examinations. Clinical license requirements vary by state and include additional hours of supervised clinical practice beyond those hours that are completed while studying for the graduate degree. The Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) determined that Loma Linda University's master's degree in marital and family therapy meets the Senate Bill statutory requirements for marriage and family therapy under Business and Professions Code (BPC) section 4980.36 and 4980.37 (www.bbbs.ca.gov). The program offered by Loma Linda University is fully accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COMAFTE), the accrediting body for the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). The national commission ensures that academic and clinical training programs adhere to the highest standards of the profession. Conduct or disciplinary actions The applicant should view \"instruction for completing application for registration as a marriage and family intern\" at the Board of Behavioral Science Examiner's Website for possible issues that may prevent someone from obtaining a marital and family therapy license in the state of California or any state in which a license is sought. A person who completes a graduate degree in MFT may be denied licensure due to prior convictions; and this has to be clearly considered before pursuing studies or such license.Clinical training In addition to successful completion of 90 quarter units of academic course work, students in the Marital and Family Therapy Program must complete field experience at clinical placement sites. Upon completion of 18 quarter units, the student will be evaluated by all the teaching faculty to determine if s/he will be allowed to continue the program and/ or be permitted to enter the clinical phase of the program. Students have numerous choices of placement sites across Southern California in which to gain required clinical experience. These sites include community mental health centers, private and public agencies, school and hospital settings, and the department's counseling and family sciences clinic. Some stipends are available for trainees. The clinical training includes a seven-quarter practicum sequence and supervision of trainees at a clinical site. Students must take 18 units of practicum and complete a minimum of 500 clinical hours and 100 direct supervision hours. Of the direct client contact hours, at least 250 hours must be with couples and families. Of the direct supervision hours, at least 50 hours must be with raw data (video, audio, and live supervision). For every week in which clients are seen, the student must have at least one hour of individual supervision. The ratio of supervision hours to treatment hours must not be less than one hour of supervision to five hours of clinical contact. Students enrolled in the program should consult the clinical training manual regarding clinical training requirements. Degree completion The M.S. degree in marital and family therapy may be completed in either two years of full-time study or at least three years of part-time study. Students have up to five years to complete the degree. In order to maintain full-time status, students must take a minimum of 8 units during the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer quarters. Mostly, first- year students attend classes on Tuesday and Thursday; and second- year students attend classes on Monday and Wednesday. Full-time employment is discouraged when a student is enrolled for full-time study. Clinical traineeships are usually on days students are not in class. In order to participate in the June commencement exercises, students must complete all the required 500 clinical hours and the 90 units of required courses.

Normal time to complete the program 2 years (7 academic quarters) based on full-time enrollment Post-master's course MFAM 744 Clinical Internship 1 Total Units 1 Marital and Family Therapy \u2014 D.M.F.T. Interim program director Winetta Oloo The Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F.T.) program is one of the few D.M.F.T. programs in the United States that is accredited by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). The degree curriculum adopts the practitioner-administrator-evaluator approach and focuses on applied skill development for use in clinical practice and administrative positions. The goal of the curriculum is to prepare students to apply evidence-based standards to the systemic/ relational principles of marriage and family therapy as they design, evaluate, and administer programs that impact a clinical population. Graduates of the D.M.F.T. program are multiculturally informed and well-prepared to serve as ethically-competent leaders who advance the marital and family therapy profession. Our alumni most often work as program directors, grant writers, program evaluators, advanced cliniciansand clinical supervisors across the nation and even outside of the United States. Some alumni also serve the University as faculty members and adjunct professors. The 121-unit* D.M.F.T. degree curriculum requires a minimum of three years of full-time study for completion. This includes course work, 1000 hours of direct client contact, a doctoral project, and supervised professional development experience. The program is also designed to meet the requirements for California state licensure as a marital and family therapist. *Students who have completed a master's degree from a COAMFTE- accredited program receive advanced standing of 43 units, reducing the required time to complete the degree to a minimum of two years. Consideration for advanced standing will be given to students entering the D.M.F.T. program with an M.A. or an M.S. degree from a non- COAMFTE-accredited program on a course-by-course basis. Knowledge and skills promoted Theory and practice Students study the work of the original thinkers in marital and family therapy, as well as the most recent developments in the field\u2014such as social constructionism, evidence-based practice, and global perspectives. D.M.F.T. degree students will develop skills in applying marriage and family therapy principles and frameworks to public and private clinical practice settings. They will develop a critical understanding of the theoretical and philosophical foundations of marriage and family therapy, be conversant with the current issues in the field, and use this knowledge to develop programs and services. Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves and invites reflection and consideration of the impact of their personal values, social positions, and contexts on their clinical, administrative, and program development practices. Students are supported in the development of their strengths as they create an epistemological framework and ethical consciousness that guide their approach to professional practice in their lives; and are encouraged to engage beyond their local communities to include experiences in wider cultural and global contexts. Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply an in-depth understanding of theory to the practice of marital and family therapy interventions and program activities at the family, community, and societal levels\u2014drawing on the core marriage and family therapy frameworks. They will develop sophistication in clinical, administrative, and supervisory skills necessary for multisystemic engagement. As it is COAMFTE-accredited, the D.M.F.T. degree program offers students the opportunity to complete the requirements for becoming an AAMFT-approved supervisor prior to graduation. Evaluation skills Students will develop skills and understanding of the process of evaluation research related to marital and family therapy programs and services. This includes the ability to apply research findings to clinical practice and to utilize research findings in creative ways for the benefit of the general population. D.M.F.T. degree students will focus on evaluation of program performance and outcomes in practice-based settings. Program goal and outcomes The goal of the D.M.F.T. degree program is to prepare doctoral-level marital and family therapists to serve as program developers, as well asLoma Linda University 2017-2018 171 evaluators-administrators, who thereby promote the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. This goal works in combination with the larger University mission of advancing health services that attend to the whole person by developing practiced-based knowledge in marriage and family therapy. There are two overall program outcomes. These outcomes integrate our University's commitment to diversity and quality training of health-care professionals with the need for diverse doctoral-level practitioners skilled in program development/evaluation and administration. The program outcomes are: 1. The program will graduate a diverse student body prepared to advance the field of marriage and family therapy through practiced- based leadership. 2. The program will prepare doctoral-level family therapy professionals to apply the systemic/relational principles of the field to design, evaluate, and administer programs that contribute to MFT practice. Student learning outcomes 1. Students will develop a professional identity as doctoral-level marital and family therapists aligned with national practice standards. 2. Students will become adept in systems/relational practice, demonstrating sophistication as therapists, program developers, evaluators, and administrators of marital and family therapy services. 3. Students will be able to use marital and family therapy, human development, and family science literature to design and evaluate programs, clinical protocols, organizational structures, and service- delivery processes. 4. To further benefit families and communities, students will demonstrate the ability to use research and evaluation methodologies to improve human service program performance and outcomes. 5. Students will be responsive to the societal, cultural, and spiritual contexts in which health and well-being are embedded. 6. Students will develop an ethical consciousness that guides their practice in all aspects of professional work. Advanced standing policy National accreditation and certification processes ensure that degrees are comparable across institutional boundaries. This advanced standing policy recognizes the value of these professional review processes on the part of the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences and facilitates cooperation in professional training within the marital and family therapy discipline. The policy assures that at least half of all interim master's degree units and 60 percent of doctoral academic credit will be earned at Loma Linda University, while enabling cooperative relationships with other accredited programs. Guidelines Advanced standing may be granted for previous course work equivalent in content and scope to required counseling and family sciences (CFS) courses. This reduces the number of units to be taken at this University. Determination of advanced standing is based on the following guidelines: 1. Residency requirements a. Interim master's degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 45 units for an interim master's degree earned in combination with a CFS doctoral degree. b. Doctoral degree. Advanced standing may not reduce total units below 60 units for a Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy,Ph.D. degree in family studies, or Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy (D.M.F.T.) degree. 2. Determination of equivalency a. Credits applied to advanced standing must be graduate-level courses earned at an accredited institution. No credit may be applied for grades lower than B-. b. Courses completed in programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Martial and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) will be reviewed as a whole in relation to CFS program requirements. It is anticipated that comparable course content from these schools may be divided into different course configurations than that of this University. Students seeking advanced standing based on units earned at other institutions will be evaluated on a case-by-base basis in accordance with COAMFTE standards. c. Advanced standing is not granted for religion courses. d. Doctoral courses taken more than five years previously may be considered for advanced standing only if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis and the student can demonstrate current knowledge in the field. e. Approved prior client contact hours may also be applied. See CFS doctoral handbook for approval process. 3. Approval process Students seeking advanced standing should meet with their program director prior to admission or within the first two quarters of study and supply copies of each syllabus of prior course work. Following the course review, the program director will write a letter to the School of Behavioral Health that outlines which courses from previous institutions qualify for advanced standing and which equivalent CFS courses will be waived. The letter will specify how many units and client contact hours the student will need to complete the degree. Rather than completing separate academic variances for each course, the student will submit one academic variance accompanied by the program director's letter outlining the advanced standing. Financial assistance Students who are accepted into the D.M.F.T. degree curriculum in marital and family therapy may apply for work-study and department-funded research, teaching , and administrative assistantships awarded by the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences. Departmental awards are contingent on the availability of funds. Students may also apply for need-based financial aid, such as a loan or other work-study programs on campus. Students accepted into the D.M.F.T. degree curriculum in marital and family therapy are eligible for and encouraged to apply for the AAMFT minority fellowships.

Simpson The School Counseling Program certificate is one of two options in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences that qualify a graduate for the California pupil personnel services (PPS) credential in school counseling. Students pursuing the M.S. degree curriculum in the Counseling Program may choose school counseling as a single specialization embedded in the degree program, or combine it with the licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) specialization. Students in the Marital and Family Therapy Program may add the School Counseling Program certificate to their M.S. degree curriculum. Successful completion of the certificate, including passing scores on all sections of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST), will qualify graduates for the California PPS credential in school counseling. As with all department programs, the School Counseling Program certificate is designed in accordance with the department's vision of transforming relationships. Faculty are committed to the mission of facilitating wholeness by promoting health, healing, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, professional training, community service, and global outreach. The call to service In the heart of the campus, the University's commitment to service is memorialized in the Good Samaritan sculpture that contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. As counselingneeds are more openly recognized and accepted across cultures, students and faculty are called to serve together in local and global communities. Loma Linda University's relationships around the world continue to create unique opportunities for students to join in global partnership through field experience. Professional school counseling Professional school counselors are leaders of counseling programs within the educational system. As articulated by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), school counseling programs are preventive in design, developmental in nature, and integral to the total educational program. Counselors address academic, career, and personal/social needs through their work as advocates for K-12 students, collaborators with parents and school personnel, and liaisons to the community. Employment as a school counselor in public schools requires the pupil personnel services credential in school counseling. Combining the school counselor certification with licensure in clinical mental health is an excellent professional path that enhances competence and professional opportunities. Additional information is located on the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing Web site at <http:// www.ctc.ca.gov>. Degree and certificate requirements The School Counseling Program certificate is paired with the M.S. degree at Loma Linda University. An approved master's degree is required for state credentialing. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the certificate and receive a University recommendation for the school counseling credential until all degree and certificate requirements are completed. This applies to students pursuing the M.S. degree in the Counseling Program (credential option) and the M.S. degree in the Marital and Family Therapy Program (school counseling certificate option). Required courses for the certificate/credential program are listed at the end of this narrative. Certificate of clearance prior to field placement School Counseling Program students must obtain a certificate of clearance (COC) from the state of California before they are allowed to begin field experience. The COC requires verification of a current TB test and a LiveScan, in accordance with state guidelines. The process can take six-to-eight weeks. Practicum and field experience Field experience requirements for the certificate program include 100 hours of prefield practicum followed by 600 hours of field experience. For students in a clinical master's degree, prefield hours are met earlier in the program through clinical placements. In addition, 200 of the required 600 hours of school counseling field experience can be elective hours from clinical training. The remaining 400 hours must be completed as a school counselor trainee in public schools, evenly divided between two different grade blocks (e.g., elementary school, middle school, or high school). California Test of Basic Skills (CBEST) Candidates for the school counseling certificate must take the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) within the first two quarters following admission to the program and must pass all sections of the CBEST before the University can recommend them for the school counseling credential.174 Systems, Families and Couples\u2014Ph.D. Financial assistance This program is not independently eligible for federal financial aid. However, a student can complete the requirements for this certificate while concurrently enrolled in a School of Behavioral Health graduate degree program as noted above (see degree and certificate requirements). Program learning outcomes School Counseling Program students will: 1. Integrate counseling concepts and skills with a personal epistemology. 2. Demonstrate counseling interventions based upon a broad range of theoretical and legal/ethical frameworks through comprehensive written examination. 3. Develop identity as a professional school counselor through membership and participation in professional organizations. 4. Satisfactorily complete 600 clock hours of supervised practicum in counseling, 200 of which may be supervised clinical hours. 5. Meet all University qualifications for the California pupil personnel services credential in school counseling issued by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).

The 103-unit curriculum requires a minimum of four years of full-time study for completion\u2014 including two-to-three years of course work, clinical practice leading to licensure or certification, a dissertation, and supervised professional development experiences. The purpose of the curriculum is to develop family life scholars and practitioners who will advance theory, research, practice, and teaching in the field of family social science. Students will be prepared for academic and clinical training positions in universities and postgraduate institutes. Ph.D. degree students develop expertise in conducting original research using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches. Ph.D. degree program specialty Students in the Ph.D. degree program in systems, families, and couples will choose one of two specialties: family studies or couples and family therapy. These specialties include required courses totaling 22 units of course work and undergird the entire doctoral program of study. The family studies specialty focuses on skills development in the delivery of family services, especially within a teaching format. An example of this might be developing curriculum for parenting courses. The family studies specialty meets the course requirements of the National Council on Family Relations for Certified Family Life Educator (CFLE). More information on becoming certified by the National Council on Family Relations can be found in the organization's official web site at http:// www.ncfr.org. The couples and family therapy specialty focuses on researching and honing clinical skill for work with family systems. This specialty is fully accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COMAFTE), the accrediting body for the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). The national commission functions to ensure that academic and clinical training programs adhere to the highest standards of the profession. For more information on the field of marital and family therapy, core ideas guiding this doctoral program, and the marital and family therapy specialty's advanced standing policy, see the overview section (p. 165) for the D.M.F.T. degree program. Knowledge and skills promoted Theory and practice Students study the work of original thinkers in systems, families, and couples; as well as the most recent developments in the field\u2014such as social constructionism, evidence-based practice, and global perspective. Students will develop a critical understanding of the theoretical and philosophical foundations of the field; critically examine the interrelationships between sociohistorical factors, transnational family structures and relationships, and clinical approaches; be conversant in the current issues in the field; and contribute to the discourse regarding them. They will use this knowledge to advance the field of family therapy. Personal development The program encourages students to develop a clear understanding of themselves; and it invites reflection and consideration of the impact of their personal values, social positions, and contexts on their clinical and scholarly practices. Students are supported in the development of their strengths as they create an epistemological framework and ethical consciousness to guide their research and practice, and are encouraged to engage beyond their local communities to include experiences in wider cultural and global contexts.Practice and supervisory skills Students will apply a critical understanding of theory to work with couples and families, community, and societal levels drawing on the core modalities of the field. They will develop sophistication in their personal and professional skills, supervisory skills, and skills for active multisystemic involvement. Research skills Students will develop skills and a critical understanding of the process of research and evaluation related to families and intervention work. This includes the ability to apply research findings to clinical practice and to utilize research findings in creative ways for the benefit of the general population. Ph.D. degree students will develop expertise in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research approaches, leading to publication in scholarly journals and presentations at professional conferences. Teaching skills The program provides experiential and didactic training for teaching in higher education as well as community settings. Through didactic training, students will be exposed to various teaching and learning paradigms and will ultimately select their own epistemology. They will test and grow this epistemology through experiential training as they lead a course (e.g., develop syllabi, tests, assignments, etc.) under the supervision of a faculty member. Advanced students will also be given opportunities to facilitate, or cofacilitate a course on their own. Student learning outcomes Family studies 1.

Both conceptually and pragmatically, the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an overarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspective and methodological framework that supports the use of scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of interdisciplinary scholarship when studying the interrelated aspects of behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment brought together for the purpose of creating sustainable interventions directed toward improving the functioning of individuals, families, groups, organizations, institutions, and communities. As such, priority has been given to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars for advanced practice roles\u2014capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations.

Program director Kimberly Freeman Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole,\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice, within a behavioral health framework, can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. An interdisciplinary approach to this course of study considers the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities. The curriculum provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system within a forensic behavioral health specialization. Mission The mission of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically and analytically about the problems of crime and social control in contemporary society and to work with the legal system as it relates to a forensic behavioral health framework. Program objectives Students will demonstrate: The ability to integrate and utilize knowledge of social science and theories of criminology as these apply to criminal justice issues within behavioral health settings. An understanding of the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency. An understanding of the structure of the American criminal juvenile justice systems.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 187 An understanding of the ethical principles that guide the concepts of justice and fairness within professional criminal justice/forensic behavioral health practice. An understanding of mental illness and treatment interventions within a forensic behavioral health framework. An understanding of the differences between retributive and restorative justice approaches in addressing the effects of crime. General overview The 48-quarter unit program begins with 12 units of core course work. The curriculum is divided into three professional areas of study, which include: criminal justice, religion and ethics, and social research methods. During the final year of study, students complete the forensic behavioral health specialization along with specialized selectives. Forensic behavioral health is a specialized branch of professional practice in which the clinical and criminal justice worlds overlap. Students will focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice systems that experience severe mental illness and may also present with co- occurring substance use. Students will gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming. In addition, students will be prepared to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for community treatment. Students have two options to complete the program: 1. Nonthesis: Professional practica (540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar) and 8 units of didactic selectives; OR 2. Thesis: 6 units of academic thesis and 2 units of didactic selectives. Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) admission requirements, this program follows the admission requirements of the School of Behavioral Health (p. 152), as follows: 1. Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. These criteria include: A cumulative undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale). Applicants with lower grade point averages will be considered if the last 45-quarter credits (30 semester units) of non-field practica coursework shows significant improvement or if they have additional attributes that demonstrate preparedness and an appropriate fit for graduate education in the area of Criminal Justice. Work and volunteer experiences must be verified by employer/supervisor statements on official agency stationery. Further consideration will also be given to individuals who provide evidence of additional graduate coursework, certifications, and/ or training that illustrate preliminary preparation for a career in Criminal Justice. Students who are admitted to the Criminal Justice Program with a cumulative G.P.A. below 3.0 may be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning assistance program. Demonstration, through the application and interview processes, of compatibility with professional standards set by the program including the ability to develop and nurture interpersonal relationships, communication skills, self-awareness, professional comportment, critical thinking skills, fit with the mission and values of Loma Linda University and the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology, and the capacity to successfully complete the Master of Science in Criminal Justice curriculum.2. Submission of three letters of recommendation (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor preferred). Program requirements The 48-unit curriculum for the M.S. degree in criminal justice provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research activities essential for M.S. degree students. Students must maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale) in order to progress successfully though the program and complete the degree. In addition students must meet the knowledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. All course grades should meet the minimum B (3.0) standard, which by university policy indicates satisfactory performance. Courses in which a student earns a grade below a B (3.0) may need to be repeated (or may not apply to the degree) if competency in the subject area is related to practice performance with clients, and a grade less than a 3.0 represents marginal or unsatisfactory practice performance.

Program director Kimberly Freeman Gerontology is the multidisciplinary-multidimensional study of aging and aging processes. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge and skills required for competent practice, with considerable attention given to understanding the social, cultural, and economic factors that affect services for this population. Mission The mission of the Gerontology Program is to provide graduate-level education for future and current professionals who are dedicated to enhancing the lives of older adults through evidenced-based interventions. Program objectives Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate human behavior and developmental theories of aging, incorporating a bio-psycho- social-spiritual strength-based orientation to geriatric practice. Students will demonstrate the ability to use research in evaluating the effectiveness of practice and programs in achieving intended outcomes for older adults. Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate into practice an understanding of intersectionality and the unique needs of older adults belonging to specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic groups; of men and women; and of those with different sexual orientations. Students will demonstrate knowledge of professional ethics in proving assistance to older adults. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the policies that shape and regulate the continuum of care and services available to older adults. General overview The 48-unit program begins with 14 units of core course work required for all students. The curriculum is further divided into three professional areas of study which includes: religion and ethics, social research methods, and geriatric practice. Students also take specialized selectives to further enhance their area of interest. The curriculum allows students to develop their knowledge and skills in locating and providing resources, services, and opportunities for older adults and their families; as well asa problem-solving approach supporting the development of coping skills for older adults and their caregivers. In addition to the above, students are given either a thesis or a nonthesis (professional practicum) option. 1. Thesis: Students who choose the thesis option complete 6 research- related units and 5 units of selectives. 2. Nonthesis: Students choosing the internship option complete a practical orientation, 540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar, and 11 units of didactic selectives.

Normal time to complete the program 2 years (7 academic quarters ) based on full-time enrollment; part time permittedPlay Therapy \u2014 Certificate Program director Kimberly Freeman Play therapy is a recognized, theoretically-based approach for working with children and adolescents presenting with a number of behavioral health issues. This approach utilizes toys and other expressive activities as forms of communication and as an intervention method for problem solving and promoting well-being. The Play Therapy Program certificate is designed to meet the educational requirements of the Association of Play Therapy (APT) to become a registered play therapist (RPT). It also provides students with 50 hours of supervised play therapy experience, which can be counted towards the requirement for becoming an RPT. Objectives Students will understand the history of play therapy and its application in the assessment and treatment of children and youth. Students will understand the theories that inform play therapy with children and adolescents, including those guiding assessment, diagnosis, and specialized interventions. Students will understand the methods and techniques used in play therapy with children and adolescents, including those applicable in specialized interventions. Students will be able to correctly apply play therapy methods and techniques with children and adolescents. The Play Therapy Program certificate is housed under the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies in the School of Behavioral Health. Programs under the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies are considered areas of study that are applicable to all of the behavioral health professions. As such, these programs bring together the collective academic and clinical expertise of all of the departments in the School of Behavioral Health. Students concurrently enrolled in a degree program in the School of Behavioral Health need to work with their respective programs to determine if any of the courses in the Play Therapy Program may also count toward electives. University policies regarding double credits for courses apply.

Policy and research specialization Students admitted to the program should have demonstrated evidence of policy and research interests that are compatible with the areas of expertise supported by program faculty. Information regarding faculty areas of expertise is available by contacting the program director. Years one and two are largely composed of course work and comprehensive examimations. Upon completing required course work, students engage in the development of an individualized program of applied research and policy activities directed by a faculty member. An applied research product, usually a publishable paper, is the result of a year-long activity and often serves as the third comprehensive examination. After completing all required course work and passing three comprehensive examimations, students choose a dissertation committee chair and committee with whom they work closely to develop and defend a dissertation proposal\u2014 following University guidelines. Upon successful defense of the proposal students are admitted to candidacy and actively engage in dissertation research, culminating in the successful defense of their dissertation. Consistent with Faculty of Graduate Study policy, the department requires a two-publication dissertation. More information is available from the program director.

Dissertation research for Ph.D. degree candidates follows University guidelines. Details regarding these requirements can be obtained from the program director. Normal time to complete the program 5 years based on full-time enrollment; part time permitted Social Work \u2014 M.S.W. Program director Kimberly Freeman The social work profession centers on improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full, productive participation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree offered by the Social Work Program (M.S.W.) in the School of Behavioral Health emphasizes an ecological perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system with his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole\"; and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the development of the generalist curriculum, clinical practice specialization, and selection of practicum sites for the Social Work program. Mission The mission of the Master of Social Work degree program at Loma Linda University is to prepare competent, ethical, and compassionate advanced social work practitioners who possess the knowledge, values, attitudes, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole person care in advanced practice and leadership roles within behavioral health institutions and agencies. Goals The goals of the M.S.W. in social work degree are to: Instill in graduates the knowledge, ethics, values, and skills expected of professional social workers. Prepare students for advanced practice with diverse populations and the advancement of social and economic justice in local, national, and international communities. Equip students to integrate research and practice for advancing the profession of social work. Prepare advanced social work practitioners for work in behavioral health institutions and agencies. Transition students into professional roles with a commitment to life- long learning. Competencies Reflected in the above goals are the following nine social work competencies that describe the knowledge, values, skills, and the cognitive and affective processes that define and inform generalist and clinical practice. 1. Demonstrate ethical and professional behavior. 2. Engage diversity and difference in practice.3. Advance human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice. 4. Engage in practice-informed research and research-informed practice. 5. Engage in policy practice. 6. Engage with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. 7. Assess individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. 8. Intervene with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. 9. Evaluate practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Liberal arts preparation The M.S.W. in social work degree curriculum is built on a liberal arts perspective. Individual applicants whose undergraduate degree does not reflect this perspective may be asked to enroll in additional courses. Please note: Any prerequisite requirements must be completed before admission to the M.S.W. degree program. General overview The program begins with the generalist content (first-year courses) common to all graduate social work education. The generalist practice curriculum is grounded in the liberal arts and the person-in-environment framework. Within this framework, students learn to promote social well-being, and build on the strength and resiliency of all human beings through a range of prevention and intervention practice methods when working with diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Integrated within the curriculum, students learn to apply ethical principles, critical thinking and research-informed practice at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels while also maintaining emphasis on diversity, advocacy for human rights, and social and economic justice. The clinical practice specialization builds on the strengths-based and ecological practice perspective of the generalist curriculum by extending, expanding, and enhancing students' ability to effectively engage in advanced clinical practice. This requires the integration of generalist and clinical practice theories and intervention methods as applied to individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Theoretical perspectives include empowerment, strengths approach, attachment, child development, risk and resiliency, trauma, cognitive neuroscience, family systems, cognitive behavior, and psychodynamic; all of which are enhanced by the person-in-the-environment perspective. These theoretical underpinnings support student skill acquisition and development through the clinical specialization courses with a firm grounding in engagement, diagnostic assessment, problem solving, social policy, and evidence-informed treatment approaches. Students' clinical practice experiences also attend to the needs and rights of all persons to promote social and economic justice. Clinical students also learn to be alert to and understand the importance of continuous self- reflection and practice evaluation. Program options Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers the two-year, three-year, and four-year options. Students completing the two-year option cannot be engaged in regular full-time employment. An advanced standing option is also available to qualified B.S.W. degree students (see below).Loma Linda University 2017-2018 193 Beginning Fall 2016\u2014 as a result of a cost-shared agreement\u2014an online hybrid (online and onsite) M.S.W. degree program is offered for full- time employees of Riverside County only. All program requirements for the Riverside County cohort are the same as those required for the on-campus cohorts for the three-year, part-time option. A separate application portal has been created for the Riverside County cohort, which requires verification of full-time employment with Riverside County. Courses for the onsite portion of this hybrid program will be taught at: Riverside County Innovation Center 3450 Fourteenth Street Riverside CA 92501 Inquiries about this program should be directed to the Dr. Kimberly Freeman, M.S.W. program director. Advanced standing for B.S.W. degree students Students who have earned a B.S.W. degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE)-accredited program within the past five years have the opportunity to remove areas of redundancy in their education through consideration for advanced standing. In their personal statement, which is part of the application for admission to the M.S.W. degree program, B.S.W. degree students can request consideration for advanced standing status and thus have the opportunity to complete their M.S.W. degree in twelve months. Students completing the advanced standing track must begin the M.S.W. degree program during the Summer Quarter, which requires individuals to submit all components of their application packet by January 15 of the enrollment year (exceptions to this date will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis). Advanced standing students enrolling as part of the summer cohort are eligible to receive a scholarship covering up to 14 units, not including living expenses. Information on scholarships is updated annually. See the M.S.W. Handbook on the department website for more specific information: http://behavioralhealth.llu.edu/programs/social-work/msw- social-work Transfer students Transfer students who have taken courses in an M.S.W. degree program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) may transfer up to 20 percent of the 78 units required for the M.S.W. degree at Loma Linda University, unless otherwise approved. Evaluation of all courses is conducted on a case-by-case basis using course outlines, transcripts, and course catalog entries to review and assure adequate equivalency. The Academic Standards Committee evaluates these equivalencies. The 20 percent transfer of units is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a B (G.P.A. of 3.0) grade or better has been recorded. Note: The grades of courses transferred do not calculate into a student's G.P.A. earned while matriculating through the program at Loma Linda University. A maximum of nine (9) quarter units that have been previously applied to another master's degree may be accepted as transfer credits in the areas of research methods and statistics. Individuals wishing to transfer research methods and/or statistics courses must first pass the program's competency examination/s in these areas. Consideration is given to other course transfers on a case-by-case basis. Professional (field) practica grades/credits are not typically transferable \u2014review is made on a case-by-case basis. Consideration may begiven if there is clear evidence that the student has met the practice competencies of the M.S.W. degree program. No academic credit is given for life experience and/or previous work experience for any part for the M.S.W. degree program (i.e., generalist and clinical practica, courses in the generalist or clinical specialization curricula). Central academic requirements and processes M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 units completed toward the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. advancement G.P.A. during the new student orientation. Qualifying review When all generalist course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review (see the M.S.W. Handbook ). The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in the assessment of strengths and areas for improvement, provide feedback, foster an environment of self-evaluation, and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Generalist and clinical practica Field practica are regarded as an integral part of the Social Work Program as these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another\u2014presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to clinical practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. The emphasis of SOWK 757A Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar and Seminar, and SOWK 757C Generalist Practicum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or 9 generalist practica units) is on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills\u2014including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspective as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A Clinical Practicum and Seminar Seminar, and SOWK 787C Clinical Practicum and Seminar (600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar or 12 clinical practica units) reflects the clinical practice specialization and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced practice capabilities. More specifically, clinical practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the generalist skills achieved during the first year of study.194 Social Work \u2014 M.S.W. Research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually-authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. Wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during the generalist and clinical practica and seminar experiences. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development begins during the first year of study and culminates during the second year of study as the student completes the final quarter of the clinical practicum. This experience emphasizes the student's plans for employment, lifelong learning, and integration of the core values of Loma Linda University; and is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of transitioning professional. Combined degrees Students interested in completing a combined degrees curriculum with the Social Work and Gerontology programs, the Social Work and Criminal Justice programs, or the Social Work and Social Policy and Social Research programs should contact the Social Work Department directly. Accreditation The Master of Social Work Program is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to provide master's degree-level education, with the next reaffirmation to be completed in 2018. Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) admission requirements, admission to the Social Work Program is governed by the policies and procedures established by the School of Behavioral Health (p. 152 ). Admission requirements for the M.S.W. Program include the following: 1. A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university. 2. The MSW curriculum is built on a liberal arts perspective. Individual applicants whose undergraduate degree does not reflect this perspective may be asked to enroll in additional courses. 3. Applicants must submit a completed application, including a personal statement; application fee; all college and/or university transcripts; and at least three letters of recommendation\u2014preferably one of which is from an academic source and one from a work supervisor. 4. Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. These criteria include: A cumulative undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale). Applicants with lower grade point averages will be considered if the last 45-quarter credits (30 semester units) of non-field practica course work shows significant improvement or if they have additional attributes that demonstrate preparedness and an appropriate fit for graduate social work education. Work and volunteer experiences must be verified by employer/ supervisor statements on official agency stationery. Furtherconsideration will also be given to individuals who provide evidence of additional graduate coursework, certifications, and/ or training that illustrate preliminary preparation for a career in social work. Students who are admitted to the Social Work Program with a cumulative G.P.A. below 3.0 may be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning assistance program. Demonstration, through the application and interview processes, of compatibility with the profession of social work, ability to develop and nurture interpersonal relationships, communication skills, self-awareness, professional comportment, critical thinking skills, fit with the mission and values of Loma Linda University and the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology, and the capacity to successfully complete the Master of Social Work curriculum. Program requirements The M.S.W. degree consists of 78 units of didactic course work and 21 units of professional practica experience. Students must maintain a program grade point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale) and meet the knowledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. All course grades should meet the minimum B (3.0) standard, which by university policy indicates satisfactory performance. Courses in which a student earns a grade below a B (3.0) may need to be repeated (or may not apply to the degree) if competency in the subject area is related to practice performance with clients, and a grade less than a 3.0 represents marginal or unsatisfactory practice performance.

Interim Dean, School of Dentistry Loma Linda University 2017-2018 197 School foundations History A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to establish an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Subsequently, official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty- two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960, Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period, the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s, the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic wasremodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for internationally trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensive, twenty-four-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. Beginning with the nineteen-year deanship of Dr. Charles Goodacre in 1994, the School of Dentistry focused particularly on research, service learning, and technology that included the development of electronic learning materials and the acquisition and utilization of 3D computed tomography (3DCT) and computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. A preclinical laboratory was remodeled into a simulation laboratory in 2008. The laboratory included flat-panel monitors with access to faculty presentations and the clinical management system. The Department of Dental Hygiene added two programs to meet changing professional needs. In 2008, the B.S. Online Degree Completion Program accepted the first cohort, allowing licensed hygienists to complete a B.S. degree online in six quarters. In the autumn of 2010, the LLU Center for Dentistry and Orthodontics was opened in San Bernardino, three miles from the school. The three-story treatment, research, and teaching facility brought together the University's Advanced Education Program in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics and the School of Dentistry's faculty practices \u2014creating the most comprehensive oral health care center in the Inland Empire. In September 2011, the Department of Dental Hygiene accepted the inaugural class at the off-campus Associate in Science degree program in Palm Desert, California. A year later (August 2012), another opening featured the school's groundbreaking for the Hugh Love Center for Research and Education in Technology. Comprising six operatories and a three-chair open clinic, the 3,000-square-foot center enables qualified students, under faculty supervision, the opportunity to treat patients using the very latest in dental technology. Dr. Ronald J. Dailey was named School of Dentistry dean in July of 2013. Having led the school through all of its academic challenges198 School of Dentistry as an associate dean since 1993, Dr. Dailey was well prepared to pilot the school's programs through revisions that accommodate new accreditation standards; as well as the Joint Commission on National Dental Board Examination's integration of basic, clinical, and behavioral sciences into a single national board examination. The School of Dentistry continues to regularly expand the opportunities for enhanced student learning by improving physical facilities; making regular curricular modifications; and reinforcing the excellence of its clinical practices in light of its motto, \"Service Is Our Calling.\" Our mission Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ as: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound biologic principles.

This section of the CATALOG providesthe general setting for the programs of the School of Dentistry and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Specific program requirements Information on the preceding pages pertains to general requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibility to be fully informed not only of these general requirements but also of the specific requirements in the following pages, which govern the curriculum of the chosen program. Programs and degrees The School of Dentistry offers a comprehensive range of programs. Each of the school's six programs draws on the curricula of the various departments. 1. The undergraduate curriculum, the DENTAL HYGIENE program and the DENTAL HYGIENE DEGREE COMPLETION program, leads to the Bachelor of Science degree and prepares the dental hygienist to enter a variety of careers. Dental hygiene is a four-year college curriculum; the junior and senior years are taken in the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. The DENTAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATE IN SCIENCE degree is a three-year college curriculum in which the first year prerequisites are taken at a regionally accredited college, and the remaining two years are taken at the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry off-campus site. 2. The four-year professional curriculum, the GENERAL DENTISTRY program, leads to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree and equips the general dentist to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. 3. The INTERNATIONAL DENTIST program, a two-academic- year curriculum, leads to a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Loma Linda University. The program is designed for the dentist who has earned a dental degree outside the United States. 4. The POSTBACCALAUREATE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE DENTAL TRACK program is designed for students who are unsuccessful in their application to the Doctor of Dental Surgery program at Loma Linda University. The students in this program participate in some first- year dental courses. Successful completion of this program leads to a postbaccalaureate certificate in biomedical science. 5. The ADVANCED DENTAL EDUCATION programs lead to postdoctoral certificates in eight specialty and nonspecialty areas of dentistry and, at the student's option, additionally to a Master of Science or a Master of Science in Dentistry degree. 6. The COMBINED DEGREES programs lead to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree (through the School of Dentistry) earned concurrently with a Master of Science degree or Doctor of Philosophy degree\u2014 D.D.S./M.S. or D.D.S./Ph.D.; or to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree (through the School of Dentistry) earned concurrently with a Master of Arts degree in Bioethics (through the School of Religion)\u2014D.D.S./ M.A. Combined degrees programs D.D.S. / M.S. / M.A. A combined degrees program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Master of Science degree is open to qualified students of dentistry. The student who is interested in establishing a broader professional base in science or who is looking toward a career in teaching or research may take an interim leave from the School of Dentistry after the second or third professional year and fulfill professional degree requirementsLoma Linda University 2017-2018 199 subsequent to or concurrent with completing course work and research for the Master of Science degree. The combined degrees program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Master of Arts in bioethics is designed to fit the schedule of Doctor of Dental Surgery degree students. Ethics in dentistry is an emerging academic interest, and this program aims to evolve the Loma Linda University dental school into one of a very select few in the nation known for their expertise in ethical issues. This program requires 48 units of credit. This degree is offered cooperatively by the School of Religion and the School of Dentistry. D.D.S. / Ph.D. The biomedical sciences program provides opportunity for well-qualified and motivated students to pursue both a professional and a graduate education and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation in health and human disease. The student who has a baccalaureate degree and the approval of the School of Dentistry Office of Academic Affairs may enter the combined degrees program and work concurrently toward the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees. A minimum of six years is required to complete a combined degrees program, offered cooperatively by the School of Dentistry and the School of Medicine. Awards All School of Dentistry students are eligible to receive awards of various kinds for demonstrated excellence, scholastic attainment, leadership ability, technical ability, professional proficiency, initiative, and other accomplishments or achievements, according to the bases established by the donors. Awards are given through various organizations, associations, and school and university departments. The names of all award recipients are printed in the University commencement program. Student life School of Dentistry inherent requirements In harmony with its own didactic, clinical, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guidelines, Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has identified the following inherent requirements for entry into all its programs. Cognition Students must have the cognitive abilities that allow the accurate and effective ability to measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, synthesize, and critically problem solve. Effective dental education requires the capacity to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at integrated solutions. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully solve clinical problems. Sensation and perception For learning to occur, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, smell, and somatic sensation. Specifically, students must be able to acquire information from written documents and to visualize information presented in images from papers, videos, and digital media\u2014including interpretation of radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices.Sufficient visual acuity is required to read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Adequate visual and tactile skills are also necessary to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Students must be able to observe and describe changes in mood, activity, and posture in their patients, possessing skills in effective perception and understanding of nonverbal communications. Accurately noting verbal and nonverbal communication is essential when performing dental operations or administering medications. Communication skills Students must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. They must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, faculty, staff, and other students. Specifically, students must be able to observe, hear, and speak to patients in order to elicit and provide information. In addition, they must have the ability to read and understand written communications and generate effective oral and written communications with all members of the health-care team. This includes the ability to discern when a matter is of a confidential nature in order to maintain confidentiality. Students may be required to remediate written and/or verbal language skills before admission or during their program. This remediation may include accent modification. Fine and gross motor skills Students need sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to provide general dental care to perform palpation, percussion, auscultation and other diagnostic maneuvers; basic laboratory tests; and diagnostic procedures. These actions require fine and gross muscular movements, coordination, and equilibrium. Individuals must be able to operate foot controls utilizing fine movements, operating high- or low-speed dental instruments to achieve accurate movements of less than one-half millimeter. Students must be able to perform basic life support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, assist patients who lack motor control, and position themselves around the patient and dental chair. Behavioral and psychosocial attributes Students must possess the emotional stability and demonstrate the resilience required by a challenging educational program. Success requires use of good judgment, insight, self-motivation, self-assessment and self-control, high achievement striving, and the development of a mature, sensitive, and effective personal relationship style. It is imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, demonstrate flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical issues of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, and cultural sensitivity are required personal qualities. Disabled applicants and students LLU School of Dentistry provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for individuals with documented disabilities who demonstrate a need for accommodation. The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a person with a disability as an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Problems such as English as200 School of Dentistry a second language, test anxiety, or slow reading without an identified underlying physical or mental deficit, or failure to achieve a desired outcome are generally not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. To be considered for an accommodation based on a learning disability, a student must experience marked difficulty when compared with the average person in the general population, not just other dental school students, in one or more basic academic areas as a result of a significant information processing or attentional disorder. Students requesting accommodations must provide supporting documentation for the disability requiring accommodation, including: A report from a licensed professional approved by Loma Linda University School of Dentistry identifying the diagnosed disability and the recommended accommodations. Record of any previous accommodations provided by educational institutions or other testing agencies. If no prior accommodations were provided, the licensed professional should include a detailed explanation as to why no accommodations were given in the past and why they are needed now. Documentation needs to be reviewed by the associate dean for admissions and student affairs, before accommodation is formally implemented. While awaiting assessment and documentation, temporary accommodation may be granted. The temporary accommodation will not exceed ninety (90) days. Students requesting accommodation are responsible for: Reporting their request for accommodation to the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs Providing the supporting documentation Policies for this school The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook at <http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/ handbook/documents/Student-Handbook.pdf>. Professional ethics Successful students should demonstrate behaviors and attributes in harmony with School of Dentistry's core values. The school seeks students who openly and enthusiastically align themselves with the following core values: Belief in God Spiritual maturity Demonstrated compassion Service to others Commitment to excellence Critical thinking Respect for self and others Ethical integrity Principled care Pursuit of knowledge Conscientiousness and industry Effective communicationThe school code of ethics expands and elaborates Loma Linda University's standards of ethical conduct. Organized dentistry is proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential if dentistry is to continue to maintain its position of trust in society. The establishment of peer review committees, ethics committees, codes of ethics, and other regulatory and/or advisory processes and standards within the profession indicate a vital and continuing concern for maintaining high standards of integrity. The School of Dentistry is a partner in this process where future professionals are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes consistent with the highest goals of the profession. The school seeks to broaden students' ethical perceptions by including a religious perspective not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the professions' ethical frameworks, it is anticipated that the dental professionals' ethic will be more completely informed and not only will reflect concern for his or her fellows, but also will reflect an intimate relationship with the Creator God. The code contains specific admonitions that are limited in number but comprehensive in nature. It is anticipated that the values of honesty, integrity, and altruism will be enhanced during professional training so that, following graduation, these virtues will be second nature in the service provided to patients. Thus, the relationship of trust between dental professional and patient can develop to benefit both the profession and the public. This is a goal the school feels it must meet as it seeks to train dental professionals to become competent in all aspects of patient care. The School of Dentistry code of ethics applies to all students (associate and baccalaureate dental hygiene; predoctoral, including international dentist students; graduate, certificate, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars; and exchange students). The School of Dentistry code of professional ethics with its specific guidelines is available for review in Section VII of the LLU Student Handbook . Student leadership Student Government Loma Linda University American Student Dental Association (LLU ASDA) is composed of peer voted student officials who are charged by administration to carry out the actions necessary for a successful student government, as well as serving as a representation for he ASDA chapter at regional and national meetings and events. LLU ASDA's central body if the Executive Council (EC) compromised of the First Delegate/ President, Second Delegate/President-elect, two class representatives, secretary and treasurer. The EC has the authority to appoint members to other designated offices to fulfill the work of the local chapter as needed and delegate duties to subcommittees as needed in governing the student body, including representation for other state and national professional organizations (CDA, ADEA, AGD) and class leadership. The EC oversees the utilization of all funds paid by student dues and obtained through fundraising. Elections for all positions of LLU ASDA occur in the spring quarter. Class leadership Class leaders are elected annually during the Autumn term for the first year and Spring term thereafter.

Class leadership consists of: DDS - President and four vice presidents serving in various capacities. IDP - Two class representatives DH BS - President and three vice presidents. DH AS - President and one vice president. Committee representation Students are invited to serve on school standing committees. The Office of Admissions and Student Affairs consults with LLU ASDA and class leadership to select students to serve on committees, including the Admissions Committees, Academic Review Committees, Curriculum Committee, and Professional Standards Committee. To maintain a leadership position, a minimum 2.7 GPA must be maintained by the president, vice presidents and professional organization representatives. Special opportunities Alumni-Student Convention The annual Alumni-Student Convention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and listen to presentations by prominent guest lecturers in the dental profession. Research presentation Students have the opportunity to give research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are invited to present their table clinics at state and national conventions. Dedication service A dedication service is held during the Alumni-Student Convention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional lives to Christ. Incoming students are presented with personalized Bibles and graduating students are given personalized white coats embroidered with the School logo. Academic information General policies Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration is completed online at the myLLU registration portal <https://ssweb.llu.edu/ login >. Once at the portal, a student must clear registration holds\u2014 student health, transcript, housing and finance. At the beginning of the first year of attendance, a student is required to have a picture taken for the student identification badge. International students must also register with the International Student Affairs office as required by law. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason. A charge is applied if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered. A change in registration after the second week affects the grade record. A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the University without permission from the associate dean for academic affairs.Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire junior year for the Associate in Science degree; and the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire third (D3) and fourth (D4) years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each review period. The eligibility requirements are: Complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the term. Achieve a term grade point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-. Receive no incomplete (I) grades on the grade report. Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course director at this University and the school's associate dean for academic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. Special examination It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take it, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. Repeating/remediating a course (predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs) If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades), the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering.202 School of Dentistry 2. For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade point average. 4. Under certain circumstances and upon recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, a student may remediate/repeat a maximum of 12 units during the current and subsequent academic year. Upon such recommendation, the student will be permitted to move forward as a member of the cohort with which he or she enrolled.

National Dental Board Examinations Successful completion of the National Board Dental Examination, Parts I and II (NBDE-I and NBDE-II) is a requirement for graduation. The National Board Dental Examinations are designed to assess cognitive knowledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibility to sit for either part of the National Board Dental Examination is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination that assesses mastery of the test specifications prior to each National Board Dental Examination. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the National Board Dental Examination are as follows: Part I First attempt Part I examination should be taken prior to commencing the third year of dental school and is normally scheduled during June following completion of the second year. If upon first attempt the examination is not successfully completed, the student will be given an opportunity to retake the examination. During this interim period of time, students will be required to study for a re-examination, and sit for a second attempt no later than December. Second attempt Students must be successful in the second attempt prior to December of the third year to remain with the cohort. If a student does not successfully complete the second attempt of the Part I examination by the end of December in their third year, s/he will be required to take a leave of absence to prepare for re-examination with an anticipated reengagement in the Summer quarter of the subsequent year. Third attempt Upon successful completion of Part I the student will be readmitted as stated above. If the student does not successfully complete the National Board Dental Examination, Part I on the third attempt, s/he will be discontinued from the program. Part II Part II examination is scheduled in the fourth year. If the examination is not successfully completed, the student will be given an opportunity to retake the examination per the National Board Dental Examination policies. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must have successfully completed Parts I and II of the National Board Dental Examination before being awarded the D.D.S. degree. Procedures for academic review (predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs) There are six academic review committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the associate dean, academic affairs; the associate dean, admissions and student affairs; and the department representative/course directors of all courses required of the respective class in the academic year. The associate dean, clinic administration, the clinic director, and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 academic review committees. In addition, each committee has two student membersappointed by the dean in consultation with the associate dean, admissions and student affairs and DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The academic review committees meet a minimum of two times annually to evaluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for academic sanctions may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic performance is as follows: 1. The academic review committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a hearing called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to the academic disciplinary policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the recommendation of the academic review committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the academic review committee. The dean will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the academic review committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the process was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the recommendation. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appeal is warranted or not. Academic disciplinary policy (predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs) Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student.204 School of Dentistry Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing or unsatisfactory (U/F/D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding year. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding year. Level IV If a student meets the criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-campus, service-learning, or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fulfilled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action or remediation As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action for the student may consist of: 1. Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof. 2. Other specified requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the academic review committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to re-entering the academic program.The following guidelines pertain to when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive reviews or terms on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Dental Examination on schedule after two attempts and needs full study time to prepare for the National Board Dental Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation, yet shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the associate dean for academic affairs. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the academic review committee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the academic review committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are indicated below for predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene students: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three consecutive reviews or terms on academic probation. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to meet criteria for promotion to D2 year by the end of the D1 year.

Failure to pass the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination within three attempts. Failure to achieve eligibility for graduation within three full academic years of enrollment in the dental hygiene program. In some situations, the academic review committee may recommend that a student repeat an academic year (or portion thereof) as an alternative to discontinuation. Scholastic standing Grades and grade points for the predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs may be found in Section II of this catalog, with the following exceptions: Satisfactory (S)\u2014grade if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. Marginal Satisfactory (MS)\u2014grade if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Unsatisfactory (U)\u2014grade if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for overall performance. Student-initiated academic grievance procedure If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor, where appropriate; then with the course director, if applicable; and finally with the department chair. If the student is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs (for further discussion of the academic grievance process, see Loma Linda University Student Handbook , Section V\u2014University Policies). Service-learning Service-learning at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and abroad.Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours, as described in each program. Predoctoral dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service- learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to thirty of the remaining eighty hours may be completed doing nondental service. Dental hygiene students must complete seventy-five service-learning hours. Thirty-five hours of local service are required, and up to fifteen nondental service hours may be credited. International Dentist Program students must complete sixty hours of service. Of the sixty hours, forty will be assigned by the program. Up to ten hours of nondental service may be completed as part of the sixty hours total requirement. In addition, a didactic component is included within the service-learning program. Lectures are embedded within existing courses and occur throughout the curricula. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. Learning environment Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school- sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. Basic sciences The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as part of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The purpose of the basic science curriculum is to provide a foundation of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that206 School of Dentistry expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists. Financial information Financial policies The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. General financial practices The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must be settled. Satisfactory academic progress policy (all programs) To be eligible for federal, state, and University financial aid, students are required by the U.S. Department of Education and the state of California to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree objectives. In compliance with prescribed regulations, the University and School of Dentistry have established guidelines that are designed to ensure that students successfully complete courses to promote timely advancement toward a specific degree objective. Definition of satisfactory academic progress The School of Dentistry defines satisfactory academic progress by the following three criteria: 1. Meeting a minimum grade point average requirement 2. Making yearly progress by completing the academic requirements defined for a program 3. Completing the degree objective within the maximum time allowedGrade point average requirement To maintain satisfactory academic progress, students in the predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. In addition, dental hygiene students must achieve no grade lower than a C- in all core courses. Yearly progress requirement Each student's academic progress is evaluated by the Academic Review Committee throughout each academic term, and a cumulative review is conducted to determine eligibility for promotion at the end of each academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs monitors the minimum grade point average requirement. The Office of Financial Aid, along with the School of Dentistry Office of Academic Affairs, monitors yearly progress and the maximum time allowance. Students whose academic standing or degree progress falls below the standard receive a financial aid warning during the next term of registration. If their academic standing or degree progress is not raised to the standard by the end of the term in which the financial aid warning was issued, their financial aid will be terminated until the requirements have been met. Reasonable degree progress It is expected that students will complete the requirements for a degree within the scheduled curriculum time. The Doctor of Dental Surgery degree is scheduled to be completed in four years and may not exceed six. The Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in two years and may not exceed three years. The Bachelor of Science dental hygiene online degree completion program is scheduled to be completed in six quarters and may not exceed 12 quarters. The Associate in Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in seven quarters and may not exceed 14 quarters. Certification of status The Office of Academic Affairs will certify the official status of each enrolled student at the end of each academic year to the Office of University Records and to the Office of Financial Aid. Student financial aid Federal loans are available only to United States citizens, green card holders, or those with permanent resident status. With good credit or a creditworthy cosigner, federal loans may be used to cover the entire academic budget. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid <finaid@llu.edu> or 909/558-4509.

(p. 250) Undergraduate Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the Bachelor of Science degree undergraduate curriculum of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and continuing care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist.The entry-level and the online completion program curricula are approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). The entry-level program is also approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and caring persons prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific knowledge and principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply evidence-based principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render.

Dean Joseph M. Caruso The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever- changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dentistry curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry\u2014which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health-care delivery system through basic and applied research.

The biochemistry requirement is one semester or a minimum of four units or two quarters or a minimum of six units. All science prerequisites must be completed within five years prior to admission, with a grade of C or above in each course. A minimum grade point average of 2.7 in science subjects and in nonscience subjects, averaged separately, is required. The average grade point average for accepted students is substantially higher. Students who are enrolled in another program in Loma Linda University are not considered for admission until they have completed or have been released from the program. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant must meet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.), performance on224 Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. the Dental Admission Test (DAT), and a personal interview. Applicants are expected to have taken the DAT within the previous two years, preferably not later than October of the year preceding expected matriculation. In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and understanding, the applicant should include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first year of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. The choice of electives can broaden the applicant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the individual's ability to think and express him-/herself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to develop basic resources for the resolution of personal problems and the growth of self- understanding the student must have in order to understand and help associates. An applicant from a college or university outside the U.S. or Canada or from a nonaccredited college or university in the U.S. must complete a minimum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accredited college or university in the U.S. or Canada. This includes the required specific core sciences in the areas of biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics (all sciences except Biochemistry must include laboratories). A grade of C or above in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) Credits from professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing, pharmacy, chiropractic, or medicine) do not fulfill admission requirements. Credit for studies taken at a military service school is granted to veterans according to recommendations in the Guide of the American Council on Education and/or the California Committee for the Study of Education. The University reserves the right to require satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS). Applications are available online at <http://www.adea.org/>.. Due to the high volume of applicants LLUSD recommends that AADSAS applications be submitted before August. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University (LLU). 1.AADSAS application. Is submitted to the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service between June 1 and December 1 at www.adea.org where it is processed in approximately four to six weeks prior to being sent to the LLUSD Office of Admissions. 2.Supplemental application. The applicant then receives an email invitation from LLU to complete an electronic supplemental application. 3. The applicant must return the completed supplemental application and materials within thirty (30) days. This includes an essay specific to Loma Linda University, a photograph, and the application fee of $100. 4.Transcripts. Official transcripts must be sent to AADSAS at the time application is submitted. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official transcripts\u2014mailed directly from all colleges/universities to LLU\u2014are required and must be submitted by August 1 in order for the student to be registered for the first academic year of classes. 5. International students must submit official transcripts at time of supplemental application. 6.References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. A reference from a pre-professional committee or science professor; a reference from an employer or professional and a reference from a spiritual leader. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is required that Loma Linda University is sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. All recommendation letters sent to AADSAS will be sent to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry along with the application. 7.Dental Admission Test. The applicant is required to complete and meet specific criteria related to performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test by October of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired. The student entering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission criteria. The committee reviews all scores on the test. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Linda University before an applicant is invited to interview. 8.Interview. The applicant's records will be screened when the supplemental application, recommendations, transcripts, and DAT scores are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the school for a personal interview. An interview is required for admission as it provides an opportunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors, including communication skills, core values, motivation, and passion for the profession; as well as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the interview, a tour of the school will be given by a current dental student. 9.Observation. It is important that students seek experience observing and assisting in a dental office in order to become familiar with the work of a dentist. Prior to interviewing, applicants are expected to complete a minimum of fifty (50) hours of observation/work experience in a dental facility, twenty (20) of which must be done with a general dentist. 10.Acceptance. The student receives notification of an acceptance via a phone call, email and letter signed by the Dean. Upon payment of the deposit, accepted students receive an email that serves as a receipt, as well as information about how to access registration information. 11.Pre-entrance health requirements/immunizations. It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to before the student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration. Forms to document the required immunizations are provided for the physician in the registration information made available electronically to the student by LLU. In order to avoid having a hold placed on registration, the student is encouraged to return the documentation forms to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. For a complete list of required immunizations and tests, see Section II of this CATALOG under the heading \"Health Care.\" Documentation verifying compliance with this requirement must be provided before registration can be completed.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 225 For further information, consult the Student Handbook, Section V\u2014 University Policies\u2014Communicable disease transmission prevention policy; or contact the Student Health Service office at 909/558-8770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinical facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, the student is required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 12.Deposits. The student accepted into dentistry must submit a nonrefundable deposit of $1,000 to the Office of Admissions. All deposits become part of the first term's tuition. Failure to submit this deposit will result in loss of the applicant's position in the class. A second nonrefundable deposit of $1,000 is due on May 1 in order to secure a place in the class. The remaining balance of the first term's tuition and fees are due no later than the day of matriculation in August. 13.Financial requirement. Non-U.S. citizens and nonpermanent residents are required by U.S. immigration regulation to pay for their first year's tuition and fees before they can register for classes. In addition, they must provide documentary evidence of sufficient funds for their second year. International students will receive the necessary visa applications and registration information after they have submitted their $1,000 deposit and payment plan.14.Financial aid. A financial aid advisor and financial aid programs are available. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid by e- mail, <finaid@llu.edu>; or by telephone, 909/558-4509. Web site information is located at <http://www.llu.edu/students/financial-aid/ >. Transfer Transfer from another school of dentistry in the United States is considered only in unusual circumstances.

Academic policies Grading system for advanced education programs The following information outlines the grading systems for all postdoctoral students/residents enrolled in advanced education programs in the School of Dentistry. Each course taught in the school has been approved for either a letter grade or an S/U grade, and deviations from this are not allowed other than the MS grade as specified below. Grades and grade points for postdoctoral students/ residents A 4.0 Outstanding performance A- 3.7 Very good performance B+ 3.3 Good performance. B 3.0 Satisfactory performance. B- 2.7 Minimum passing grade without remediation; Cumulative G.P.A. must be 3.0 or higher to avoid academic probation. C+ 2.3 Remediation required and cumulative G.P.A. must be 3.0 or higher to avoid academic probation. C 2.0 Remediation required and cumulative G.P.A. must be 3.0 or higher to avoid academic probation. Postdoctoral students/residents who receive one or more of the following grades in any quarter will be placed on academic probation and must retake the course(s) for which these grades were received. C- 1.7 Unsatisfactory; Course must be retaken. Cumulative G.P.A must be 3.0 or higher to avoid academic probation. D 0.0 Failure; course must be retaken. F 0.0 Failure; Course must be retaken; Academic probation required. S none Satisfactory performance; Equivalent of a B grade or better. MS none Marginally satisfactory; minimum passing grade; equivalent to a B- grade; Multiple MS grades may result in academic probation. U none Unsatisfactory; The U grade is not computed in the G.P.A. The Course must be repeated to count toward a certificate and/or degree. University policy states that \"a student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program.\" Academic criteria for academic advancement and program completion Process to remediate a course: 1. A detailed written plan must be developed by the course director/ program director outlining how deficiencies will be remediated and reassessed. 2. The plan must be approved by the Office of Advanced Dental Education.3. The postdoctoral student/resident is required to register for the following course: Advanced Dental Education Remediation (GRDN 700) with the sub-title of the course that is being remediated. 4. Remediation must be accomplished during the academic quarter immediately following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory grade was received. 5. Successful remediation of a course will not result in a grade change for the course. 6. Failure to successfully remediate a course will result in the need for the postgraduate student/resident to repeat the course with academic probation. 7. The postdoctoral student/resident may exercise the option to retake the course which may result in a grade change for the course. Process to repeat a course: 1. The postdoctoral student/resident will be placed on academic probation. 2. The postdoctoral student/resident must register for the course to be repeated at the earliest opportunity. 3. The postdoctoral student/resident must receive a minimum grade of B- to continue in the advanced dental education program. Academic disciplinary policy for advanced education programs: Academic probation Academic probation for postdoctoral students/residents will be for a minimum of one academic quarter following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory performance was noted. Probationary status will be reviewed on a quarterly basis until successful remediation has been recorded. Such action must be confirmed by memorandum to the student. Under the following conditions, a postdoctoral student/resident will be sent an advisory letter from the Office of Advanced Dental Education regarding the potential for placement on academic probation. 1. Term G.P.A. below 3.0 (B) 2. One or more courses with a grade of C+ or lower 3. More than one course with a grade of Marginally Satisfactory (MS). A postdoctoral student/resident will be placed on academic probation if he/she meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Cumulative G.P.A below 3.0. 2. One or more courses with a grade of C, or lower. 3. Failing or unsatisfactory grades in any course(s) required for the specialty certificate, Master of Science (M.S.) degree, or Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree programs. 4. Total of three or more Marginally Satisfactory (MS) grades. Level of Academic Probation: The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness238 Advanced Dental Education or nature of the academic deficiency, a postdoctoral student/resident may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation. Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student/resident is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level IV If a student/resident meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a postdoctoral student/resident on academic probation: A student/resident on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-campus, service learning, or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fulfilled, unless the postdoctoral student/ resident is discontinued. Remedial action (remediation): A postdoctoral student/resident who is not performing up to expectations (academic and professional) may receive the following: 1. Restriction of clinical privileges by the program director. 2. Academic probation (Level I to III) - upon recommendation of the Program Director by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. 3. Professional Standards (Behavioral) probation (Level I to III) - (See Professional Standards Review Process in Loma Linda University Student Handbook). 4. Clinical probation (Level I to III) - upon recommendation of the Program Director by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. 5. Discontinuation - upon recommendation of the Program Director to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education. Discontinuation must be approved by the Dean. Probation: All recommendations to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for probation must be supported by well-documented evidence of repeated counseling and other internal measures designedto point out deficiencies and take corrective action through a detailed remediation program. A remediation program must be specific in design, implemented, and monitored for any postdoctoral student/resident who is not performing up to a program' s stated standards. It is important to have documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations or counseling, discussions, and corrective measures. Written statements from support staff should also be included if they have direct contact or knowledge of a matter involving a postdoctoral student/resident. Postdoctoral students/residents may be placed on academic probation, professional standards (behavioral) probation, and/or clinical probation. Probation begins at Level I and may progress to Level III. Postdoctoral students/residents should be placed on probation for the academic quarter immediately following the quarter in which the unsatisfactory performance was documented. Probationary status will be reviewed on a quarterly basis until successful remediation has been documented. This information must be conveyed to the postdoctoral student/resident verbally and in writing. Continuation: Postdoctoral students/residents who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their year group for as long as necessary before being promoted to the next year or discontinued. To exercise this option, the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education must inform University Records of the decision to continue a postdoctoral student/resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination as to when to recommend continuing a postdoctoral student/resident, when to recommend discontinuing a postdoctoral student/resident and when the postdoctoral student/resident has completed his/her program. Recommendation for continuation must be submitted to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for review and approval. Discontinuation: Postdoctoral students/residents who do not achieve required measurable improvement by the end of the prescribed remediation and counseling periods may be recommended for discontinuation by their Program Director to the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education for review. Recommendation to discontinue a postdoctoral student/resident must be submitted by the Assistant Dean for Advanced Dental Education, in writing, to the Dean for review and action.

Closed to admission. The Advanced General Dentistry Education Program in Dental Anesthesiology is offered to dentists who desire to pursue a career in anesthesiology for dentistry. The educational design of this thirty-six month program provides a strong clinical background in anesthesiology. The program is based in the Koppel Special Care Dentistry Center (KSCDC), an outpatient facility utilizing general anesthesia for dental care. The KSCDC is located in the School of Dentistry, where approximately 4,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. Scheduled simulation training is obtained at the LLU Medical Simulation Center. Additional training in structured rotations in cardiology, internal medicine, and anesthesiology is obtained at area hospitals. Didactic instruction is coordinated through the School of Dentistry's Department of Dental Anesthesiology. Residents attend an anesthesiology lecture series and weekly grand rounds at Loma Linda University Medical Center. In addition, regular meetings of the dental anesthesiology residents are held, during which a variety of contemporary topics are discussed\u2014including a review of the current literature. Residents also participate in teaching pain control in the240 Endodontics \u2014 Certificate (post-D.D.S.), M.S.D., M.S. predoctoral curriculum and present their topics at the annual Dental Anesthesia Symposium at Loma Linda University. Upon successful completion of the program, the dental anesthesiologist will be eligible to take the diplomate examination of the American Dental Board of Anesthesiology, and to apply for a general anesthesia permit in any state of the United States. Following enrollment into the program, residents may apply for acceptance to the Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree track, in addition to the specialty certificate. The application should be submitted at the end of the first year and be supported by the program director. Admission into the M.S.D. degree track may extend the length of study. Any additional time must be in residence, and continued financial support is not guaranteed. Dental anesthesiology goals Goal 1 To provide the dental anesthesia resident with anesthesia- related skills and knowledge that are the basis for a safe and responsible practice of office-based or hospital-based dental anesthesiology after completion of the training program. Goal 2 To provide an in-depth education in acute pain and anxiety as it pertains to dental treatment and an understanding of the application of the pharmacologic and behavioral treatments of these conditions. Goal 3 To provide a background in the health sciences and clinical medicine that will allow a dentist anesthesiologist to recognize and appropriately refer the patient who is at elevated risk for anesthesia due to comorbidities. Goal 4 To develop desirable character values and attributes in residents--including professionalism, respect for others, responsibility, compassion, integrity, and ethical behavior; and to instill the importance of a commitment to lifelong learning. Goal 5 To develop professional presentation skills to enhance professional communications. Program link: www.llu.edu/dentistry/gradprograms/ Program director Larry D.

Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of Medicine Loma Linda University 2017-2018 257 School foundations History The professional curriculum in medicine was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. For more than a century, the School of Medicine has kept pace with the rapid growth of knowledge and technology. Over 10,000 students have graduated from the school and have gone on to all corners of the earth, fulfilling the University's motto\u2014\"To make man whole.\" Since 1909 Since the school's inception, the first two years of the medical school program have always been taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid-1960s, however, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center and at nearby Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be concentrated on the Loma Linda campus, beginning with the 1966-1967 school year. Our mission The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole- person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires\u2014 Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Cultivating an atmosphere of inquiry and discovering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, safe, comprehensive, whole person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole person care wherever the opportunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine.Doctor of Medicine degree/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program requirements The Doctor of Medicine degree/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program (M.D./OMS) is designed to provide an opportunity for qualified dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized, three-year period. Clinical surgical health-care delivery is emphasized. The content of the program conforms to the standards of the Commission on Accreditation and is designed to prepare the oral surgeon for certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents begin their residency program on the OMS service. They subsequently enter the second year at Loma Linda University School of Medicine with advanced standing. The residents then complete the second, third, and fourth years of medical school. The third year of the M.D./OMS curriculum consists of required clerkships in acute care, emergency medicine, a subinternship in ENT, and whole person care. An additional 30 units of electives, which include anesthesia and oral and maxillofacial surgery, complete the third year of the medical program. The graduate then enters a one-year general surgery internship, followed by two years of oral and maxillofacial surgery residency. Graduate combined degrees programs Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. Combined degrees (M.D./M.S. or M.D./Ph.D.)\u2014SM/GS The M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program is available through the School of Medicine. It includes many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. Students in the combined degrees program complete the first two years of the standard medical curriculum. This is followed by three or more years of graduate course work and research to qualify for a Ph.D. degree, or at least one year for an M.S. degree, before commencing the last two years of the medical school curriculum\u2014the clinical training \u2014for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, and pharmacology. For the M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees programs, the prerequisites and Graduate Record Examination requirements are similar to those described for the Medical Scientist Program, except that biochemistry is not required. Medical Scientist Program (M.D./Ph.D.) Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in the Medical Scientist Program. Tuition assistance for the M.D. portion of the combined degrees program is not given to all students who earn both degrees. Assistance for the M.D. portion will be given only in cases where an applicant has received approval from the School of Medicine M.D./Ph.D. Admissions Committee prior to beginning the M.D. course work. Assistance will be in the form of an institutional loan that will cover M.D. tuition and fees but will not include living expenses. The School of Medicine makes provision for the loan to be forgiven when a recipient meets the terms described below and in the loan agreement.258 School of Medicine Loans for the first two years of the M.D. curriculum may be canceled when a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree within the time schedule described below and according to the terms of the loan agreement. Loans for the third and fourth years of the M.D. curriculum may be canceled when a student completes the Ph.D. degree within the time schedule described below and according to the terms described below and according to the terms of the loan agreement. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. (See Medical Scientist Program in the Combined Degrees Programs after the general information for the School of Medicine.) Residency programs Loma Linda University is affiliated with a variety of accredited residency programs in two sponsoring institutions. The first is Loma Linda University Medical Center, and the second is Loma Linda-Inland Empire Consortium for Healthcare Education. All specialties and a variety of subspecialty programs are offered. Additional nonaccredited fellowships are available. Graduate physicians wishing to apply for entrance into these programs should contact the director of the program. Graduate dentists who seek residencies in dental anesthesia, endodontics, oral implantology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, and prosthodontics should apply directly to the School of Dentistry. Research centers Basic science investigation is advanced, and patient treatment is enhanced through the ground-breaking research conducted in several centers housed within the School of Medicine. Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine The mission of the Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine (CHDMM) is to eliminate health disparities through research, education, and community engagement. Faculty members at the CHDMM use modern molecular genetics and cell biology approaches, community based participatory research (CBPR), and precision medicine to investigate the causes of health disparities, how they are developed, and promising strategies to address them. Current research efforts at the center examine the influence of the augmented state of cellular oxidative stress (ASCOS) and inflammatory pathways on cell death and survival as it pertains to cancer, diabetes and neurological health disparities. The goal is to define novel molecular determinants and biomarkers associated with these health disparities, leading to the development of innovative clinical and community interventions aimed at eliminating or reducing them. The education mission of the center is to train a diverse group of graduate students, medical students, and postdoctoral scientists to develop an inclusive biomedical workforce. Further, through partnering with community-based organizations, the CHDMM aims to develop healthy and whole communities through the implementation of evidence based prevention initiatives and programs. Center for Perinatal Biology The primary research focus of the Center for Perinatal Biology is investigation of molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of fetaldevelopment and programming of health and disease later in life. The majority of the funding to support this research is derived from competitive grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health; additional funding is provided by the National Science Foundation and other agencies. The biomedical scientists in this internationally renowned research center also teach basic science courses in the School of Medicine; as well as graduate courses in their disciplines: physiology/ pharmacology, gynecology/obstetrics, pathology/human anatomy, biochemistry/microbiology, and pediatrics. For graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and beginning investigators \u2014who spend from two-to-four years in research and training in fields related to developmental biology and physiology\u2014the center is an ideal environment. A number of visiting scholars from other universities also work in the center during sabbaticals or other interims. Neurosurgery Center for Research, Training, and Education The Neurosurgery Center for Research, Training, and Education has as its primary focus the improvement of patient care by conducting translational research. These goals are met by the research and development of new biologically and technologically advanced diagnostic procedures, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and innovative hemostatic instrumentation. The center functions in collaboration with many well-known institutions, such as George Mason University, UCLA, and North Carolina State University. The center has been the recipient of a five-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) competitive grant to determine the role of iron perturbations in metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as well as grants for proteomic study of schizophrenia. The center's multidisciplinary work involves collaborations of faculty within Biochemistry, Radiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Radiobiology, Psychiatry, Geriatric Medicine, and Biostatistics. The center is also interested in the development of new hemostatic agents that involve the control of hemorrhage. To this end, it has developed new procoagulants and surgical devices in collaboration with industry. The center works in close collaboration with industrial resources for both testing and development of new surgical instrumentation. The director of the center holds numerous international and United States patents on surgical instruments and other devices. Neuroscience Research Center The major goal of the Center for Neuroscience Research is to conduct translational studies of major neurological disorders, in particular, the brain hemorrhage seen in neurosurgery and neurology. These and traumatic brain injury caused by brain hemorrhage. A longitudinal combined approach is encouraged, which includes animal models, experimental treatment, neuroimaging, neurological functional evaluations, and neural and cerebral vascular biological studies, to explore the mechanisms and potential treatment options. The Center is funded by a National Institutes of Health Program Project Grant, as well as additional federal grant support to individual Center members. Center for Genomics The mission of the Center for Genomics is to provide state-of-the- art genomic (e.g., next-generation sequencing), epigenomic, and bioinformatic tools to: 1) better understand the molecular mechanisms of human disease and health disparities from a genome-wide and systems biology approach; 2) identify novel biomarkers of and novel therapeuticLoma Linda University 2017-2018 259 targets for human disease while providing single-nucleotide resolution genomic and epigenomic data for precision medicine; and 3) define the health and lifestyle profile of the Loma Linda Blue Zone population at the genomic and epigenomic levels.

General information The basic sciences of the School of Medicine offer graduate programs with emphases in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiology. The Ph.D. degree curriculum is designed to prepare students for a career in independent research and teaching in an academic or biotechnology setting. Students may enter any of these five Ph.D. degree curricula by applying to the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies Program. After completing a common first-year core curriculum, students will select a program and a mentor for the completion of their studies, during which advanced courses and laboratory work allow them to fully develop an area of research interest and expertise. Students usually rotate through up to three research laboratories before selecting a research advisor. The M.S. degree course of study provides education appropriate for technicians involved in biomedical research and for medical technologists seeking career advancement. A pathway to combined M.D./Ph.D. degrees is also offered. Combined degrees Combined degrees (Ph.D./M.D. and M.S./M.D.) options are also available. The combination of an M.S. degree with a professional degree provides additional content and research experience as a background for postgraduate medical or dental education. The combination of a Ph.D. degree with a professional degree prepares the student for a future in academic medicine or dentistry\u2014combining research, teaching, and clinical practice. The combined degrees are described at the end of Section III in this CATALOG.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 263 Department of Basic Sciences The Department of Basic Sciences in the School of Medicine offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in four areas (biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiology) through the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies Program (IBGS). This program includes a common integrated first-year core curriculum that explores the biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of living systems in a way that emphasizes analytical thinking and problem solving. During this first year, students also attend seminars and rotate through up to two research laboratories. After completing the first year of study, students select both a program and a laboratory from which they wish to obtain a degree. Advanced, discipline-specific courses are taken during the second year; and research leading to the publication of peer-reviewed articles and doctoral dissertation defense is carried out between the time a research laboratory is selected and the completion of the degree.

Zuccarelli General regulations First-year curriculum (Ph.D. degree) The first-year curriculum includes a course sequence taught by interdisciplinary faculty that integrates all the disciplines of the264 Biochemistry \u2014 M.S., Ph.D. biomedical basic science areas--moving from molecules through cellular mechanisms to integrated systems. In addition, a supplemental course covers research-related topics--such as scientific communication and integrity, information handling and statistics, as well as successful grant writing. Students learn of new developments in the biomedical sciences through weekly seminars, and they gain presentation skills of their own in a weekly student presentation seminar series. During the subsequent years, formal courses continue to broaden and integrate into a meaningful whole an understanding of the clinical consequences of cellular events. Religion requirement Students in the Master of Science (M.S.) degree curricula are required to complete one 3-unit, graduate-level religion class (RELT 617 Seminar in Religion and the Sciences ). Students in the Ph.D. degree curriculum are required to complete three graduate-level religion courses of 3 or more units each. These must include RELT 617 Seminar in Religion and the Sciences ; as well as RELE 525 Ethics for Scientists and RELR 588 Personal and Family Wholeness . A course in biblical studies ( RELT 559 New Testament Thought , RELT 560 Jesus the Revealer: The Message of the Gospel of John , RELT 564 Apostle of Hope: The Life, Letters, and Legacy of Paul , or RELT 565 Vision of Healing: The Message of the Book of Revelation ) may be substituted for either the ethical or relational course. Research units A student will, at all times, have registration in research units. An IP will be assigned until the student registers for new units. The units should be spread out over the course of time it takes to complete thesis or dissertation research satisfactorily. An IP may not be carried for longer than five quarters.

Physiology \u2014 M.S., Ph.D. Program coordinator John H. Zhang The School of Medicine's Division of Physiology offers curricula leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. The core curriculum provides a broad background in physiology. In this Christian environment in which students pursue study oriented to their specific interests, individual attention is assured by maintenance of a small student/faculty ratio. The research-oriented curriculum leading to the Ph.D. degree is designed to provide students with the information and tools needed to succeed as independent, lifelong learners and investigators in careers that include independent research and teaching in university, clinical, biotechnological, or government environments. The program offers cutting-edge opportunities in areas of research excellence that are supported by nationally competitive extramural funding. These areas include perinatal biology, health disparities, neurosciences, and cardiovascular science. Doctoral degree students are expected to develop creativity and independence, in addition to technical skills. The goal of the thesis or research Master of Science degree is to provide training opportunities for individuals who will pursue technical jobs in biomedical research laboratories either in universities or in biotechnology industry; or for students who will continue education in other professional schools, including medicine or dentistry. Program student learning outcomes 1. Students will demonstrate a broad knowledge of the biomedical sciences. 2. Students will demonstrate subject mastery in molecular, cellular, and integrative aspects of physiology. 3. Students will interpret the current literature in physiology. 4. Students will make original contributions to the body of biomedical knowledge. 5. Students will demonstrate an understanding of the principles of scientific and professional ethics. 6. Students will understand the process of applying for external funding.* *This objective is not applicable to M.S. degree students.

Our goal is to provide students with the best possible opportunities for graduate study in these areas, with strong preparation for careers in the application of research in, or teaching of biology, geology, paleontology, or earth systems science. Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook and the School of Medicine's \"Orange Book\" of Student Guidelines, Policies, and Procedures. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Financial information Schedule of charges (2016-2017) EBS strives to make it possible for every qualified student to successfully complete his or her degree in a timely manner. For many students, financial arrangements may be key elements in providing opportunity for timely completion. The Department therefore makes available\u2014to as many qualified students as possible\u2014various forms of financial aid within the limits of the departmental budget and circumstances. Such financial aid may take the form of research assistantships (RA) and tuition waivers, or other special awards. It is hoped that these incentives will not only help make a student's graduate career possible, but will also strengthen and expand his or her opportunities for learning while enrolled in the University. Other financial aid, such as student loans or other scholarships, are available through the Student Financial Aid office in the Student Services building. However, every student is responsible for the enrollment fee each quarter. It is not covered by tuition waivers. If a student is awarded an RA, he or she will be expected to document at least 30 hours per pay period (2 weeks) on departmental and research-related projects. Ph.D. degree students will be expected to document at least 40 hours per pay period on their project in order to continue receiving the RA. Please note that RAs are awarded on a set amount for the year (M.S. $7,500 and Ph.D. $17,000). This amount is paid out monthly after the first full month of work. Tuition $580 Per unit, graduate credit $290 Per unit, undergraduate credit; $3,480 per quarter $350 Per unit, audit, graduate Special charges* $60 Application fee $799 Enrollment fee per quarter$60 Fee for credit by examination $30 Per unit fee to have credit earned by examination appear on transcript *Programs may have additional fees.

When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made its recommendation, the dean of the school in which the program is housed takes official action and notifies the applicant. The applicant must respond affirmatively before becoming eligible to register for programs within the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences 2. As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with Student Health Service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3. New students are required to pass a background check before they register for classes. From master's to Ph.D. degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared\u2014even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted\u2014along with appropriate supporting documents \u2014to the school in which the program is housed. If the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before starting any doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Undergraduate programs Admission requirements High school and college subject requirements for each program are outlined in the respective programs. Students are required to provide evidence of completion (official transcript) of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs in any of the schools of the University. A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. To be eligible for admission, applicants must have completed a minimum of 96 quarter units or 64 semester units at an accredited college or university. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all transfer courses unless otherwise specified in specific program requirements; C- grades are not acceptable for transfer. An overall college G.P.A. of at least 2.5 to 3.0 is expected, depending on the program to which the student applies. Graduate degree requirements Admission requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to graduate programs in the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; and prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students withan overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability for completing the program. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required for application for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study.

Normal time to complete the program 5 years based on full-time enrollment; part time permitted Environmental Sciences \u2014 B.S. Program director Ricardo A. Escobar III The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences (EBS) offers a program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in environmental sciences (ENVS). This program builds upon a strong interdisciplinary breadth in natural, physical, and earth systems sciences to help understand the effect of human activities on environmental sustainability and management. In addition, since understanding the environment has become highly dependent on advanced technology, students will learn to use marketable geospatial applications, such as: geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, computer systems modeling, and global positioning systems (GPS). These tools will help students address environmental problems, such as: climate change, biodiversity decline, groundwater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, and air and noise pollution. Students have a choice of advanced expertise in conservation biology and biodiversity or environmental geology. Lastly, this program will encourage students to develop critical-thinking skills, healthy lifestyles, and service-oriented attitudes that are necessary to develop effective and ethical solutions to environmental problems on a local and global scale. Learning outcomes Demonstrate breadth and depth of knowledge of earth's environment by understanding the dynamic and interdependent nature of each of earth's component systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere). Demonstrate the ability to critically evaluate the relation of science and faith within an environmental context. Demonstrate written, technical, oral, and problem-solving skills necessary to collect, analyze, and share environmental data with scientific and public communities. Demonstrate awareness of the professional and academic opportunities in the environmental science field, as well as knowledge of concurrent environmental science research. Obtain an understanding of the human and natural causes to some of earth's environmental problems and learn how the environmental scientist addresses them. Employment opportunities Career options in the field of environmental sciences are diverse and abundant. The Environmental Sciences Program prepares students for entry-level jobs in environmental sciences or GIS fields. Graduates may pursue jobs in the public sector through local, state, and federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Department of Fish and Game. In the private sector, graduates may seek jobs in environmental consulting firms, foundations, and organizations. Some examples of career paths that environmental science graduates pursue include environmental engineering, science, and social policy;284 Environmental Sciences \u2014 B.S. a wide variety of natural resources management fields, such as soil science, forestry, agriculture, watershed science, range management, wildlife conservation, recreation resources, land management, and ecology; landscape architecture, conservation science, geographic information science (GIS), climatology, diverse health sciences; as well as public policy, law, or planning careers. Environmental scientists may also become involved through employment or volunteering with nonprofit organizations such as Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) International; and help world populations learn how to use the earth's resources to their advantage in a sustainable manner. Preparation for teaching In addition to the environmental sciences major, a student preparing to teach at the elementary or secondary level will need to complete the requirements for a teaching credential. The student should consult the undergraduate program director for further information. General elective units can be used for education courses. Preparation for advanced programs Because of the strong foundation in the natural and physical sciences acquired in the Environmental Sciences Program, students have the option of applying to a variety of graduate programs; as well as medical, dental, and engineering programs. In most cases, these programs require full-year courses in general biology, general chemistry, general physics, and organic chemistry. One or more courses in calculus may also be required. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the prehealth or graduate program of their choice early in their studies to ensure they meet specific course requirements. Environmental internship The Environmental Sciences Program offers students the opportunity to engage in \"hands-on\" application of fundamentals learned in course work by enrolling in ENVS 487 Internship in Environmental Sciences . With the supervision of a faculty advisor, students will develop an academic component of the internship and will be permitted to earn up to 8 units of general elective credit towards the B.S. degree. All internship appointments are subject to Environmental Sciences Program director approval. Undergraduate research Following approval of an academic advisor and research professor, students interested in field research may gain training and experience in one of the three concentration areas offered by the program. Under the supervision of a research professor, students will develop a project within the context of environmental conservation, health, or sustainability in an effort to find new solutions to environmental problems. Honors program Students who have a G.P.A. of 3.0 or above, a sponsoring faculty member, and an approved research proposal may apply to be accepted into the environmental sciences honors program.

Research in paleontology may also be pursued through the M.S. and Ph.D. degree curricula in biology, and through the Ph.D. degree curriculum in earth science. Program objectives The Geology Program focuses on field-oriented geology\u2014particularly sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleontology. The integrated core course sequence provides students with the tools to conduct research in the subdisciplines of sedimentology, paleontology, or environmental geology. Fieldwork is emphasized because it provides a first-hand experience with geological phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily grasped or understood solely from classroom or laboratory study. Throughout the geology curriculum, students are encouraged to develop an open-minded and investigative approach in the application of the scientific method to the resolution of geologic problems. Consideration of multiple working hypotheses is encouraged. The Geology Program aims to instill in students the values of honesty, scientific integrity, careful research, and independent critical thinking; provide the tools and intellectual environment in which geologists can attain their highest potential in scholarship and research; and challenge graduate students to consider the relationships among science, faith, and societal responsibility. Learning outcomes 1. Demonstrate advanced breadth and depth of knowledge in earth science.2. Plan and carry out independent research. 3. Demonstrate written and oral communication skills, and the integration of technology in communication. 4. Demonstrate ability to analyze and synthesize previous knowledge. 5. Demonstrate a professional aptitude and attitude. 6. Demonstrate critical evaluation skills in relation to faith, science, and public interest issues. Financial aid Research and teaching assistantships are available at the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences on a competitive basis. Further information can be obtained by contacting the department at <ebs@llu.edu>. Qualified students are also encouraged to seek fellowships and grants from federal and private agencies with the help of their advisors.

The core curriculum offers a broad biomedical background. Course work provides opportunities for qualified students not only to study all aspects of human morphology from both didactic and investigative points of view, but also to develop a special area of research interest. Study and research on other species and in other biomedical disciplines may be included in the student's curriculum. While working on a significant research problem, students are introduced to research methods both through scientific literature and the laboratory. They acquire experience in scientific communication by participating in seminars, writing critical reviews, and reporting results of research experience either in thesis/ dissertation form or as publishable/published papers. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare the graduate for a career in independent research and teaching in university, clinical, biotechnological, or government environments. In addition to technical skills, doctoral degree students are expected to develop creativity and independence. The Master of Science degree provides content appropriate for persons preparing to teach at the secondary level or in related professional school areas, or for persons intending to pursue careers as research technicians. Student learning outcomes 1. Students will demonstrate a broad knowledge of the biomedical sciences. 2. Students will demonstrate subject mastery in molecular, cellular, and integrative aspects of anatomy. 3. Students will interpret the current literature in anatomy. 4.

Non-Course Requirements Each student is required to complete 50 hours of Community Service by July of the second year of the program. The experience is documented using the \"Experience Transcripts\" through the University Records office. The type of service is the decision of the student; multiple opportunities are available through the Pathologists' Assistant program, the School of Medicine and the University.300 Biomedical Sciences \u2014 M.M.S. Will Alexander Lecture Series: Attendance at the Will Alexander Wholeness Series is mandatory in PGY1. The series extends from Fall to Spring, once a month, Wednesday evenings for 1 hour. The lecture series includes topics on wholeness, personal/professional development, care of creation, diversity, and service. Normal time to complete the program 2 years (24 months) \u2014 full-time enrollment required Biomedical Sciences \u2014 M.M.S. Program Coordinator Kenneth R. Wright Students accepted into the Master of Medical Science degree in biomedical sciences enroll in basic science courses with first-year medical students. Faculty responsible for teaching students in the M.M.S. Program will be those who teach these first-year basic sciences courses. The program enables students to complete their studies in one academic year of full-time commitment. The program is intended to provide experience in the rapidly changing area of biomedical sciences; and it prepares students to apply to professional programs in medicine or to pursue other career options\u2014such as high school teaching, patent law, or biotechnology management. The curriculum includes four (4) units of critical thinking, 4 units of medical practice management, 3 units of religion, and a capstone project of three (3) units. The remaining units come from the first-year medical curriculum\u2014which includes gross anatomy, embryology, physiology, cell structure and function, biochemistry, and genetics. Although the courses share lecture/laboratory experiences and tests with the Doctor of Medicine degree program, such courses will not be transferred to the M.D. degree program; a student subsequently admitted to the M.D. degree program should expect to take, and pay for, the normal M.D. degree curriculum. The program will culminate with a capstone project, which will give the student the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency/knowledge in the biomedical sciences and understanding of current clinical literature, etc. Admissions Applicants to the Master of Medical Science must satisfy the same requirements (p. 307) as those applying to the Medicine Program at Loma Linda University; that is, they will have completed a baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) with a course of study that includes a year each of general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and general physics and a course in biochemistry. Applicants are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Students are accepted into the program on recommendation of the School of Medicine admissions committee only.

Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook available at <llu.edu/central/handbook>. Communications Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. A student bulletin board is located in the student lounge. It is the responsibility of students to check their e-mail daily. Required supplies Microscope Microscopes will be provided to students, and a rental fee will be charged. If a student chooses to use his/her own microscope, it must be approved by the histology faculty in the Division of Anatomy. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. Practice and regulations Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensive examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course, s/he will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the advanced program. The course director, the senior associate dean of medical student education, and the student will work together to determine the content of the advanced program. Full tuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations In order to sit for an examination, students must be present when the chief proctor reads the examination instructions at the designated start time. Students who arrive late to an examination will be denied entrance. If, due to special circumstances, a student has been given permission by the Office of Medical Student Education to arrive late to an examination, the number of minutes the student is late will be deducted from his/her allotted examination time. Students who arrive after any other student has left the examination for any reason will not be permitted to take the examination. For national board subject examinations, students will be denied entrance once the examination has started, without exception. Missed examinations Students who have an excused absence for one day of a three-day midterm examination will receive their two-day score, and the percentage earned on the cumulative final examination (including NBME subjectexaminations) for each course will be substituted for the missed examination. Students who miss two or three days of a three-day midterm examination are required to take a makeup examination within two weeks of the missed examination dates at a date and time scheduled by the course director. Makeup examinations may differ in content and/or format from the missed examinations. In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. Should a student miss an in-house final examination because of an excused absence, arrangements must be made with the course directors to make up the missed examinations. The course directors, at their discretion, may opt to have the student take an examination that is different in format, content, or length from the final examination that was administered to the class. Should a student miss a national board subject examination because of an excused absence, the student will be allowed one opportunity at the end of the academic year to take and pass the subject examination upon completing all other course work for that year. Arrangements for the makeup examination must be made through the Office of Medical Student Education. Conditions to be met for an excused absence In order to have an excused absence, the student must get a written excuse from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education prior to administration of the test in question. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide written documentation of their illness from the Student Health Center or another examining physician. Whether or not this documentation is an adequate excuse for missing an examination will be left to the discretion of the senior associate dean for medical student education. Under no circumstances are students allowed to take examinations early. In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education (909/558-4255) must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education have an unexcused absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). Missing more than one examination in any course or combination of courses could result in a student having to repeat the course(s) during the next academic year. Grading policy Course/Clerkship directors assign grades at the end of each course/ clerkship. Grades reflect the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors. The University transcript records grades for completed courses/ clerkships as Satisfactory (S), Marginal Satisfactory (MS), or Unsatisfactory (U). For the purposes of determining eligibility for promotion, the School of Medicine utilizes grades of Satisfactory (S), Marginal Satisfactory (MS), Unsatisfactory (U), or In Progress (IP). Course/Clerkship directors assign a grade of Satisfactory (S) when a student's performance clearly exceeds the requirements of the course/ clerkship. A grade of Marginal Satisfactory (MS) is assigned when the course/clerkship director judges that student performance meets but does not exceed the minimal requirements of the course. A grade of Unsatisfactory is assigned when a student's performance fails to meet the minimal requirements for the course/clerkship. A notation of In Progress (IP) is used to identify students having unfinished course/302 Professional clerkship requirements. Subjective narrative descriptions of student performance are submitted to the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and may be used in the medical student performance evaluation (MSPE/Dean's Letter). Students who wish to contest a grade should discuss the grade first with the course/clerkship director, then with the department chair. If the student is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal the grade to the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. Determination of Dean's Letter grade For the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE/Dean's Letter), students will be assigned one of the following five designations for each course/clerkship: H (honors) HP (high pass) P (pass) MP (marginal pass) U (unsatisfactory) Each designation will be based on predetermined criteria established by the course/clerkship director in collaboration with the Office of Medical Student Education. The criteria for ranking may include student performance on faculty-generated examinations, national standardized subject examinations, active and computer-based learning activities, patient-care activities, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), medical simulations, and other academic activities as set forth by the course/clerkship director. Students who have failed a course or clerkship- specific NBME subject examination are not eligible to receive Dean's Letter grades of honors or high pass in that course/clerkship. Junior and Senior year medical students will not be ranked against each other. Clerkship grades and performance on school-required activities will be reported on the MSPE (Dean's Letter). Promotion Promotion from year to year is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance and attainment of competency milestones. Cognitive and noncognitive (including personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession) academic progress are monitored by the Academic Review Committee. The committee evaluates cumulative academic performance, not just performance in current or most recent course work. Students must pass each course and/or attain competency milestones to demonstrate overall satisfactory performance. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Decelerated program\u2014freshman curriculum Students who experience academic difficulty during their first year of medical school may be assigned to a decelerated program with a reduced load. This reassignment will ordinarily occur within the first two weeks following the second midterm examination when, in the judgment of the dean's office, it appears the student will be unlikely to pass the year while carrying out a full load. Academic probation A student whose overall performance is judged to be unsatisfactory by the Academic Review Committee is placed on academic probation. For more information concerning the terms of academic probation, please see the Student Handbook .Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must meet with the senior associate dean for medical student education to determine educational appropriateness and file a change of program form. To completely withdraw from school, the student must complete the online withdrawal form. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdrawal used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allowed. School policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three attempts. Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three years of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of three sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed study student until he or she has either passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the third time. The Student Handbook provides conditions and deadlines for taking and passing USMLE examinations.

Goals for each year Medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function-- including normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and biblical practice of medicine--both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to: traditional lecture; small-group, problem-based, and case-based learning; personalized computer- based instruction; quantitative laboratory experiences; and patient care experiences. The second year of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences--basic to the practice of medicine--with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to individual organ systems whenever possible. The second year will also continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine--both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to: experiences; and longitudinal patient- care experience. The third year of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in seven core clinical science disciplines to build foundational and comprehensive experiences for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain these experiences through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health-care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease, b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data, and c) the application of management principles to patients with acute and chronic304 Professional conditions. Recurring experiences in whole person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prevention will be integrated into the seven core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. The fourth year of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in mandatory supervised patient- care experiences in emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, preventive medicine and public health; and a subintern-level experience in internal medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during the eighteen weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least two weeks of electives will be in a basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. Doctor of Medicine degree requirements The School of Medicine requires that a candidate for a degree or certificate from the school must have met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must have been spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, length of academic residence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations covering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum, as may be required. Successfully completed USMLE examinations (Steps I and II), as specified--both clinical skills and knowledge components. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the University. The candidate is required to participate in graduation exercises upon completion of the academic program. If the candidate is out of sequence with his/her current class but would like to participate in the commencement exercises, s/he must have completed a minimum of three months of the required senior clerkships, i.e., medicine, pediatrics, family medicine or surgery subinternship, preventive medicine and public health, intensive care and emergency medicine by April 1 of the year of graduation. Consent for the student to be absent, granted by the president of the University, is contingent on the recommendation of the dean to the president. The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official conferring of degrees service. Licensing examinations National The graduate who holds credentials from the USMLE may be granted a license by endorsement of the examining board of most states.Additional requirements made by some states are given in a pamphlet that may be obtained from the Federation of State Medical Boards, 400 Fuller Wiser Road, Suite 300, Euless, TX 76039-3855. Postgraduate training Graduate specialty medical education residencies Loma Linda University is affiliated with a variety of accredited residency programs in two sponsoring institutions. The first is Loma Linda University Medical Center and the second Loma Linda-Inland Empire Consortium for Healthcare Education. Additional nonaccredited fellowships are available. Graduate physicians wishing to apply for entrance into these programs should contact the director of the program. These programs are sponsored by Loma Linda University Medical Center and Loma Linda Inland Empire Consortium for Healthcare Education. Postgraduate training In harmony with the needs of medicine today, the curriculum leading to the Doctor of Medicine degree is planned with the assumption that all students will take standard postgraduate training in one of the fields of medicine. This means serving as a resident for a minimum of three years in a hospital approved for this training by the Council of Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association. The Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education supplies information and assistance for the arrangement of residencies. Since the school participates in the National Residency Matching Program, selection through this means constitutes approval by the School of Medicine. Continuing medical education Recognizing the imperative of lifelong learning for professionals, the School of Medicine supports a program of continuing medical education for physicians beyond their formal postgraduate years. The Office of Continuing Medical Education is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide Category I continuing medical education credit for physicians. Course offerings include weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly School of Medicine departmental grand rounds and a large number of one-day and multiday conferences and workshops that are presented locally and nationally for School of Medicine faculty, alumni, and practicing physicians within the geographic area in which the conferences are presented.

Duerkson-Hughes Objectives Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Program description The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and who want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees course through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised, scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. Also, during the first year, students rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be306 Medicine \u2014 M.D. two to three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects with the stipulation that all requirements for the Ph.D. degree must be completed by no later than December 31 of the year the student graduates from the M.D. degree program. It is the intent of this program that students acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Admissions Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the student's scores before s/he is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. Financial assistance Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Cost-of-living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.* 2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the first and second years of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the first and second years is canceled. 4. Tuition waiver for both the third and fourth years of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. Tuition assistance for the MD portion of the combined degree program is not given to all students who earn both degrees. Assistance for the MD portion will only be given in cases where an applicant has received approval from the School of Medicine MD/PhD Admissions Committee prior to beginning the MD coursework. Assistance that is received will be in the form of an institutional loan which will cover MD tuition and fees but will not include living expenses. The School of Medicine makes provision for the loan to be forgiven when a recipient meets the terms described below and in the loan agreement. Loans for the first two years of the MD curriculum will be canceled when a student completes the PhD within the time schedule described belowand according to the terms of the loan agreement. Loans for the third and fourth year of the MD curriculum may be canceled when a student completes the PhD degree within the time schedule described below and according to the terms described below and according to the terms of the loan agreement. M.D./Ph.D. degree students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before beginning the third year of medical school. Students who have not completed the Ph.D. degree may apply for a tuition deferment for their third year of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the first term of their fourth year. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the first two years must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the associate dean for basic sciences, and the dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstances will a student be granted a tuition deferment or be allowed to register for the last term of medical school until s/he has finished the requirements for the Ph.D degree. If a student withdraws from the Ph.D. degree program his/her tuition deferments will be converted to a loan. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will convert to loan obligations at that time. *Stipends from the School of Medicine will be awarded for the first two years of the graduate program, provided that the student makes satisfactory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends covering study beyond the first two years should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research. Medicine \u2014 M.D. Curriculum The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. The first two academic years are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine. Exposure to patient care is integrated within these two years. The remaining two academic years consist of clinically-oriented core instruction and twenty weeks of clinical electives. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function\u2014including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods\u2014including but not limited to traditional lecture, small group, problem-based and case- based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences, and patient-care experiences. THE SECOND YEAR of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to individual organ systems whenever possible. The second year will continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate,Loma Linda University 2017-2018 307 ethical, and Christian practice of medicine\u2014both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditional lecture; small group, problem-based, and case-based learning; personalized computer-based instruction; quantitative laboratory experiences; and longitudinal patient- care experiences. THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in seven core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will obtain this foundation through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health-care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease, b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data, and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experiences in whole person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, radiology, health maintenance, and disease prevention will be integrated into the seven core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in supervised patient-care experiences in emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and preventive medicine and public health; and a subintern-level experience in medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during a minimum twenty weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, up to one month of elective must be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process.

The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, life experience, and significant qualities of character and personality. The study of medicine Preparing for a career in medicine, students should quest for a broad understanding in the major areas of knowledge--the natural sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the humanities--which assists them in the process of learning throughout their life. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate the ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly--both orally and in written form-- their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society.

Scores older than three years will not be considered. Recommended Introductory course in basic statistics Introductory course in psychology Introductory course in sociology Provide evidence of experience with direct involvement in providing healthcare, thus informing the applicant's decision to pursue medicine as a career. Application procedure and acceptance It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process well in advance of the date of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is available on the Web at <aamc.org/students/ applying/amcas (https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas)>. AMCAS deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August of the following year. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1. The applicant submits a formal application through the AMCAS We site, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's verified data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests the applicant to complete an online supplementary application.3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the year preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant responds online to his/her offer of admissions as a student, and accepts the technical standards. 6. In summary, the Admissions Office requires the following: Verified AMCAS application. Loma Linda University School of Medicine supplementary application and $85 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowledgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate college/university. Applicant's availability for interviews, should an offer for an interview be extended. Pre-entrance health requirement and health coverage Exposure to patients takes place during year one of medical education. Because of this, it is necessary for students to have immunizations against certain infectious diseases. In order to complete registration for the first academic quarter, students must give evidence in the form of physician records or college health service records that they have met immunization requirements. Students without proper verification will be required to receive immunizations, and the charges will be billed to the students' account. The pre-entrance requirements may be found at <http://home.llu.edu/campus-and-spiritual-life/student-health/new- students.>. Students are also required to have certain injections and immunizations repeated at various intervals during their enrollment. Including an annual skin test for tuberculosis. Medical students will be required to have flu shots on an annual basis in order to meet the requirements of clinical sites where students will be working. These will be given by the Student Health Center at the beginning of each flu season. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with health coverage through the University's Department of Risk Management. The Student Health Plan remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. For Student Health Plan benefit information, visit http://home.llu.edu/ campus-and-spiritual-life/student-health/services-and-fees. The plan does not cover optical care and provides only limited dental care. For these reasons it may be to the student's advantage to maintain a current personal policy if they have one. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for his/her spouse/children may purchase it through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration or during specified enrollment periods. GovernmentLoma Linda University 2017-2018 309 regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions about the plan should call Risk Management at (909) 651-4010. Annual tuition also covers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. Early decision program A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Loma Linda University, s/he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any school desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program. Deadlines June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of matriculation to the School of Medicine) is the period for submission of application for the first year class.

Loma Linda University School of Medicine technical standards Loma Linda University School of Medicine candidates for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills of five varieties, including: observation; communication; motor; intellectual (conceptual, integrative, and quantitative); behavioral and social. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in certain areas, but a candidate should beable to perform in a reasonably independent manner without the use of a surrogate. OBSERVATION: The student must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, microbiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. COMMUNICATION: A student must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues, and other personnel. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health-care team. MOTOR: Students should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.); carry out diagnostic procedures (proctoscopy, paracentesis, etc.); and read EKGs and X-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment of patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. INTELLECTUAL-CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ABILITIES: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL ATTRIBUTES: Medical students must possess the emotional health required for appropriate utilization of their intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment, and the timely completion of all responsibilities attendant to their academic work, team work, and patient care. They must demonstrate the ability to develop mature, sensitive and effective professional relationships with peers, faculty, staff, members of the health-care team, and patients. Medical students must demonstrate empathy, and concern for others while respecting appropriate personal and professional boundaries. Medical students must demonstrate integrity as manifested by truthfulness, acceptance of responsibility for one's actions, accountability for mistakes, and the ability to place the wellbeing of the patient above their own when necessary. They must be able to tolerate demanding workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the medical education and clinical practice settings.310 Medicine \u2014 M.D. Program requirements First Year ANAT 529 Gross Anatomy and Embryology 10.5 BCHM 518 Fundamentals of Human Biochemistry 2.5 MDCJ 519 Foundations of Clinical Medicine 17 MDCJ 520 Basis of Medical Genetics 2 MDCJ 527 Cell Structure and Function 8.5 MDCJ 528 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Sciences3.5 MDCJ 538 Medical Neuroscience 3.5 PHSL 526 Medical Physiology 7.5 RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics 2 RELR 701 Orientation to Religion and Medicine 2 Select two of the following: 4 RELR 725 Wholeness for Physicians RELR 749 Marriage and Family Wholeness RELT 706 Adventist Beliefs and Life RELT 707 Medicine, Humanity, and God RELT 767 Apostle of Hope: The Life, Letters, and Legacy of Paul Second Year MDCJ 521 Applications of Clinical Genetics 2 MDCJ 530 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis 11 MDCJ 539 Diseases of Neuroscience 4 MICR 547 Medical Microbiology 4.5 PATH 517 Human Systemic Pathology 9.5 PHRM 515 Medical Pharmacology 6 PRVM 517 Lifestyle and Preventive Medicine 4 PSYT 526 Psychopathology 4.5 RELR 775 Art and Science of Whole Person Care 2 Select one of the following: 2 RELR 749 Marriage and Family Wholeness (If not taken 1st year) RELT 716 God and Human Suffering RELT 734 Anthropology of Mission Third Year 1.5 units = 1 week of clinical clerkship FMDN 701 Family Medicine Clerkship (4 weeks) 6 GYOB 701 Gynecology and Obstetrics Clerkship (6 weeks) 9 MEDN 701 Medicine Clerkship (10 weeks) 15 MNES 791 Third-year Elective (2 weeks) 3 NEUR 701 Neurology Clerkship (4 weeks) 6 PEDS 701 Pediatrics Clerkship (8 weeks) 12 PRVM 791 Applied Preventive Medicine 2 PSYT 701 Psychiatry Clerkship (6 weeks) 9 RADS 791 Integrated Clinical Radiology 2 RELE 714 Advanced Medical Ethics 2 SURG 701 Surgery Clerkship (10 weeks) 15 Fourth Year Clinical clerkships EMDN 821 Emergency Medicine Clerkship (2 weeks) 3MDCJ 821 Preventive Medicine and Population Health (4 weeks)6 Select one rotation (4 weeks): 6 MEDN 822 Medicine Intensive Care PEDS 822 Pediatrics Intensive Care SURG 822 Surgery Intensive Care Subinternship: Select one rotation (4 weeks) 6 FMDN 821 Family Medicine Subinternship MEDN 821 Medicine Subinternship PEDS 821 Pediatrics Subinternship SURG 821 Surgery Subinternship Select 30 units (20 weeks) of the following: 30 ANAT 891 Anatomy Elective ANES 891 Anesthesiology 891 Biochemistry Elective DERM 891 Dermatology Elective EMDN 891 Emergency Medicine Elective FMDN 891 Family Medicine Elective (General Family Medicine) GYOB 891 Gynecology and Obstetrics Elective MDCJ 891 Whole Person Care MEDN 891 Medicine Elective NEUR 891 Neurology Elective NEUS Elective 891 Orthopaedic Surgery Elective OTOL 891 Otolaryngology Elective PATH 891 Pathology Elective PEDS 891 Pediatrics Elective PHRM 891 Pharmacology Elective PHSL 891 Physiology Elective PMRH 891 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Elective PRVM 891 Preventive Medicine Elective PSYT 891 Psychiatry Elective RADS 891 Radiology Elective RDMN 891 Radiation Medicine Elective SURG 891 Surgery Elective UROL 891 Urology Elective Total Units 244.5 Normal time to complete the program 4 years \u2014 full-time enrollment requiredLoma Linda University 2017-2018 311 Anesthesiology The goals of the Department of Anesthesiology are to: 1.

In 1907, the first class to graduate included seven students\u2014five women and two men. As the school developed and became a college-based program rather than a hospital diploma program, the baccalaureate degree commenced in 1949. The Master of Science degree was granted in 1957. The Doctor of Philosophy degree was added to the existing programs of the school, with the first class starting in 2002. The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree began in 2010. Accreditation The School of Nursing received accreditation by the National League for Nursing (NLN) (61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006) in 1951. In 2000, initial accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) was received. The B.S. degree in nursing, M.S. degree in nursing, and Doctor of Nursing Practice at Loma Linda University School of Nursing are accredited by the CCNE (One Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036, (202/887-6791). The most recent accreditation for the B.S. and M.S. degree curricula by the CCNE was in 2009; and for the DNP program in 2012. The nurse anesthesia area received initial accreditation from the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Education Programs (COA) in 2014 (222 South Prospect Avenue, Park Ridge, IL 60068-4001). The C alifornia Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) (P. O. Box 944210, Sacramento, CA 94244-2100) granted continuing approval in 2011. Consumers are encouraged to contact CCNE, COA, or BRN with comments about the program. Agency membership The School of Nursing holds agency membership and actively participates in the following major professional organizations: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Education Programs (COA), and Western Institute of Nursing. SN Vision: Transforming lives through nursing education, professional practice, and research. SN Mission The education of nurses dedicated to professional excellence and compassion in clinical practice, education, and research. Loma Linda University-educated nurses will further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ through commitment to whole person care and Christian values. Programs of study The School of Nursing prepares professional nurses to practice with a Christian perspective through the following programs: 1. The baccalaureate degree curriculum\u2014designed to prepare competent, beginning-level professional nurses who are committed to excellence in practice. 2. The master's degree in nursing program\u2014designed to prepare nurses for leadership as nurse educators, nurse administrators, or nurse anesthetists. 3. The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree\u2014designed to prepare nurses for leadership as advanced practice registered nurses, clinical nursespecialists and nurse practitioners, and other advanced nursing roles in the clinical setting. 4. The Doctor of Philosophy degree program\u2014designed to prepare nurse scholars for leadership in education, administration, and research. Philosophy In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development of wholeness in those served. Individuals \u2014created to reflect the wholeness of God's character\u2014have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to his/her original state at Creation. God works through human agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individual families and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to care for those affected by health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014 learn in different ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in the development of the science and practice of nursing.

Student organizations The following student organizations enable students to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspects of University life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization of the School of Nursing. This association comprises all the students of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectives of this organization are to serve as a channel for communication between students and faculty, and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University Student Association (LLUSA) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. Class organizations The members of the junior and senior classes elect officers and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. Honor society: Sigma Theta Tau International In 1975, LLUSN became an official chapter Gamma Alpha, of Sigma Theta Tau International, the honor society for nursing. Students may be invited to become members if they meet the established criteria. Financial information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 351 General financial practices Before the beginning of each school year, the student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses.

Scholarship Woodruff (George and Ollie) ScholarshipLoma Linda University 2017-2018 353 Undergraduate Curricula overview The following sections describe the undergraduate curricula offered by the School of Nursing and list the courses each student must complete. Students are expected to follow the general policies of the University, the school, and specific policies of their degree curriculum. The school reserves the right to update and modify curricula content to keep current with trends in health care. B.S. degree The purpose of the School of Nursing's baccalaureate degree is to prepare competent clinicians who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. The curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree is consistent with the faculty's belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with those from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary and acute care\u2014with clients from various ages, cultural groups, and socioeconomic strata. Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of preclinical work\u2014which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any regional accredited college or university. After completion of an additional eight quarters at Loma Linda University, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health-care team. Learning outcomes for baccalaureate nursing The learning outcomes of the baccalaureate nursing program are designed to prepare competent nursing professionals. 1. Patient-centered care: Evaluate nursing care and education provided to patients, families, groups, populations, and communities across the lifespan from diverse backgrounds in a variety of settings to ensure that it is wholistic, compassionate, age and culturally appropriate; and based on a patient's background, preferences, values, and needs. 2. Teamwork and collaboration: Collaborate with members of the interprofessional health-care team to manage and coordinate the provision of safe, quality care for patients, families, and groups. 3. Evidence based practice: Integrate scientific information and best current evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences when making clinical judgments in the management of patient-centered care. 4. Quality improvement: Use quality improvement measures to evaluate the effect of change on the delivery of patient-centered care and patient outcomes.5. Safety: Evaluate effectiveness of strategies used to reduce the risk of harm to patients, self, and others in health-care, home, and community settings. 6. Informatics: Use empirical and evidence-based information and patient care technology to communicate relevant patient information, manage care, and mitigate error in the provision of safe, quality, patient-centered care. 7. Professionalism: Model integrity and accountability in practices that uphold established regulatory, legal, and ethical principles while providing standard-based nursing care. 8. Leadership: Integrate leadership and management theories and principles into practice when managing a caseload of patients and making clinical judgments about their care. 9. Communication: Use verbal, nonverbal, and written communication strategies that promote an effective exchange of information; development of therapeutic relationships; and shared decision making with patients, families, groups, populations, and communities from diverse backgrounds. Professional registration Satisfactory completion of the California Board of Registered Nursing- required content prepares the student to sit for the NCLEX-RN examination. All states require that a nurse pass the NCLEX-RN examination for licensure to practice. California application forms and fees are submitted to the California Board of Registered Nursing, P.O. Box 944210, Sacramento, CA 94244-2100: Web site: <http://www.rn.ca.gov/>. Four B.S. degree options 1. Standard (generic) B.S. degree curriculum Students must complete all prerequisite courses prior to starting clinical courses. Occasional exception for certain prerequisites can be made. For more specifics, consult with admissions department staff. 2. B.S. degree curriculum (for student with bachelor's degree in another area). Applicants for this track must fulfill the same admission requirements (p. 356) and degree requirements as the standard B.S. degree. Students entering with a nonnursing baccalaureate degree may write the NCLEX-RN after completing nursing courses required for licensure. This allows students to write the NCLEX-RN after six quarters and prior to completing the B.S. degree. Students who choose this option and obtain employment as an RN may be eligible to enroll in online courses in the RN to B.S. academic program. Students with an entering G.P.A. of 3.3 or above are eligible to request the accelerated curriculum option that prepares students to write the NCLEX-RN after five quarters rather than six. Applicants to this track should expect to carry intensive academic loads. Students in this track must maintain a 3.0 G.P.A. each quarter. 3. RN to B.S. curriculum The returning RN may complete a baccalaureate degree in four quarters of full-time course work. Part-time study is an option. Courses are designed in the on-line format. On-line activities will include weekly discussions and assignments designed to focus on the working environment of the RN. The returning RN must have completed all prerequisite courses prior to acceptance into the program, must be currently working as an RN, and must meet the following noncourse requirements: Current RN license A.S. degree or diploma in nursing 4. B.S. degree for the licensed vocational nurse354 Undergraduate Students must complete all prerequisite courses prior to starting clinical courses. Nondegree option The 45-quarter unit RN licensure option A 45-quarter unit option is open to all LVNs who seek only the RN license. Since the LVN choosing this option does not meet the requirements for a degree as outlined by the school, neither a degree nor a certificate will be issued; nor will a graduation exercise be included. In addition, the student will not be eligible to wear the school pin, cap, or other insignia. An RN license obtained through this option is valid in California and may not be transferable to other states. Prerequisite per BRN High school diploma Current LVN license in California (skills will need to be validated) Completion of physiology and microbiology with a grade of C or higher G.P.A. of at least 2.0 Academic plan Required courses Required courses NRSG 217 Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing 6 NRSG 317 Adult Health Nursing II 8 NRSG 226 LVN Bridge Course for Physical Assessment 2 NRSG 227 LVN Bridge Course for Gerontological Nursing 2 NRSG 308 Adult Health Nursing I #8 NRSG 420 Professional Preparation 2 Optional courses (to complete 45 units) NRSG 314 Obstetrical and Neonatal Nursing 6 NRSG 315 Child Health Nursing 6 NRSG 316 The Nursing Role in Health Promotion 4 NRSG 408 Critical Care Nursing 6 NRSG 409 Home Health Nursing 3 #This course may be challenged. +Upon completion of this course, students are credited with NRSG 214 Fundamentals of Professional Nursing (8 units), NRSG 216 Basic Nursing Skills and Health Assessment (2 units), and NRSG 309 Gerontological Nursing (2 units). NOTE: The student in this 45-unit RN option must maintain a G.P.A. of at least 2.0 and earn a grade of at least a C in each course throughout enrollment at Loma Linda University. A grade below a C will cause the student to be dropped from the LLU School of Nursing. Academic policies and practices Academic residence To qualify for an undergraduate degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 45 units at Loma Linda University; 32 of the units must be at the senior level. At minimum, three clinical nursing courses are required as part of these units. Nursing courses Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursingcourse, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory, the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76 percent on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D Below 62% F Clinical experiences Clinical experiences are under the direction of the course coordinator. The student has supervised experience under a clinical instructor in the care of patients. Tardiness or unexcused absences from class or clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Three times of being tardy to class and/ or laboratory is equal to one absence. Absence in excess of 20 percent of course appointments (class, seminar and/or clinical) may be cause for failure. Students must make up for absences from clinical due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $200 will be charged for make-up of clinical laboratory during nonclinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse during assigned clinical laboratory time. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing, planning, and implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the University catalog and the University Student Handbook . Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may fail the course or be dropped from the program. Students are responsible for their individual transportation to off-campus clinical sites. Individual transportation does not mean arrangements to car-pool with someone. Off-campus clinical assignments cannot be promised on the basis of the student's transportation convenience.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 355 Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required nursing courses required for licensure. Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanors, driving citations, and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Credit by examination Challenge/equivalency examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health-care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health-care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination at 76%. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. Advanced placement program Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more Advanced Placement (AP) examinations with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the College Board to University Records. For specific policy and time limits regarding CLEP examinations, see \"Academic Policies\" in the Section II of the CATALOG. Military Option for Advanced Placement Individuals who have held military health care occupations in the areas including, but not limited to Basic Medical Technician Corpsmen, Army Health Care Specialist, or Air Force Independent Duty Medical Technician may be eligible to apply for advanced placement into the 2nd quarter courses of the nursing program at Loma Linda University School of Nursing if they are able to provide verifiable education and experience required to meet the equivalency for first quarter coursework. Interested candidates are advised to meet with the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Program at least 4 weeks prior to application to review eligibility requirements. Academic Support In order to promote academic success in the nursing program, if a student earns a grade of \"C\" or \"C+\" in NRSG 214 Fundamentals of Professional Nursing and/or NRSG 216 Basic Nursing Skills and Health Assessment , the student will be required to: Register for NRSG 244 Strategies for Academic Success (1 unit) during the second quarter and through completion of third quarter courses. Follow an individualized plan for continued involvement with the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) in subsequent quarters. Theindividualized plan will be developed based on individual needs as determined by the ACE faculty mentor, course instructor(s), advisor, and student. Student will be recommended to limit second quarter registration to 15 units or less, including Strategies for Academic Success. Total length of program may then equal nine (9) units. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: religion and nutrition. Any nursing or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course or named cognate, or who have withdrawn (W) due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success and to communicate regularly with the academic advisor. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. See Student Handbook for grievance procedure. Graduation requirements A candidate must complete the undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to completion of degree. A degree will be granted when the student has met the following requirements: 1. Completed all requirements for admission to the respective curriculum. 2. Completed all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, and length of academic residence. 3. Completed a minimum of 193.0 quarter units for the baccalaureate degree, with a minimum overall G.P.A. of 2.0. 4.

The Ph.D. degree in nursing is a research- oriented degree with emphases on the development of nursing science in the areas of vulnerable populations, health/wellness/wholeness, and health systems research. The nurse-scientist who completes this program should be committed to the generation of knowledge critical to development of nursing science and practice. Graduates join other nursing leaders in furthering the development of nursing science and improving health-care delivery throughout the world. The program is designed for entry with a minimum of a B.S. degree. Advanced standing, of up to 32 units, is given to students with a prior master's degree in nursing. See program requirements for more details. The program completion range is three-to-seven years (projected mean is five years) depending on whether students are full or part time. Learning outcomes for Doctor of Philosophy The learning outcomes of the Ph.D. degree program are designed to prepare nurse scientists and scholars with a Christian perspective for leadership in education, health-care administration, and research within a global community. Upon completion of the Ph.D. degree, the nurse will: 1. Embrace a holistic perspective on life and demonstrate this by integrating the bio-psycho-social-spiritual dimensions in teaching, scholarship, and service. 2. Extend Christ-centered values to nursing scholarship and education. 3. Serve as a nurse scholar through the generation and dissemination of knowledge relevant to nursing science, health policy, and the nursing profession. 4. Explain complex phenomena clearly in a spoken and written English to both professional and lay audiences. 5. Demonstrate advanced competency and leadership in the use of technology for the purpose of generating new knowledge in nursing. 6. Engage in collaborative discourse, scholarship, and leadership contributing to health care and society. The curriculum The Ph.D. degree program is offered using a year-round hybrid/blended format. The hybrid/blended format will use both face-to-face on the LLU campus, and distance- learning strategies. The curriculum has six domains: core courses (B.S. to Ph.D.), Ph.D. role courses, concentration/ elective courses (to support the dissertation), methods courses (research methods and statistics), religion, and dissertation units. The department has identified approximately twenty courses within the School of Nursing that could be selected to satisfy requirements within the domains as well as a variety of courses in other LLU schools and the NEXus* consortium that may support the student's dissertation interest. The doctoral degree program is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of knowledge development within the discipline of nursing through philosophical, theoretical, and scientific methods of inquiry. The student is encouraged to select an individually focused area of advanced inquiry that will support his/her chosen area of expertise in nursing that falls within the broad scope of vulnerable populations, health/wellness/wholeness, or health systems research. The individual area of concentration should fit established research programs of the School of Nursing faculty or other LLU faculty as advised.*NEXus is a partnership among select Western Institute of Nursing institutions to facilitate enrollment in doctoral courses not available on the student's home campus. Through NEXus, the institutions have identified courses that are available at a distance and open for enrollments from partner institutions. Progression criteria The following sequential elements are required for progression in the doctoral program: 1. Area of concentration developed and approval of student's proposed academic plan by the end of the first year of full-time study. 2. Complete all core, concentration, and methods courses. 3. Pass oral comprehensive examination. 4. Successful defense of research proposal. 5. Advancement to candidacy. 6. Successful defense of dissertation. Refer to guidelines from the Faculty of Graduate Studies* and the Ph.D. student handbook for dissertation format requirements. The normal time to complete the program is three to seven years\u2014(5 years projected mean) based on less than full-time enrollment. *The Ph.D. Program Oversight: Faculty of Graduate Studies Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) admission requirements, the applicant to the Doctor of Philosophy degree program in nursing must also complete the following requirements: 1.

Pharmacists play an integral role in caring for patients in a multidisciplinary approach within the health-care team. While the traditional role for pharmacists is to dispense medications to patients, the practice of pharmacy is extensive and has become a \"hands-on\" practice. In the community setting, pharmacists administer vaccines to patients and also conduct patient assessments of ailments such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and seizures in outpatient disease- based clinics. In the institutional setting, pharmacists work closely with physicians, nurses, and allied professionals to ensure that patients are receiving appropriate doses of medications per protocol. In order to gain these skills, knowledge of pharmacy practice in drug information, pharmaceutical care, clinical therapeutics, and experiential education is vital; along with understanding of biomedical, pharmaceutical, social, and administrative science. This catalog will introduce you to the courses and services available to help you reach your goals. The aim of our faculty, staff, and administration is to provide an environment that helps you develop into a caring, compassionate, competent, and skillful pharmacist. We are committed to ensuring that all students gain the knowledge and skills needed for the profession and a dedication of lifelong service to others. While a student at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy, you will have opportunities toparticipate in community outreach, including programs to underserved patient populations. The University motto, \"To make man whole,\" combined with the mission to continue the teaching and healing ministry to Jesus Christ is the foundation on which all programs at Loma Linda University are built. It is our desire to prepare all graduates to fulfill this mission. Welcome to the school that will help you grow spiritually, mentally, physically, socially, and professionally for a life of service to those in need. Noreen H. Chan Tompkins, PharmD, BCPS-AQ ID Dean, School of Pharmacy School foundations History In 1994, a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees; and in 1995, the board voted to continue to approve in principle the establishment of a school of pharmacy. The new School of Pharmacy's pioneering class of 2006 began on September 19, 2002. In July 2007, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education granted full accreditation status to the School of Pharmacy. In October 2012, the School of Pharmacy moved into Shryock Hall, a historical building in the core of the LLU campus. The administrative team, Department of Pharmacy Practice, and Department of Experiential and Continuing Education now call Shryock Hall home. The Chan Shun Pavilion houses the Department of Pharmaceutical and Administrative Sciences and three research laboratories. Mission, goals, and values Our mission In addition to the mission of Loma Linda University to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, the School of Pharmacy is committed to: Educating competent, caring pharmacists who will serve as integral members of the health-care team; Expanding\u2014through research\u2014the development of therapeutic regimens that will advance the knowledge and technology available for the treatment of disease; and Providing high-quality pharmaceutical care to all those within the global sphere of influence of Loma Linda University. The School of Pharmacy educates pharmacists of the highest ethical and professional standards to deliver competent and compassionate pharmaceutical care. A diverse and dynamic educational environment produces students who are practitioners, health professionals, and providers of humanitarian service to a global community. Graduates will be dedicated to lifelong learning; developing new knowledge; advancing standards of practice; and integrating physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of health. Our goals The goals of Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy are to: Provide pharmaceutical care in a global community. Expand and disseminate pharmaceutical knowledge through research and scholarly activities. Promote integrity and high ethical standards in conjunction with empathic attitudes that contribute to the well-being of patients and society.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 379 Engender and nurture the desire to serve humankind. Create an educational environment supportive of diverse populations and learning styles. Demonstrate pharmacy leadership within the University and the region. Encourage cultivation of self-education habits that foster lifelong learning. Instill positive personal health lifestyles that promote wholeness, wellness, and spiritual values. Incorporate educational techniques and technologies that best serve student learning. Promote responsible management of health-care resources and the environment. Our values The School of Pharmacy's academic and co-curricular activities focus on the following seven values (J-CHIEFS): Justice\u2014the commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" Compassion\u2014the sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. Humility\u2014the willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. Integrity\u2014the quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match his/her actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Excellence\u2014the commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. Freedom\u2014the competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. Purity/Self-Control\u2014the commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions.

Thus, admission to the School of Pharmacy is offered only to those who present the highest qualifications for the study and practice of pharmacy. Technical standards presented in this document are requirements for admission to, promotion within, and graduation from the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. It is the policy of Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy that no person shall be denied admission, promotion, or graduation on the basis of any disability, provided that the individual demonstrates ability to meet the minimum technical standards set forth herein. Standards are developed as criteria to achieve the Doctor of Pharmacy degree in preparation for licensure as a practicing pharmacist and for postgraduate professional training and education in any of the varied fields of pharmacy. Further, the safety of the patient must be guarded as the final and ultimate consideration. Therefore, it is not only reasonable, but also essential, for competent patient care to require minimum technical standards for the education of pharmacists. Graduates of schools of pharmacy must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical, administrative, and leadership situations and to render a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical care. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy acknowledges Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and PL 11-336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 1993, but ascertains that certain minimum technical standards must be present in the prospective candidates. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education requires that the curriculum provide a general professional education, enabling each student to eventually practice as a pharmacist generalist. This requires the development of broad knowledge, skills, behaviors, ongoing self-directed learning, and the eventual ability to deliver competent pharmaceutical care within a reasonable time frame and within the context of the legal and ethical framework of the profession. Technical standards Technical standards specify those attributes the faculty consider necessary for initiating, continuing, or completing a high-quality pharmacy education program, thus enabling each graduate to enter practice, residency, or fellowship training. Faculty have responsibility to monitor the maintenance of these standards. Students must be able to perform independently all of the described functions. A candidate for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in the following areas: observation, communication, motor coordination and function; intellectual-conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; behavioral and social attributes; and ethical values. The School of Pharmacy will consider for admission any applicant who demonstrates the ability to perform or to learn to perform the skills listed in this document. Applicants are not required to disclose the nature of their disability(ies) to the Admissions Committee. However, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss his/her specific issue(s) with the associate dean for student affairs and admissions prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant, reasonable accommodations will be provided. This commitment also holds for current students whose health or abilities change while enrolled in the program. The School of Pharmacy recognizes that certain student disabilities can be accommodated without compromising the standards required by the college and the integrity of the curriculum. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The school is committed to the development of innovative and creative ways of opening the curriculum to competitive and qualified disabled candidatesLoma Linda University 2017-2018 381 while protecting the care of patients. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, third parties cannot be used to assist students in accomplishing curricular requirements in the skill areas specified above. Observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations and conduct exercises in a variety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to monitoring of drug response and preparation of specialty dosage forms and experiments in the basic sciences. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonverbal as well as verbal signals. The student must be able to observe and interpret presented information. Specific observation requirements include, but are not limited to the following abilities: visualizing and discriminating findings on monitoring tests; reading written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected images; observing and differentiating changes in body movement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and monitoring instruments and tests; observing a patient's environment; and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. Communication A student should be able to speak, hear, and listen to patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communications. Students must be able to relate effectively and sensitively with patients and their caregivers/partners, and convey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues, and other personnel in the School of Pharmacy. Communication includes speech, reading, writing, hearing, and computer literacy. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectively, and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health-care team. Specific requirements include but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with members of the health- care team individually and collectively; eliciting a thorough medication and medical history; and communicating complex findings in appropriate terms that are understood by patients and their caregivers, partners, and various members of the health-care team (fellow students, pharmacists, faculty and staff members, physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social workers, and others). Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise but complete summaries of individual activities, decisions, and complex, prolonged encounters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appropriately document activities according to directions in a thorough and timely fashion. Motor coordination and function Students should have sufficient motor function and skills necessary to perform basic tasks in the practice of pharmacy and to elicit information from patients by various screening maneuvers. Students should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must be able to respond promptly to emergencies within the practice setting and must not hinder the ability of their co-workers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation, applying pressure to stop bleeding, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication, and preparing sterile intravenous medications. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functionaluse of the senses of touch and vision. Students must have sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug responses and to prepare and or dispense pharmaceuticals. A candidate should be able to perform basic laboratory tests (e.g., blood glucose and lipid levels); administer immunizations (intramuscular and subcutaneous); compound sterile and nonsterile dosage forms; use current technology for drug information evaluation; read EKGs, drug blood levels, and other laboratory results. It is also necessary for the student to be able to access drug and disease information sources (both paper and electronic) within a reasonable time frame and record data correctly so that it is clearly understood by other health professionals. Intellectual--conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities A student should possess sufficient intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities to complete a rigorous and intense didactic and experiential curriculum. These abilities include measurement, calculation, rational reasoning, problem analysis and solving, decision-making, judgment, numerical recognition, information integration, and solution synthesis. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three- dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relations of structures. Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages for a variety of patient-specific conditions, such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respiratory arrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involving appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc., must be made accurately and quickly. Problem solving and critical skills demanded of all pharmacists require all of the above-mentioned intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. The ability to incorporate new information from peers or teachers and to locate and evaluate new information from the literature to be used appropriately in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans is essential, as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Students must be able to identify and acknowledge the limits of their knowledge to others when appropriate and be able to recognize when the limits of their knowledge indicate that further study or investigation is essential before participating in decision making. A student must be fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, kindness, patience, good interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are required. Students must possess the emotional and mental health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the screening and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients of differing cultures and backgrounds. Students must also be able to develop mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners--providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate. Students must possess adequate endurance to be able to tolerate physically, intellectually, and emotionally taxing workloads; and to function effectively under stress or with distractions. At times, this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must develop the skills necessary to instruct and supervise technical personnel assisting with the delivery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate suggestions and criticism and, if necessary, respond quickly, appropriately, and cooperatively by modification of behavior. Empathy, patience, integrity,382 School of Pharmacy concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and education processes. Ethical values A student must demonstrate the highest level of professional demeanor and behavior; and must perform in an ethical manner in all dealings with peers, faculty, staff, and patients. Students must also be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners while protecting patient confidentiality. Students must also meet the expected ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Good moral character, decent values, and principled judgment are paramount attributes for being a professional. In order to participate in key components of the curriculum, a student must be able to obtain and maintain a valid intern pharmacist license from the California State Board of Pharmacy and pass requisite criminal background checks and random illegal drug screens required by the Board of Pharmacy or affiliated clinical institutions of Loma Linda University. Applicable technical standards requirements 1. The candidate/student observes demonstrations and participates in experiments in the basic pharmaceutical sciences. 2. The candidate/student analyzes, synthesizes, extrapolates, solves problems, and reaches therapeutic judgments and monitoring parameters. 3. The candidate/student sufficiently uses the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical assessment.

In summary Candidates for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have somatic sensation and functional use of the senses of vision and hearing. Candidates must have sufficient use of senses (touch, pain, temperature, position, pressure, movement, and vibratory) and motor function to permit them to carry out the activities described above. Students must be able to consistently, quickly, and accurately integrate all information received by whatever sense(s) employed; and they must have the intellectual ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Finally, students must have good moral character, decent values, and principled judgment; and they are expected to meet the ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession.Any faculty or administrative team member may question any enrolled student's or admission candidate's ability to meet any technical standard. A request for such an investigation of a specific individual must be made in writing to the associate dean for student affairs and admissions, detailing the reasons why such an evaluation is deemed necessary. The dean will be notified if such a request is granted. Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The University Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. The School of Pharmacy prepares the school-specific Policy and Procedure Manual , which is provided to all pharmacy students. Regulations, policies, procedures, and other program requirements are contained in this manual. Health check requirements All new students are required to have the immunizations listed below before their first registration. Students will not be allowed to register without a valid and completed immunization record. It is strongly recommended that all required immunizations and physical examinations be obtained by the student before arrival on campus. All of these immunizations, except the third hepatitis B, can be completed in one month. Many county health departments offer these immunizations at a reduced cost. Immunizations Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)\u2014Series of two injections must be current after 1980 or show a positive MMR titer. Tdap (tetanus/diphtheria)\u2014Must be current within ten years. (Note: Tetanus-only immunization does not meet the requirement.) Hepatitis B\u2014Series of three injections, recombinant form-Engerix-B. Tuberculosis skin test (PPD Mantoux)\u2014Must be current within six months. (If student tests positive, a chest X-ray report done within the past year is required.) Varicella (chickenpox)\u2014Must show proof of a positive Varicella titer. A completed immunization record form must be submitted to the School of Pharmacy Office of Student Affairs, as well as to the Student Health Services. A valid and completed immunization record is required before the student can register. Physical examination Documentation of a physical examination is required for entrance into the program. For additional information, please contact Student Health Services directly at 909/558-8770. Background check Students are required to pass a background check prior to each Autumn Quarter registration in order to comply with clinical site regulations. Applicants receive detailed information through the applicant portal regarding the process for obtaining the background check. Pharmacy intern license California law requires that all pharmacy students be licensed as interns before participating in any pharmacy practice experience. Consequently,Loma Linda University 2017-2018 383 all enrolled students must possess a valid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license to participate in the experiential components of the Pharm.D. program. Application for this license is part of the orientation program scheduled prior to the start of the PY1 year. Professional integrity Loma Linda University seeks to educate ethical and proficient pharmacists in a Christian paradigm. Fundamental core values of compassion, integrity, freedom, excellence, justice, purity, and humility are expected of each student attending the School of Pharmacy. Integrity is important in upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct and is consistent with the oath that is taken upon graduation. It includes being accountable for one's own conduct, as well as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues within the profession. Professionalism involves treating others with courtesy and respect. It is expected that all School of Pharmacy students will exhibit conduct that shows respect to others at all times. Code of conduct In harmony with the goals of Loma Linda University, students are expected to demonstrate a pattern of personal discipline with lifestyle expectations that are consistent with those of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Joining the Loma Linda University family is an honor and requires each individual to uphold the policies, regulations, and guidelines established for all members of the University team. The following are expected of each member of the Loma Linda University family: To respect oneself. To respect the dignity, feelings, worth, and values of others. To respect the rights and property of others and to discourage vandalism and theft. To prohibit discrimination while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions.

Student organizations Professional development Professional development activities are encapsulated in a required course. The purpose of this course is to encourage students' participation in portfolio development, leadership development activities, and other relevant exercises. Professional organizations Involvement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational and professional experience within the School of Pharmacy. The complete list of School of Pharmacy-recognized professional organizations can be found in the Professional Organization Policies andProcedure Manual . This manual is maintained in the Office of Assessment and Professional Affairs. Organization membership by invitation The School of Pharmacy endorses three organizations in which student membership is by invitation only. Membership in these organizations is seen as prestigious and indicative of superior academic achievement and leadership. California Pharmacy Student Leadership (CAPSLEAD) Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society (RX) Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharmacy Leadership Society (PLS) Class leadership Each class elects leaders to serve as student representatives to administration and to guide the class in addressing student-related issues. The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders\u2014 assisting with class issues, helping plan events, and facilitating a strong communication link to and from students. Each class also elects a full- time faculty member to serve as class advisor. The advisor's function is to serve as mentor, keep abreast of class issues, and maintain an open communication link with the associate dean for student affairs and admissions.

Academic integrity policy Academic dishonesty is an act of deliberate deceit in the fulfillment of a student's obligations to the academic community. It includes, but is not limited to, the failure to observe rules of fairness in taking examinations or writing papers, plagiarism, fabrication and cheating. \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take- home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). a. Plagiarism is the act of presenting the work of another as if it were one's own. It includes quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing or utilizing material from the Internet or from books, articles in periodicals, magazines, or newspapers without appropriate citation. In addition, any unacknowledged use of another's ideas constitutes plagiarism, including the use of papers written by other students, interviews, radio or TV broadcasts, or any published or unpublished materials (e.g., letters, pamphlets, leaflets, notes or documents). b. Fabrication is the act of contriving or making up material, data or other information (e.g., research data, patient test results) and submitting such as fact. c. Cheating is the act of deceiving, which includes such acts as looking at another's examination during the examination, using unauthorized aids (e.g., notes, electronic equipment) to retrieve or communicate information during examinations, or whatever else is deemed contrary to the rules of fairness--including violation of specific rules designated by the instructor of the course. d. Facilitation of academic dishonesty is the act of attempting to help someone engage in plagiarism, fabrication, cheating, or any other type of academic dishonesty. Disciplinary action for violation of the academic integrity policy may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, a failing grade in the course, suspension, or dismissal from the program. e. School of Pharmacy Procedures (1) If any faculty member, employee or student of the School has reason to believe that academic dishonesty or unethical conduct may have occurred, the incident may be reported immediately (verbal or written).386 School of Pharmacy If the incident is not reported immediately, it must be reported in writing to the course coordinator within 48 hours. The course coordinator must report the incident to the Office of Academic Affairs. Failure to report breaches of integrity is considered a failure of academic and/ or professional responsibility\u2014and thus may be subject to disciplinary action by the School or University. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. (2) When allegations of misconduct are made, the Office of Academic Affairs is responsible to ensure that an inquiry is made. This central reporting system allows patterns of behavior to be considered in determining the appropriate course of action. A discussion with the accused student will take place before formal action is taken. The student will have the opportunity to submit a written response concerning the specific incident. (3) The Office of Academic Affairs will inform the student in writing if formal disciplinary action is taken. The student has the right to appeal the decision. HIPAA violations It is illegal for anyone to access any medical record that they have not been given specific permission to access including their own profile. HIPAA (protected health information) violations are reported directly to the dean. The dean will meet with the student to review the compliance report. The dean may seek counsel on appropriate disciplinary action from academic, institutional and/or other agency personnel. The dean will determine the appropriate disciplinary action, and communicate the actions(s) taken to the student and corporate compliance officer. In all cases, the action of the dean is final. The student may only follow through with a University-level procedural appeal as related to the procedures contained in this section (i.e., HIPAA Violations). Interprofessional education LLUSP provides interprofessional education (IPE) experiences for pharmacy students to develop their professional communication skills and to use their knowledge and experience to provide a team-based approach and patient-centered care. It is required for all pharmacy students to participate in scheduled IPE- related courses and events throughout their didactic education and clinical training. Student progression/remediation 1. Any student who fails to achieve a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 2.5 in all courses at the conclusion of the academic year (PY1-PY3) will be dismissed from the Pharm.D program. A minimum grade of C is required to pass all pharmacy courses (required and elective). 1. Upon failing a required course, a PY1 student will be placed on a leave of absence; and the intern license will be cancelled until she/he returns to retake the failed course work. 2. In order to maintain intern license while waiting to retake the failed course work, the PY2 and PY3 students may choose to enroll in elective courses for which they are qualified The student is permitted to participate in campus activities and student organizations (no leadership roles or competitions) and maintain his/her intern license. Alternatively, the student may go on academic leave of absence for two quarters and surrender his/her intern license. 3. Upon return, the student must repeat the course(s) failed initially. Returning students are able to take at their own discretion electivecourses for which they are qualified. Repeated courses are posted as actual grade earned (per LLU policy), however both grades remain on the transcript. Only the latter grade is used for G.P.A. calculations. 4. Failing more than 9 units of required course work, whether accumulated in a single academic quarter or throughout the entire academic program, will result in dismissal from the program. A student will have a maximum of six academic years to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree, beginning with the initial date of matriculation. 5. Students must complete 9 units of elective courses by the end of the PY3 year. 6. Withdrawing from individual required courses (as a full-time student) is not permitted and will result in an automatic withdrawal from all enrolled courses for that quarter. Withdrawing from an entire block of courses requires administrative approval and requires the student to return and retake the entire block the next academic year. 7. Withdrawing from elective courses incurs no penalty as it pertains to the progression policy. Progression/remediation policy for PY4 1. All APPE courses must be passed with a grade of \"S\" (satisfactory). Any student who receives a \"U\" (unsatisfactory) will have to repeat the APPE course. 2. Any student who fails one APPE course during the PY4 year will be allowed to participate in the commencement ceremonies only if he or she does not have more than 9 units of failed or withdrawn (see section \"e\") required courses since the start of the program. However, the student's degree will not be awarded until he or she successfully passes the previously failed rotation when it is offered in the following academic year. 3. Students failing two APPE courses will be dismissed from the program because they will have failed more than 9 units of required courses. Grading The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades only. The exceptions are Professional Development, Independent Study, IPPE, and APPE--which will be graded on a \"satisfactory/unsatisfactory\" basis. For the definition of satisfactory/unsatisfactory, consult the respective course syllabus. Letter grades are determined based on performance in gaining a certain percentage of total points possible in each class. The grade distribution below shows the percentage range and the letter grade associated with each range. A passing grade of C or above is required in all courses. At least 70% of the total points must be achieved to pass each course. The grade distribution is as follows: A 93-100 Linda University 2017-2018 387 ** Unsatisfactory Performance Based on the grading policy above, a course is passed with a grade of C or above unless both conditions listed below are met in the order listed. 1. The final percentage point of performance is below 70%. 2. The final percentage point is below 1.75 standard deviations of the class percentage point mean. Incomplete notation The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course overload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for reasons other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. To receive an incomplete, the student is responsible for initiating a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a petition to receive incomplete grade on-line form (myllu.llu.edu), stating the reason for the request. If this request is approved, the instructor reports an \"I\" as well as the grade the student would have received if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions). Failure to complete course requirements will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. Final course grade appeal and grade-change policy Every student has a right to receive a grade based on a fair and unprejudiced evaluation, utilizing a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore, instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, submitted to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors have the responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grading methods are explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the judgment of the instructor of record is authoritative and the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involve a challenge of an instructor's grading standard. A student has a right to expect thoughtful and clearly defined approaches to grading, but it must be recognized that varied standards and individual approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or re-grade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatment. Only the final grade in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons--such as clerical error, prejudice, or arbitrariness--the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice , and/or error will be considered legitimate grounds for an appeal. 1. Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise professional judgment. 2. Prejudice: The grade awarded was motivated by ill will and is not indicative of the student's academic performance.3. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade due to possible error. This procedure does not cover instances where students have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda University's sexual harassment policy. The grade appeal procedure strives to resolve in a collegial manner a disagreement between student and instructor concerning the assignment of a grade. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion, and for the formal adjudication by a grade appeal panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the procedure outlined below. The grade appeal process must be started within three business days after grades are posted by University Records. Student grade appeal process Step 1 . A student who wishes to challenge a grade must discuss the matter first with the instructor within three business day after grades are posted by University Records. In most cases, the discussion between the student and the instructor should suffice; and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aware that the only valid basis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that was arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error. Step 2 . If the student's concerns remain unresolved after Step 1, the student may submit a written request to the appropriate department chair within three business days of speaking with the instructor and not having his or her concerns resolved. In situations where the instructor of record is a department chair or associate dean, then the dean will serve as the appropriate department chair in this step. The appropriate department chair will communicate within three business day with the student; and, if the department chair believes that the complaint may have merit, s/ he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the department chair, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain or change it. The department chair will communicate the result to the student and the instructor. Step 3 . If the matter remains unresolved after Step 2, the student may within three business days of notification submit to the dean a written request that includes all supporting documents. The dean will appoint a grade appeal panel to review the request. Please note that only appeals directly related to the assignment of a final grade are considered; and that attendance, illness, personal circumstances, or other reason for appeal not directly related to the assignment of a grade will not be considered. The panel may require any or all individuals associated with the appeal to appear. The panel is charged to determine whether the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of unfair treatment--such as arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error--might justify changing the grade. The panel will make its decision based on a majority vote; and is only required to state their decision, not the rationale for their decision. If the panel concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student, the instructor, and the dean; and the matter will be considered closed. If the panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it will request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written388 School of Pharmacy explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, the instructor must provide a written explanation for refusing to change the grade. If the panel after considering the instructor's explanation again concludes that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, the panel will then determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the original grade. Having made this determination, each panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of University Records. The instructor, the student, and the Dean will be advised of the new grade. Under no circumstances may persons other than the original faculty member or panel change a grade. Should the panel conclude that the instructor's written explanation justifies the original grade, the panel will report this in writing to the student, the instructor, and the dean; and the matter will be closed. Performance levels Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 2.5. Academic monitoring Each student's academic status will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each academic quarter, including each student's cumulative G.P.A. as reported by University Records. A student with a cumulative G.P.A. of less than 3.00 will be monitored by the Academic Standing Committee until the student has achieved two successive quarters with a quarterly G.P.A. above 3.00. Each student being monitored by the Academic Standing Committee must follow the protocol from the Office of Academic Affairs. Academic dismissal The progression policy addresses most elements of academic dismissal. The following two paragraphs address additional elements relating to academic dismissal. Required courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once), Grades of D+, D, D-, F, and U are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within these limits will result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receive written notification from the associate dean for academic affairs in person. The notice will include procedures for appeal. Dismissed students are required to turn in any LLU identification badges and will have their electronic and parking privileges revoked. The school will also notify the California Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's intern pharmacist license. Readmission of dismissed students A dismissed student may appeal his/her dismissal with the program directly with the Office of the Dean within five business days. Withdrawal from the program If, after having been registered, a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the course of a quarter, the associate dean of student affairs and admissions must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made by electronic submission. An exit interview with a member of the School of Pharmacy administration is required. Examination technology requirements All incoming students will be required to have their own computer. The majority of testing will be done using a computerized testingprogram from the company ExamSoft; and students will need their own computer or iPad that meets or exceeds the requirements for test taking indicated below.

Students will only be allowed to have those items necessary for completion of the examination at their desk during the examination period. All cell phones and PDAs must be turned off and placed with all other items at the front of the room. 2. Students will be responsible for furnishing their own writing utensils, including No. 2 pencils for the ScantronTM. 3. Students may be assigned random seating during the examination period. Whenever possible, multiple rooms will be used during examination periods in order to maximize space between students. Whenever possible, a ratio of one proctor per 35 students will also be maintained. 4. Bathroom breaks: Students should consult their course syllabus for policies relating to using the bathroom during examinations and other graded activities. 5. Late arrivals are disruptive. Students should arrive on time for the examination. At the instructor's discretion, students who arrive late to an examination will be allowed to take the examination only if no student who has completed the examination has left the room. Students who arrive late will not be given additional time and must turn their examination in at the same time the instructor calls time for those students who arrived on time. 6. Students should write clearly. If the instructor or course coordinator cannot read a student's answer, it will be counted wrong. Examination review If examinations are not to be returned to the students permanently, examination reviews can take place under the following conditions: 1. Students must leave all personal items (i.e., purses, backpacks, cell phones, PDAs, tape recorders, jackets, coats) at the front of the room or outside the office. 2. Students will not be allowed to have writing material or utensils during the review unless specifically allowed by the instructor. 3. The examination review can occur either at a prescheduled time or may be individually scheduled in the instructor's/coordinator's office, and in all cases will occur under the direct supervision of the instructor or course coordinator. 4. Writing down questions and/or answers from an examination is prohibited and if attempted will constitute academic dishonesty, with the requisite consequences up to and including dismissal from the program. 5. At the instructor's/coordinator's discretion, examinations and quizzes may be reviewed in class but will be collected immediately thereafter. Failure to return a test will result in a zero (0) grade for a quiz or examination. Faculty will be responsible for ensuring that all tests are returned. Requests for examination re-grade Students will be allowed to review their examinations during instructor office hours, during a review session, or upon return of essay/ calculations examinations. All requests for examination re-grades must be submitted in writing within seven days after the date when grades for the examination have been communicated to students and mustaddress specific disagreements. The instructor or course coordinator will respond to the request in writing, stating whether or not each particular grade change request has been allowed. Once an examination has been submitted for re-grading, the course coordinator reserves the right to re- grade the entire examination, not just the question(s)/section for which the examination has been submitted for re-grade. This may result in additional point deductions. After the one-week review period, requests for re-grade will not be accepted for any reason. Missed examination policy Makeup work for missed examinations will only be granted when proper procedure for being absent has been followed (see Class Absence Policy) and at the discretion of the course coordinator. Such an absence requires timely notification to the course coordinator and proper documentation provided to the Office of Student Affairs. Absences for religious reasons or school-approved activities will be honored. The student must notify the course coordinator in advance of the examination that such a situation exists. Makeup examinations may be different in both content and form from the original (missed) examination. Disclaimer The faculty of the School of Pharmacy reserves the right to revise the curriculum at any time to assure that students acquire the most current and relevant training possible. If curricular changes become necessary, every effort will be made to apprise students of the change and how it impacts their course of study. However, assurance of well-prepared graduates will prevail as the dominant concern. The School of Pharmacy will graduate only those students it deems ready to accept the moral, ethical, and professional responsibilities of the practice of pharmacy, and consequently reserves the right to withhold the recommendation for graduation of any student who does not conform to these standards. Graduation requirements A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy at Loma Linda University shall meet all of the following requirements: 1.

A request for such an investigation of a specific individual must be made in writing to the associate dean for student affairs and admissions detailing the reasons why such an evaluation is deemed necessary. The dean will be notified if such a request is granted. Experiential education While enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program, students are required to complete a supervised series of practice-based courses to prepare them for licensure as pharmacists. To qualify for licensure as a pharmacist, students must graduate from the School of Pharmacy with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, complete the required internship hours and achieve passing scores on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX); and the law examination for the state where they plan to practice. The experiential program consists of a both introductory (IPPE) and advanced (APPE) pharmacy practice experiences designed to meet the required structured, supervised, professional experience for a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Students and their supervising preceptors are guided by the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual, which contains the guidelines and policies for the successful completion of the program. The School of Pharmacy requires participation in introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) each year during the PYs 1-3 to enhance practice skills and prepare students to function as members of a health- care team. The advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) comprise the entire PY4 curriculum and are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three years of pharmacy (didactic and experiential) course work.The purpose of the experiential education program is to apply knowledge from the classroom and laboratory courses to patient care (pharmacy practice). The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce well-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible pharmacists who can deliver exemplary pharmaceutical care, as well as communicate effectively with diverse patients and other health-care professionals. Experiential education requirements During experiential courses, students are assigned to both hospital- based and community-based pharmacy practice settings under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. Participation in the IPPE/APPE courses requires a valid California intern pharmacist license issued by the California Board of Pharmacy. Students completion IPPE/ APPE at sites outside of California, must be licensed in the applicable state. When a student is participating in an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from University policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the following regulations are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. \u00b7 Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and tardiness will not be tolerated. \u00b7 Students must maintain their University e-mail account and check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. \u00b7 All experiential educational assignments are made through the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education and are the responsibility of the chair of the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education. \u00b7 Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receive financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. The student is responsible for all financial obligations associated with his/her pharmacy education. He/She is also responsible for fulfilling all site requirements prior to each rotation within the time frame requested. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to practice assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a valid driver's license and is responsible for transportation to and from sites. IPPE rotations can be up to a 70-mile radius from campus. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educational activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receives instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Department of Experiential and Continuing Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda University identification card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat mustLoma Linda University 2017-2018 391 be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site implements special attire or dress code requirements, the more stringent of the dress code requirements prevails, whether that of Loma Linda University or of the off- site institution. Pharmacy practice experience The chair of the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education coordinates both introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE). Participation in the practice-based experiences requires: \u00b7 Immunizations: Students must safeguard themselves and be sure that all University-required immunizations are up to date. Students are responsible for keeping the records of their own immunizations accessible. For the protection of patients and the students themselves, it is highly recommended that students receive the influenza vaccine in September during their PY4 year. Some sites may require this immunization. \u00b7HIPAA certificate: All students are required to complete HIPAA training and obtain a certificate of completion annually. \u00b7Bloodborne pathogen training: All students are required to complete training and obtain a certificate of completion annually. \u00b7Medicare fraud and abuse training: Students must complete training and obtain a certificate of training annually. \u00b7Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis annually during their enrollment (complete a one- or two- step PPD test, depending on the practice site requirement). A chest X- ray may also be required when medically indicated. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education. A record of tuberculosis screening clearance must be on file with student health. \u00b7Background check: Facilities require a background check of all personnel, including students who are placed on site for experiential education. Some institutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry into the School of Pharmacy. Annual review and update is required during the program. \u00b7Random drug screening: Random drug screening may be required for some practice settings. This screening may be above and beyond school- mandated screening. \u00b7Intern license: Students must hold a valid, nonprobationary California pharmacist intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences. \u00b7CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid CPR and first aid certificates. Effective dates must be current through the completion of PY4. \u00b7Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student health insurance card with them at all times.Requirements for participation in the IPPE/APPE program are subject to modification based on the requirements for licensure and the requirements for placement in the participating practice settings. Introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) The goals of the introductory pharmacy practice experience are to sharpen students' clinical skills through direct patient-care activities in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings; to introduce the student to different career opportunities in pharmacy; and to assist them in determining their career choices. Under the supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student will be provided opportunities to apply didactic knowledge to patient care in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings early on. These experiences will enhance communication, problem-solving, critical- thinking, and decision-making skills through direct patient-care activities. Advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) Students are required to complete a total of six advanced pharmacy practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four experiences (each lasting six weeks) will be in required fields of hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical community practice. Two experiences will be in elective fields. All APPE must be completed under the supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist. In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy practice experiences, a student must achieve PY4 standing as defined by the School of Pharmacy. Licensing Pharmacy intern license All School of Pharmacy students must have a current nonprobationary California intern pharmacist license. Students will be guided through the licensure application process during the first-year orientation. The intern licensure is required for the introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE). Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the Web site <http:// www.pharmacy.ca.gov/forms/intern_app_pkt.pdf>. It is the student's responsibility to keep his/her pharmacy intern license current and valid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address change, changes in the student enrollment status, or name change within thirty days of the change. A photocopy of the student's valid pharmacy intern license must be on file in the school's Department of Experiential and Continuing Education. Pharmacy intern hours In order to be licensed as a pharmacist in California, the California State Board of Pharmacy requires each applicant to have completed a minimum of 1,500 hours of supervised pharmacy practice experience. As of January 1, 2016, an applicant for the pharmacist examination who has graduated on or after January 1, 2016, from an ACPE-accredited college of pharmacy or school of pharmacy recognized by the board shall be deemed to have satisfied those pharmacy practice experience requirements.

The increase in diseases directly related to lifestyle choices, the reappearance of infectious diseases that science believed were under control, the widening gap between those who have and those who don't and its impact on their life and health are all examples of public health issues that demand our attention. And yet, they are not necessarily the most important. Why do bad things happen to good people? At the end of the day, what does any of this really matter? Am I important, of value to God or to other human beings? These questions are at the core of our existence; and the answer to them can make the difference in someone's life, health, and future. This is the reason that Loma Linda University School of Public Health exists as one of the CEPH-accredited schools. We are a community that cares about public health issues. We value wholeness and the importance of healthy lifestyle decisions\u2014offering the only M.P.H. degree program in lifestyle medicine and a thriving nutrition department. We are serious about creating and advancing knowledge as our faculty members and students engage in research that spans epidemiological studies and community-based participatory enterprises; and we care about people\u2014 not just as populations, but also as individuals\u2014and about their access to comprehensive health care. We care about the environment we live in and the policies that are developed to empower people to make the rightchoices. We care about working with individuals and communities as we all strive to effectively connect what we know with how we live. The School of Public Health is special because it is part of an educational and health-care system that can be found in the whole world\u2014from the most remote village to the most advanced metropolis; and our faculty members prepare our students to practice public health in such a world. However, the reason we exist as a school goes beyond all that has been mentioned. We are here because we want to explore the other questions with you. When you leave this institution, our prayer is that you will deepen your relationship with a God who loves you, who values you as an individual, who has a mission for your life, and to whom you matter. We hope that you get a chance to meet Him in the classrooms, down the hallways, in devotional events and spiritual retreats, and especially in the faces of those we will serve together. Welcome to the School of Public Health. As you browse through these pages, we encourage you to become acquainted with the many ways you can arrive at your professional destination\u2014a degree in public health that will enable you to serve, contributing to healthy lifestyles in a global community from a faith-based perspective.

Educational goals Loma Linda University School of Public Health, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian institution, seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to make man whole\" by: Educating ethical and proficient scholars through instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth. Expanding and providing advanced knowledge through research in various fields related to human health and disease. Providing advanced skills and competencies for professionals who plan to pursue a practice or research career. School foundations History The school's foundation was laid in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. In 1964, plans were laid for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine were accredited by APHA and organized under thename Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the school's emphasis on lifestyle. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH): 1010 Wayne Avenue, Suite 220, Silver Spring, MD 20910; and is also a member of the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH). Master's degree programs Master of Public Health (M.P.H.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), and Master of Science (M.S.) degree programs are designed for those with appropriate backgrounds who are seeking to acquire graduate- level competencies in public health, health administration, nutrition, and biostatistics. Online programs The School of Public Health offers master's degree programs in an online format in two majors to meet the needs of qualified individuals who seek to develop graduate-level competencies in public health but who for a variety of reasons choose not to be full-time, on-campus students. The School of Public Health has considerable experience offering distance learning programs at the master's degree level. For more than thirty years, the School of Public Health has adapted its program delivery style to meet the needs of busy professionals. Currently the school offers an online postbaccalaureate certificate in lifestyle interventions, and an online M.P.H. degree in two areas: population medicine and health education. The Dr.P.H. degree in health education is also offered in a technology-mediated format. These programs cater to students in the U.S. and internationally. General degree requirements All applicants to the online programs must meet the general admissions requirements found in Section II of this CATALOG. Online program financial information Financial policies Tuition for the online M.P.H. degree programs courses is the same as the on-campus tuition rate. Tuition must be paid in full at the time of registration. Financial clearance The student is expected to maintain a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained: before registering for any class; before receiving a diploma; or before requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 397 Loans Inquiry about loans should be directed to the University Office of Financial Aid.

Centers Center for Leadership in Health Systems Executive Director, Karl J. McCleary We live in an age where many of the most powerful interventions and technologies for curing disease, with ample knowledge for extending life, and enhancing well-being are readily available. This is true in many industrialized countries. Despite these accomplishments, health for many remains out of reach because our capabilities do not match individual and community needs, provide good access and high quality services regardless of where you live, or can be delivered to scale. Without strong and integrated systems, effective implementation and overall performance is hindered. According to the World Health Organization, a health system consists of all organizations, people, and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. The Center for Leadership in Health Systems is committed to promoting health improvement and a culture of health through health systems. Our vision is to be a prominent, faith-based Center that demonstrates leadership in health systems research and policy \u2014 whose analyses, practice, education, and high-impact interventions improve health outcomes, strengthen, and transform the health systems of the world. Some of our initiatives include increasing access to health care and reducing burden on public health systems (SBC-MORE), strengthening high quality laboratory services for HIV diagnosis, care, and treatment and monitoring in Malawi, examining cross-cultural leadership practices, and understanding the relationship between mental health and comorbid conditions on delivery systems. Center for Community Resilience Interim Executive Director, Karl J. McCleary The Center for Community Resilience was envisioned as a venue for engagement in creative, collaborative inter-disciplinary dialog aimed at designing solutions to pressing public health, community- rooted challenges. \"Resilience\" was seen as a unifying concept and policy instrument that uses community transformation and development approaches to address the chronic vulnerability of populations exposed to recurrent shocks and stressors, whether they are physical, such as natural disasters or pollution, or social, such as poverty. Building resilience involves multidimensional action that strengthens the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities of vulnerable populations to cope with and/or recover from specific and stressors. The Center's declared mission to understand and identify vulnerabilities rooted in health behaviors, socioeconomic, environmental, preparedness, and care delivery factors, defines its operational field. The scholarly, transitional work within the Center is aimed at developing and supporting multifactorial, holistic interventions that reduce community vulnerabilities and ensure opportunities for residents to make healthy choices. During the initial discussions, it was concluded that through the CCR, LLUSPH has a unique opportunity to enhance resilience and community wellness in the most deprived, vulnerable regions surrounding LLU. Center for Nutrition, Healthy Lifestyle, and Disease Prevention400 School of Public Health Executive Director, Joan Sabat\u00e9 Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancers account for 60% of all deaths worldwide, with an estimated 80% of these deaths occurring in low and middle income countries. These conditions are largely preventable through the adoption of healthy diets, physical activity, and avoidance of smoking. The Center focuses on elucidating the key dietary and other behavioral factors for the prevention of chronic diseases worldwide. Also, the Center is compelled to focus effort on effective health education programs to improve diet quality and recover a healthy lifestyle in the US and globally. Researchers at the Center are leaders in the study of the health effects of plant foods, and the home of the world-renowned Adventist Health Study, providing the global community with strong evidence for healthy outcomes, and the prevention of chronic diseases when adopting a plant- based diet. Building on the Adventist Health Study's unique 50 plus years of research in lifestyle and plant-based diets, the Center will pioneer new knowledge and develop innovative, interdisciplinary, translational, and interventional research aimed at reducing the risk, morbidity and mortality of unhealthy diets, sedentarism, and tobacco use related chronic diseases in the US and globally. Admissions Applicants must meet Loma Linda University (p. 24) and school- specific admissions requirements. The school's admissions office and program director ensure that applicants are qualified for the proposed curriculum and are capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. This is accomplished by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant character and personality qualities. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. Those who meet the requirements as well as the published deadlines may enroll. In selecting students, the admissions office and program director look for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual rigor. They also look for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required.

Admission decisions fit into one of two categories: regular admission or denial of admission.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 401 Admissions requirements Specific requirements\u2014which vary from program to program\u2014should be determined based on the student's area of interest. Requirements for admission into the degree programs are specified in the next section. Prerequisite courses A grade of B or higher is required for all prerequisite courses. Prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance. Entrance tests Scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or equivalent are required with the application. Application forms for the GRE and information regarding examination times and places are furnished by the Educational Testing Service, GRE-ETS, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, U.S.A.; and at <http://www.ets.org>. Applicants for the M.B.A. degree in health administration are required to submit scores from the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or equivalent, such as the GRE. Application for the GMAT are available at <http:// www.mba.com/us>. General regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III of this CATALOG provides the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. University e-mail accounts The University accepts its moral, ethical, and legal responsibility for informing and reminding students of deadlines, regulations, and processes by issuing an e-mail account to every student and communicating with students by e-mail. It is the students' responsibility to read and respond to their e-mail messages from the University. Learning environment Technology facilities Technology-mediated and fully online courses are part of the school's curricula. Students should be prepared to use e-mail, electronic library resources, online survey tools, course management tools, and other Internet communication tools while engaged in the School of Public Health learning environment. Through the online M.P.H., the technology- mediated Dr.P.H. degree programs, and the online post-baccalaureate certificate programs, the School of Public Health demonstrates its commitment to moving forward with a technology-supported and technology-facilitated learning environment. Tutorials are available to assist members of this learning community in using the school's various tools. Campus facilities Facilities for the School of Public Health--offices, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas-- are located mainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall. Additional offices and research facilities are located in the Parkland Building and the Centennial Complex.Academic policies Students are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily complying with the policies and meeting the regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Advanced standing Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limited units of advanced standing. If approved by the program director and the assistant dean for admission and records of the school, degree requirements\u2014exclusive of elective units--are reduced. Courses taken during the past five years are considered in an evaluation of the student's qualification for advanced standing. Competency in courses taken more than five years previously may be considered if the content has been used professionally on a regular basis. No advanced standing is granted for life experience that is not in conjunction with previous course work. Religion course work requirement Registration and completion of graduate-level religion course work is mandatory for completion of degree requirements. The religion requirement is designed to provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of public health students, to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges, and to provide opportunity for personal spiritual growth. Transfer of course units from other universities and institutions is not allowed; nor is a waiver option available, regardless of educational background. Traditional letter grading is required. Selection of religion courses to fulfill requirements for the various degrees should be made in consultation with the advisor, using the course schedule published online at <llu.edu/central/ssweb>. Master's degree students are required to complete a 3-unit, 500-level religion course per degree sought; and doctoral students are required to complete three 500-level religion courses in each of the religion content areas: ethical, relational, and theological studies. Only courses with REL_ code prefixes may be used to satisfy the religion course requirement. The religion requirement may not be waived by registering for a religion course at a university other than Loma Linda University. Student classification Students enrolled in courses prior to receiving official acceptance into the School of Public Health are classified as \"nondegree\" students by the University. Students may retain this status only by permission of the assistant dean for admissions and records for a maximum of 12 units of credit before official acceptance into the school. Convocation attendance Attendance at weekly University and quarterly school convocations is required. Unexcused absences are reported to the dean. Persistent failure to attend may jeopardize a student's regular standing. Course attendance Only duly registered students may attend classes. Students are expected to attend all required contact elements in a course. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Adding an additional M.P.H. major Students who wish to add another major to their M.P.H. program must complete a written petition to revise or make a change in their program. This request will be reviewed by the relevant departmental committee for402 School of Public Health approval to add the major. After approval, the student must work with the assigned advisor in the secondary department to determine the course work and other requirements that must be fulfilled for the additional major. These requirements must be specified on the Degree Compliance Report (DCR) for the student within one quarter of acceptance into the added major; otherwise the student will be administratively withdrawn from the added major. Because each combination of majors is unique, there is no guaranteed timeline for completion of the requirements for the additional major. Adding another major may also impact financial aid. Additional majors require a minimum of 18 unique units from the major core course work beyond those required for the primary major, with a grade point average of at least 3.0 for those added units. Coordination of the field practicum experience between the two majors is also required. All successfully completed majors will be listed on the student's transcript. Time limit The time lapse from first enrollment in courses applied to a master's degree curriculum to the conferring of the degree may not exceed five years. For a doctoral degree, the maximum time allowed for advancement to candidacy is five years, and seven years to completion of the degree program. Students who show evidence of appropriate academic progress may be granted up to two one-year extensions for master's and three one-year extensions for doctoral degrees. These extensions are not automatic but must be initiated by student request and be approved by the major department and the assistant dean for admissions and records. Exceeding the time limit requirements may have financial aid implications. Academic probation Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress, as defined elsewhere in this Catalog, will be placed on academic probation. Students with two quarters of unsatisfactory performance jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program. Residency requirements Residency requirements may be met by a student taking, through the School of Public Health, the minimum number of units specified for the appropriate degree. The minimum didactic unit residency requirement for a single M.P.H. degree is 56 units (including up to 9 units of transfer credit) and for a single doctoral degree is 60 units (plus dissertation units). Advanced standing can be considered for previous course work relative to these requirements. Graduation requirements A candidate for a degree shall have met the following conditions: Completed all requirements for admission. Satisfactorily completed all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance; number of credit units; specific course and field instruction; applicable qualifying and comprehensive examinations and culminating activities; and have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 for graduate students, computed separately for the total degree program and for courses in the major area. Completed a field practicum or internship (if required by the program). Completed the culminating experience. Completed an online exit survey (at the conclusion of the program). Submitted a graduation petition two-to-four quarters before graduation, as specified by the University. Given evidence of responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the school.

The candidate who has completed the requirements at the end of the Spring Quarter is encouraged to be present at the conferring of degrees. Students desiring to participate in commencement ceremonies must do so at the spring (June) exercise immediately following completion of their assigned curricula. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. Grievance policy Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific school policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled.

Academic advisement It is the responsibility of students to know and fulfill all academic and graduation requirements and to make every reasonable effort to obtain adequate academic advisement. Frequent advisor contact helps to ensure that students have current academic information and are making adequate progress toward educational goals. Continuing education The school offers nondegree short courses and workshops at various locations in the United States and overseas to meet the continuing education needs of School of Public Health alumni, other health professionals, and lay persons in the church and community. In addition, most degree courses are approved for continuing education credit. Financial information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accountsLoma Linda University 2017-2018 403 with other schools or with this University must be settled prior to registration. Traineeships United States Public Health Service traineeships provide grant money in support of public health training to citizens of the United States or to persons having in their possession a visa granting permanent residence in the United States. Allocation is made by the school to those who demonstrate financial need and who undertake specified programs of study. Further availability is contingent upon congressional funding. Applications are available from the School of Public Health Office of Financial Administration. Assistantships A limited number of teaching and research assistantships are available through the academic departments and individual researchers. It is understood that the student will perform such duties as may be required by the one to whom the student is responsible, but such duties are not to exceed the equivalent of half-time employment. Students will be considered after they demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in the area in which they would work. Application for financial aid Before a fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship is awarded, the student must have secured regular admission to the school. The student's academic record, financial need, and potential productivity are among the factors considered in the awarding of financial aid. Preference is given to complete applications received by March 2. Early application is advised. Loans Loan funds may be available to School of Public Health students who show need as determined by a federal formula. Loans are restricted to citizens of the United States and eligible noncitizens.

Educational effectiveness indicators Program learner outcomes as evidenced by: Signature assignments linked to course requirements and program learning outcomes Field practicum report Culminating experience Prerequisites The following undergraduate-level courses are required and may be taken as a MOOC or other online course where a certificate is received. Micro-economics (one course) Accounting (one course) Health-care administration practicum The practicum is a supervised work experience for emerging administrative health-care professionals in a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degree program. Students from this program will engage in an 800-hour project in a health-care setting\u2014such as a hospital, long-term care facility, or community clinic. The purpose of the practicum is to provide students with the opportunity to apply academic learning in an interdisciplinary environment and to integrate public health concepts and skills from their program of study. The depth and breadth of the experience varies by site location and project availability. This is done in the context of carefully planned and implemented field-based experience in a real world setting. The practicum is participatory in nature rather than observational, and is designed to address students' program competencies and career interests while also making contributions to the placement site/organization. While these hours will be spent at the organization, the student's work will be guided and evaluated through the Student Practicum Course on Canvas/LiveText. The units for which the student will need to register will vary according to the hours that will be completed that quarter. The practicum coordinator will work closely with students and their mentors in monitoring student progress. Students will present their experiences to the program faculty and students in final papers and oral presentations. The practicum experience may not be required of students who have five years of health-care administration experience. In order to potentially reduce or waive the practicum hours, students with five years or more of experience will complete a competency inventory assessment to demonstrate their experience. Students enrolled in a professional clinical program who are also enrolled in the M.B.A degree program are required to complete 400 hours in their practicum since their clinical education is counted as exposure to practical and professional development.416 Health Education \u2014 M.P.H.

Further details provided in the Doctoral Handbook. Normal time to complete the program 5.33 years based on full-time enrollmentEpidemiology \u2014 Ph.D. Program director Jayakaran S. Job The aim of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree program is to prepare students entering with a strong background in the health sciences for a career in research and teaching in academic institutions, governmental agencies, research institutes, nonprofit organizations, or private industry. In contrast with the Dr.P.H. graduates, those with the Ph.D. degree may exhibit proficiency in \"narrower lines of research and often with different types of research methods.\" They continue their careers, for example, teaching at a university, conducting research in a national laboratory, or engaging in population-based fieldwork around the world. The curriculum is designed to fulfill program requirements while also addressing the nature of the student's research interest and academic needs. Ph.D. degree students are expected to critically evaluate and write scientific journal articles as part of their educational training. They are also expected to gain adequate experience in pedagogy. Each student is responsible for identifying an appropriate faculty research mentor during the program. Learning objectives Students completing the Ph.D. degree program in epidemiology are expected to develop high-level knowledge of epidemiologic theory and methodology and to apply this knowledge to the design, conduct, statistical analysis, and interpretation of data from population-based research in the health sciences. The graduate of this program will be able to: Demonstrate knowledge of human disease etiology and apply this knowledge to epidemiologic investigations. Interpret descriptive epidemiologic data to generate hypotheses in the examination of possible risk factors for disease. Critically evaluate the scientific literature pertaining to exposure and disease relationships, study designs, measures of association, issues of bias, confounding and effect modification; and identify gaps in knowledge. Utilize classical, modern, and innovative epidemiologic methods to design studies and to develop research proposals using National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Apply quantitative skills to analyze and synthesize epidemiologic data and to use statistical software packages. Communicate epidemiologic concepts and findings orally and in written format (e.g., publishable manuscripts) to diverse audiences.

Normal time to complete the program 7 years based on less than full-time enrollmentLoma Linda University 2017-2018 437 SCHOOL OF RELIGION Dean's welcome Welcome to the most unusual school of Loma Linda University. The School of Religion has several degree programs that associate areas in the sciences with religion. But the major task of the School of Religion remains enriching programs in the other seven schools of the University with a faith-based, wholistic approach to the health sciences. So, in whatever program you have enrolled, you will come in contact with School of Religion offerings that have been uniquely designed to help you prepare for wholistic ministry within your chosen profession. Studying at Loma Linda University is about more than just careers and professions; it is about mission and purpose for all of life. The School of Religion is pleased to have an important role in helping to prepare you for the most fulfilling life and career possible. Detailed information about our master's degrees and our new doctoral program in religion is contained in this section of the Catalog. These programs have been designed to specifically equip graduates with skills in clinical ministry, chaplaincy, bioethics, and the integration of religion with both the sciences and health. However, within the framework of our academic programs, we also offer a unique opportunity for LLU students in other professional programs to apply for dual enrollment in either bioethics or clinical ministry. Students enrolled in dentistry (D.D.S.), marital and family therapy (M.S.), medicine (M.D.), nursing (M.S.), psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.), and social policy and social research (M.A.) are eligible to apply for admission to the master's degree in either theBioethics or Clinical Ministry program. Please refer to The Combined Degrees Programs of the University section to learn more about our dual enrollment degree programs. On behalf of the faculty and staff of the School of Religion, let me personally invite you to seriously consider the courses and the programs that we offer. We can help strengthen your faith; broaden your spiritual and academic horizons; enhance your ability to serve; and prepare you not only for this life, but also for eternity. May God enrich your studies, Jon Paulien, Ph.D. Dean, School of Religion 438 School of Religion School foundations History In the configuration of Loma Linda University as a health sciences university, the role of religion as integrative in each of the programs of the University is mandated and continuously affirmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Humanity's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3. To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal involvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice.

Taylor, Jr. Louis Venden Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) admissions requirements, the applicant must also complete the following requirements: A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to theLoma Linda University 2017-2018 439 School of Religion. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. See admission requirements for individual program in this CATALOG for G.P.A. requirements. A personal interview is desirable and should be arranged with the director of the program in which the student wishes to study. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be removed while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance into the program. Application deadlines The School of Religion has a rolling admission policy for some programs in which completed applications are reviewed and students are accepted on a continual basis. Applications must be completed by the deadlines listed for the program in which the student wishes to enroll: Master of Arts in Bioethics and Master of Arts in Religion and Science Autumn Quarter: August 1 \u2014 Early Admissions for Autumn: May 1 Spring Quarter: February 15 \u2014 Early Admissions for Spring: Nov. 1 Masters of Science in Chaplaincy and Doctor of Science in Religion and Health Autumn Quarter: August 1 \u2014 Early Admissions for Autumn: May 1 General regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Academic probation Degree students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Students who are on academic probation and fail to earn a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have an overall G.P.A. of 3.0 after two quarters, jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program and may be dismissed from school. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Religion program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exception to this are the combined degrees programs, discussed at the end of Section III of this CATALOG. Financial information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean.Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installments are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. On- and off-campus student housing Students may go to <llu.edu/central/housing> for housing information and a housing application form.

Transfer credits Students are permitted to transfer up to 8 units of approved graduate- level courses from other accredited institutions into the Bioethics Program. Special features RELE 598 Master's Seminar I : This capstone seminar reflects on previous class work and involves integration of conceptual presuppositions, ethical theories, and ethical principles. Mastery of a broad knowledge of the field through an examination will be assessed by the bioethics faculty. (All program faculty and students are invited to attend sessions they choose from these two seminars.) RELE 599 Master's Seminar II : Each student enters class with a research paper, likely prepared in an earlier course. With collegial critique, these papers are prepared for publication and submitted to at least one peer- review journal. Papers demonstrate the ability to identify an issue, analyze it, use relevant literature, and creatively conceptualize or even advance the discussion. Professional students are encouraged to write for their professional publications, adopting relevant size and editorial considerations. Paper(s) will total 20-25 pages. Certificate The Bioethics Program certificate is designed to provide basic competence in bioethics to a health-care professional. It consists of 28 units of academic credit: three core bioethics courses (RELE 524 Bioethics and Society, RELE 588 Explorers of the Moral Life , and RELE 589 Biblical Ethics) ; plus electives taken from bioethics course offerings. A student can take a clinical track by including RELE 545 Bioethics Case Conference I , RELE 554 Clinical Ethics Practicum I , and RELE 555 Clinical Ethics Practicum II . The certificate can be completed in two-to-three quarters of full-time study. Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) and School of Religion (p. 438) admissions requirements, the applicant must also complete the following requirements: Typically, applicants will meet the following criteria for admission: 1. Minimal GRE percentile scores of 60 (verbal), 60 (analytical writing), and 35 (quantitative).

Program director Angela Li The program leading to the Master of Science in Chaplaincy degree (M.S.Chap.) prepares the student to enter the pastoral field as a professional chaplain through demonstrating competence in four core areas: 1. Theory of pastoral care competencies (integration of theological, psychological, and sociological perspectives into the practice). 2. Identity and conduct competencies (formation of pastoral identity within the clinical context, including integration of professional ethics in daily practice). 3. Pastoral competencies (provision of effective pastoral care using appropriate pastoral, spiritual, and theological resources). 4. Professional competencies (integration of pastoral/spiritual care into the life and service of the institution in which it resides, while establishing and maintaining professionalism within the interdisciplinary relationships). This degree offers academic and clinical training to aspiring scholars and practitioners. It is designed to educate students according to the standards for associate certification with the Association of Professional Chaplains (APC). Professional certification is granted by APC and other such agencies. Students interested in board certification with APC may require additional academic credits to qualify and are encouraged to pursue the doctoral degree in religion and health offered by the School of Religion. NOTE: The APC certifies chaplains from diverse religious traditions. Eligibility for chaplaincy certification from APC or other certification agencies generally requires an endorsement from the student's own religious tradition. Current or future endorsement, commissioning, ordination, or comparable professional standing to function in a ministry of pastoral care is granted through membership of an appropriate religious authority and according to the standard practice and policy of that authority. Students are strongly advised to contact their own religious denomination to determine requirements. Loma Linda University Medical Center, under the auspices of the Department of Chaplain Services, is a Clinical Pastoral Education Center that is accredited by the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc. (ACPE).

The remainder of the Portfolio is due at the completion of the course work and must be completed prior to exams. Dissertation Students are required to register for RELG 699 Dissertation Research. To fulfill the requirement for this course, students will select one of the options for dissertations as outlined by LLU. The dissertation is scheduled after successfully defending the proposal. Normal time to complete the program 4 years (16 quarters) based on less than full-time enrollment Religion and Society \u2014 M.A. Program director Zane Yi Drawing upon the entire faculty of the School of Religion, plus professors in other LLU schools and nearby universities on a case-by-case basis, this degree integrates with different specialties the serious study of religion\u2014one of the most powerful forces for both good and evil today. Taking courses and seminars in religion, as well as other disciplines, each student develops\u2014with the assistance of a mentor\u2014an individualized program that meets his or her own distinctive interests and goals. This program is not designed to prepare persons to become ordained Christian ministers. Rather, it hopes to enrich knowledge about religion, and enhance skills in dealing with such. Mentors As soon as possible, but in every case before the student has completed half of the program, the program's administrative committee will link the student to a mentor who will provide support and guidance. Until then, the program director will mentor the student.Learning outcomes Upon the successful completion of this program, each student will be able to: 1. Analyze the prominent features of the most influential religions in the world today. 2. Assess how effective Christianity was in its interactions with society in one of its major historical periods. 3. Describe the ways human beings have organized their societies over the centuries. 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of one past or present major human society in meeting human needs and protecting its environment. 5. Appraise the variety of ways religions and societies typically interact. 6. Critique interpretations of how religion and society interacted in one major episode that made a lasting difference. Periodic review In addition, each student's achievements will be assessed every 12 units to determine the advisability of his or her continuing in the program. Prerequisites There are no prerequisites for this program; however, those who enter having taken few or no courses in religion will have to structure their program considering the requirements. The opposite will be true for those who enter the program after having extensively studied religion but not the other subject(s) they desire to explore. Core courses Four of this program's twelve courses are required: RELT 501, 502, 503; and RELG 696. The religion science cluster\u2014 RELT 501 Religion and Society , RELT 502 Religion and Society , and RELT 503 Religion and Society\u2014which may be taken in any sequence, provides intensive introductions to the field as a whole. One course is offered each quarter during the academic school year, and a course may be offered also in the summer. The fourth required course is the Final Project ( RELG 696 Project ). These four 4-unit courses, totaling 16 units, constitute one-third of the program. The remaining eight courses, totaling 32 units and two- thirds of the program, are selected by the student and approved by the administrative committee. Transfer credits Students are permitted to transfer up to 8 units of approved graduate- level courses from other accredited institutions into the Religion and Society Program. Admissions In addition to Loma Linda University (p. 24) and School of Religion (p. 438) admissions requirements, the applicants to the M.A. in Religion and Society Program are expected to present/complete: 1. A bachelors degree from an accredited institution. 2. An overall undergraduate Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) of at least 3.25. 3. Acceptable scores in an approved standardized test such as the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), Medical School Admissions Test (MCAT) or Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).448 Religion and Society \u2014 M.A. 4. A brief essay (1,000 words) that specifies how this degree would benefit the applicant personally and professionally. 5. An interview. 6. Two Letters of Recommendation from previous teachers. In addition to these considerations, acceptance into this program depends upon whether, at the time the student wishes to study, the School of Religion's resources and his or her interests and goals overlap enough to make it a mutually beneficial experience Provisional Admission A student who seems promising even though he or she does not meet one or more of the admission requirements might be given a Provisional Acceptance for up to 12 units after which the administrative committee will determine whether or not he or she will be permitted to continue. Program requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts in Religion and Society, the student will complete a minimum of 48 units of course work as herein specified, with an overall grade point average of B+ or better, and no course lower than a B in a core course. Required RELT 501 Religion and Society 3 RELT 502 Religion and Society 3 RELT 503 Religion and Society 3 RELG 696 Project 4 Individual area of emphasis Minimum of 32 units that focus on a single topic, case, theme, era, or text: Selected from the School of Religion 19 Selected from the School of Religion or another school on campus 16 Total Units 48 Areas of Emphasis These are approved clusters of courses that focus on a single topic, case, theme, era, problem, debate or text. At least 19 of these units must be taken from the School of Religion. The other 16 units may be taken either at the School of Religion or elsewhere on campus. Illustrative areas of emphasis These are representative of the kinds of individualized programs that students and their mentors may formulate. Public Policy Health Ecology Behavioral Sciences Natural Sciences Nursing Scripture Theology Inquires about other possibilities are encouraged. Individualized program proposal Before completing half of the program (24 units), with the mentor, the student will submit for approval to the administrative committee an Individualized Program. This will detail courses and other experience thatwill fulfill the degree's requirements as well as establish the acceptable area of emphasis and make original contribution. Noncourse requirements Student portfolio This noncourse requirement assesses the student's progress and contains all the items from the entire program which the student submitted and received back after being Integration papers At the conclusion of each course, students write a brief (3 - 5 pages) Integration Paper that will summarize and appraise how it interacted with at least two of the University Student Learning Outcomes and at least two of the Program Learning Outcomes. At the conclusion of their studies, students write a longer (10 - 15 pages) Integration Paper that does the same thing for the program as a whole. The integration papers will be part of the student portfolio. Comprehensive examination Successful performance on this test establishes that the student is qualified to complete their Final Project. It is passed to the administrative committee's satisfaction before the Final Project is approved. Final project Within the contours of what is appropriate for Master of Arts degrees, the final project is to make an original contribution. It can be a major paper reporting on significant literary, historical, social science, laboratory or field research; however, it can also be a video, program proposal, pilot project or work of art and drama. The project's acceptability is determined by the administrative committee. Normal time to complete the program 1.66 years (6 academic quarters) based on full-time enrollment; part time permitted.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 449 FACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES Executive Director's welcome We are very pleased that you have chosen to continue your education at Loma Linda University in a graduate program coordinated by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The Faculty of Graduate Studies is an organization of scholars, scientists, and educators whose mission is to enhance the quality of research, scholarship, and discovery throughout the University. It cooperates with the eight schools in providing graduate programs that strive to meet the highest academic and intellectual standards. Loma Linda University is a health sciences campus dedicated to creating learning environments that enable students to develop personal wholeness; to train for careers that serve local, national, and international communities; and to accept every person as having equal worth in the sight of God. Its mission is embodied in the Good Samaritan sculptures, a tableau that occupies a central position on the campus. The Faculty of Graduate Studies encourages students to engage in original research and creative study that will expand opportunities for wholeness, service, and mutual respect. You will find vigorous academicprograms among the degrees sponsored by the Faculty, studies that will stretch your mind and that will encourage you to expand the boundaries of knowledge, understand your world, and apply Christian principles to your life and profession. Our faculty and staff are here to assist you as you prepare for a career of creative service. Feel free to contact us by e-mail at <graduatestudies@llu.edu>. Rafael A. Ca\u00f1izales Executive Director, Faculty of Graduate Studies 450 Faculty of Graduate Studies Foundations of graduate study Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958\u2014 the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963, the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School\u2014with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005, the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Since then, the FGS has continued to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the University; promote and encourage independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relate intellectual achievements to the service of humankind. Philosophy In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of humankind. General regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are also outlined in this section. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs (Section II). Application and admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired.Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Some students with an overall grade point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior or other evidence of capability is available. International applicants are not eligible for provisional admission. From master's to Ph.D. degree Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree program. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree program, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is to earn a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree program, an application form should be submitted, along with letters of reference, to the dean(s) of the respective school(s). If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field, and that are of equivalent quality and scope, to his/her doctoral program. Student life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook \u2014which more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies\u2014is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook . Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Academic information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. Financial information Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. General financial practices The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled.

The combined degrees programs provide opportunities for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in humans. For admission to a combined degrees program, students must have a baccalaureate degree and must already be admitted to the schools offering their chosen combined degrees program. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended. The usual degree requirements apply. Interested and qualified students may choose from the combined degrees programs offered by the University. Programs For convenience in locating a combined degrees program, some programs are listed twice\u2014the second time with the program names reversed\u2014e.g., Criminal Justice with Social Work and Social Work with Criminal Justice. Combined degrees programs that must be entered in a specified order are listed only once. For example, a master's degree student in bioethics cannot choose to add pharmacy (Pharm.D.), but a pharmacy student can choose to add the M.A. degree in bioethics. Such programs list the primary degree program first. Bioethics\u2014SR with Psychology\u2014BH M.A./Psy.D. or M.A./Ph (p. 452) .D.

The program This program combines study for the M.A. degree in bioethics (offered by the School of Religion) with either the Psy.D. or Ph.D. degree in psychology (offered by the Department of Psychology of the School of Behavioral Health). The purpose of the combined degrees program is to facilitate more efficient completion of graduate programs in ethics and psychology for the student interested in both areas. Students who complete the program should be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the fields of psychology and of ethics. In order to enter this combined degrees program, students must gain separate acceptance into the M.A. degree in ethics curriculum and to one of the doctoral degrees in psychology. Admission information is available at the School of Behavioral Health. Course requirements Students in this combined degrees program will complete all the requirements for both degrees with greater efficiency by taking a number of courses that fulfill requirements for both degrees. Approval for selective courses should be sought from the student's advisors for both degrees.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 453 M.A. curriculum A total of 48 quarter units is required for the M.A. degree. The following courses constitute the core requirements for students completing the M.A. degree in bioethics when taken with psychology as part of the combined degrees program: Core requirements Core requirements RELE 524 Bioethics and Society 4 RELE 548 Christian Social Ethics 3 RELE 554 Clinical Ethics Practicum I 4 RELE 555 Clinical Ethics Practicum II 4 RELE 577 Theological Ethics 3 RELE 588 Explorers of the Moral Life 3 RELG 504 Research Methods in Religious Studies 4 RELR 584 Culture, Psychology, and Religion 3 PSYC 505 Research Methods in Psychological Science 4 Selectives In addition to the preceding 32 units, students completing the M.A. degree program will choose 14 units of the following:16 RELR 587 Religion and the Social Sciences PSYC 524 History, Systems, and Philosophy of Psychology PSYC 526 Ethics and Legal Issues in Clinical Psychology PSYC 551 Psychobiological Foundations PSYC 564 Foundations of Social and Cultural Psychology PSYC 566 Cultural Psychology PSYC 567 Human Diversity PSYC 575 Foundations of Human Development Total Units 48 Psychology\u2014Ph.D. or Psy.D. curriculum Students completing one of the doctoral curricula in psychology will complete all of the course requirements as listed in the School of Behavioral Health, 2 units of minor concentration, which will be fulfilled by 12 of the selective units listed above. (See Psychology Program for full information.) Clinical Ministry \u2014 M.A. with Marital and Family Therapy \u2014 M.S. Program director, Clinical Ministry Siroj Sorajjakool Program director, Marital and Family Therapy Mary E. Moline Faculty The faculty for the combined degrees Clinical Ministry with Marital and Family Therapy program is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences in the School of Behavioral Health. The program The combined Master of Arts degree in clinical ministry and Master of Science degree in marital and family therapy (MFAM) have many common subject areas, such as the spiritual and clinical emphasis on caring for the whole person. The joining of the two degree curriculaprovides the student with the added Christian clinical counseling skills needed to minister to many spiritual and mental health problems. The marital and family therapy degree also prepares the student for a clinical license. Licensure allows the student in the M.A./M.S. combined degrees program more options for practice, including private practice. The student's ability to provide more services to the community\u2014in addition to the traditional areas of practice, such as hospitals, churches, and schools\u2014is increased. Objectives The combined degrees Clinical Ministry with Marital and Family Therapy program has the following objectives: 1. Students will gain clinical skills related to the field of spiritual care and marriage and family therapy that will enable them to become competent practitioners. 2. Students will learn to integrate theoretical, theological, biblical, and philosophical foundations pertaining to the study of spirituality and marriage and family therapy. 3. Students will be able to identify spiritual issues within the context of marital relations and health care and offer spiritual interventions. 4. Students will be knowledgeable of the legal and ethical standards relevant to the fields of chaplaincy and marital and family therapy and apply their knowledge to their clinical practice. The family clinical ministry track provides the basis for doctoral work in mental health and religious studies. Outstanding students are encouraged to explore possibilities for further studies. Admission Applicants will need to apply and be accepted to both programs separately; and follow their admission requirements in order to qualify for the combined degree. (See the CATALOG for specific instructions). Students can start the combined degrees program either by taking marital and family therapy courses or take clinical ministries courses during their first year. Clinical placements Students who take case presentation in MFAM will be placed in secular sites. Students taking course work in clinical ministries but who are continuing their case presentation in MFAM will be placed in a Christian- oriented site, such as the Christian Counseling Center. Course requirements In order to complete the combined degrees\u2014Master of Arts in clinical ministry with Master of Science in marital and family therapy, the student will complete a minimum of 126 units of course work as specified, with an overall grade average of B or better, with no grade lower than a C and with no grade in a core course lower than a B-.

This biomedical sciences program provides opportunity for well-qualified and motivated students to pursue both a professional and a graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation in the areas of health and human disease. The student who has a baccalaureate degree and obtains the approval of the Biomedical Advisory Committee may enter the combined degrees program and work concurrently toward both degrees. A minimum of six years is required to complete this combined degrees program, offered cooperatively by the School of Dentistry and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. with Anatomy \u2014 M.S., Ph.D. Combined degrees programs allow qualified students to work on combined D.D.S./M.S. or Ph.D. (dentistry with anatomy) degrees. Details are provided in the Dentistry Program descriptions in Section III (p. 198). Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. with Biology or Geology \u2014 M.S. For students selecting a combined degrees program with a Master of Science degree in biology or geology, up to 12 units of credit for basic science courses and up to 6 units of credit for research and/or graduate courses completed as part of the electives of the professional curriculum may be applied toward the master's degree program. For students selecting a combined degrees program with a Doctor of Philosophy degree, up to 30 units of credit for basic science courses and up to 30 units of research and/or graduate courses\u2014but not more than 36 units completed as part of the electives of the professional curriculum\u2014 may be applied to the Doctor of Philosophy degree program. The animal physiology and the statistics requirements are met as part of the professional curriculum. Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. with Biomedical Sciences \u2014 M.S. The D.D.S./M.S. is a combined degrees program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery and the Master of Science degrees. It is open to qualified students of dentistry. A student who is interested in establishing a broader professional base in science or who desires a career in teaching or research may take an interim leave from the School of Dentistry to fulfill the professional degree requirements subsequent to or concurrentLoma Linda University 2017-2018 455 with completing course work and research for the Master of Science degree. Dentistry \u2014 D.D.S. with Bioethics \u2014 M.A. Program director, Bioethics, School of Religion Zdravko Plantak Program coordinators, School of Dentistry Robert Handysides Graham Stacey Faculty The faculty for the combined degrees program in Bioethics with Dentistry is drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Religion and School of Dentistry. Admissions Students are selected through a competitive process led by the School of Dentistry in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. The School of Dentistry academic dean and dean of students recommend students, triggering a streamlined admissions process to the M.A. degree in bioethics curriculum. DAT scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE for dental students. The program The combined degrees Bioethics with Dentistry Program is designed to fit the schedule of D.D.S. degree students. Ethics in dentistry is well- established at Loma Linda University. Loma Linda University's School of Dentistry is one of a select few dental schools in the nation known for expertise in ethical issues. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units. However, the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees reduce the total units required by 12 units in the following manner: 1. The 8 units earned from the following four 2-unit courses in the dental curriculum can be counted for credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) RELR 717 Diversity and the Christian Health Professional , b) DNES 794 Public Health Dentistry , c) RELR 715 Christian Dentist in Community, and d) DNES 851 The Dentist and the Law. In order for these 8 units to be counted toward the M.A. degree, the student must submit a supplemental eight-page paper that integrates the content of these four courses and relates the content to bioethics.These four courses have sufficiently similar content to bioethics that they warrant being applied to both the D.D.S. and the M.A. degree in bioethics, once the supplemental paper is approved. 2. Four (4) units come from the deletion of RELE 734 Christian Ethics for Dentists from the combined degrees student's curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program; and the deletion of a 2-unit religion selective from the dental curriculum, which will now be taken in the bioethics selectives. M.A. degree requirements The following courses from the D.D.S. curriculum will be counted double for the M.A. degree in bioethics once the supplemental papers, noted above, are approved.

Lamberton Faculty The faculty for the combined degrees Bioethics with Medicine Program is drawn from Loma Linda University's School of Religion and School of Medicine. Admissions Students are selected through a competitive process led by the School of Medicine in conjunction with the Bioethics Program. Selection is based upon the standard admission criteria for the M.A. degree in bioethics minus the GRE because the MCAT includes a critical-thinking component.456 Medicine \u2014 M.D. with Biology or Geology \u2014 M.S. The Program An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. However, the M.A./M.D. combined degrees student is able to reduce the total units required by sharing 18 units between the two programs in the following manner. 1. 12 units from three courses in the medical curriculum count as credit toward the M.A. degree in bioethics: a) MDCJ 538 Medical , and c) PRVM 517 Lifestyle and Preventive Medicine. Acceptance of these courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrative, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. The rationale: These three courses in medicine have sufficiently relevant content to bioethics that they academically warrant being applied to the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements. 2. 4 units come from three School of Religion courses: a) RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics , b) RELE 714 Advanced Medical Ethics , and c) the deletion of one RELT course from the medical student's combined degrees curriculum because its content is substantively duplicated in the Bioethics Program. (Students are informed of the combined degrees option at the beginning of their freshman year and are encouraged not to take RELE 704 Medicine and Ethics during Autumn Quarter if they are contemplating the combined degrees program. The School of Medicine's determination about student acceptability for the combined degrees program can be made immediately after Autumn Quarter grades are posted.) M.A. degree requirements The following courses from the M.D. curriculum will be double counted for the M.A. degree in bioethics once the supplemental papers, noted above, are approved.

For students selecting a combined degrees program with a Master of Science degree in biology or geology, up to 12 units of credit for basic science courses and up to 6 units of credit for research and/or graduate courses completed as part of the electives of the professional curriculum may be applied toward the master's degree program. For students selecting a combined degrees program with a Doctor of Philosophy degree, up to 30 units of credit for basic science courses and up to 30 units of research and/or graduate courses\u2014but not more than 36 units completed as part of the electives of the professional curriculum\u2014 may be applied to the Doctor of Philosophy degree program. Animal physiology and statistics requirements are met as part of the professional curriculum. Medicine \u2014 M.D. with Master of Science (M.S.) or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees programs include many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. Students in the combined-degrees program complete the first two years of the standard medical curriculum. This is followed by three or more years of graduate course work and research to qualify for a Ph.D. degree, or at least one year for an M.S. degree, before commencing the last two years of the medical school curriculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Majors in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, or pharmacology are offered. For the M.D./Ph.D. and M.D./M.S. combined-degrees programs, the prerequisites and Graduate Record Examination requirements are similar to those described for the Medical Scientist Program. Biochemistry is also required. Medicine \u2014 M.D. with Medical Scientist \u2014 Ph.D. The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and who want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies (IGBS) graduate programs (anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, pharmacology, and physiology). In the first year, students participate in a scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 457 In the second year, students increase their involvement in individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees may also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two to three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. This program intends that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept a student before he or she is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. For information regarding tuition waivers and scholarships, contact the director of the Medical Scientist Program. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery \u2014 Certificate with Medicine \u2014 M.D. The M.D./OMS program is designed to provide an opportunity for qualified dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized three-year period. Clinical surgical health-care delivery is emphasized. The content of the program conforms to the Standards of the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) and is designed to prepare the surgeon for certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents begin their residency program on the OMS service. They subsequently enter the second-year class at Loma Linda University School of Medicine (with advanced standing). The residents then complete the second, third, and fourth years of medical school. The fourth year of the OMS residency consists of a full postgraduate year of general surgery. The residentcompletes the final two years of the OMS training on the OMS service. During the final year, s/he functions as chief resident. Application process Application for admission should be submitted to the School of Dentistry by October 15 of the year prior to the summer of intended enrollment. The School of Dentistry participates in the Post Doctoral Application Service (PASS). Applicants are recommended to the School of Medicine for consideration in the six-year OMS program. Tuition Students in the OMS program with the School of Medicine are charged tuition and fees for the first two and one-half years of the program; tuition for the remaining years is waived.

HSRT scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE for pharmacy students. The program The M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is designed to fit the schedule of Pharm.D. students. Loma Linda University has been a leader in bioethics education for health-care professionals for nearly half a century. The University's School of Pharmacy places a high premium on moral values and is a pioneer as one of the very few pharmacy schools in the nation to offer a Pharm.D./M.A. combined degrees program. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. But the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student is able to double count 25 units of the needed 48 units as follows: 1. Eight (8) units come from three courses in the pharmacy curriculum that are counted for M.A. degree in bioethics credit: a) RXSA 545 Public Health and Lifestyles , 547 Pharmacy Law , and c) RXSA 751 Social-Behavioral Aspects of Pharmacy Practice . Acceptance of these courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrative, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics.Loma Linda University 2017-2018 459 2.

Purpose of the program The purpose of the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees Bioethics with Social Policy and Social Research Program is to facilitate an integrated and more efficient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interests in both bioethics and social policy. Students who complete this combined degrees program will be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the field of social policy and ethics. Individuals working in the area of social policy must be able to undertake and publish research on social problems. This requires the ability to apply ethical theory to real-world policy scenarios. Graduates will be able to provide leadership to the social policy arena by conducting interdisciplinary research on various issues and agendas that have significant moral implications. Admissions To enter the proposed program, students must gain separate acceptance to both graduate programs. The Social Policy and Social Research Program director recommends students. This recommendation triggers a streamlined admissions process for the M.A. degree in bioethics. Course work requirements If an M.A. degree in bioethics is taken as a stand-alone degree, the requirement is 48 units. However, the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student is able to double count 20 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1. 16 units from four courses in the social policy curriculum count toward the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements because of their similarity to ethics-type courses.

Within this framework, students learn to promote social well-being and build on the strength and resiliency of all human beings through a range ofprevention and intervention practice methods when working with diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. During their second year, students complete a clinical practice specialization along with specialized courses and practicum in forensic behavioral health. Students choosing this area will focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice systems who experience severe mental illness and may also present with co-occurring substance use. Students will gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming. In addition, students will be prepared to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for community treatment. Students gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming within a forensic mental health framework. In addition, this context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the development and implementation of assertive community treatment plans. An integrated practicum and seminar class in criminal justice typically begins in the Summer Quarter of the second year. The combined degrees emphasize a thoughtful reflection about integrated issues in both social work and criminal justice that provides students with a deeper understanding of practice issues affecting the field.
