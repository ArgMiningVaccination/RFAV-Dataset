We hope that therapy will bring us insight, a renewed sense of connection, and resolution to the things we have been struggling with. I strive to be the therapist that I have needed, a guide who could help me navigate my own inner terrain, who could help me make sense of my experiences, learn better ways to cope, to understand and accept myself.

We received training in the skills of active listening, mediation and problem-solving. Little did I know that this experience would lead me to where I am today, as a counselor and therapist for the last twenty-two years.

I help people gain awareness of how and why they have lost access to meaningful parts of themselves, find ways to remove blocks to emotional growth, and move towards a life that feels more connected and alive. This work can be highly effective both with individuals and couples.

Im an attachment-based therapist who first is human. Do you often feel alone in your emotions and private thoughts but worry it might be too much for a partner or family?

What's the difference between a psychologist, a therapist, and a counselor? [Therapists, psychologists, and counselors](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/psychologist-vs-therapist-vs-counselor)are all licensed mental health professionals. In the US, psychologists have earned a doctoral degree. The terms \"therapist\" and \"counselor\" are used somewhat interchangeably, but generally therapists offer longer-term, mental health care, while counselors offer shorter-term care that may focus on one domain, such as marriage, career, or academic challenges. What type of therapist is right for me? Clients should consider factors such as insurance coverage and their primary reason(s) for seeking therapy to determine the type of professional best suited to their needs. Someone struggling with mental health challenges such as depression or anxiety, for example, may wish to seek out a clinical psychologist or therapist, while someone navigating career obstacles or marital upheaval may benefit from seeing a counselor who can offer short-term, targeted support. Is everyone in the Psychology Today Therapy Directory a licensed therapist? The Psychology Today directory lists providers who offer legitimate mental health services to the public, including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and counselors. Many have been licensed by the country or state where they practice; providers whose license or primary credential has been [verified by Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/what-does-verified-by-psychology-today-mean)are signified by a \"Verified\" symbol. Some clinicians or organizations provide services for which their state or country does not offer licenses, such as pastoral counseling. They may be selectively included without the \"Verified\" seal. What type of therapy is right for me? The [type of therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/therapy-types-and-modalities)best suited to a particular individual depends on several factors, including their primary reason for seeking therapy, their preferred timeline (some therapy types last for a set number of sessions, while others are open-ended), and their personality and preferences\u2014some may prefer a more structured approach. For many individuals, multiple types of therapy could provide a good fit. Is online therapy cheaper than in-person therapy? Many therapists charge the same amount for online therapy as they do for in-person therapy\u2014though clients may still find this cost-effective if it cuts down on their transportation costs. Health insurance plans often offer equivalent coverage for online and in-person therapy; indeed, in many places, they are legally required to do so. Text-based or on-demand therapy apps may be cheaper than traditional one-on-one psychotherapy; however, the practice may be less effective and is not likely to be covered by insurance. "}
