At Alternative to Meds Center, we offer a variety of specialized spa services in conjunction with your custom treatment plan, all tailored to help naturally detox the body and heal the mind. Our Holistic Detox and Recovery Spa Services Spa Services include: - Ionic foot baths - Nebulized glutathione treatments - Therapeutic massage treatments - Sauna cleansing - Colon Hydrotherapy Spa Services: Ionic Foot Baths Toxins that have built up within the body and brain can have a number of effects, not the least of which is slowing you down and leaving you feeling exhausted or drained. An ionic foot bath is designed to help remove toxins from the body. Ionic foot baths send a small current through the body that produces positively charged ions. These ions neutralize negatively charged ions in the body, allowing the toxins to leave the body through the bottom of the feet. Footbaths are ideal for individuals who want a powerful cleansing treatment that is approachable and relaxing. In just thirty minutes, you'll be able to see the results of your holistic detox process within the foot tub. This natural remedy for removing harmful toxins from the body may also help reduce cravings for the substances once responsible for toxic buildup. Ionic foot baths are available several times a week in our spa room as a safe, holistic detox service. For more information click to learn how they work to reduce toxicity in the body.

If not impeded, the resulting reactions within the body and brain can contribute to a variety of health issues like inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, anxiety, depression, and addiction. Chemical toxins from what we breathe, eat, or drink can also hamper the brain's ability to regulate itself. Glutathione can boost the actions of other antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and CoQ10 and help the brain restore essential neurotransmitters. Our nebulized glutathione treatment administers this master antioxidant directly to the lungs, helping to restore balance within the body. As an added benefit, this treatment is administered via a vaporizer, eliminating the need for needles while still ensuring glutathione enters the bloodstream quickly. Nebulized Glutathione is offered and encouraged daily in the spa room. It is a master antioxidant and supports detoxification pathways. Find out more about this essential service offered.

Our massage therapists administer precise sequences of movements that stimulate the right area of the body to stress and compress tissue, improve circulation, mobilize lymph, and relieve muscle tension. Massages can also help a person achieve a better level of relaxation that helps to decrease stress, improve sleep, and provide a break from the demands of daily life. Massage is an ideal alternative to pharmaceutical means of combating physical or mental health disorders. For those in addiction recovery, massage can serve as an important conduit for relieving anxiety, depression, and other co-occurring conditions that may have contributed to substance use. We feel it is an important part of the healing process as it aids in mental and physical relaxation while reducing toxins that are stored in our muscles.

Saunas have been used for thousands of years to heal the body and mind. Sauna services can naturally detoxify the body, boost immunity, provide pain relief, and improve cardiovascular health. Sauna detoxification is a great way to naturally remove toxins from the body. Sweat is the body's natural way of purging toxins via the pores on the skin's surface. The advantage of this method is that it bypasses the internal organs and instead uses the skin as a more direct avenue for releasing toxins, thereby reducing the burden on the liver and kidneys. The cornerstone of our holistic detoxification program is our bio-transformative sauna protocol. [Contact us](https://www.alternativetomeds.com/contact/) to find out how we use targeted supplementation and exercise to prime your body for the most effective toxin release. Colon Hydrotherapy Colon purging techniques can help remove toxins from the body. Toxins frequently accumulate within the body, but when the body attempts to eliminate toxins in the natural fashion, they can be re-deposited into the colon. Clearing out your elimination pathways is the best way to enhance the benefits of a full cleansing process. While these treatments can be for anyone looking for a deeper toxin removal treatment, they are ideal for individuals who struggle with heavy chemical dependency. This includes individuals who are prone to environmental allergies, as well as those who have undergone long-term use of prescription medications. It is particularly beneficial for individuals who have used benzodiazepines, as these medications can slow the gut response, increasing the likelihood of constipation and retaining toxins. At Alternative to Meds, we know how important a happy and healthy gut is for mental and overall health. Weekly Colon hydrotherapy removes accumulated waste and effectively helps ease negative symptoms while allowing for better nutrient absorption. Read more to learn about the many benefits of Colon "}
