Queen Sonja of Norway said Americans don't fully appreciate nor understand the importance of a monarchy after her daughter announced she'd given up her royal duties to pursue a life with her American fianc\u00e9. On Tuesday, the Norwegian royal house announced on its official website that [Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise](https://www.insider.com/princess-martha-louise-sexism-norwegian-monarchy-queen-2020-12), 51, would [no longer perform official royal engagements](https://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=216586&sek=113027). The princess, who is the eldest child of King Harald and Queen Sonja, [got engaged](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cef6dOGrc9h) to [Durek Verrett](https://www.insider.com/princess-maertha-louise-durek-verrett-on-being-royal-interracial-couple-2022-6), a shaman from the US, in June. In a separate statement shared on [the official Norwegian royal website](https://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=216587&sek=27287), M\u00e4rtha Louise said that her and Verrett's beliefs in spiritual healing and alternative medicine played a role in why she decided to step back from royal life. However, at a press conference on Tuesday, her mother indicated cultural differences were also at play. According to Hello! magazine, [Sonja, 85, was asked about Verrett's shamanic practices](https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20221108156447/queen-sonja-norway-breaks-silence-princess-martha-louise-americans-have-no-idea/) and said that he didn't understand why his work would affect the image of the royal family. Watch: \"Americans have no idea what a kingdom is. So it's no wonder he doesn't realize,\" Sonja said, according to the publication. \"Americans don't understand the bearing of this here. They don't. He thought he could do whatever he wanted without compromising us at all,\" she added. At the press conference, Harald said his daughter would keep her title, but that he was \"sorry\" to see that she would no longer be representing the royal family. \"She is our daughter and she will continue to be,\" he added. Despite cultural differences and belief systems leading to M\u00e4rtha Louise relinquishing her duties, Sonja and Harald maintained the family remain close to her and Verrett. \"Even if we disagree on things, we are happy with each other,\" Sonja said. \"I have the feeling that the family is now very close to each other in a new, nice way.\" In giving up her royal duties, M\u00e4rtha Louise - who has three children with [her late ex-husband, Ari Behn](https://www.insider.com/princess-martha-louise-of-norway-felt-sorrow-ex-husband-death-2022-1) - will also be giving up her patronages and agreeing not to refer to members of the royal household on her social media channels with Verrett, the announcement detailed. It added that the changes would ensure there is a clear divide between M\u00e4rtha Louise and Verrett's practices, which include crystal healing, acupuncture, yoga, and natural remedies, and the royal household. \"I am aware that many people follow what I do and say very closely,\" the princess said in her announcement. \"My title entails a certain responsibility. It is therefore important to me, including in my business activity, to distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other.\" Representatives for the Norwegian royal household did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
