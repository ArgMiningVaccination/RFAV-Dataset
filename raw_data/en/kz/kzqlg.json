U 13.1. Patient care emphasis - Collectively, APPEs emphasize continuity of care and incorporate acute, chronic, and wellness-promoting patient -care services in outpatient (community/ambulatory care) and inpatient (hospital/health system) settings. 13.2. Diverse populations - In the aggregate, APPEs expose students to diverse patient populations as related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors (e.g., rural/urban, poverty/affluence), and disease states) 13.3. Interprofessional experiences - In the aggregate, students gain in -depth experience in delivering direct patient care as part of an interprofessional team. 13.4. APPE duration - The curriculum includes no less than 36 weeks (1440 hours) of APPE. All student s are exposed to a minimum of 160 hours in each required APPE area. The majority of APPE is focused on direct patient care. 13.5. Timing - APPEs follow successful completion of all IPPE and required didactic curricular content. Required capstone courses or activities that provide opportunity for additional professional growth and insight are allowed during or after completion of APPEs. These activities do not compromise the quality of the APPEs, nor count toward the required 1440 hours of APPE. 13.6. Required APPE - Required APPEs occur in four practice settings: (1) community pharmacy; (2) ambulatory patient care; (3) hospital/health system pharmacy; and (4) inpatient general medicine patient care. 13.7. Elective APPE - Elective APPEs are structured to give students the opportunity to: (1) mature professionally, (2) secure the breadth and depth of experiences needed to achieve the Educational Outcomes articulated in Standards 1 -4, and (3) explore various sectors of practi ce. 13.8. Geographic restrictions - Required APPEs are completed in the United States or its territories or possessions. All quality assurance expectations for U.S. -based experiential education courses apply to elective APPEs offered outside of the U.S. 3 2) College or School's Comments on the Standard: The college or school's descriptive text and supporting evidence should specifically address the following.

PHRM 581-589 consist of nine five - week rotations, each of which is 200 hours. Students are responsible for completing eight of the nine blocks for a total of 1600 APPE hours. Five of the eight rotations are required rotations; Inpatient General Med/Acute C are, Ambulatory Care, Community, Institutional and the NDSU required Rural rotation. The remaining three rotations are \"Elective\" rotations. Elective rotations are defined as a second \"required\" rotation or any pharmacy -related experience that will provide opportunities for students to develop professional skills and individual interests ( Appendix 13A ). For the current rotation year (2019-2020) NDSU engaged 320 unique APPE rotation sites w ith 392 APPE preceptors provid ing 2380 APPE rotation blocks in both r equired and elective rotations. All required rotations are completed in the United States and are precepted by licensed pharmacists. Additional information on preceptors can be found in the documentation for Standard 20. To ensure that all students have equal access to the same rotation opportunities, and to ensure that students match with required rotation types , the eV alue electronic rotation management system is used. This matching process takes place between the f all and s pring semesters. Students self -select sites and indicate the order of their preferred APPE rotations and the e Value system utilizes an algorithm -based optimization process to place students. The APPE Director advises all students on rotation choices throughout the f all semester by providing input on which sites will help students meet their professional and career goals. Match statistics for rotation year 2019-2020 resulted in 91% of all rotations in the student's top three choices. The effectiveness of the matching system and site recruitment process is also seen in the results of the 2019 AACP Graduating Student Survey with 94.2% of students agree/ strongly agree that the available pharmacy practice experience electives met their needs . Course syllabi with learning objectives, ass ignments , and preceptor responsibilities are specific for each required rotation, Patient Care elective, Non-patient Care elective , and Rural rotation (Appendix 13B). General learning objectives are developed by the APPE Director in conjunction with the Experiential Education Committee, mapped to the PharmD Ability Based Outcomes (ABOs) , and given final approval by the Experiential Education Committee. This c ommittee includes experiential education directors and staff, faculty members, and practicing pharmacists. Th e Committee routinely reviews and revises all APPE rotation objectives, rotation activities, rotation assignments and evaluation criteria to ensure optimal student learning in experiential education that integrates with the didactic curriculum. To ensure appropriate rigor for the Advanced Community and Advanced Institutional rotations, criteria to differentiate introductory and advanced practice experiences were developed ( Appendices 13C -D). The criteria are used to differentiate student education level and skill sets necessary to be successful in all experiential introductory and advanced Community and Institutional experience activities. This do cument was developed in conjunction with the Experiential Education Committee and additional practicing pharmacists and is reviewed and updated every 3 years using feedback from the C ommittee and additional preceptors as part of the quality assurance proce ss 5 Site Evaluation and Quality Improvement The SOP follows a quality assurance process when recruiting new rotation sites ( Appendix 13 E). Sites must meet all of NDSUs quality assurance requirements in order to accept student for rotations. The effectiveness of this process is evidenced by 2019 Graduating Student Survey response s where 100% of students agree/strongly agree that their APPEs were of high quality. Additional information on rotation site recruitment can be found in documentation for Standard 22. Affiliation agreements between the SOP and practice sites are sent at the time a new site is approved and reminder emails are generated when an agreement is expiring within 6 months. Status updates on the agreements in process are tracked by the Experiential Education Office . Affiliation a greements are reviewed by the Contract Manager, Experiential Coordinator, Director of Experiential Outreach and Assessment and other Experiential Directors as needed. Agreements are given a final signature b y the Dean of the College. All active rotations sites have a signed affiliation agreement on file. Additional information on site evaluation, quality improvement and affiliation agreements can be found in Standard 22. Preceptor Development The School app lies quality criteria to preceptor recruitment with an application form to formalize the recruitment process and assist in the recruitment of quality pharmacy preceptors (Appendix 13 F). Prior to accepting students, preceptors are oriented to the School's M ission, Vision, and V alues, the specific learning expectations outlined in the syllabus, and delivering effective performance evaluations. Preceptors have online access to the Preceptor Handbook ( Appendix 13 G) which includes the school's curriculum and teaching methods, guidance regarding assessment of student's previous knowledge and experiences applicable to the rotation's objectives, information on who to contact for serious student problems or unprofessional behavior and review of the performance assess ment and grading systems and policies to address misconduct. Preceptors are offered a variety of development opportunities. Opportunities include free CE or recertification modules through the Collaborative Education Institute (CEI), \" From the Schoolhous e\" series which is of fered live or on demand, SOP sponsored 4 hour research seminar, SOP sponsored full-day teaching seminar, continuing education presented at the annual State Convention, and other topics developed by the Experiential Education Outreach and Assessm ent Director. Students are also utilized to deliver targeted preceptor education topics to active preceptors. For 2019 - 2020, APPE students were charged with providing education on the P harmacists Patient Care Process to one or more of their pr eceptors (Appendix 13 H). For future years, a menu of a variety of educational options is planned for preceptors to choose from. The SOP will ensure students are trained to deliver the education from the menu and provide teaching and learning resources . This process will be used to augment current educational offerings available to NDSU preceptors. Additional information regarding preceptor development and quality assurance can be found in Standard 20 . Direct Patient Care Focus APPE students are allowed a maximum of two non -patient care rotations. All other rotations must have a direct patient care focus. Students document a portion of their patient care activities by entering 20 case l ogs into a rotation management system (minimum of 100 patient care case logs annually per student). Logs 6 include disease states, patient demographics, drug related problems, interventions and other healthcare interactions ( Appendi ces 13I-N). Patient care case logs are reviewed in aggregate biannuall y by the APPE Director and the Experiential Education Committee to ensure that interactions and interventions are high quality. Student exposure to d iverse patient s and disease state s is supported by the 2019 G raduating Student S urvey responses with 100% of students strongly agree/agree that they had direct interaction with diverse patient populations. The extent of direct patient care is further evidenced by the 2019 Graduating S tudent Survey where 98.5% of students strongly agree/agree they were able to engage in direct patient care in the community setting; 98.6% strongly agree/agree in the ambulatory care setting, 97.1% strongly agree/ agree in the hospital setting, and 98.5% strongly agree/agree in the inpatient general med setting. An additional indicator of a well-rounded APPE experience is evidenced by the degree that continuity of care is stressed during the APPE year. In 2019, 98.5% of students strongly agree/ agree that continuity of care was emphasized during the APPE year. Interprofessional Experiences Case logs (20 logs/student/patient care rotation) are also reviewed in aggregate biannually by the APPE Director and the Experiential Education Committee to ensure that a significant number of entries include interprofessional interactions with medical providers and medical provider students. Case Log data for rotation year 2018-2019 details that 100% of students interacted with a medical provider and nearly 50% interacted with a t least 1 medical provider student . 7 In addition to the above mentioned required rotation activities, students also complete a minimum of 10 Interprofessional Education (IPE) activities during the APPE rotation year, a minimum of 1 IPE activity per required rotation ( Appendix 13 O). The effec tiveness of the APPE curriculum to foster interprofessional interaction is evidenced by the 2019 Graduating S tudent Survey where 100% of students strongly agree/agree that their practice experiences allowed them to collaborate with other healthcare profess ionals. Student Performance Assessment Student performance is assessed on multiple measures using an Ability -Based Outcomes (ABOs) evaluation (used prior to academic year 2019) and most recently, an E ntrustable Professional Activity (EPA) evaluation tool (Appendices 13P-Q). The new EPA evaluation was implemented in May of 2019 and is being carefully monitored to ensure that appropriate data and feedback is being collected and it appropriately reflects student abilities. This evaluation is auto generated at the mid-point and conclusion of the rotation. The benchmark is Level 3: \"I trust the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited correction or feedback\". Professionalism questions are scored as yes/no/needs improvement on the mid -term evaluation and yes/no on the final evaluation. The benchmark for these questions is 'yes'. Student performance on rotation is also documented in to an electronic portfolio in eValue . Portfolios are used to encourage and foster the practice of continuing professional development as students self -assess learning needs , write student specific learning objectives, and reflect upon their practice experiences and progress toward accomplishment of their individualized goal s. Assignments specific to APPE rotation type are completed and also uploaded in to their por tfolio (Appendix 13 R). Additional rotation requirements assessed by preceptors include 20 Case Logs per patient care rotation, journal clubs, drug information questions and any other preceptor assigned activities. Portfolio components are reviewed and students given formative feedback from the APPE Director ( Appendix 13 S), followed by a summative assessment by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for those students seeking licensure in North Dakota. Experiential Directors are notified electronically when a student does not reach the benchmark on both the mid-point and/or final evaluation. Students not meeting the benchma rk on the midterm evaluation are contacted by the APPE Director for the reason(s) why the score was received and how the student plans to improve upon the low score. Students not meeting the benchmark on one item will remediate to ensure competency in the skill where the low score was received. Students not meeting the benchmark on two or more items will fail the rotation and will repeat the course ( Appendix 13 T). During the 2018 -2019 rotation year, 5 students were successfully remediated and 2 students suc cessfully repeated courses. Students not meeting the benchmark on professionalism questions on the final evaluation will be required to complete additional tasks to ensure competency in the prof essionalism domain . A report of APPE student performance is reviewed by the Experiential Education Committee as a standing agenda item and provided to the Senior Associate Dean and the Assessment Committee annually. Rotation failures are reported to the Senior Associate Dean at the time of incident. Preceptor / Si te Evaluation Preceptors and sites are evaluated by each student in an anonymous fashion using an 5 -point Likert Scale Instrument (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree) that was initially developed in collaboration with other Distric t V schools, but has since had minor adaptations ( Appendix 13 U). This process does not influence the grading of either student or preceptor. Experiential Directors are notified 8 electronically of low preceptor/site scores (defined as disagree or strongly disagree) on the evaluation of preceptor/site. Low scores are monitored by the Experiential Education Office, with follow -up by the Director of Experiential Outreach and Assessment. Follow -up with the preceptor can be through one or more means: review of pr evious evaluations, consultation with student, and consultation with other Director(s), follow -up phone calls and/or site visits. If upon follow -up it is deemed necessary, preceptors/sites may be removed from the active preceptor/site list. Ongoing assess ment of rotation sites is provided by the Director of Experiential Outreach Assessment. Feedback for the purpose of improvement, is provided directly to the preceptor. Additional information on site quality improvement can be found in Standard 22. Notable achievements, innovations or quality improvements Increased quality and quantity of IPE focused activities during the APPE year. Implementation of an Entrustable Professional Activity based preceptor evaluation of student for APPE, IPE activity assignment . Implementation of a preceptor education model utilizing APPE students. The School of Pharmacy and UND School of Medicine collaborate to match medical students and pharmacy students while on rural rotations , when possible. Other disciplines are invited to participate as identified on site. Students are instructed to id entify a shared patient and to work up the patient as they have been taught. Students then compare and contrast their results and debrief with faculty at NDSU and UND. Follow up su rveys indicate that these students see value in this experience. 3) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance.

They reflect the abilities of the students as a result of completion of the curriculum as a who le, rather than completion of a single course or course sequence. Additional information on Program -level Ability -Based Outcomes can be found at: https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/pharmacy/AbilityBasedOutcomes1.pdf 5 NDSU Experiential Education Website -value.net Experiential General University Policies NDSU is committed to following the General Policies detailed in the NDSU Bulletin relating to Student Behavior, Privacy of Student Records, Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, Consensual Relationships, Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs, and Campus Security. If you have questions/concerns regarding these matters, contact the Associate Director for Student Rights and Responsibilities. NDSU Academic Honesty Statement All work in this course must be completed in a manner consistent with NDSU Un iversity Senate Policy, Section 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct. You can find this policy at: http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/335.pdf . Violating this code will result in a penalty or penalties to be determined by the instructor depending on the seriousness and circumstances of the offense. The instructor may: (1) fail the student for the particular assignment or test; or (2) give the student a failing grade. Students are res ponsible for completing and submitting their own work. Such actions may include dismissal, which is a suspension from NDSU for a specific period of time, or expulsion from NDSU, which carries no expectation of return at a later date. Academic dishonesty, i n any form, is inconsistent with an academic community that operates on the basis of honesty, integrity and fair play. If questions arise, students are encouraged to consult with the instructor. Rotation Schedule Information Where to Locate Rotation Schedules & Rotation Change Requests Students can view their rotation schedules in e*value at any time by logging into e*value Schedules -Schedule Report. Students needing a rotation change must request changes no less than 10 weeks prior to the start date of the rotation needing to be changed. Please utilize the Rotation Change Request Form which can be found in BlackBoard or in e*value under the Documents section. The APPE Director may deny a rotation change request if the change is not in the best inte rest of the student , School or rotation site . If a student is unable to complete a rotation at a distant site due to illness or other emergency, the 10 week requirement may be waived. 6 If a student fails a rotation, the APPE Director reserves the right to r eschedule the failed rotation, and any other rotations located outside of the Fargo area, to a rotation site that will best fit the student's academic needs. For additional information regarding rotation grading, ple ase refer to the section on grading proc esses at the end of this handbook. Rotation Timeline Two weeks prior to Rotation: Contact your preceptor, via email, two weeks before the start date of the rotation. It is extremely important that this rule is followed. Do not wait until the Thursday or Friday before the rotation begins. If a rotation site is no longer able to accomm odate your rotation, the Experiential Office needs time to locate an alternate site. If no alternate site is available, the rotation in question may be cancelled resulting in a delayed graduation date. For Rotation 7, initiate contact in mid -December. M any preceptors take vacations over the holidays. Sending an early email will give the preceptor time to respond to your email and answer your questions in a timely manner. Review relevant course materials and objectives for the rotation. Review directi ons to the rotation site so that your arrival on day one is punctual. Remember that your email and first day are your preceptor's first impressions of you. Day One of Rotation: Be punctual! If you are going to be late, be sure to call your preceptor as soon as possible so that they are aware of your tardy arrival. Be truthful with your reason for being late. Have your rotation folder with you. This folder should contain everyth ing your preceptor may need. Review individual student objectives for the rotations and discuss the preceptor's expectation of students. Discuss any personal or professional leave days occurring during the rotation. Notify Mark Lofgren if a different preceptor is assigned for your rotation. Adjustments will be made in E*value so the appropriate preceptor receives the evaluations. All Experiential documents are available on BlackBoard or in e*value should your preceptor ask about a docu ment that you do not have in your rotation folder. Rotation Mid -Point: Preceptors will automatically receive the mid -term evaluation of the student . If possible, respectfully ask your preceptor to schedule a time to sit down to discuss your performance during the first half of the rotation. Unless you receive all \" 4 or 5\"s, ask the preceptor for suggested improvements for your performance. Be sure to take notes and begin to make adjustments right away . Be gracious in accepting constructive criticism. This is one example of how professional growth happens. Contact the preceptor for your next rotation. Last Day of the Rotation: Respectfully ask your preceptor to schedule a time to sit down to discuss your performance during the final half of the rotation. Ask for additional feedback on your progress with constructive criticism from the mid -point evaluation. 7 Thank your preceptor and any other pharmacists, technicians or support staff who have worked with you during the rotation. Leave a thank you note as well. Treats are a nice touch (and memorable!) but, are not required. Complete the Evaluation of Prece ptor and Site within s even days of end of the rotation. Upload the Evaluation of Preceptor and Site as well as portfolio assignments within seven days of the end of the rotation . Rotation Hours Students are required to actively engage in rotation activities for a minimum of 40 hours per week. Accreditation Standards mandate that no more than 45 hours on site will be acknowledged. o Rotation hours are at the discretion of the preceptor and may be 'normal' business hours, evening hours, night hours or weekend hours. o Students may be expected to arrive at the rotation site early to work up patients before patient rounds. (Remember, patient care is the priority.) o Time spent on homework activities is to be expected and is not included in the 40 hour requirement. If a student is unable to attend the rotation for any reason, the student must contact the preceptor as soon as possible. Be punctual! Three \"professional days\" will be allowed during the rot ation year for any student wishing to attend a professional meeting/conference. Students must inform the APPE Director that they will be attending a conference and provide proof of registration . Rotation 6 spans 6 weeks to allow students to attend midyear . Students will work with their preceptors to determine which 5 weeks of the 6 week block will be completed. Outside Employment & Coursework While On Rotations Students may accept employment not related to rotation experiences provided that such employme nt does not interfere with APPE rotations. Students should critically assess the amount of additional non -APPE hours they are physically able to complete while maintaining patient safety as well as successful completion of rotations as the primary priority of the APPE year. Students too fatigued to safely care for their patients will be removed from the rotation. Students may enroll in a maximum of 3 credits of outside coursework during the rotation year, provided that these courses are offered in the evening or online and do not interfere with APPE rotations. APPE rotations take priority. Inclement Weather Conditions Students located in the Fargo -Moorhead area are not expected to report to Experiential Education sites if classes at NDSU have been ca ncelled due to inclement weather conditions or weather conditions are such that a student could not travel safely to and from the practice site. Students located outside the F argo area shall follow the local public school policy, and in case of closure shall contact their preceptor directly for instructions. Students who miss rotation hours due to inclement weather should work with their preceptors and the APPE Director to make up lost time. 8 Rotation Calendar & Holidays APPE Rotation Schedule North Dakota State University 2019/2020 The Pharm.D fourth year will begin on May 2 0, 201 9 at 8:00 am and will end on April 2 4, 2020 at 5:00 pm.

Immunization s Students ar e required to be current on all immunizations specified by the School or institution, prior to beginning rotations. APPE students are required to receive an influenza vaccination prior to the beginning of Rotation 5. Documentation must be received by the Experiential Education Office prior to the beginning of Rotation 5. Students who wish to decline this vaccination must contact the APPE Director. Students are required to provide documentation of two TB skin tests over a period of 1 -3 weeks (minimum of 7 days apart) within 3 months of the start of an institutional -based rotation. Some sites require a one -step TB test within 3 months of a hospital -based rotation. This requirement may result in a student having one o r more TB tests during their P4 year of rotations. If a student has a positive TB skin test, the student may have been immunized in the past, received treatment, or have been recently exposed. In these situations: Students must provide annual proof of a negative chest x -ray (baseline or subsequent chest x -ray taken after the initial positive skin test is acceptable) OR a Quantiferon blood test verifying that the student is clear of TB disease. If either the x -ray or the Quantiferon test is positive, the provider would then discuss treatment with Isoniazid (INH). o For those students who have been treated with Isoniazid (INH); the student will be considered cleared, as the Latent TB would have been treated. These students will still need to be tested on an annual basis. o If the affected student leaves the USA and returns to a high -risk country for over 30 days within the past 5 years, the student will retest as there is a chance of re - exposure. o If the affected student does not leave the USA, the student may s chedule an appointment with a provider to discuss the possibility of a letter stating that the student has been treated and is clear of TB disease. CPR All students are required to have and maintain CPR certification throughout the professional program. Proof of Basic Life Support (BLS) CPR certification will be submitted during the P1 year and maintained throughout the professional program. Drug Screening Students may be required to obtain one or more negative drug screens prior to a rotation. Student s for whom this applies will be contacted by the Experiential Education Office. 15 Blood or Body Fluid Exposure In the event of a student being exposed to a patient's blood or other body fluid, the student should immediately follow these steps: Wash needle s ticks and cuts with soap and water. Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water. Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants. Report the incident to your preceptor and the NDSU Experiential Education Office. Immediately seek medical evaluation and treatment for the exposure. For further information about blood or body fluid exposure, visit the CDC website at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html . Rotation Reimbursement Students will not be assigned to any rotation site where the student has previously worked for a salary. An exception may be made for students who will work in a different capacity than as a paid intern. For example, a Sanford Inpa tient Intern may be eligible to complete a Critical Care rotation at Sanford. Students will not request or accept pay or remuneration. With the prior approval of the APPE Director, students may accept reimbursement for room, board and/or commuting costs. Grading Preceptors are evaluated by the student(s) scheduled with them for rotation. Once a preceptor has had three students the preceptor is able to view their evaluation scores in aggregate. Student evaluation of preceptors is anonymous. Students a re evaluated by the preceptor on record for each rotation. APPEs are graded as Pass/Fail. The mid -term evaluation is generated during the second week of each rotation. Preceptors are encouraged to schedule time to discuss this checkpoint of the rotation . The final evaluation is generated during the fourth week of the rotation. Preceptors are encouraged to schedule time to discuss the evaluation prior to completing the Final Evaluation . Students are expected to score a Level 3 of e ntrustment on all EPA evaluation questions. Level 3 of entrustment states that the preceptor trusts the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited correction or feedback. Students are expected to score \"yes\" on all Professionalism (ABO 4) evaluation questions. For information on scores of Level 1 or Level 2 entrustment, please refer to the Remediation section below. 16 Remediation Policy Preceptors complete two evaluations of a student for each rotation; a mid -term evaluation and a final e valuation. The mid -term evaluation will serve as a checkpoint for students; identifying areas for improvement. If a student fails an APPE rotation or is unable to successfully complete an APPE rotation, for any reason other than a health -related situation , a failing grade will be entered into the grade book along with a new, expected rotation completion date. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. Exceptions may be made and will be determined on a case -by-case basis. Students with a do cumented health -related situation that prevents the successful completion of an APPE rotation will be given an incomplete grade and will be assigned a new, expected completion date. If the expected completion date is missed, the incomplete grade will defau lt to a failing grade. During any APPE rotation, if a student puts patients, preceptors or the practice at risk or demonstrates unprofessional behavior, the student may be immediately dismissed from the rotation and given a failing grade for that rotation . A failing grade will be entered into the gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. Failed rotations may not be made up in the same semester or over the winter break. Remed iation Process for students not meeting professionalism expectations: APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on Personal and Professional Development. Students are expected to score \"yes\" on all final evaluation professionalism questions. APPE student s demonstrating a lack of professionalism that results in an answer of \"no\" on professionalism -related questions appearing on the final evaluation will be required to successfully complete a rigorous Remediation Plan through the Office of Experiential Educ ation prior to Graduation. An Incomplete grade may be entered into the gradebook along with an expected completion date. Students will not graduate until the Remediation Plan has been successfully completed. APPE students entering into Remediation throu gh the Office of Experiential Education for professionalism reasons will be required, at a minimum, to create, and follow, an acceptable Action Plan detailing steps to improve performance in the area of Personal and Professional Development ( ABO 4). Action Plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the Experiential Education Directors. Additionally, the approved Action Plan will be shared with the student's next two preceptors and follow up with these preceptors regarding the student's pe rformance on rotation will occur over the next two rotations unless Remediatio n is occurring during Rotation 8 or Rotation 9. If, however, during subsequent rotations, the student receives a final evaluation score of \"no\" on the same professionalism -related question(s) as already received on a previous evaluation, the current rotation will be considered a failed rotation. A failing grade will be entered into the 17 gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date. Students will not receive cred it for failed rotation hours. See Remediation Process resulting from multiple scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment for further details on failed rotations. Remediation Process resulting from failure to meet Level 3 of entrustment on any single EPA evaluation question: APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on a series of Entrustable Professional Activities questions. Students are expected to meet Level 3 of entrustment on all EPA questions. Level 3 entrustment states that the preceptor trusts the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited correction or feedback. APPE students receiving scores of less than Level 3 on any single EPA question will be required to successfully complete a rigorous Remediation Plan. Remediation student s will be required, at a minimum, to create, and follow, an acceptable Action Plan detailing steps to improve performance in the area(s) where deficiencies were noted. Action Plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. Additional R emediation measures may be required by the APPE Director. Additionally, the approved Action Plan will be shared with the student's next two preceptors and follow up with these preceptors regarding the student's performance on rotation will occur over the next two rotations unless Remediation is occurring during Rotation 8 or Rotation 9 . If the Action Plan is followed and successfully completed and if there ar e no further deficiencies noted by preceptors over the next two rotations, Remediation will be complete. If, however, during subsequent rotations, the student receives a score of less than Level 3 of entrustment on the same EPA question(s) as previously received, the current rotation w ill be considered a failed rotation. A failing grade will be entered into the gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. See Remediation Process resulting from multiple scor es of less than Level 3 of entrustment for further details on failed rotations. Remediation Process resulting from 2 or more scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment (failed rotation): APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on a series of Entrustable Professional Activities questions. Students are expected to meet Level 3 of entrustment on all EPA questions. Level 3 entrustment states that the preceptor trusts the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited correction or feedback. APPE students receiving 2 or more scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment will fail the rotation. A failing grade for the applicable course will be entered into the gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date. Students will not receive cr edit for failed rotation hours. A make -up rotation, of the same type, will be scheduled at a different location at the end of the rotation year resulting in a delayed graduation date. Remediation rotation locations are at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. It should be noted that not all preceptors are willing to 18 precept a Remediation rotation and Remediation rotations may take place in locations that are at a distance from Fargo. APPE students failing a rotation will be required to successfully complete a rigorous Remediation Plan. Remediation students will be required, at a minimum, to meet, face to face with the APPE Director and the Dean's office as well as create, and follow, an acceptable Action Plan detailing steps to improve performance i n the area(s) where deficiencies were noted. Action Plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. Additional Remediation measures may be required by the APPE Director. Additionally, the approved Action Plan will be shared with the student's next two preceptors and follow up with these preceptors regarding the student's performance on rotation will occur over the next two rotations unless Remediation is occurring during Rotation 8 or Rotation 9. If the Action Plan is followed and successfully completed and if there are no further deficiencies noted by preceptors over the next two rotations, Remediation will be complete. Upon successful completion of the Remediation rotation the student will graduate. If, however, during subsequent rotations, the student does not meet Level 3 of entrustment on any EPA question(s) where this level was also not previously met, the current rotation will be considered a failed rotation. If a student fails two rotations, Policy 31.03, Right to Terminate Enrollment, may be considered.

PHRM 581 -589 Advanced Rural Practice Experiences 5 Credits Rotation Year 2020 -2021 Meeting Times TBA The Advanced Rural Practice rotation may be completed in any pharmacy setting in which the healthcare setting is located in a community of 7,000 people or less that is at least 20 miles from a community of 20,000 people or more. The purpose of the Advanced Rural Practice rotation is to give students an experience in which resources, financial, physical or human, may be in limited supply. Students practicing in this s etting will get experience in multiple areas of pharmacy practice simultaneously as the pharmacist may often be the sole healthcare provider in a community or the only pharmacist in a health system. Additionally, students can expect to work with a differen t demographic of patients than usually seen in larger communities (i.e. agriculture workers who only visit their physician infrequently). While disease states seen in the rural setting will most likely be similar to those seen in larger communities, collab orators and resources will be different. Additionally, students will explore how to keep a viable pharmacy practice in operation when financial, physical and human resources may be limited. Finally, the Advanced Rural Practice Rotation helps fulfill the mi ssion of NDSU, a land grant university, by serving the needs of North Dakota and its surrounding region.

If i t is approved as a new site, a Site Agreement will be sent to the site for appropriate administrative signatures Initiation of a New Preceptor at Currently Approved Site APPENDIX 20DAMEE site evaluation policy and procedures - updated Feb 2019 The Director of Experiential Outreach and Assess ment or their designate will provide information on the recommended topics above after review of preceptor submitted materials. Performance will be mo nitored as described in Current Sites and Preceptors section. Ongoing preceptor development is offered to all preceptors in multiple formats (live, recorded, webinar, and newsletter). Preceptors are considered Adjunct Faculty with the NDSU School of Pharmacy and are not eligible for promotion. Current Sites and Preceptors The Director or their designate will evaluate all experien tial sites taking five or more students per year in person at least once every two years. Sites taking less than five stu dents per year, and those not within driving distance may be evaluated via site visits, email or telephone conversations every three years . Sites may be evaluated more frequently if needed (e.g., poor student evaluations, change in preceptor at the site). This routine evaluation is to determine continued approval for completion of student pharmacist experiential education at the practice site. The Director of Experiential Outreach and Assessment or their designate will evaluate the site and preceptor according to established criteria (see the attached Experiential Site and Preceptor Evaluation form). During the site visit, the student evaluations of the site and preceptor will be discussed. Roles and responsibilities of both the preceptor and the inst itution will be reviewed. The preceptor will be commended for areas in which the preceptor and/or site are meeting or exceeding expectations. Constructive feedback that addresses specific areas that need improvement will also be discussed with the precepto r. Working with the Director or their designate, the preceptor will develop an improvement plan, if necessary. Preceptor feedback regarding the School's experiential program will be solicited during the evaluation discussion. A copy of the experiential site and preceptor evaluation form and student evaluations will be kept electronically in the electronic rotation management system for retrieval and review. Experiential sites and/or preceptors not granted approval, or those gr anted conditional approval and not meeting those conditions will not be used/retained as a preceptor and/or training site for the program. School of Pharmacy Assessment Committee and Experiential Education Committee: The School of Pharmacy Assessment Com mittee will provide oversight for the assessment of student learning and the Experiential Education Committee will provide oversight of the QA process for the experiential program.

Trouble -Shooting W elcome to the North Dakota State University College of Health Professions, School of Pharmacy Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE & APPE). Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences are designed to integrate, apply, reinforce, and advance the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values developed through the other components of the curriculum. The focus of the introductory rotations (IPPE) is to familiarize students with the technical aspects of medication distribution within institutional and community pharmacy practice settings. Advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) rotations during the final year of pharmacy school will build upon the knowledge base gained during the introductory experiences and will allow stu dents to focus primarily on the advanced pharmacist roles involved in the oversight of medication distribution within an institutional pharmacy practice environment. IPPE -I rotations consist of one three week rotation in an institutional setting for a total of 120 hours. IPPE -II rotations consist of one four week rotation in a community setting for a total of 160 hours. APPE rotations consist of eight five -week rotations for a total of 200 hours per rotation. Five of the eight rotations are required rotations consisting of one each of community, institutional, inpatient general medicine ( acute care ), ambulatory care, and rural rotations. The required pharmacy practice experiences must include direct interaction with diverse patient populations in a variety of practice settings and involve collaboration with other health care professionals. The additional three APPE rotati ons are considered \"elective\" rotations. Elective rotations are defined as any \"required\" rotation or any experience that will provide opportunities for students to develop professional skills and individual interests. Most pharmacy practice experiences must be under the supervision of qualified pharmacist preceptors licensed in the United States. Active preceptors are considered \"Adjunct Faculty Members in the NDSU School of Pharmacy.\" Thank you for being a pharmacy preceptor for NDSU! We value our partnerships with pharmacists from around the region and the excellent education they provide to the next generation of pharmacists.

If you have questions/concerns regarding these matters, contact the Associate Director for Student Rights and R esponsibilities. https://www.ndsu.edu/policy/index_by_policy_number/ NDSU Pharmacy Stude nt Handbook EVALUATIONS Student Evaluations A Student Evaluation of the preceptor/site must be completed for all rotations and registered on the E*Value website, within one week following the completion of each rotation. It is recommended that this evaluation be discussed with the preceptor during the feedback session at the conclusion of t he rotation. These comments and observations will provide the preceptor with invaluable feedback regarding his/her site, service, and individual performance as a preceptor. Preceptors have the ability to view anonymous student evaluations of the preceptor /site through E*Value once a preceptor has had at least three students provide an electronic evaluation for the preceptor through E*Value. (see E*Value section of preceptor's handbook for directions) Preceptors, who have not yet received at least three ev aluations, can request verbal feedback and/or suggestions for improvement from our office. Preceptor Evaluation The \"Preceptor Evaluation of Student Form\", is to be completed by the preceptor. The preceptor is required to: 1. Provide the student with verbal, constructive feedback, midway and throughout the rotation. 2. Provide a written \"Student Evaluation\" and constructive feedback at mid -point (for APPE) and conclusion of the rotation 3. Post on the E*Value website, \"Student Evaluation\" within two weeks following the completion of each rotation. An electronic copy of the evaluations will be generated by E*Value and emailed to preceptors at the mid -point of the rotation and one week prior to the completion of the practice experience. **Please notify mark.lofgren@ndsu.edu if you do not receive these notifications from E*value as they sometimes go to junk mail. Grading: The Grading System used to monitor academic performance for the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences is: P (Pass): Indicates that the student has successfully completed the work of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences F (Fail): Indicates that student performance was unsatisfactory or that the student did not meet the expectations and/or complete the required work of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience. Students must complete and pass ALL course components to pass this course. Preceptor Eva luation of Students A. During any rotation, if a student puts patients, preceptors or th e practice at risk, that student may be immediately dismissed from the rotation and given a failing grade for that rotation. Students will not receive credit for failed rotation hours. Preceptors are asked to immediately notify Teri Undem, APPE Director (7 01- 231-6578) or Rebecca Brynjulson, IPPE Director (701 -231-7477) of any problems with their students or the rotation. B. Upon failure of an IPPE rotation, a student will receive a failing grade and the student will complete a remediation plan during the subs equent academic year that includes repeating the course for academic credit. The student will be required to successfully complete all IPPE hours prior to beginning APPE. A minimum of 300 IPPE hours must be successfully completed prior to APPE. C. Upon failure of an APPE rotation, a student will receive an incomplete grade and will be required to successfully complete a remediation plan that includes repeating the failed rotation type for APPE credit. Upon completion of the remediation plan, the student will b e required to make up any rotation hours that were missed due to the remediation plan. All make up rotation hours will be completed at the end of the academic year, resulting in a delayed graduation. Remediation hours cannot be made up over the holiday bre ak. A total of 1600 ACPE rotation hours, in the appropriate combination of required and elective rotations, must be successfully completed prior to graduation. D. If a student requires remediation and does not successfully complete the remediation plan, Colle ge Policy 3.03, Right to Terminate Enrollment, will be considered.

PRECEPTOR RESPONSIBILITIES The integration of classroom knowledge into professional performance is recognized as an essential activity in the achievement of professionalism. The following list emphasizes the serious responsibilities inherent in accepting the role of a preceptor: a. Understand the dimensions, responsibilities and tasks of pharmacy practice and identify those tasks which are performed in the preceptor's pharmacy. b. Assess the student 's knowledge and level of experience before assigning learning experiences. From both educational and public safety standpoints, the student's duties should not exceed his/her educational level. c. Review the assessment of the student's entry level knowledge and experience with the student, pointing out strengths and weaknesses and assigning learning experiences to correct deficiencies. d. Set clear learning objectives for the student, based on the student's education and experience and upon the dimensions, resp onsibilities and tasks of pharmacy practice. e. Plan specific learning activities that will contribute to the mastery of each task and ensure time to practice the skill in the pharmacy. f. Thoroughly review such topics as patient confidentiality, security practices, professional demeanor, patient communication, communication with other health professionals, work schedules, lines of responsibility, relationships with the preceptor and other staff members, employee benefits, professional supervision, and the performance evaluation. g. Provide information and demonstrate appropriate practice performance. h. Serve as a learning resource and role model for the student while infusing new values and attitudes. i. Provide a broad scope of educational experiences. Special projects may be arranged, such as in -service training, design of record systems, and newsletter writing. Exchange visits to other pharmacies may provide exposure to alternative distribution, recordkeeping and control systems. j. Systematically rotate the student's responsibilities to provide a wide variety of experiences. k. Coordinate and share teaching and supervisory responsibilities with other pharmacists. l. Close and continuous supervision of the student's performance, appropriate for his/her educational level and experience, is required by all preceptors. However, the advanced student's learning is facilitated when some latitude in independent performance is permitted. Intermittent checks of performance and retrospective reviews may be appropriate for th e advanced student who has acquired the judgment making ability required for practice. m. Provide positive corrective feedback during the learning process. Discuss pharmaceutical care plans and SOAP notes and answer any questions or refer to literature for evidence based practices. n. Evaluate and document the student's abilities during and at the completion of the Pharmacy Practice Experience. These evaluations may take the form of exit interviews, performance rating scales, review of student reports/care plans, and performance tests. o. Meet with representatives of the Board of Pharmacy or of the School of Pharmacy who are responsible for coordinating the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience Program. p. Encourage/model active participation in continuing educat ion and lifelong learning.

KEY STEPS IN LEARNING The learning activities suggested for students can be summarized in five steps. Set Clear Learning Objectives Determine the Achievement Level and Learning Needs of the Student Plan Specific Learning Activities Implement the Learning Plan Evaluate and Feedback the Results Set Clear Learning Objectives Preceptors are responsible for supervising the learning of students who will practice in general practice locations and in various roles. The preceptor and the student should begin each rotation with a prepared set of learning objectives that represent a description of the knowledge, skills, and capabilities required to practice pharmacy in that setting. It is important that the student be exposed to the differen t roles and tasks. This may require arrangement of learning experiences outside of the preceptor's pharmacy Determine the Achievement Level and Learning Needs of the Student Specifically ask the student what he/she knows, what they have experience d, and their expectations during the rotation you are supervising. Decide what knowledge, skills, and attitudes are deficient in the student's background and focus the learning on these deficiencies. Plan Specific Learning Activities Decide on the experiences/learning activities that will be necessary to meet the learning objectives of both the student and the preceptor. Learning activities may include daily practice responsibilities, observation of selected tasks, working on assignments and special projects, reading journal articles or other references, attending meetings and seminars, discussions with the preceptor and other pharmacists, and evaluation of performance. Implement the Learning Plan Develop a schedule of experiences/learning activities that are possible within your rotation site and during the rotation time frame. Arrange for special visits to other practice sites or with ot her health professionals. Determine the best time for the preceptor to meet with the student to offer ad vice and feedback. Evaluate and Feedback the Results If possible, it is important to provide feedback when the behavior is observed. Provide corrective and supportive feedback as often as possible focusing on specific assignments or tasks performed. THE IMPORTANCE OF FEEDBACK The student needs to know whether he/she is performing appropriately. Approval by the preceptor and appreciation from patients and other health professionals are factors which will encourage the student to repeat proper performance. An awareness of satisfactory performance is as important as an awareness of deficiencies because a student needs to understand how to improve on a parti cular skill so that he/she can increase proficiency through practice in a future rotation. In addition to feedback from the preceptor regarding performance, the preceptor should discuss/quiz the student regularly on assigned tasks. Correct responses contribute to positive reinforcement. Incorrect answers are not necessarily a sign of failure, but a signal to re -emphasize a particular task. Suggested Questions to initiate conversation and begin feedback for the Mid- rotation and/or Final Rotation Evaluations: 1. How would you rate your performance so far? How do you think your care plans are going? 2. What do you think of your .......? .... patient counseling? .... time management skills? 3. Why do you think that? Explain what you feel you are doing well ... or not so well? 4. How could you improve? 5. What would you like to improve in the coming weeks? 6. Set specific objectives for the student or incorporate in objective setting along with the student. 7. Do you have enough time to work on projects/tasks here? Too much time? 8. What is your favorite activity for this rotation...of the day? 9. What is your least favorite activity? Why? 10. What is the most important task you are assigned? 11. What did you find helpful in learning/preparing for this rotation? 12. What would you like to see change in the future? 13. What would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of this rotation? 14. What skills have you learned that you plan to use in the future Seven Keys to Effective Feedback Feedback should be: Goal- Referenced Tangible and Transparent Actionable User -friendly Timely Ongoing Consistent Portions of this manual have been extracted from the AACP/NABP manual, The Internship Experience , the Drake University Competency Statements developed with the support of SmithKline Corporation, the Community Practice Externship Manual of the University Of Minnesota College Of Pharmacy and Wiggins G.

APPE Remediation and Course Failure Process Preceptors complete two evaluations of a student for each rotation; a mid -term evaluation and a final evaluation. The mid -term evaluation will serve as a checkpoint for students; i dentifying areas for improvement. The final grade or need for remediation is based upon the final evaluation. If a student fails an APPE rotation or is unable to successfully complete a n APPE rotation, a failing grade will be entered into the grade book along with a new , expe cted rotation completion date. Students will not receive academic credit for failed rotation s. Exceptions may be made and will be det ermined on a case -by-case basis. During any APPE rotation, if a student puts patients, preceptors or the practice at risk or demonstrates unprofessional behavior, the student may be immediately dismissed from the rotation and given a failing grade for that rotation . A failing grade will be entered into the gradebook along with a new , expe cted rotation completion date and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will be notified . Process for students not meeting professionalism expectations: APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on Personal and Professional Development . Students are expected to score \"yes\" on all final evaluation professionalism questions. APPE s tudents demonstrating a lack of professionalism that results in an answer of \"no\" on professionalism -related questions appearing on the final evaluation will be required to successfully complete a rigorous approved remediation action plan through the Office of Experiential Education prior to Graduation. An Incomplete grade may be entered into the gradebook along with an expected completion date. Students will not graduate until t he remediation plan has been successfully completed . Remediation action plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. Additionally, the approved action plan will be shared with the student's next two preceptors and follow up with these preceptors regarding the student's performance on rotation will occur over the next two rotations unless r emediation is occurring during Rotation 8 or Rotation 9. If, however, during subsequent rotations, the student receives a final evaluation score of \"no\" on the same professionalism -related question(s) as already received on a previous evaluation , the rotation where the \"no\" was received will be considered a failed rotation. A fail ing grade will be entered into the gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date and the Associate Dean s for Academic and Student Affairs will be notified . Students will not receive credit for failed rotation s. See Remediation Process resulting f rom multiple scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment for further details on failed rotations. Remediation Process resulting from failure to meet Level 3 of entrustment on any single EPA evaluation question: APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on a series of Entrustable Professional Activities questions. Students are expected to meet Level 3 of entrustment on all EPA questions. Level 3 entrustment states that the preceptor trusts the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited co rrection or feedback. APPENDIX 13 TAPPE s tudents receiving scores of less than Level 3 on any single EPA question will have an incomplete grade entered into the gradebook and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will be notified. Students will be required to succes sfully complete a rigorous remediation action plan. Remediation students will be required, at a minimum, to create, and follow, an acceptable remediation action plan detailing steps to improve performance in the area(s) where deficiencies were noted. Remediation action plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. Additional Remediation measures may be required by the APPE Director. Additionally, the approved Action Plan will be shared with the student's next two preceptors and follow up with these preceptors regarding the student's performance on rotation will occur over the next two rotations unless Remediation is occurring during R otation 8 or Rotation 9. If the Action Plan is followed and successfully completed and if there are no further deficiencies noted , by preceptors, over the next two rotations, remediation will be complete and the incomplete grade will be changed to a pas sing grade . If, however, during subsequent rotations , the student receives a score of less than Level 3 of entrustment on the same EPA question (s) as previously received , the rotation where the low score was received will be considered a f ailed rotation . A failing grade will be entered into the gradebook along with a new, expected rotation completion date and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will be notified . Students will not receive academic credit for failed rotation s. See Remediation Process resulting from multiple scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment for further details on failed rotations. Failed course resulting from 2 or more scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment : APPE students are evaluated by preceptors on a series of Entrustable Professional Activities questions. Students are expected to meet Level 3 of entrustment on all EPA questions. Level 3 entrustment states that the preceptor trusts the learner to complete this task. The learner requires limited corre ction or feedback. APPE s tudents receiving 2 or more scores of less than Level 3 of entrustment will fail the rotation. A failing grade for the applicable course will be entered into the gradebook and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will be notified Students will not receive academic credit for failed rotation s. A make -up rotation , of the same type , will be scheduled at a differe nt location at the end of the rotation y ear resulting in a delayed graduation date. Repeat course rotation locations are at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. It should be noted that not all preceptors are willing to precept a repeat course rotation and these rotations may take place in locations that are at a distance from Fargo. Students who fail a rotation will be required, at a minimum, to meet, face to face with the APPE Director and the Dean's office as well as create, and follow, an acceptable action plan detailing steps to improve performance in the area(s) where deficiencies were noted. Actio n plans will be approved at the sole discretion of the APPE Director. Action plans will be shared with the next two preceptor s in order to help the student develop in the areas cited as needing improvement. Additional measures may be required by the APPE Director . If a student fails two rotations, Policy 3 .03, Right to Terminate Enrollment, may be considered. 10/9/2019 https://www.e-value.net/index.cfm 1/4Preview Form North Dakota State University College Subject: Evaluator: Site: Period: Dates of Course/Rotation: Course/Rotation: Acute Care Form: Student Evaluation of Preceptor Use the following scale to indicate your agreement with the following statements 5 = Strongly Agree 4 = Agree 3 = Neutral 2 = Disagree 1 = Strongly Disagree 0 = N/A - Not applicable to the Rotation or Site The preceptor is interested in teaching this rotation.
