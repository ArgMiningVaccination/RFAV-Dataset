Let me know what you think. -or- Namaste~ \"It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.\" Chuck Palahniuk, Diary Saturday night will be my next FREE Full Moon Reiki Meditation at 11pm EST. \"As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. The more northern tribes knew this Moon as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter; or the Full Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. The Full Sap Moon, marking the time of tapping maple trees, is another variation. To the settlers, it was also known as the Lenten Moon, and was considered to be the last full Moon of winter.\" - The Farmer's Almanac I like to call this full moon The Spring Maple Moon. Growing up in the upper Adirondack mountains, my father would often bring my sister and I to our cousin's Sugar Bush, which is where 100% Pure Maple Syrup is collected, heated and even sampled sometimes with a bit of fresh fallen snow. There are so many happy memories in those woods where we would ride the snowmobiles, walk over icy brooks that were beginning to thaw. When we would bundle up and play all day in the snow... This will be an excellent night for really asking how can tap into your childish enthusiasms and how you can share your own inner sweetness with your Self & others? Self discovery is essential to a balanced and healthy holistic lifestyle. As I like to say, \"In order to live happy and healthy lives we need to have a happy and healthy relationship with our past, especially with our childhoods. If we can look back at the fond moments, the moments that truly matter; then the trauma, the abuse, and the struggle of childhood can be looked at with more compassionate eyes. Our inner child is set free. If it is allowed to feel what it will in those moments of happiness, it can finally come out of the dark corners of our psyches. By doing so we allow our inner sweetness and goodwill to shine like how the sun can melt snow and like how sap flows from trees in order for sweetness to manifest.\" So, why not get in touch with your inner workings a bit more; find spiritual, emotional, and mental clarity so that you can manifest harmony and warmth of spirit? So, Happy [Full Moon in Virgo](http://lunaf.com/english/astrology/moon-in-zodiacal-sign/virgo/) friends! By using the Maple Tree as an example, we will focus on how we too can tap into our reserves of sweetness in order to open untold doors of happiness & health. Join us from the comfort of wherever you will be at the time. Whether you're awake, out socializing, working, or even at home in bed; you can attend in spirit by just taking a moment to ponder the following. No one has to meditate. Simply sitting and taking a reflective moment is all that is needed. [What is Reiki]? Whenever someone asks what I do, and I tell them that I am a Reiki Practitioner, I often get an odd look of curiosity. I always begin by quoting Usui Sensei, \"Reiki is the secret art of inviting happiness into your life.\" Reiki is a Japanese method very similar to massage, except your clothes stay on. The point is to facilitate a relaxing atmosphere and environment so that the body can naturally heal itself of physical, emotional, mental, sexual and spiritual pain. It works great for aches and pains, grief and heartbreak, as well as when you lose your faith in yourself. It empowers people and helps to deal with trauma, abuse, and depression. I even use it to help with my patients management who have PTSD, ADHD, OCD, and even PMS. (This normally gets a chuckle). Simply put, Reiki allows you take time for yourself, for peace, for harmony, and for your health. It isn't a cure, but it does help to heal issues at their core in conjunction with other medical therapies. I will be offering and sending this unconditional healing energy to anyone who wishes to participate. By liking this post, or joining this event, I am taking that as an affirmative. A simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" will be fine. Whether or not you physically attend or meditate on your own is up to you. The energy will be sent regardless, and it will go where it is most needed to each person. I send Reiki with a clear intention that it will only be received with free will and if it is refused will be redirected to the Earth or another person who needs and wants it. Will you be calling it an early night, and will already be in bed? No worries. When we are asleep we are perfect channelers of Reiki energy. If you wish, you can say the blessing below before bed to welcome the harmony that will be sent to you. Again, my intention for Saturday night will be to focus on our ability to create sweetness in our lives. \"Everyone carries an atmosphere about him. It may be healthful and invigorating, or it may be unwholesome and depressing. It may make a little spot of the world a sweeter, better, safer place to live in; or it may make it harder for those to live worthily and beautifully who dwell within its circle.\" [J.R. Miller] We will also focus on all those seeds that we planted during the last New Moon. This will be an excellent time for you to meditate and answer some of the questions we posed a few weeks ago. How have you tended your inner heart's garden? Have you become more considerate of your actions towards others and your Self? Have you begun to shun negative self-talk? Do you find yourself being more grateful for the people in your life? It is a good idea to place your hands over your heart chakra, Anahata, as you say the following blessing, light a candle if you wish, and either just sit, or meditate if you're awake. If asleep, you may say it prior to bed if you wish. Again, when we are asleep we are in an excellent state for healing. It is one of the few times our subconscious can consciously speak to us because we are in an altered state of consciousness. Take note of your dreams the next morning, perhaps you will get a message for an area in your life to focus on and heal. Always feel free to message me privately if you have questions. Namaste~ We are all one after all. \"Thank-you for sending Sweetness for the greatest good of everyone gathered tonight. Thank-you for sending Sweetness for the greatest good of all who could not make it for this healing. Thank-you for sending Sweetness for the greatest good of (our/my) home, community, and planet. May my words be filled with sweetness. May my thoughts be filled with sweetness. May my actions be filled with sweetness. May I acknowledge my past heart breaks and let them go with a warm hug. May I acknowledge my current heart's condition and let it be. May I acknowledge my future heart's wholeness with a smile. As the moon softens, may my pain and suffering be released as the moon darkens and darkens. As the moon softens, may my mind draw upon the peaceful sanctuary of this season, as the moon darkens and darkens. As the moon softens, may my soul be nurtured with self-love and self-acceptance, as the moon darkens and darkens. As I begin to travel in the land of Spring, may I relate my journey to the wisdom of this season. May my spirit soften at the wonder of this night. May my life flow like warm sap and nourish my Spirit. Happy Full Moon. Namaste. Thank-you. Thank-you. Thank-you.\" Just allow the energy to flow for a few minutes until it seems like you have met your mark. Bathe yourself in sweet moon beams as you drift away to sleep. Now, as participants, if you wish to step it further, you can become a better conduit for this energy by sinking into meditation with me at the same time. I will be performing the Reiki healing tomorrow, SATURDAY March 15th AT 11PM EST. for about 30-60 minutes. If you wish, get comfortable, light some candles/incense, put your choice of music on, and meditate with me. You may even wish to make some hot chocolate or tea, light some candles/turn on your music, and just sit. ***Perhaps for this special night you could take a warmed shot of 100% Pure Maple Syrup! If you will already be in bed asleep, which is a great state of mind to be in when receiving healing, print out and say the intention above. Or you could even say one of your own making. I am really very excited about this, and I welcome who ever is interested! Let's take some time for ourselves, and meditate together. (Just be sure to correlate with your time zone.) If you run late by accident, don't feel guilty. You can enter at any time and leave at any time. The key is to allow yourself the time to heal. You may even wish to stay longer than the 30 minutes. I will be gifting the Reiki for approximately 1 hour. See you all tomorrow under the liminal moon light. Photos courtesy of [Tomas Sobek](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomas_sobek/), [Marion J. I wrote an article Return to [Fukushima: Is Nuclear Power Worth All the Head & Heartache?](http://completehealthcircle.com/2014/01/17/return-to-fukushima/) Now, almost three years later, we have much propagated information surrounding the health risks, especially since we now know that after years of denial, TEPCO admitted in the fall 2013 that contaminated groundwater is flowing into the Pacific at [the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool every week.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/08/130807-fukushima-radioactive-water-leak/) Back in March 2011, there was very little information in circulation other than that the plant had meltdown (several times) and that they were fixing it. Many people decided to take things into their own hands, and reclaim their health. Many people fled, and are now still considered \"nuclear refugees.\" Others stocked up on potassium iodide and prussian blue. However, there were others who took prudent precautionary steps to protect themselves and loved ones from potential radioactive effects. And, I don't blame a single one. We all know the threat of radiation contamination worldwide is not only possible, but is probable. Not only that, but we are exposed to mild levels of radiation everyday from space, at doctor's appointments, cellphones and other electronics. Yet, we complicate matters worse with the hazards and dangers with nuclear power. These nuclear reactors can damage not only our health as humans, but the health of land, air and sea, which is also ongoing, and steadily growing due to meltdowns much like Fukushima. You can find out what the Signs & Symptoms of Radiation Sickness & Poisoning are [here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/radiation-sickness/basics/definition/con-20022901), but the basics are: So, with all of that said, here is a list of 10+ Remedies for Radiation. This knowledge could just save your life one day. Combine the oils in pairs when diffusing (for example, Melrose with Sacred Frankincense or Sacred Frankincense with Purification). Melrose is a particularly powerful blend because it contains two melaleuca oils that may protect cells from radiation damage, according to Dr. Daniel Penoel in l'aromath\u00c4 -rapie Exactement. Another sensible precaution is to wear an inexpensive dust mask saturated with the above oils while you are outside or traveling. Melrose combats minor skin irritations with its powerful cleansing properties. How to Use: Diffuse, inhale directly, or dilute with V-6 Vegetable Oil Complex to apply topically. Essential Oils: Rosemary, Clove, Melaleuca (M. Alternifolia), used on Chernobyl victims.) Retail Value: $23.36 US Sacred Frankincense essential oil comes from the Boswellia sacra frankincense tree. This oil is ideal for those who wish to take their spiritual journey and meditation experiences to a higher level. How to Use: Diffuse, inhale directly, apply topically, or take as a dietary supplement Retail value: 5 mL: $55.59 US 15mL: $118.09 US Purification\u00ae, the sweet, refreshing scent instantly deodorizes and neutralizes the air. This blend also contains citronella to deter insects and soothe minor bites. How to Use: Diffuse, inhale directly, or apply topically. Essential Value: $24.67 US - Longevity 1-2 capsules twice daily - increases the oxygen and ATP cellular fuel for increasing cell life and immunity for tronger resistance against damage from environmental pollution - Exodus II 1-2 capsules of oil daily to support the immune system - Melrose 6-20 drops per capsule or in yogurt 1-3 times a day - formulated with 2 species of melaleuca (alternifolia and quinquenervia) that were found through research by Daniel Penoel, MD and Pierre Franchomme, PhD, to prevent cellular damage from environmental pollution and potential daily radiation exposure - Mineral Essence 1 dropper-full per day - protects from mineral depletion as minerals work as a catalyst for enzyme conversion and vitamin absorption - Super C 1-2 tablets daily - provides the body with 2,166 percent of the recommended dietary intake of the powerful antioxidant vitamin C and is enhanced with minerals, bioflavoinoids and pure organe, lemon and other essential oils; a natural antioxidant and free radical scavenger that supports the immune system and protects healthy cells - Thyromin* 1 capsule three times a day - contains potassium iodide and kelp researched and proven to protect the thyroid from environmental radiation; other ingredients give support and nutrition to both the thyroid and adrenal galnds - ICP 1-2 teaspoons in the morning - a good fiber blend that binds with toxins and helps with elimination, high in rutin from buckwheat which helps to protect against radiation and stimulates new bone marrow production - JuvaPower 1-2 teaspoons at night - helps cleanse the colon - Endoflex and Di-Gize 1-2 capsules daily - EndoFlex contains oils very specific to the thyroid while at the same time addressing the entire endocrine system; Geranium contains esters that protect the thyroid and supports the thyroid in being able to uptake iodine from food - NingXia Red 4-6 oz daily - strengthens all body systems, high in antioxidants - Detoxzyme 3-5 capsules at night - digests toxins while sleeping - Allerzyme 1-2 capsules three times a day - digests non-nutritious substances that cause imbalance and irritation - Essentialzyme 1 capsule three times a day - to keep general digestion continually working for better nutrient absorption and usability - Calcium/magnesium. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that calcium may prevent precancerous cells from becoming cancerous. It also protects against strontium 90 (similar structure to calcium) and other radioisotopes. - Vitamin A or beta carotene. This vitamin manufactures antibodies, maintains and protects mucus membranes, and protects the thymus gland, the master gland of the immune system. It helps guard against tumor formation and cancer, as well as reverses aging process of the skin caused by ultraviolet light - Coenzyme Q10. This substance protects against many chemicals and radiation, offering immense benefits to the immune system and retarding the aging process. Sufferers of heart problems, high blood pressure, angina, and obesity often find this substance to be helpful in managing symptoms. Natural levels decline with age; therefore, supplementation is needed. - Vitamin C + bioflavinoids and rutin. A protective dose of between 500mg and 2,000 mg can counteract toxins and radiation. - Vitamin E. Neutralizes harmful free radicals and protects delicate membranes. - Zinc. Helps strengthen the T-cell-producing thymus gland. Aim for 50 to 100 mg daily, available from grains, nuts, seeds and legumes. - Selenium. Selenium fights cancer and protects against carcinogens, by helping to produce a free radical scavenger called glutathione peroxidase. - Proanthocyanadins (Grape seed extract/Pycnogenol). Considered to be one of the most powerful antioxidants or free radical scavengers, grape seed extract helps counteract stress, pollution and radiation - DHEA. The most dominant hormone in the body, DHEA is considered the \"Fountain of Youth\" hormone because it can help extend life span. DHEA helps counteract the negative effects of stress, boosts the immune system, regulates blood cholesterol and lowers blood pressure. It rebalances the hormones in the body, especially during menopause, slows the production of free radicals, and inhibits the growth of cancers and carcinogens. A good food source of DHEA is wild yams. - Melatonin. This valuable cancer-inhibiting hormone is often used to replenish the levels of melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland that affects the sleep cycle, fertility and the immune system. It's often used to prevent and counteract jet lag and can rebalance the pineal gland after electric field exposure. - Pau (also called ipe roxo, la pacho, taheebo, and bowstick tea). An herbal tea from the inner bark of two trees that grow in the warmer part of South America (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, etc.). Many South American doctors use a therapeutic tea from this herb to relieve pain and treat many conditions including leukemia and other forms of cancer, infections including yeast and other fungal conditions, skin rashes, and many other ailments. Dr. Theodoro Meyer of the Universidad Nacional of Tucuman, a province of the Argentine Andes, studied taheebo's chemical composition and found a substance called xyloidin, an antibiotic capable of killing viruses. Dr. Prats Ruiz, M.D., of Concepcion, a city in Tucuman province, reported blood profiles of patients with leukemia before and after treatment with taheebo to document the efficacy of taheebo in treatment of certain cancers. Clinical details are provided by Professor Carlos Hugo Burgstaller in his book on the medicinal flora of Paraguay and Argentina, LA VUELTA A LOS VEGETALES (Buenos Aires, 1968). - This tea was widely available in many health food stores until news of its anticancer claims became widespread. There is now an FDA effort to prohibit its sale in the United States. It has already been taken off the Canadian market to be \"reclassified as an over-the-counter drug\" because of the healing claims made for it. FDA approval of a drug for a specific use takes 8-12 years and costs about $56 million (1982 estimate). - SAFFRON TEA. Contains colchicine, a substance that has been used in the treatment of leukemia. It also lowers uric acid (high in those who have a tendency towards gout and/or cardiovascular disease). - THYME TEA. Often used as a remedy after x-rays. Just steep one tablespoon of thyme per pint of hot water for 20 minutes, then cool and strain. - BLACK TEA. (CONTAINING TANNIN) AND HONEY. Used for radiation protection in China. A balanced body can heal itself ... but it needs your help. It's important to pay close attention to the foods and dietary supplements you consume. Here's why. Diet and your body's susceptibility to radiation are closely entwined. Radiation and pollutants destroy vitamins A, C, E, K several N vitamins, essential fatty acids, calcium and neuro-hormones. If your body lacks calcium. Potassium and other nutrients, it will more readily absorb the radioactive elements that are similar in structure to these nutrients. Your best bet is to eat natural, fresh, organic (as much as possible) unprocessed foods, avoiding, white sugar, red meat, refined wheat, caffeine and homogenized milk. Pollen is an excellent food containing all essential amino acids, vitamins A, D, E, K, C, bioflavanoids, B-complex (especially pantothenic acid and B-3), and 27 minerals. Research has proven pollen to be beneficial in treating several diseases. Dr. Emil Chauvin (French Academy of Science) discovered bee pollen was beneficial in treating anemia (increases red blood cells and hemoglobin), chronic prostatis, constipation, flatulence and colon infections, especially diarrhea. Dr. Peter Hernuss at the University of Vienna's Women's Clinic conducted a study involving 25 women with inoperative uterine cancer. All received radiotherapy. The 15 who took 20 grams of bee pollen three times a day tolerated the radiation much better than the ten who took no bee pollen. Made from naturally fermented soybeans, rice or barley, miso is a superior source of usable whole protein, aids digestion and assimilation, is low in fats, has a wonderful salty flavor, promotes health and helps neutralize environmental pollution including radiation. The reason for Miso's protectiveness is not really known. It was observed that the Japanese who ate miso everyday did not die from radiation-induced cancer after the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The observed effect of miso as a cancerostatic agent was further confirmed in a recent study in Japan. Sodium alginate, a nonnutritious extract from Pacific kelp used to bind and detoxify heavy metals from the body (such as lead, mercury, cadmium, etc.), and agar, used as a thickening agent instead of gelatin or corn starch, will protect the human body from radiation effects. They also reduce absorption of strontium 90 by 50-80%. Kelp and dulse, excellent natural sources of iodine, help protect against radioactive iodine, found mostly in milk. When the diet is adequately supplied with organic iodine (as in kelp), radioiodine is not as readily absorbed by the thyroid or the ovaries. Kelp contains 150,000 mcg of iodine per 100 grams (32 ounces). The RDA of iodine is 150-200 mcg. A reasonable daily dose of kelp would be 1-2 teaspoons of granules or 5-10 tablets. Other high iodine foods include: seafood, beef liver, pineapple, eggs and whole wheat. Note: Taking kelp as a source of iodine is much safer than drinking iodine or eating potassium iodide, which can be especially dangerous for pregnant women and can cause allergic reactions. Iodine (inorganic) is toxic because of its tendency to combine with protein. That's how it destroys bacteria (a protein). When you put iodine into your mouth, it combines with the protein there and in your stomach or wherever it goes. This causes irritation or worse. Also, sudden large doses of iodine in humans with a normal thyroid may reduce the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Limit your cellphone usage, and for goodness sake remove any electronics from the bedroom. As A World without Cancer explains, \"Cellphones use radiofrequency waves, a form of electromagnetism that has been classified as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\" Whether cellphones cause brain cancer or not will likely take years of research, but it's probably in your best interest to play it safe in the meantime. Protect Yourself: Keep your phone away from your head by using speakerphone or texting instead of calling. You can also look for a phone with a lower specific absorption rate (SAR), which measures the level of radiofrequency energy it emits. Check [cellphone SAR levels on CNET](http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phone-radiation-levels/). Some treatments may reduce damage to internal organs caused by radioactive particles. Medical personnel would use these treatments only if you've been exposed to a specific type of radiation. These treatments include the following: Related Articles [http://completehealthcircle.com/2013/11/12/how-to-cancer-proof-your-environment/](http://completehealthcircle.com/2013/11/12/how-to-cancer-proof-your-environment/) References Living](http://www.youngliving.com/en_US). If only there were a magic spell that could take away all your pain. All the tears, all the bad memories, all the hurt, revenge, and anger. If only there was an easy fix to a broken heart, but the truth of the matter is that there is no one easy cure-all for a broken heart other than acceptance. We all go through this at some point or another. A boyfriend, a girlfriend, a partner, a spouse breaks our heart into a million little pieces. We feel everything yet nothing all at the same time. There is a great pain in your chest and tears only seem to keep flowing. We fall to bits on the floor in a deep pool of our own making. Then that moment creeps in, do we sink or swim? Sometimes my dears, it helps to sink all the way to the bottom, because then, well, there is no other way than up. Sometimes we forgo the sinking because we are too afraid of what is down there below the surface. So, we fight with all our might. To not see it, to run from it, to punch at the water fiercely with all our might, grabbing on to whatever may be floating closest to us, so we do not have to go down there to that thing called reality. Some of us spend years just floating like this not wanting to face the reality of why the relationship didn't work out because, well, we know why it didn't it was his/her fault! Not yours. Right? Wrong. It takes two to tango as they say, and the fact of the matter is that both parties are always equally to blame for the heartache. You accepted the courting, no? Your actions impacted that other person, no? Just as much as their actions impacted yours. (Do not think I am blaming the victim however, there comes a moment where the cute little rabbit smells the wolf in the air, but decides to stick around to see what happens.) In Western culture I see this all the time. We create these traps for ourselves, and all we can do is look back on them with self-love, acceptance, and not be too hard on ourselves. Life is too short for regret and denial. A life filled with love waits for us again, once we are ready to stop floating in our seas of denial, and look at our reflection upon the waves. Only then, can we delve deep within our own hearts to discover what was lost and eventually, with time and effort, we may rise again and walk along the shore to see the beauty of another sunrise. Here are 10+ Remedies that I hope will help you to free yourself from your sea of heartbreak. Good luck my friends!

It carries a soft feminine energy of compassion and peace, tenderness and healing, nourishment and comfort. It speaks directly to the Heart Chakra, dissolving emotional wounds, fears and resentments, and circulates a Divine loving energy throughout the entire aura. Reawakening the heart to its own innate love, it provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment and contentment, allowing one the capacity to truly give and receive love from others.\"- [Crystal Vaults] Wear or carry this crystal with you to welcome your heart's healing and to promote joy, self-love, and acceptance of the situation. You may also wish to make an elixir with a smaller rose quartz in a single glass or make a bunch in a sun tea jar. Recipe: Wash your crystal(s) under tepid distilled, filtered or pure water because if the water is too cold or too hot it could damage them. Treated tap water can be high in other minerals as well as chemicals that may interact with the crystal. Rinsing them off and drying them first allows you to ensure that you are not drinking dust, germs, dirt, etc. Once dry add your crystal to a glass jar/cup for 8-12 hours. You can super charge the water by placing them in sun or moon light, just be sure to cover the container with a glass lid or wax paper so that critters don't dirty the water. Dosage: 8-12 glasses a day. This helps also with hydration. What I do is fill my glass 16 oz. water bottle with filtered water and throw in a couple tumbled rose quartz and go about my day. I set an intention that by drinking this elixir will help heal my pain and heart chakra. Every time I take a sip, I visualize drinking unconditional love. It always tastes super fresh! *CAUTION* You should not do this with every crystal since some contain toxins like copper or lead that will leech into (Azurite, Chrysocolla, Malachite, Galena, Chalcopyrite, Smithsonite or Dioptase (to name a few) are not recommended.) I recommend highly, these books. Some were given to me, and others I found in a time of great need. I hope you find their words as helpful as I did. Whether you are gay or straight, male or female your heart will grow with these stories and exercises. Run by Amelie Chance, who a \"little over 12 years ago, went through a divorce which left her living in fear. She was afraid that her heart would never heal.

Yet today, we are experiencing a warm front of rain and the snow is sadly melting. To the north traveler's tires are spinning on roads covered in slush. Windshield wipers are freezing stuck. Roads are being closed, and the woods are decorated in icicles. Birds and squirrels are fat with the help of nature enthusiasts as they supplement their winter stores of nuts and seeds. All around, people are preparing for Christmas, Kwanzaa, and the New Year. They are frantic if they have put off some things, and others sink deeply with a smile as they have been finished for weeks. Holiday spirit fills our hearts as we make preparations to share it with friends and family over the next month. Some take on nostalgic moments of Holidays past, others excite over sharing in the Holiday present, and still others hope for the next year in order to share it with a partner. \"Are you feeling more emotional these days? Winters are like that, a more inward and sensitive time. Nature is in her resting season, quiet, withdrawn, deep in the earth and the roots, preparing for Spring. You also may be deeper within yourself, seeking replenishment, resting, reflecting, and being more aware of your senses. As the winter climates of cold and wet (snow, rain, or fog) chill you to your bones, seek inner warmth and spend more time at home with family and friends.\" December 21st was the date of the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, and longest night. Now, each day will grow longer, however small, and the nights will shorten however little. We are in the deep stretch now, especially if you grew up where I did in the upper Adirondacks of New York State. Now begins a time to stay active so the cold doesn't freeze you in place, and so your energy stays warm and moving. It is also an excellent time to hibernate. To relish in sleep, rest, and siesta! Now is the time to get plenty of relaxation and to make sure you are eating nutritious, wholesome food. Most of all, now is the time to really pay attention to your dreams. Replenish your complete health this winter season by taping into your inner Water element (Winter is related to the element of water in the Chinese Five Element system). Water is in the air, on and within the earth, and constitutes a majour part of all living matter. This fluid is very adaptable, taking the shape of its container and changing form with cold and heat. It supports your being, both as a drink and when carrying you on a boat, a raft, or when swimming. Water is the essential medium of your body, through which all things pass. This fluid of life is important for functions like the circulation of blood, which carries heat and nourishment throughout the body; the lymphatic flow, which helps to process and eliminate wastes and provides your ability to fight off infections and other foreign agents; and for the flow of urine, saliva, perspiration, tears, and sexual fluids. Water can be warm and loving, and cold and frightening. It is nourishing, refreshing, and invigorating. By looking at the element of Water, you can see the analogy between the human body and the planet Earth. We both consist of 70-80 percent water. In fact, seawater is almost identical to blood plasma. Water is the circulatory system of the Earth. Clouds, mountain snow, lakes, rivers, streams, and the oceans are all part of this water circulation. Water can related to the emotions in general, but the specific emotional imbalance associated with Water energy is fear. This may be manifest as specific phobias; as a general anxiety about life; or as paranoia or negativity, in which one always expects the worst. Fear can be either a cause or a consequence of a Water imbalance. An illness affecting the bladder or kidneys may generate a fearful feeling; and fear can itself injure these organs, according to the Chinese system. During excitement or in change, one who has a Water imbalance may respond by trembling. This trembling represents a release of fearful energy and tensions. And although fear may block the expression of live, love and faith can transmute fear. Water must stay in motion; it has rhythm, a cycle which is primarily ruled by the movement and gravitational pull of the moon. The daily expansions and contractions of the oceans in the tides is like the breathing cycle of the Earth. We too have our cycles. Many of us have cycles in which held-in emotions are released, like the winter rains. Then, with the new awareness and expression of those feelings comes a real lightening up of our energy. Water, sometimes held in the body along with the emotions, can cause lethargy and slowness, irritability, and an inability to express ourselves. From the Chinese viewpoint, people with deficient Water energy may find it difficult to slow down, relax or rest, with an inability to reflect clearly. A balanced Water element allows fluidity and flow, an ability to rest and nourish oneself and others, to guide perception and reflection , and have a ready expression of feelings such as love. These qualities of compassion, understanding, and responsiveness to needs and feelings of others are often seen as the \"maternal\" and \"feminine\" aspect of ourselves, and are also characteristics of the Water element. However, we now know that placing one gender as a descriptive role for a set of characteristics is not only ignorant, but exclusive towards other genders that exist. Remember, gender is a human concept, and there are most certainly more than just two. Energy ebbs and flows, moves up and down, but giving these energies gender seems to only perpetuate gender-bias and imbalance. We must break free from these bonds that keep us chained to only a specific \"set-way\" of standards, and create our own based on our own unique and beautiful personalities. In Winter, we can take the time to really ask ourselves about our ups and downs, our highs and lows, our introvert-ness and our extrovert-ness. By feeling our own inner Winter and embracing this quiet time for ourselves, we will learn untold mysteries about who we are and why we are? By feeling our own inner Winter, we gain a sense of value, purpose, and warmth. By feeling our Winter we regain our complete health. Here in up-state New York, the farmer's markets are gone; the gardens are barren; but the supply for in-season foods is abundant. Fresh fruits and vegetables are not as easily available as they were for us, but you may be fortunate to live in the tropics where the growing season is all year around. As you move into winter, you need to adjust your diet once again. The weather is colder, so a diet that produces more heat is necessary. Days are shorter and you tend to have less physical activity, thereby burning fewer calories than you might during the more active summer. Don't increase your food intake too much or you may gain more weight than you wish. A diet which is mainly carbohydrates and protein will produce the heat you need and perhaps give you a few added pounds, but with even moderate activity, you should stay in pretty good shape until spring comes and you can once again cleanse and lighten up. Here are a few suggestions: Staying Healthy With the Seasons by Dr. Elson M. Haas, M.D. 21st 2003 Century Edition Photography courtesy of [Nora from Photoity.com](http://photoity.com/stunning-winter-photographs-that-will-take-your-breath-away/winter-photography-19/) It is always good, in my opinion, to treat yourself with food and herbs first before going to see a physician. Allowing your food to \"be thy medicine\" has worked for centuries prior to the pharmaceutical businesses became supreme. Don't get me wrong though. I am talking about minor things like colds, cuts, scrapes, stiff muscles, etc. NOT chronic migraines, recurrent and persistent pain, blood in stool or urine, broken bones, etc. We have to be smart about our own health. We must become more involved with our healthcare. We have to listen to our bodies and we must treat them the right way. By this I mean, we must be kind to ourselves. We must be kind to our bodies. If we are sick, take a day off. Recharge, heal thyself. Many of our ailments can be remedied in a few hours or days naturally. If things persist, and natural solutions aren't completely getting the job done, then bring in the big guns. But we shouldn't use medication as a crutch, nor western medicine as a cure-all. Just like with eastern and homeopathic medicine. A holistic view must be undertaken. Treat the whole of yourself, not just the pain, the source of the pain. Not just the headache, the reason for the headache. Sometimes our bodies try to tell us things. And sometimes that means we have some serious lifestyle changes. Our bodies are not meant to be rubber bands, so it is crazy to think we can continue doing what we are doing when we are creating the same problems over and over again. We are fluid. We have feelings. And our bodies hold everything together in the physical world. The following article is from [Herbs Info](http://www.herbs-info.com/blog/top-20-natural-painkillers-in-your-kitchen/). Some of these I knew, others I did not. I hope some of these you can learn from and add to your home medicine cabinet. Note - as always - this is just background information, not medical advice or a recommendation to self-medicate. Pain may be an indicator of more serious issues and so if you have symptoms, medical consultation is advised. Also, be sure to ask your physician if there are any known interactions between herbs and medications you are taking. Just discovered a fantastic, fascinating list of natural painkillers that are common kitchen ingredients! What's interesting is that the list is not just a basic list - but also gives specific information as to the type of pain that researchers have found that these natural ingredients may assist with - and the way in which the food is used (not all of the remedies involve actually eating the herb / food in question!) This list is absolutely incredible - and the uses are based on reports from scientific research (this info is included at the source article - link at the foot of my commentary). The original list is a bit of a long read though, requiring much scrolling - and so we thought it might be good to seem them all \"at a glance\" - so for those who want to \"skim\" through the list really quickly, I made a \"short version\" of the top 20, together with a summary of the condition each item is used for. Once again, the miracles of nature have astounded me and made me wonder if the modern world will tamper with everything before going full circle and realizing that \"natural is best\" after all! Thankfully there are still many good scientists doing groundbreaking work in this field and I take my hat off to you.

Next to wine, raw honey, herbal tea, and Amazon's Used Books Section, it is one of my biggest guilty pleasures. Although, for some time now I have known, I don't have to feel so guilty about it! Because, well, it has incredible health and medicinal properties. Here is a list of scholarly journals I found from [Green Med Info](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/substance/chocolate). The following article is from [Mother Nature Network](http://www.mnn.com/food/beverages/stories/7-health-benefits-of-drinking-hot-cocoa). It shows seven ways in which chocolate can promote wellness in your life. With resources and studies like this, why would anyone NOT eat chocolate? Yet, there is a risk of overindulgence. Just like with any therapy, over-use can be counter-productive. As is the quality of the source and ingredients in the cocoa. Rule of thumb, do your research! Find out the story of the chocolate you like so much, and discover if it's standards meet the your best. I love winter season, just one more reason to bundle up and sip on some luscious drinking chocolate. Oh those clever Mayans. When they weren't busy developing written languages, deciphering complicated astronomical systems and fending off conquistadores, they happened to invent sipping chocolate. Even if the Mesoamerican version was a spicy drink served cold, we can still thank them for having conceived of a drinkable cocoa concoction that has endured, in some form or another, for millennia. It wasn't until the Spanish explorers brought chocolate back to Europe in the 16th century that sweetened warm versions of the elixir were consumed. Indeed, from the 16th to 19th centuries, [hot chocolate]was valued as a special drink, as well as taken as a medicine. Drinkable chocolate has been used for years to treat ailments and maladies. When chocolate made its way to France in the 17th century, it was used \"to fight against fits of anger and bad moods.\" Which wasn't just the French being French, it was truly insightful, given that modern research has discovered that chocolate reduces levels of stress hormones in the bodies of people feeling highly freaked out.Which begs the question: We keep hearing more and more about the health benefits of chocolate, can the same be applied to hot cocoa as well? As it turns out, the answer is a resounding yes.Research continues to show us that [antioxidants]help prevent cancer, heart disease, age-related macular degeneration and aging in general because they fight free radicals in the body. The trendy so-called super foods are the ones bursting with antioxidants \u2014 acai, goji berries, blueberries and pomegranate have become the super-food darlings. But antioxidants come in surprising forms too, like in vehicles once considered more vice than health food, such as [coffee], red wine, and yes, chocolate. Which is one of the areas where chocolate, especially in the form of hot cocoa, shines. Here's how.1. According to a study conducted at Cornell University, the antioxidant concentration in hot cocoa is [almost twice as strong as red wine]. Cocoa's concentration was two to three times stronger than that of green tea and four to five times stronger than that of black tea.2. Professor Chang Yong Lee, the leader of the Cornell study, added that the \"hot\" in \"hot chocolate\" is important as well. More antioxidants are released when it's heated up.3. A cup of hot cocoa contains 611 milligrams of the phenolic compound gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of the flavonoid epicatechin equivalents (ECE). The antioxidant gallic acid is used to treat internal hemorrhages, albuminuria (the presence of albumin in the urine, which can indicate kidney disease) and diabetes.4. Although a regular bar of chocolate has strong antioxidant activity, the health benefits may be outweighed because of the saturated fats present \u2014 cocoa generally has much less fat per serving compared to the 8 grams of fat in a standard chocolate bar.5. The [flavonoids]help your body process nitric oxide, which is why hot cocoa can improve blood flow, help lower your blood pressure and improve heart health.6. The flavonoids in hot chocolate also help prevent platelets in your blood from mingling together and forming clots.7. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, drinking hot chocolate can help you [think better]too. The flavonoids increase the blood flow and oxygen to the brain. Since dementia is caused by a reduced flow of blood to the brain, researchers think it could be treated with cocoa.Now comes the tricky part. Commercial instant hot cocoa mixes are often more of an artificial monstrosity that may eradicate any good the cocoa may have to offer. One of the most popular mixes, for example, lists cocoa fifth on the list of ingredients, beneath the higher-level ingredients of sugar, corn syrup and a medley of vegetable oils.But not to worry, making your own healthy versions from scratch couldn't be easier. (See [5 healthy recipes for hot cocoa]for the happy hot cocoa how-to.) Imagine an environment free from gravity, strain, tension, or pain. Imagine if you could Float effortlessly in a euphoric state without distractions or unwanted noise. YOU CAN! [True REST](Restricted Environmental Stimulus Therapy) is a zero gravity environment that allows the mind and body to truly rest. Flotation Therapy is a special solution of salinated water utilizing 1,200 pounds of Epsom salt. The buoyancy makes floating on water feel like floating on air. Without any effort you can relieve pain, heal faster, relax, de-stress, improve sleep, and have fun in this unique state. The benefits are staggering and the experience is Beyond Euphoria. True REST gives immense pain relief, euphoric relaxation, and allows for better and deeper sleep. A recent Pain study shows 70% of participants getting FULL pain relief during a Float session. You are in complete control of each Float and can customize your session with lighting and music. True REST features an ADA compliant REST Suite, with ample room for wheelchair access and a ADA compliant shower. Many clients with severe fibromyalgia and other movement restricting problems find this specially designed room very helpful. Each REST Suite contains a changing area and private showers. The Pod is automatically cleaned and disinfected after each use and will be pristine for every client, every visit. The Center features a Prep Room, used after a Float for hair drying and other preparation. History John C. Lilly, a medical practitioner and neuro-psychiatrist, developed the flotation tank in 1954. During his training in psychoanalysis at the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Lilly commenced experiments with sensory deprivation. In neurophysiology, there had been an open question as to what keeps the brain going and the origin of its energy sources. One hypothesis was that the energy sources are biological and internal and do not depend upon the outside environment. It was argued that if all stimuli are cut off to the brain then the brain would go to sleep. Lilly decided to test this hypothesis and, with this in mind, created an environment which totally isolated an individual from external stimulation. From here, he studied the origin of consciousness and its relation to the brain. Peter Suedfeld and Roderick Borrie of the University of British Columbia began experimenting on the therapeutic benefits of flotation tank usage in the late 1970s. They named their technique \"Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy\" (REST). Tank design and usage In the original tanks, people were required to wear complicated head-masks to breathe underwater and uncomfortable tight clothing that constricted the blood flow in certain areas, but the mask and clothing detracted from the isolation experience. The tight fit of the mask seal around the face and the retention strips wrapping around the back of the head were uncomfortable in long sessions. The constant hissing of the air valves and bubbling of exhaust air out of the mask prevented the possibility of silence. The faceplate of the mask was typically solid black for visual isolation, but then the tank user needed help entering and leaving the isolation tank since the mask blinded them. The tight neoprene clothing was extremely uncomfortable in sensitive areas such as the genitalia, and constricted blood flow and mobility in other areas. In newer tanks, epsom salt is added to the water in the tank to increase the density of the water so that the subject floats with the face above the water. However, since the ears are submerged when the subject is in a relaxed position, hearing is greatly reduced, particularly when ear-plugs are also used. When the arms float to the side, skin sensation is greatly reduced because the air and water are the same temperature as the skin, and the feeling of a body boundary fades. The sense of smell is also greatly reduced, especially if the water has not been treated with chlorine. Flotation Therapy Preparation - REST is perhaps the easiest pastime imaginable. The only precaution that you should take is that you should not shave, wax, or tan at all on the day of your REST session. The high salt content of the water can be irritating to freshly shaved, tanned or waxed skin. We provide Vaseline in every room for people to cover any small cuts and grazes. - Please do not wear any hair or skin products prior to floating. If you have hair coloring that has not set you cannot go in the tank until the color is set and nothing washes out in the shower. - You do not want to be hungry while Floating, but try to leave about 30 minutes before the Float. - Avoid caffeine 4 hours prior to your Float. You must not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. - Females on their menstrual cycle are NOT permitted in the Float Pod. Please reschedule if you have already made an appointment. Your First Float - Your first Float will start out with a 5 minute Introductory Video on flotation therapy and the True REST Float Center. - You will be taken to the Quiet Room where you will replace your shoes with sandals (Epsom salts can be corrosive to shoes and clothes. You may not want to wear your \"best\" clothes.) We recommend bringing a towel, but you can rent a big fluffy one from us for $3. The Float Suite - Upon entering the private room you will rinse off in a warm shower - Each room contains earplugs and Vaseline to cover up small cuts and grazes. We recommend earplugs to avoid swimmers ear and salt in your ear canal.(Epsom salts can irritate freshly shaved skin and we do NOT recommend floating on the day of a shave, waxing, or tan.) Entering the REST Pod - Upon entering the pod the automatic sensors will start your full 60 minute float session. The lights remain on until you turn them off. The water is heated to skin temperature, and even though it is only 10 inches deep, it contains 1,200 pounds of our specially formulated salt directly imported from Germany. This is the reason you are able to float on the surface. - Climb into the pod and lie back gently, the buoyancy will lift you up. It is difficult to gauge how relaxed you are whilst floating, but will you notice afterward! Clients with sports injuries or back pain experience some discomfort in the early stages. One's brain focuses on even minor sensations due to a complete lack of \"feeling\" elsewhere. Keep relaxed and the aches and pains will drift away. (RELAX! Your body and head are completely supported by the water. You do not need to force you head up and your are in no danger of rolling over. Try touching the bottom of the pods with your hands...it is very difficult.) In-Pod Experience - Music will begin as soon as you enter the Pod. Music lasts 10 minutes in the beginning followed by silence and 5 minutes at the end of your session. It will take awhile for your brain to settle down, but the music is designed to distract you from your own thoughts. Try humming to yourself while in the Pod or hum when you exhale. It will sound powerful and loud and can be quite fun. Please do not become frustrated if it takes your mind a bit to settle down as everyone experiences this at first.The real benefits are normally only noticed after the session is complete. - Remember you are in a private room, so you can leave the pod door open if you wish (you may feel a chill if you leave it open the entire hour), alternatively you can prop it partially open with your towel, rolled up. You might want to leave the pod's interior light on. (Switch is to your right while lying down). - If you get salt in your eyes there is a bottle of pure water hanging inside the pod. Ending the Session - Music will begin at the end of your session letting you know your time is up. If you fall asleep the lights will turn on gradually and the automatic purification system will start, waking you up. If this doesn't work and you are still asleep you may hear a knock on the door. - Upon exiting the REST pod make sure to thoroughly rinse off all salty water and to rinse your ears thoroughly, as in rare cases crystalline salt can cause ear aches. Salt can be corrosive to clothes, but is great for skin and hair. Epsom salts don't rob your skin of salt, thus there is no pruning or wrinkling, but instead your skin will be left soft and silky. - Please try to vacate the room within 10 minutes at the end of your session, as we need to prepare for the next client. Enjoy your float session! - Upon getting your clothes back on you are free to re-claim your shoes or use our Prep Room for hair drying or makeup. Physical Benefits - Improves athletic performance and helps prevent sports injuries, speeds healing process - Decreases the production of Cortisol, ACTH, Lactic Acid, and Adrenaline - Increases the production of endorphins - Quickens rehabilitation and recovery - Relieves pain from arthritis, migraines, injuries, etc. - Boosts immune function - Improves circulation - Increases distribution of oxygen and nutrients - Reduces blood pressure, pulse, heart rate and oxygen consumption General Well Being - Promotes total calm and peaceful relaxation - Eliminates fatigue and jet lag - Improves sleep - Alleviates stress (mental and physical) - Energizes, rejuvenates and revitalizes Left/Right Brain Synchronization - Shifts brain waves from the Beta to Alpha, Theta and even Delta - Better mental clarity and alertness - Increases creativity and problem solving ability - Intensifies acuteness of all the senses - Accelerates learning - Diminishes depression, anxiety and fear - Facilitates freedom from habits, phobias and addictions Lately, I have noticed I have been focusing a lot on Spiritual Health and Healing. I've touched upon Mental Health & Healing a tad as well. But seldom do I post on Physical Health & Fitness. Granted, if you have a healthy Spirit and Mind, then it stands to reason that you care about your physical health as well, however, I am being pulled to post more about this subject. So, having said that, with 80,000 chemicals in use in the United States (with little research into their long-term safety), here are some simple ways to help keep your family safe. The following is an article written by [Leah Zerbe of Rodale News](http://www.rodalenews.com/how-prevent-cancer). I hope it will be food for thought for you to make some changes. I goes into depth about different leading factors of cancer. Sadly, however, cancer of all kinds plagues our modern world. Could this be from us as a species making choice decisions that have affected our health? I say yes. And I'm sure you can agree with me as well. Because there was a time when all food was organic. There was a time when all waters were safe to drink without the threat of mercury or other pollutants. There was a time where villages had peace of mind. And there was a time when we all lived in harmony with the planet. We are working fast to correct it, but more must be done to counteract the wrongs we have committed not just on our beloved Mother Earth, but ourselves, and our very DNA. A World without Cancer How to prevent cancer...that's the billion-dollar question everyone wants to answer. Although the cancer death rate has dropped nearly 1 percent a year since 1990 and the American Cancer Society estimates that by 2015 the total number of cancer deaths will be 23 percent lower than it was 25 years earlier, there's still much work to be done to truly eradicate the threat of this disease\u2014to actually prevent it. We turned to board-certified radiologist Margaret I. Cuomo, MD, author of [A World without Cancer], to learn how to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals that have ties to cancer. Of course, these steps don't provide a bulletproof shield guaranteeing that you'll never get cancer, but with 80,000 chemicals now sold in the United States\u2014many of them cancer promoting\u2014they can help protect your and your family. Reduce contaminants at home. The Problem: Thousands of chemicals hide out in everything from the food you eat to the moisturizer you put on your face day in and day out. Just because these chemicals are allowed in the products you apply to your skin every morning and evening and the treatments you feed your lawn doesn't mean they're safe. The sad truth? Most have never been tested for long-term health impacts. Protect Yourself: Take your shoes off at the door to avoid tracking contaminants into your house. Eat [organic]to avoid chemical pesticide residues and potentially dangerous food additives. Practice [organic lawn care]. Use [safer cleaning products]. Avoid BPA. The Problem: The majority of canned foods and drinks are sold in cans lined with bisphenol A, or BPA; it's also in thermal cash-register receipts and in some plastic containers, including water bottles made from No. 7 plastic. Despite numerous studies showing a link between bisphenol A and cancer, BPA is still in many U.S. products\u2014and thus, inside of us. Protect Yourself: Choose fresh or frozen food whenever possible, use glass, ceramic, or food-grade stainless steel food and drink containers instead of plastic, and say no to trivial cash-register receipts. Be wary of products claiming to BPA free, too: A recent study found bisphenol-S, a common replacement, may be just as harmful as BPA. Phase out parabens. The Problem: Although there's not a clear cause-and-effect relationship between preservatives called parabens and breast cancer, studies have found traces of the hormone-disrupting chemical in breast tumors, Dr. Cuomo explains in A World without Cancer. Because of parabens' estrogenlike properties, there's a chance the chemicals could stimulate the growth of hormone-related cancers. Protect Yourself: Check your personal care products. Anything with the word \"paraben\" on the ingredients list should be avoided. Check Environmental Working Group's [Skin Deep Cosmetics Database]to rate the overall safety of your products\u2014and to find safer ones. The preservaties are also used in some processed meats, liquid dietary supplements, and snacks and candies. Minimize dry cleaning. The Problem: Dry-cleaning your clothing can be quite a dirty matter. The Environmental Protection Agency has dubbed perchloroethylene, the go-to chemical solvent used in dry cleaning, as a \"likely human carcinogen.\" Protect Yourself: Skip dry cleaning and instead opt for wet cleaning. Many \"dry-clean only\" clothing can actually safety be cleaned at home. To learn how, read [Dry-Clean Only? Nah, There Are Cheaper, Safer Ways]. Be smart about radiation. The Problem: Depending on where it's done on the body, a CT scan could be equivalent to 100 to 800 chest X-rays, potentially increasing cancer risk. As Dr. Cuomo points out in her book, \"While the radiation risk from imaging technology to any given individual is small, the cumulative impact is not\u2014the 70 million CT scans performed in 2007 can be expected to cause some 15,000 to 45,000 new cancers, according to a calculation in Archives of Internal Medicine. Protect Yourself: Make informed decisions. Ask your doctor why a medical imaging test is ordered, and if it's really necessary. Keep track of how many scans and X-rays you've had, and ask whether an alternative test that doesn't use radiation, such as an MRI or a sonogram, would be appropriate. Limit cellphone use. The Problem: As A World without Cancer explains, \"Cellphones use radiofrequency waves, a form of electromagnetism that has been classified as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\" Whether cellphones cause brain cancer or not will likely take years of research, but it's probably in your best interest to play it safe in the meantime. Protect Yourself: Keep your phone away from your head by using speakerphone or texting instead of calling. You can also look for a phone with a lower specific absorption rate (SAR), which measures the level of radiofrequency energy it emits. Check [cellphone SAR levels on CNET]. Speak up. The Problem: In 2010, the President's Cancer Panel made it clear that research into the environmental causes of cancer needs more attention because it's a serious threat to society. Still, several years later, there are few new limits on toxic chemicals in everything from your toothpaste to your sofa cushions. Protect Yourself: Make meaningful chemical reform a top priority when you're deciding who to vote for in the next election. Write handwritten letters to your representatives and tell them why this issue is important to you. Add your voice to the growing number of voters telling them we shouldn't put products on store shelves if the chemicals in them may cause harm. Learn more.
