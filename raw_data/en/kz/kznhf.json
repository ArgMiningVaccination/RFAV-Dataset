This report explains our approach to the wide range of social, ethical and environmental issues associatedwith our business and reports our performance in 2005. The full web-based report is available on www.gsk.com GSK is a research-based pharmaceutical company, with operations in 119 countries. We make prescription medicines, vaccines, over-the-counter medicines, and consumer healthcare products. Our business accounts for 6.3% of the world's pharmaceuticalmarket. We have strong positions in several therapeutic areas including anti-infectives, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, depression, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and urology. For an overview of our business, see our Annual Report.Introduction OUR CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY In the last 80 years, medicines and vaccines have transformed millions of lives. They have helped to incr ease life expectancy and lower ed death rates fr om conditions such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. Medicines enable many people with chronic diseases to enjoy good health and lead full lives. In developed countries, healthcar e advances mean most people are no longer at risk fromdiseases such as polio and TB that were major threats lessthan a century ago. But continued r esear ch and development of new medicines is vital. Ther e are still many serious illnesses for which ther e are few tr eatments or where treatments may be improved. Discovering and developing new medicines is expensive - the average cost is ar ound \u00a3450 million and it takes an average of 15 years. Society now r elies on the pharmaceutical industry to fund most of this research, indeed the majority of medicines used ar ound the world have been developed by the pharmaceutical industry. GSK invested \u00a33.1 billion in R&D in 2005 and employs over 15,000 people. We have 149 prescription medicines and vaccines in clinical development. We believe that our business makes a valuable contribution to society by developing and marketingmedicines which improve people's lives. However we recognise that the research, development, manufacture and sale of medicines raise ethical issues for somestakeholders. We listen to these concerns and address them wher e we can.This report explains our approach to the significant corporate r esponsibility issues for our business, including: Access to medicines - how we make our medicines accessible to poor patients in developed and developingcountries Research and development - how we maintain high ethical standar ds in our r esear ch and the publication of research results Sales and marketing - how we maintain high ethical standards in the sales and marketing of our products It also covers our employment practices and approach to human rights, our envir onmental performance and our community investment. ABOUT THIS REPORT This report covers our corporate responsibility activity and performance during 2005. It updates our last corporate responsibility report published in March 2004. Data relate to the calendar year 2005 (except where stated). The environmental data is collected from all of our 81 pharmaceutical and consumer manufacturing sites, 5 of our 8 biologicals manufacturing sites and 19 of 21 pharmaceutical and consumer R&D sites as well as all 7 distribution centres, all 6 major office locations and 7 of the smaller of fice and sales locations. We include data for sites that were in operation for all or part of the year. Notes attached to the charts explain the scope and datacollection process for each parameter in more detail.Unless specified as being per unit of sales, figur es are absolute numbers, i.e. total consumption of energy, water etc. Data in the environment, health and safety sections of this r eport are externally verified.1The scope of other data relates to our worldwide operations except where indicated. We use external guidelines and frameworks to inform our reporting where relevant. We do not base our report on the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines but we haveincluded a GRI Index on our website to show which elements of the guidelines we cover and to aid comparison with other company reports. A number of changes have been made to this year's report in response to feedback received during 2005. We have added a summary to give readers an overview of our approach to CR and the key issues for our business.Last year we organized the r eport according to our ten CR Principles. This year we are still reporting progress against our principles but we have r eorganized some sections to make the r eport easier to navigate. Information on our marketing practices, pr eviously contained in Products and Customers, has been incorporated into the Ethical Conduct section. Information previously contained in the Leadership and Advocacysection has been embedded through out the report, in particular in Gover nment and External Affairs, Public Private Partnerships and Major Public Health Initiatives. For more information on our stakeholder engagementprocess see Stakeholder Engagement. 2GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Introduction continued1We accept this challenge. Solving problems such as healthcare provision in the developing world is not a job for one company alone, however we do have an important contribution to make. Our access to medicine programmes for HIV/AIDSand our work with the World Health Organization to eradicate Lymphatic Filariasis(LF) are evidence of the efforts we are making. In 2005 we shipped 126 million preferentially priced Combivir and Epivir tablets to developing countries for treatment of HIV/AIDS and donated 136 million albendazole tablets for the prevention of LF.Through our public private partnerships we are developing the first pipeline of newtuberculosis treatments in 40 years and testing new vaccines and treatments againstmalaria, a disease which takes a devastating toll on the people of Africa. Corporate r esponsibility encompasses how we addr ess and manage issues that arise from our business activities. Good performance on corporate responsibility supports our business strategy because it protects and enhances our relationships andreputation with doctors, gover nments and patients. GSK's core business - the research and production of medicines - makes a valuable contribution to society. For many people our medicines are, quite literally, life-saving. But our satisfaction in what we do does not mean we can ignor e issues associated with the r esear ch, manufacture and sale of medicines - from the publication of research results and marketing practices of pharmaceutical sales representatives, to the use of animals in r esearch and the environmental impacts of our manufacturing processes. We are confident we have the right policies and programmes in place so that we operate to the highest standar ds. This r eport pr ovides an update on the progress we have made against our ten corporate r esponsibility principles during 2005. Particular highlights include our new policies on the authorship of research articles, consumeradvertising and patient advocacy , and our Clinical T rial Register that now contains results from over 2,000 GSK sponsored clinical trials. We seek views from a wide range of stakeholders and respond to their suggestions where possible. This report contains new information in a number of areas in response to feedback we have received (see Stakeholder Engagement). We hope this report provides the information you are seeking about corporate responsibility at GSK and we welcome your feedback. Sir Christopher Gent JP Garnier Chairman Chief Executive Officer 3GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 CEO and Chairman's letter1 Corporate responsibility is fundamental to delivering our business goals. While the interests of shareholdersremain paramount we also need to respond to stakeholder expectations by helping to address society's healthcare challenges. WHY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IS IMPORTANT TO GSK To achieve its business goals, GSK focuses on a number of business drivers: build the best product pipeline in the industry to the benefit of patients, consumers and society continuously impr ove performance through commercial and operational excellence improve access to medicines through a range of extensive programmes, both in the developed anddeveloping world be the best place for the best people to do their best work Corporate responsibility encompasses how we achieve our goals and implement our business drivers. It means operating in a way that reflects our values. CR supports business success by reducing business risks and protecting our reputation. The way we conduct our business affects our relationship with the patients and consumers who use our pr oducts, the doctors who prescribe our medicines and thegovernments that regulate our industry. Our reputationwith these people and the trust they place in our productsis critical to our business. By demonstrating to stakeholders that we meet high ethical standards in all aspects of our work, and that we are committed to helping addr ess healthcar e challenges, we can maintain their support and retain our 'licence to operate'. Our reputation, the standards we operate to andour employment practices also impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate the best people. For mor e on our business strategy see our Annual Report.CR GOVERNANCE GSK's Corporate Responsibility Committee consists of non- executive directors and provides a Board-level forum for reviewing external issues with the potential to impact on GSK's business and r eputation. It pr ovides high-level guidance on our approach to all CR issues. Members of the corporate executive team, including the CEO, alsoattend CRC meetings. The Committee meets four times a year to r eview our policies and progress on our CR principles. Policies andactivities r elating to four of the principles - access to medicines, standar ds of ethical conduct, r esear ch and innovation and global community partnerships - arereviewed annually. Other principles are discussed regularly,at least once every thr ee years. The Committee's findings are reported to the Board. During 2005 the Committee met four times and reviewed our activity in a number of ar eas including: Access to medicines Animal testing Clinical trials in developing countries Community partnerships Corporate responsibility reporting including final sign- off of the CR r eport Reputation management Management of significant business risks is coor dinated by the Risk and Oversight Compliance Council (ROCC). The ROCC also considers r eputational and corporate responsibility risks. For more background information on the CRC and ROCC, see Risk management and compliance on gsk.com. 4GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility1 Corporate responsibility supports our business strategy by preparing us to meet future expectations, protecting our reputation and helping us to reduce business risk.So it is important that management of CR issues is integrated into our day-to-day operations. Our approach to CR is informed by frequent discussions with a range of stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, patients, doctors, governments and NGOs. For information on our engagement process and the feedback we have received, seeStakeholder Engagement and Government and External Affairs.Management structure We believe that day-to-day management of CR issues andperformance is done most effectivelywithin our business operations, where experts on all our CR issues work. Coordination is provided by a cross-functional team, made up of representatives from key business areas. These representatives are senior managers and have direct access to the appropriate Executive Teammember. Their role is to overseedevelopment, implementation and communication of CR policy across GSK. This ensur es a comprehensive and consistent approach is takenthroughout the organisation. We also have a small CR team that co-ordinates policy development, reporting, and communication withsocially responsible investmentanalysts.

Our stakeholders include employees,investors, patients, doctors, governments, NGOs,multilateral organisations, local communities, suppliers and the scientific community. By listening to them and being open about our views and actions we can buildtrust and address their concerns. Most of this discussion takes place in the normal course of business. For example our scientists meet regularly with academics, researchers and other pharmaceuticalcompanies. Through our access to medicine andcommunity investment programmes we collaborate withNGOs, multilateral agencies, governments and community groups. More information is available on stakeholder interaction in the following sections: Access to Medicines,Animal Research, Employees, Suppliers, and Governmentand Exter nal Af fairs. In 2005 we established a panel of external stakeholders to provide ongoing advice and comment on our EHS performance. The panel is facilitated by The EnvironmentCouncil, an independent NGO. See EHS Management. We also seek stakeholder feedback to inform our approach to managing and r eporting on CR issues. In 2005 this included: Engagement with socially responsible investors (SRI). During 2005 we had mor e than 30 meetings with SRI analysts and discussed issues including access to medicines, animal rights, supply chain, sales and marketing ethics and clinical trials. Fifteen SRI analysts attended our annual corporate responsibility (CR) briefing and met with 12 senior GSK managers. A survey of 51 corporate responsibility opinion leaders in Eur ope, the UK and the US. Participants included academics, CR organisations, customers, government agencies, investors, the media, multilateral agencies and NGOs. A survey of GSK employees. This assessed employee awareness of CR issues and sought their views on the key CR issues for GSK. This section contains a summary of the feedback we received through these channels and details of how we are responding. Stakeholder feedback This section summarises feedback on our corporate responsibility (CR) performance and reporting from CR opinion leaders, SRI investors and employees. CR opinion leader survey The CR opinion leader survey sought views from 51 people on our CR performance and reporting throughtelephone interviews. The survey pr ovided in-depth qualitative feedback but was not designed to produce statistics. This is the second year we have commissioned this survey. Nineteen of the participants in 2005 also tookpart in the 2004 survey. The survey was conducted by anexternal organisation. Findings Overall, participants rated GSK's CR performance more highly than in 2004.. A significant number also wanted to understand mor e about how our appr oach to corporate r esponsibility is integrated with business strategy and management. In addition they identified six priority issues for GSK: Access to medicines Marketing ethics and advertising Resear ch and development of new drugs Clinical trial ethics and publication of trial results Drug pricing Environmental impacts Access to medicines - We received positive feedback on our access to medicine programmes in developing countries, including preferential pricing and research into diseases of the developing world. Several stakeholderswanted GSK to adopt a tiered pricing system for middleincome countries and extend access programmes in developed countries. Marketing ethics and advertising - Respondents felt our r eporting was weakest on marketing ethics. Participants wanted us to be more open about our marketing practices and show how ethical dilemmas are addr essed. Research - Ther e was praise for our Clinical T rial Register . More information was wanted on research ethics, our relationships with the medical profession and how resear ch areas ar e chosen Drug pricing - Participants, particularly in the US, wanted to know how prices ar e set. Ther e was criticism of pr ofits made by pharmaceutical companies. 7GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued1Environment - Participants welcomed the breadth of our programmes and quantitative targets. They wanted moreon our environment strategy and materials efficiencyprogrammes and for GSK to set a more ambitious CO2 target and implement programmes to addresspharmaceuticals in the environment. CR Reporting Participants were asked to comment on our 2004 CR Report. They liked its comprehensive coverage andincreased transparency but felt it did not show which CR issues GSK considers most important to its business or convey how our approach to CR supports our overallbusiness strategy. The majority thought GSK's reporting would be improved by providing more detail on how stakeholder engagement influences our approach to CR, bringing more external voices into the report, being more open about challenges, and increasing the number of performance indicators. 8GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued1 Feedback from investors GSK r eceived the following ratings from investors and rating agencies: Organisation Rating Association of British Insur ers GSK was given a 'full' rating for its disclosur e of Boar d responsibilities and policies relating to social, ethical and environmental issues. This is the highest possible rating. Dow Jones Sustainability Index GSK was included in the DJSI W orld Index. W e came 2nd in the sector with a scor e of 82% (up fr om 76% in 2004). FTSE4Good index GSK was included in the FTSE4Good Index. EIRIS GSK was rated 'Good' in the EIRIS draft report on Access to Medicines. Only one other company achieved this top rating. Global 100 Most Sustainable GSK was included in the Global 100 Most Sustainable Companies, based Companies - Corporate Knights on research by Innovest Strategic Value Advisors. GSK is one of only three pharmaceutical companies listed Morley Fund Management GSK's rating improved from A3 to A2 due to greater disclosure and management of key impact areas such as R&D into developing world diseases, access to medicines, ethical issues in R&D, human rights, EHS, and business ethics. Oekom Research GSK was rated best in sector by Oekom's Corporate Responsibility Rating. We received a B rating, an improvement from B- in 2002. Sarasin Bank GSK was rated one of the three best performers in the industry based on analysis of company CR r eports. Covalence GSK was ranked as the top company across all sectors in Covalence's ethical ranking of the world' s biggest companies.Feedback from employees An online CR survey was sent to 980 randomly selected GSK employees to assess awareness of our CR performance and reporting. In total, 375 took part mainlyfrom the UK and US, a 38% response rate. The findings showed that: 70% had heard of the term corporate responsibility or corporate social responsibility 27% were aware that GSK produces a corporate responsibility report. Of these, most had heard aboutthe report from the myGSK global news site or gsk.com Respondents felt that the CR issues of most importance to GSK are: ethical business conduct (88%), access tomedicines (50%), health safety (48%), theenvironment (25%) 70% were aware of GSK's ethics programmes. For access to medicines this was 68%, health and safety66%, R&D processes 57%, employment practices 47%, sales and marketing practices 46%, community partnerships 43%, envir onment 33%. We are looking at ways to increase employee awareness of our approach to CR and CR reporting. An internal communications programme is being undertaken and we will conduct a follow-up survey in 2006 to measure its impact. How we ar e responding We reviewed our Corporate Responsibility Report in the light of stakeholder feedback and have addr essed many of the points they made. This includes pr oviding a better explanation of how corporate responsibility (CR) relates to our business strategy and mor e discussion of the challenges and dilemmas we have encountered. Additional content has been pr ovided this year in the following areas: Our approach to public policy and political lobbying. We are publishing our positions on key policy issues as well as our membership of trade associations and political donations in 2005. More on our marketing ethics policies and how we implement them, including data on the number of employees disciplined or dismissed for unethical conduct. Our approach to advertising to consumers. Our approach on payments to healthcare practitioners conducting GSK clinical trials.GSK's approach to the authorship of research articles in medical journals in response to concerns about'ghost-writing'. Our relationship with patient advocacy groups. We are publishing a list of all the patient groups which receivedfinancial support from GSK in 2005. Our approach to preferential pricing in middle income countries and why we do not operate a tiered pricingsystem. Information about our pilot project to assess the benefits of extending preferential pricing to moreproducts. More information on how we manage human rights standar ds in our supply chain. More information on our envir onment strategy and efforts to impr ove materials ef ficiency . Sometimes we receive feedback and suggestions from stakeholders that we disagree with or are unable toaccommodate without damaging the inter ests of the company and its shareholders. Where possible we explain the reasons for this, for example the need to use animalsin resear ch. It is not possible to provide quantitative data or meaningful indicators for all areas of our CR performance. We will continue to review the performance indicators that we publish and build on them where possible. We will continue to engage with stakeholders to understand their views of our approach to CR. GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS The pharmaceutical industry is highly r egulated and these regulations can have a significant impact on our business. It is therefore important that we engage in debate onlegislation and seek to influence policy decisions that affect GSK. In fact, as a major multinational corporation we are often approached by governments to give our views, along with other stakeholders such as NGOs. Our size and global reach give us access to governments and policy makers. W e recognise that we need to use this access responsibly to benefit patients and our business. Our public policy work is gover ned by our Exter nal Af fairs Code of Conduct, and backed up by factual r esear ch and analysis. GSK's External Affairs teams monitor changes and proposed r eforms to legislation and meet r egularly with government officials to explain our views on a range of public policy issues. 9GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued1Lobbying on issues affecting the whole pharmaceutical industry is sometimes conducted through trade associations. We may also hire professional lobbyists to support our public policy work. GSK believes that, where legally and culturally appropriate, political donations are a legitimate way of supporting thepolitical process. We have a Political Donations Policy that governs our activity in this area. Information on donations is given both in this report and in the Annual Report and Accounts. In addition, we have policies governing our interactions with other important stakeholders such as patient advocacy gr oups. This section describes: Our membership of trade organisations US lobbying expenditure in 2005 Political donations Our position on key issues Our approach to patient advocacy and the patient groups we supported in 2005. GSK was one of eight companies given a 'systematic' rating by SustainAbility and WWF in their survey of how 100 leading companies r eport on their lobbying practices. This was the highest rating awarded. A company receiveda 'systematic' rating if \"Coverage of lobbying indicatesthat systems exist to actively manage and discloselobbying and public policy activities. The company likely discusses policy positions on several material issues in some depth. However, approach to lobbying is still not fully integrated with company values, business principles and core business decision-making.\" More background information on our approach to public policy is available in the External affairs section ofgsk.com. Membership of trade associations GSK is a member of trade organisations including: Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA) Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) Japan Pharmaceutical Association LIF (The Swedish Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry) Organization For International Investment (OFII) Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) US lobbying expenditures GSK spent $4,860,000 on federal lobbying activities in the US during 2005. This information is reported to the USCongress in accordance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. This figure includes the salaries and cost of benefits for all employees registered to lobby the US government, aswell as the cost of hiring any outside lobbying consultants,the cost associated with the support of lobbying contacts,such as planning activities, research and other background that is necessary. In addition the figure includes the cost of our running the GSK Washington DC government affairs office; support staff, the portion of trade association feesassociated with federal lobbying and other costs of our activities in dealing with the US Federal government. We do not collect data on lobbying expenditur e, separately from other expenses in other countries. Political donations GSK makes political donations with corporate funds wher e such donations ar e authorized by law and ar e culturally appropriate. In 2005 we contributed \u00a3320,000 to political organisations in the US and Canada. Themajority of donations are made in the US. All donationsare covered by the GSK policy on political donations. GSK does not make donations to political parties or other political organisations in the Eur opean Union. See our Annual Report for more information. Contributions in the United States In the US, candidates are financed primarily by contributions from companies, individuals, NGOs and other parties. The rules concerning contributions are complex - for more information on the exact process please go to [link to appr opriate legislation]. However it is important to note that corporate funds cannot be used to support candidates for federal office. GSK corporate funds are only given to candidates at state level, in those states where such contributions are allowed by state law. These contributions are an accepted and important way for companies to engage in the political debate. In 2005, we donated $548,000 (approximately \u00a3301,000) to candidates for state-held of fices in the US. GSK contributions are not made on the basis of political party. GSK supports candidates who seek an environment that appropriately rewards high-risk, high-investment industries and believes in free market principles and 10GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued1intellectual property rights. All states make information about political donations publicly available. Corporate contributions to national political parties and candidates running for federal office are prohibited by US law. In accordance with the Federal Election CampaignAct, there is a GSK Political Action Committee (PAC) that facilitates voluntary political contributions by eligible employees. The PAC is not controlled by GSK but by our participating employees, who have the legal right to set up a P AC and make contributions to candidates and political parties at the federal and state levels. The GSK PAC is run by employees and all contributions are voluntary. PAC contributions are subject to strict limitations. For example, the GSK P AC may not contribute in excess of $5,000 to a candidate for federal office per election. PAC contributions ar e determined by a gover ning board of PAC-participating GSK employees from across the company . As r equir ed by law, PAC contributions are reported to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), the agency that oversees federal election activities. In 2005,the first half of the two-year federal election cycle, theGSK employees' PAC contributed $514,000 in total to 379 candidates for state and federal of fices. Contributions in Canada In 2005, GSK donated $CAD 42,000 (appr oximately \u00a319,000) in Canada to political candidates in those provinces where it is legal. Contributions in Other Countries No contributions wer e made in other countries during 2005. Our position on key issues There is a wide range of issues that affect the industry and it is important that we have clear positions to contributeto the debate. There is some criticism that companies are not transparent about their positions on key issues. GSK considers that, by definition, when we lobby on an issue then it becomes public and we prepare all position statements assuming that this will be the case. While we publish positionstatements on many key issues on our website, it would be impractical and inefficient to do this with every issue on which we have a view. We are however, happy to discuss our position on any issue with legitimate parties. The issues covered on the website change as and when new issues or updated statements are prepared. The current position statements can be found atwww.gsk.com/. The current issues covered include: Clinical trials in developing countries Counterfeit medicines Developing world challenges and access to medicines Importation of medicines Intellectual property and the TRIPS agreement Product diversion Preparations for a flu pandemic Patient advocacy Patient advocacy groups provide their members with support and information on how to live with theircondition, r epresent patient views and advocate on issues affecting patients' interests. They are an importantstakeholder for GSK and we engage with them as part of our aim to be a patient-focused company . GSK is committed to ensuring that the company works ethically with patient groups, and that the groups' independence and credibility are not compromised. A global set of principles supports this focus: GSK principles for working with patient groups 1.The independence of patient associations, of their political judgement and of their activities shall beassur ed. 2.In all co-operative matters, transparency is vital. 3.Any joint policies undertaken between patients associations and GlaxoSmithKline shall be based on mutual respect and trust. 4.GlaxoSmithKline shall refrain from using undue influence to promote its specific medicines or services. 5.When working with patient associations GlaxoSmithKline will always comply with local laws/governance. Throughout 2005 the company focused on communicating these principles exter nally to patient groups as well as, within internal training programmes, to ensur e that GSK employees act appr opriately with patient groups. 11GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued1Patient Advocacy Leaders' Summits (PALS) are one of the ways we engage with patient groups. In 2005 therewere regional summits across North America, in individualEuropean countries and for the first time, there was a pan-European summit in Brussels. These meetings givepatient groups the opportunity to learn more about GSK, and tell the company how it can better support their work. There are typically a range of workshops for attendees, including sessions on media-training and sharing best practice. The patient group representativesare also able to discuss and debate key issues relating to patient advocacy and healthcare policy. Attendees represented a wide range of patient groups including those dedicated to cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, respiratory diseases, mental health and epilepsy . The GSK European patient group advisory board was formed in 2005. It considers how the voice of patients can be strengthened across Europe. It is also a sounding- board that allows GSK to have a forum to consult patient groups on the future policy direction of the company, aswell as a forum for the groups to raise policy issues thatare important to them. The boar d has an independent chair fr om the Eur opean Cervical Cancer Association, and is made up of r epresentatives from a series of European groups. In the USA and in Eur ope GSK is playing a leading role, within the pharmaceutical industry and amongst healthcare stakeholders, to ensure that patient groups maintain their independence. In the UK GSK's advocacy work is gover ned by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) Code of Practice which was r evised in 2006. The new code states that there must be a written agreement with all patient groups that companies work with, and that there must be a list of all patient groups receiving financial support fr om companies. The GSK list is available on our website. 12GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Managing corporate responsibility continued11 Introduction 2Access to medicine Page Developing world 13 Research and development 14Preferential pricing 18Voluntary licencing 21 Investment in public health initiatives 21 Developed world 23 3 Research 4Ethical conduct 5 Employment practices6 Human rights7 Environment8 Community investment9 Data summary 2Access to medicines13GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20052 Millions of poor people in both developed and developing countries cannot obtain the medicines they need. This is part of a broader problem of access to healthcare whichremains a significant challenge in many parts of the world. The primary responsibility for addressing this problem rests with governments, but all stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, have important contributions to make. Access to medicines This section describes how GSK is supporting efforts to improve access. It covers our: Contribution to the developing world through research, preferential pricing, partnerships and voluntary licences, and community investment in important public healthinitiatives; Pricing arrangements and discount cards for middle- income countries; Patient Assistance Pr ograms and discount car ds to help uninsured patients in the US. We believe that our response is not only the right thing to do but makes good business sense. Companies that adapt their business practices to address such challenges will be the leaders of the futur e. In the competitive market for talented people this also helps us to attract and r etain the best people. Overall we need to make adequate returns on our business activities to enable us to invest in the R&D to bring new medicines and vaccines to patients. It is thisinnovation that underpins the sustainability of the company . By finding innovative ways to help poor people in developed and developing countries access our medicines, we are addressing ethical, reputational and commercial imperatives. For these reasons access to medicines is a strategic business driver of GSK. We also support under -served communities worldwide through donations, funding and practical support, see Community investment.DEVELOPING WORLD There is a healthcare crisis in many parts of the developing world. Millions of people do not have access to adequatefood and clean water. Sometimes the political will is lacking, and even when it is evident, governments often do not have the resources to fund the clinics and staff needed to deliver even basic healthcare. The AIDSpandemic has made these problems worse, creating a generation of orphans and depriving communities oftheir greatest asset - fit, healthy and productive people. Tackling this crisis is a complex challenge. Poverty is the fundamental cause and a huge barrier to progress.Significant political will and extra funding are needed from new national and international sources to aid development and build healthcar e infrastructur e. We welcome the additional resources promised by the G8 during 2005. We believe that it is the r esponsibility of gover nments and intergovernmental agencies, supplemented by the work of many NGOs, to deliver the healthcar e needed in these countries. However, the pharmaceutical industry can play a significant role in supporting their efforts. We make an important contribution through: Research and development into diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries. Webelieve GSK is currently the only company researchingboth new vaccines and treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria - the World Health Organization's three priority diseases. Much of this research is conducted through public private partnerships. Preferential pricing, specially reduced prices for antiretrovirals (ARVs), anti-malarials and vaccines. In 2005, we shipped a combined total of 126 millionpreferentially-priced Combivir and Epivir tablets for the treatment of HIV/AIDS to the developing world; Granting voluntary licences. GSK has granted seven voluntary licences for the manufacture and supply of generic versions of our leading AR Vs for tr eating HIV/AIDS in Africa;Public private partnerships Community investment in public health initiatives and partnerships that foster effective healthcare includingmajor programmes to tackle lymphatic filariasis, malaria,HIV/AIDS and diarrhoeal disease. Research and development The research and development (R&D) of new drugs and vaccines is an essential element in improving health in the developing world. There are still no effective treatments for some widespread and life-threatening diseases. Many existing treatments for diseases such as malaria arebecoming less effective due to drug resistance. Many diseases dispr oportionately affect the developing world. But lack of resources means there is often no viable commercial market for new treatments. Public private partnerships (PPPs) are helping to address this problem. GSK collaborates with several PPPs including the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (GA TB), the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation (Aeras), the Malaria V accine Initiative (MVI) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). GSK has created a dedicated group in our pharmaceutical R&D organisation, to focus on diseases of the developingworld (DDW). This includes a dedicated drug discoverycentre at our Tres Cantos R&D site in Spain and clinical development experts in the UK and US. DDW projects areprioritised according to their social and public health benefits rather than their commercial returns. A similar group exists in our vaccines organisation based in Belgium. Unlike many diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world, HIV/AIDS is dif ferent because it affects both developed and developing countries, so there is a commercial market for new treatments. This encouragesinvestment in the required R&D. GSK is an industry leader in research into HIV/AIDS treatment. In total GSK has 13 clinical pr ogrammes for medicines and vaccines against eight diseases1 particularly r elevant to the developing world. Seven of these pr ojects ar e for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries. GSK wants to continue investing in r esearch to tackle diseases that blight the developing world. However, there is a dilemma. Pharmaceutical companies must be profitable to sustain their business and to continue to develop new medicines. This business model does not work in cases wher e ther e is no pr ospect of a commercial return. Unfortunately, because of the lack of resources in endemic countries, there is limited profit to be made from new treatments for many diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries. The public private partnership (PPP) model, in which business and the public sector work together, offers a solution to this pr oblem. In a PPP , companies such as GSK provide the R&D, technology , manufacturing and distribution expertise. Academic institutions may also be involved providing resear ch and disease area knowledge. Public sector partners, such as gover nments, or organisations such as the Gates Foundation, help fund the development and delivery costs and ensur e that medicines get to the people who need them. Funds are usually channelled through organisations such as the Medicines for MalariaVenture (MMV) or the Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). Importantly , any new treatments resulting from these research efforts are made accessible to the developingworld at an affordable price. Initial drug discovery for diseases of the developing world (DDW) takes place at our dedicated DDWDiscovery Centr e at Tres Cantos. GSK provides the facilities and meets all the costs of running the site. There are 100 scientists employed by GSK at Tres Cantos half of whom ar e subsidised by our partner organisations - the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (GA TB). Research programmes are overseen by joint steering committees with representatives from GSK and our partner organisations. As compounds move into clinical development, GSK provides the clinical, r egulatory and manufacturing expertise and resources through our global R&D and supply network. Partner organisations help fund the costof running clinical trials and addr ess issues of access and distribution. This reduces the costs of development and gets new pr oducts to patients faster . 14GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2Progress in 2005 Malaria In 2004, phase IIb clinical trials of our malaria vaccine for childr en, that has been in development for 15 years, showed unprecedented results. In 2005, new datapublished in the leading medical jour nal, the Lancet, showed that the vaccine r emained efficacious over 18 months. Several mor e years of clinical investigation will be needed befor e this vaccine is ready for use but these results indicate it has the potential to help save millions of childr en's lives. To support this activity, in October the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a grant to the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) to extend the public private partnership between MVI and GSK Biologicals. Most of the new grant will dir ectly support clinical trials in Africa. From its own funds, GSK will at least match the $21.4 million it r eceives fr om MVI, to help defray some of the clinical development costs.We are working with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and academic partners to develop CDA, an af fordable fixed- dose artemisinin combination treatment for in Africa, based on GSK's existing anti-malarial, Lapdap . In November 2005 we announced clinical r esults indicating that CDA is likely to be ef fective against drug r esistant P falciparum malaria as found in Africa. CDA has now progressed into phase lll trials. Dr Chris Hentschel, CEO of MMV commented, \"These r esults suggest that CDA could become a major weapon in the fight against drug- resistant malaria. Moving into phase III trials marks a key step in the development of this pr omising antimalarial.\" 15GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2 Development Pipeline at end of 2005 for diseases relevant to the developing world* Focus Pre-clinical Activity Phase I Phase II Phase III Havrix - A) Dengue e detailed information on our product pipeline can be found in the Annual Report **isoquine should enter phase 1 in 2006During 2005 GSK and the University of California, San Francisco received MMV's Project of the Year award for ourfalcipain project, investigating a new class of compoundsfor use against malaria. We are now conducting further research to identify candidate compounds for developmentin 2006. GSK also received the Project of the Year award in 2004 for our pyridones project. This is the first time that a company has won in successive years. Following extensive development work in 2005, we hope to identify a suitable candidate for our pyridones pr oject in the first half of 2006 and commence Phase I trials in humans in 2007. Significant chemical and pharmaceutical development was undertaken on our candidate GSK369796 (n-tertbutyl isoquine) for malaria and we plan to start clinical studies in humans in 2006. During 2005 we pr ogressed our clinical development pr ogramme for tafenoquine, a new antimalarial being developed in partnership with the US gover nment's W alter Reed Army Institute of Resear ch. Additionally, we have a number of other targets with potential potency against malaria that we are working onat our T res Cantos site or with our collaborators. HIV/AIDS In November 2005, GSK and the Institut Pasteur announced a new European collaboration to develop an AIDS vaccine by fusing genes fr om the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) onto an existing measles vaccine. GSK will license the measles vaccine vector technology from Institut Pasteur and the two entities will jointly develop the AIDS vaccine. The project is beingsupported by a \u20ac5.5 million (\u00a33.7 million) grant from the European Union and will include development of a production process for the experimental vaccine as well as two clinical studies. The first study will evaluate the safetyprofile of the vaccine candidate. The second will examine safety and whether the vaccine produces an immune response against HIV in volunteers with pre-existing immunity to measles. The clinical studies will begin in the third year of the five year collaboration. Earlier in 2005, we also launched a public private partnership with the Inter national AIDS V accine Initiative (IAVI) to develop an AIDS vaccine using nonhumanprimate adenovirus vector technology. The collaboration - the first-ever in AIDS vaccine research between IAVI and a major vaccine company - will facilitate research into vaccines against types of HIV that circulate predominantly in Africa. Under the agreement, IAVI will contributetechnical expertise and funding, and GSK and IAVI resear chers form a joint ch team. GSK Biologicals also has an in-house AIDS vaccine development project using the company's proprietaryadjuvant technology. A successful AIDS vaccine mightneed to combine several of these approaches. We had mixed results in our antiretrovirals research in 2005. In December we announced positive results from a study evaluating the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of our investigational protease inhibitor, brecanavir. Brecanavir is now expected to enter phase III development in 2006. If appr oved, it may be useful in treating patients infected with strains of HIV that have become resistant to multiple protease inhibitors. In October we terminated the clinical trial of aplavir oc, our CCR5 antagonist, due to concerns over liver toxicity. We are reviewing the safety data and following-up with all patients. The red tablet versions of our HIV/AIDS medicines Combivir and Epivir , developed to avoid diversion, became the first medicines of any kind to be granted a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.This opinion was granted under Article 58 of EURegulation 726/2004 which allows the EMEA to give a scientific opinion on medicines intended for use outside the EU. The EMEA can now grant a Certificate ofPharmaceutical Pr oduct to facilitate r egistration of these ARVs in developing countries. Liquid formulations of HIV medicines are currently the only way to treat very young children. However they are not always easy to use in a developing world setting and theWHO and UNICEF have stated that access to solidformulations would facilitate the treatment of olderchildren. We are currently assessing the development of ARV tablets with a score line which can be more easily broken into smaller doses. This will help physicians and carers administer the right dose efficiently and safely to children. We organised and hosted a meeting inSeptember 2005 with representatives from the EMEA, the FDA, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, UNICEF and the WHO to discuss the development of scored tablets for children. Our partners showed a great interest in this project and understood the challenges behind this development. We are now consolidating available information into a document for further discussion with regulators during the first half of 2006. GSK has entered into a material transfer agreement with the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) under which GSK will select and pr ovide proprietary anti-HIV compounds to be tested for possible use as microbicides to prevent transmission of HIV. 16GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2We are supporting clinical trials sponsored by external organisations - such as the WHO, the UK's MedicalResearch Council and US National Institutes of Health(NIH) - through our HIV-collaborative research programme for resource-poor settings. Twenty-four trials, including 18 in Africa, are currently underway mainly focusing on public health issues. Some 12,500 patients currently form, or will form, part of our HIV collaborative studies in the developing world. Tuberculosis (TB) TB kills 2 million people a year and is a leading cause of death amongst people with AIDS in the developing world.But no new drugs against TB have been discovered in more than 40 years. During 2005 GSK announced a joint drug discovery partnership with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (GATB), the leading public privatepartnership working on TB treatments. GATB aims to accelerate the discovery and development of affordable drugs that will shorten treatment and be effective againstmulti-drug-resistant strains of TB. All compounds will be scr eened to ensur e they can be taken with HIV treatments, since people living with AIDS are oftensusceptible to TB infection. GA TB will support 25 full-time scientists working exclusively on the TB drug pr ogramme at Tres Cantos. GSK will contribute a matching number of staff and all remaining overhead costs. Under this partnership, GSK is scr eening a number of compounds for possible use as new classes of drugs with potency against TB. Any medicines discovered will be made as affordableand accessible as possible to those most in need. GSK continues to pr ovide funds to the Faculty of Health Sciences at Stellenbosch University , South Africa for TB research projects. These projects aim to identify markers that can pr edict whether patients will r espond quickly to treatment or if TB is likely to recur. In October 2005, GSK and the Aeras Global TB V accine Foundation announced a new public-private partnership to develop GSK's TB candidate vaccine which has shown promising r esults in early-stage clinical trials. GSK and Aeras plan to conduct additional trials in Europe involving adults pr eviously infected with TB or vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). Studies will then begin in Africa and other locations to test the safety and efficacy ofthe vaccine candidate in populations highly af fected by TB.Rotavirus Our vaccine, Rotarix , for the prevention of rotavirus induced gastroenteritis, was launched in Mexico in January 2005 and has now been approved in 15 countries in LatinAmerica. By early 2006, four countries - Brazil, Panama, Venezuela and El Salvador - had decided to vaccinate all new-born babies. We have distributed 1.4 million doses in Latin America, enough for 700,000 babies. Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea and vomiting (gastroenteritis) in children under two andkills around 600,000 children each year - one child everyminute - mostly in developing countries. Rotarix was tested in the largest phase III clinical trial ever performed for a vaccine, involving over 60,000 children. Since its first launch, Rotarix has been licensed in several additional countries worldwide. W e continue to seek r egulatory approval for the vaccine in other developing countries. Cervical cancer Clinical trials data presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy(ICAAC) on our candidate cervical cancer vaccine, Cervarix, showed very encouraging results. Cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths in women in the developing world. Current published data suggest that the vaccine could r educe by 70% a woman's lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer . We plan to apply for registration of the vaccine in the US and Europe as well as our International region during 2006. Leishmaniasis During 2005 we continued intensive development of sitamaquine, a new oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. This disease affects half a million people a year in the developing world and is usually fatal if untreated. GSK is providing all the funding for this project. A new treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is urgently needed, since current medicines are either impractical or becoming ineffective due to drug resistance. Sitamaquine has shown good efficacy in pilot phase II trials. A further phase IIb study will start in 2006 to investigate a shorter treatment course and positive results will enable phase IIIstudies in 2007. 1HIV/AIDS, malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue fever , hepatitis E, N. meningitis, cer vical cancer and pneumonia 17GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2PREFERENTIAL PRICING Poverty, lack of political will and insufficient medical infrastructure (hospitals, clinics and health workers) are the biggest barriers to accessing healthcare in developingcountries. The affordability of medicines is also important and there are two elements to this. First is the ability of governments or patients to pay for medicines. Solving this problem willrequire governments and inter-governmental agencies tomake significant additional financial resources available. The second element is the price at which medicines are sold, an area GSK can help to address. We are making key medicines available to developing countries at moreaffordable prices. This is a major commitment that we call 'preferential pricing' which includes not-for-profit prices for the world's poorest countries, and discounted prices for wealthier developing countries. Other factors in the supply chain such as taxes, tariffs and distributormark-ups can also have a significant impact on the price of medicines. These factors are out of our control and should be addr essed by gover nments. All our HIV/AIDS and malaria treatments are available at not-for -profit prices to public sector customers and not-for -profit organisations in all the Least Developed Countries and sub-Saharan Africa, as well as countrieswith eligible Global Fund and PEPF AR projects. This means that our not-for-profit prices are offered in over100 countries. Our not-for-profit prices are sustainable - we do not make a pr ofit on them, but we do cover our manufacturing and distribution costs. Therefore we can continue to supply them in the long-term. Our not-for-profit prices are comparable with generics. Combivir , our leading ARV, is available at $0.65 a day including delivery costs. The latest (June 2005) pricing report by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res 1shows that the average cost of generic equivalents is $0.64 a day and the lowest priced generic equivalent costs $0.50 a day - the generic prices do not include shipping costs and insurance, which are included in our prices. We negotiate public sector prices with middle-income developing countries on a case-by-case basis, see above. 1http://www .accessmed-msf.org/prod/publications.asp?scntid= 28620051846504&contenttype=P ARA&GSK vaccines are also available at preferential prices. Here we work with multinational organisations such as UNICEF,the World Health Organization and the Pan AmericanHealth Organisation, governments and non-governmental organisations, to provide appropriate and affordablevaccines for the developing world. This includes basic polio vaccines as well as specially developed combination vaccines that target several diseases. In 2005, of the 1.2 billion vaccines we shipped, around 90% went to the developing world. Progress in 2005 In 2005 we shipped 45 million preferentially-priced Combivir tablets, with the majority of these going to Africa. This is a 40 % increase on last year and more than in the previous two years combined. Shipments of Epivir grew by 135% to 81m tablets. The number of arrangements we have in place for the supply ofpreferentially priced ARVs did not change significantlyduring the year . Overall shipments are relatively low considering the scale of the HIV/AIDS epidemic but the growth is encouraging.More doctors, hospitals and clinics are needed to treatmore patients and ensure better uptake of preferentiallypriced medicines. 18GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued219GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20052 Access to medicines continued Shipme nts of pr eferentially priced Combi vir and Epivir (excluding di verted stock) Shipme nts of pr eferentially priced Combi vir and Epivir (excluding di verted stock) - millions o f tablets Shipment s Y 2001 Y 2002 Y 2003 Y 2004 Y 2005 C ombivir 3 .5 6 .0 11. 0 3 2.0 45.0 Epivir 1.0 1.7 5.2 34. 4 8 1.3 Total 4 .5 7 .7 1 6.2 66. 4 1 26.32001Millions of tablets 2002020406080100120140 2003 2004 2005It is difficult to estimate the number of patients treated as a result of our preferential pricing agreements, since GSK does not control healthcare provision. A report from the UN-led Accelerating Access Initiative (AAI), suggests thatby September 2005 more than 582,000 people living withHIV/AIDS in developing countries were receiving treatmentwith at least one antiretroviral supplied by the seven pharmaceutical companies in the AAI (compared with 221,000 people on treatment in 2004). This includes341,000 patients in Africa. Much remains to be done, but this growth is encouraging. Middle income countries We can only afford to supply products at low prices in the world's poorest countries if we can still make an adequate return on them in wealthier markets. Nevertheless, we recognise that many middle-income countries also need assistance. We negotiate preferential pricing arrangements with middle-income countries on a case-by-case basis. W e believe this is the best approach since the disease burden, and resources available to address it vary significantly from country to country . These arrangements combine a viable and sustainable commercial return for GSK with increasedaffordability for the healthcare systems concerned. For several more developed countries we are also introducing discount cards for senior citizens, see developed world below. Anti-diversion measures Product diversion, where not-for-profit medicines are illegally shipped back for sale in wealthier countries, undermines our ability to pr ovide not-for -profit prices and denies treatment to the intended patients in poorer countries. W e have intr oduced dif ferent packaging and tablet colours for many of our not-for-profit medicines to help prevent product diversion. Special tri-lingual 'access ar Epivir and Trizivir in over 50 countries, and we have received regulatory approval for the red Epivir and Combivir tablets in over 25 countries. GSK has nine AR Vs register ed under the EU's Anti-Diversion Regulation. We are the only company to have r egister ed pr oducts under this r egulation. Extending preferential pricing We set up five pilot projects in collaboration with NGOs in Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Zambia and Malawi toassess the impact of extending preferential pricing to awider range of products, such as antibiotics and asthmatreatments. As expected we found that pricing is just one of a number of factors that affect the accessibility of medicines. Lack of healthcare capacity and infrastructure were more fundamental barriers. However, making our products available at more affordable prices did expandusage. There also appeared to be a preference for ourproducts over similarly priced generics. We are evaluating the findings fr om the pilots and will use them to inform a strategic review of our business in sub-Saharan Africa. 20GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2 Eligibility for not-for-profit prices Our not-for-profit prices are targeted at those countries where the need is greatest and the available resourcesare most lacking. These are the Least DevelopedCountries (LDCs) and all of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - a total of 64 countries. In addition, all private employers in sub-Saharan Africa who pr ovide care and treatment to their uninsured staff can purchase ourARVs at not-for-profit prices. The not-for-profit prices are also offered to all Country Co-ordinating Mechanism (CCM) pr ojects 2fully funded by the Global Fund and projects funded by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in their 15focus countries. In total our not-for-profit prices are therefore offered in over 100 countries. In our target countries we also seek not-for -profit arrangements to facilitate access for cor e public employees such as teachers, nurses, police and fir e- fighters who are not covered by private health insurance schemes. We negotiate prices with the private health sector on a case-by-case basis. We depend on revenues fromsales to the private market to maintain a local pr esence and much-needed infrastructur e in developing countries. W ithout this local capacity we would be unable to provide essential services such as traininghealthcare workers to use our products, productsupport, safety monitoring and registration and launchof new pr oducts. A list of pr oducts cover ed by not-for -profit prices and eligible countries is available on our website. 2The vast majority of Global Fund projects are Country Co-ordinating Mechanism (CCM) projectsVOLUNTARY LICENSING We want to play an active role in addressing the healthcare crisis in developing countries. We believe preferentialpricing arrangements are the best way to do this, becausewe are able to ensure delivery of a safe, quality product atan affordable price for as long as it is needed. This is where we focus our efforts. But in some situations voluntary licences may also help to increase the supply of medicines. Voluntary licences (VL) enable local manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of our products. In November 2005 we signed a licencing agreement with Universal Corporation of Kenya. In total we have nowsigned seven licencing agreements for our antiretrovirals(ARVs) in Africa, where HIV/AIDS is having a devastatingimpact. This includes two VLs in Kenya and five in South Africa, the first of which was granted to Aspen Pharmacare in October 2001. Some cover just parts ofAfrica and others all of sub-Saharan Africa. A decision to grant a VL depends on a number of factors including the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in that country , local healthcar e provision and the economic and manufacturing environment. VLs are not a universal solution to HIV/AIDS but a specific response to a particularset of circumstances. We discuss VLs with potential partners on a case-by-case basis. Selecting the most appr opriate licensee is key. We need to be sure that the manufacturer will be able toprovide a long-term supply of good-quality medicines andwill implement safeguar ds to prevent the diversion of medicines to wealthier markets. Voluntary licence holders can combine the active ingredients they have licensed from us with other licensed active ingredients to produce fixed dose combinations. They can also use the US Food and Drug Administration's fast track approval process for ARVs to accelerate the availability of generic ARVs for PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) program for programmes in Africa. There has been much discussion about the use of compulsory licences, under which intellectual property rights are taken away from rights holders. Compulsorylicenses are one of the flexibilities in the World Trade Organisation's TRIPs agreement on intellectual property,which can be used for humanitarian purposes. GSK believes that widespread use of compulsory licences willundermine the intellectual property framework and becounter-productive in the long term. R&D into newtreatments, especially where commercial markets exist, such as for HIV/AIDS, depends on protection for intellectual property. INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES GSK supports public and community health initiatives in developing countries through donations of preventativemedicines, and financial and practical support. We focus this charitable support on efforts to tackle three major diseases - lymphatic filariasis (LF or elephantiasis), HIV/AIDS and malaria - as well as our PHASE education programme to reduce diarrhoea-relateddisease. We partner with non-profit organisations toprogress these efforts. For more information on our community investment programmes in 2005, see Community Investment. Progress during 2005 Eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) GSK is a founding partner in the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF (www.filariasis.org). LF is a disfiguring diseaseprevalent in tropical countries and one of the world's leading causes of permanent disability. The Global Alliance is a partnership between pharmaceutical companies, the World Health Organization, Ministries of Health, NGOs and community organisations, aiming to totally eliminate LF by 2020. We have committed to pr ovide as many doses of albendazole, our anti-parasitic drug used to prevent transmission of LF , as are needed to treat the one billion people at risk in 80 countries. In 2005, we opened a new albendazole manufacturing facility in Cape T own, South Africa. This will give us the capability to support LF elimination efforts in all at-risk countries. In 2005, we donated 136 million albendazole treatments, worth \u00a314.3 million ($25.8 million) valued at wholesaleprices, to 36 countries. Two new countries joined theprogramme in 2005. We have donated over 400 million treatments since 1998, r eaching over 100 million people. We also gave almost \u00a31 million ($1.8 million) in grants during 2005 to support the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF . A team of GSK employees helps the Global Alliance in its advocacy , resear ch, community mobilisation and education initiatives. In December 2005, GSK's programme to eliminate LF won the top honour for Corporate Social Responsibility at the inaugural annual Scrip A wards, which recognise performance excellence in the global pharmaceutical and biotech industries. 21GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2Positive Action on HIV/AIDS We recognise the need to support the communities most affected by HIV/AIDS and have a longstanding commitment as part of our community investment. Set up in 1992,Positive Action aims to strengthen the capacity of community based organisations providing HIV/AIDS healthcare services and to increase the number of people coming forward for testing and treatment by reducingstigma and discrimination. It recognises that involving people affected by HIV/AIDS is key to controlling the HIV pandemic. We launched new Positive Action programmes in India, Kenya and Mexico during 2005, and we now have 20Positive Action programmes running in 30 countries. Positive Action is supporting the Reach India project which aims to make HIV/AIDS prevention, financial and business education available to millions of poor women in rural India. GSK is giving $500,000 (\u00a3275,000) that will be usedto develop the capacity of community organisations and self-help groups to reach women in rural areas. In its first three years, this is expected to benefit 500,000 womenand 2.5 million family members. Reach India is a project ofFreedom fr om Hunger supported by Catholic Relief Services and Positive Action. In Kenya GSK is giving \u00a31 million ($1.8 million) over three years to integrate HIV/AIDS treatment and support servicesinto 60 general healthcar e clinics. 3This will enable patients to avoid the stigma of visiting an HIV clinic. Fewer than 10% of Kenyans know their HIV status. Fear of stigmatisation is a significant barrier to people seekingtesting, diagnosis and tr eatment services. Positive Action will also focus on training for healthcare professionals and the cr eation of patient self-help gr oups to increase awareness and support patients in sticking to their treatment regimes. The programme is a collaboration between GSK, AMREF (the African Medical and Resear ch Foundation), Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the National Empowerment Network of People Livingwith HIV and AIDS in Kenya. In Mexico we launched a three-year project with the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, and its Mexican partner , Colectivo Sol. The project aims to improve quality of life for people with HIV/AIDS, r educe stigma and discrimination, and help people pr otect themselves against HIV/AIDS through education and awareness raising. For information on our arrangements to supply HIV/AIDS medicines at preferential prices to developing countries, see pr eferential pricing above. GSK's African Malaria Partnership Our African Malaria Partnership supports education and behaviour change programmes in eight African countries, through partnerships with Freedom from Hunger, AMREFand Plan International. GSK has invested $1.5 million in the African Malaria Partnership over three years. This is expected to benefit two million people by 2006, by encouraging effective prevention and prompt treatment, particularly among children and pregnant women. In 2005, we gave a further $1.5 million (\u00a3824,000) three- year grant to a new partner , the Malaria Consortium (a UK NGO), to launch Mobilising for Malaria . This initiative aims to focus attention on malaria and generate political commitment and sustained funding to combat the disease. It will generate media coverage, incr ease the number of NGOs and community organisations engagedin tackling malaria, and give more African communities the knowledge and tools they need to prevent transmission of malaria. Personal Hygiene & Sanitation Education (PHASE) Every year more than two million people die of diarrhoea- related disease, mostly children in developing countries. These deaths can often be easily pr evented thr ough better hand washing and sanitation. PHASE is helping to reduce diarrhoea-related disease by encouraging school childr en to wash their hands. GSK established PHASE in 1998 and has invested \u00a31.5 million ($2.7 million) in the programme. PHASE is run inpartnership with AMREF and Plan Inter national - as well as Ministries of Health and Education. The programme has had impressive results. For example, a study by AMREF in Kenya showed that after four years, 88% of childr en from participating schools washed their hands after using the toilet compar ed with 46% from non-participating schools. PHASE was extended to Bangladesh during 2005 and now operates in six countries. Bangladesh is the first Asiancountry to take part in PHASE. In its first year, the programme will be implemented in 64 schools, reaching20,000 children. GSK is working with a new partner in Bangladesh - Save the Children USA. PHASE will beintegrated into Save the Childr en's existing School Health and Nutrition Pr ogramme to ensure the project's long- term sustainability after GSK funding finishes. GSK has convened a PHASE steering committee with representatives from our partner organisations to help expand the programme into more countries. 22GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2 3Source: Kenya Demographic and Health Sur vey 2003 http://www.measuredhs.com/hivdata/DEVELOPED WORLD Access to medicines is not just an issue for the developing world. Even in developed countries some patients cannotafford the medicines they need. This is a particularproblem in the US where many people do not have health insurance. GSK has developed Patient Assistance Programs and discount cards in the US to help patients without insurance. We are also introducing discount cards in several middle- income countries to enable qualifying patients to obtain prescription medicines at a discount price. Programmes in the US Patient Assistance Programs provide prescription medicines to low-income, uninsured patients free or at minimal cost. GSK operates several programmes, including Commitment to Access which covers cancer treatments and Bridges to Access which covers other medicines for outpatients. Patients are registered through one phone call from apatient advocate and receive medicine at their localpharmacy or by mail or der. In 2005, 565,000 patients received GSK medicines worth $463.8 million through these pr ogrammes, compared with $372.5 million in 2004. The value of the medicines is calculated using thewholesale acquisition cost (W AC). GSK was the first pharmaceutical company in the US to offer a card providing savings on medicines to low-income senior citizens and disabled people. Known as the Orange Card this enabled these people to buy GSK outpatient prescription medicines at a discount of up to 40%. In 2005, 205,672 Orange Card holders r eceived 49,084 prescriptions, saving $5 million (based on WAC). In 2002, GSK and six other pharmaceutical companies established the Together Rx card which provided discounts on over 155 prescription medicines for low-income senior citizens who are eligible for Medicare. In 2005, 347,835people received 463,901 GSK prescriptions through this programme, saving $7.5 million (based on W AC). Our access programmes in the US will change significantly in 2006 with the launch of a new Medicar e prescription drug coverage programme. The Orange Card and Together Rx programmes finished on 31 December 2005 as those patients are now eligible for the new Medicare programme. We will report on the roll-out of thesechanges next year .In January 2005, GSK and nine other pharmaceutical companies created a new card to improve access tomedicines for other uninsured Americans, not just seniors.The Together Rx Access card provides savings of 25-40% on more than 275 medicines. Approximately 36 millionpeople, around 80% of uninsured people in the US, are eligible to enrol. The participating companies enrolled 353,113 people in 2005, who received 647,227 prescriptions worth $10.1 million (based on WAC). GSK assisted 10,947 of these patients, with 31,617prescriptions, worth $2.9 million. Orange Cards in middle income countries In 2004 GSK introduced Orange Cards providing discounts on certain GSK prescription medicines for eligible patients in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ukraine. The nature of the discounts varies between countries, depending on theneeds of the patient and the way in which the healthcaresystem operates. Our Orange Card in the Ukraine gives all asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who are under 25 or over 50, an average discount of 19% onGSK's Seretide asthma medicine. Asthma patients of anyage who suffer disabilities or who are affected by theChernobyl nuclear disaster are also eligible. Eligibility is assessed by the patient's doctor and patients can receive the medicine at participating pharmacies. A hotlinenumber has been set up to help patients find their near est pharmacy . In 2005, 3,500 patients enr olled and received discounts worth $176,000. In Lithuania, our Orange Card gives senior citizens an average discount of 40% on the patient co-payment on all GSK prescription medicines. So far more than 12,000patients have applied for an Orange Card and 155 pharmacies are registered to participate. In 2005, 3,000 patients received discounts worth \u00a320,000 ($36,400). InDecember we widened the group who are eligible for the Orange Card to include disabled people. A GSK Orange Card was also introduced in Bulgaria in May 2004 for low-income patients with chr onic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. Card holders receive an average 35% discount on four GSK prescription medicines. In 2005, 36,000 patients received discounts worth over Euro 1.4million ($1.75 million) 23GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Access to medicines continued2Summary of GSK discount programmes Country GSK Programme Number of Patients Value of Benefit to Patients US Patient Assistance Programs - Free or 565,000 received $464 million minimal cost medicines for low-income, prescriptionsuninsured patients.

GSK is one of several partners in MMV along with academic institutions, biotech firms and other pharmaceutical companies. One of our MMV projects is CDA, an affordable fixed- dose combination treatment for malaria in Africa. CDAis based on GSK' s Lapdap , itself one of the first new malaria treatments developed through a PPP . In 2005, clinical trials showed that CDA may be ef fective against drug r esistant malaria. A similar partnership, the Malaria Vaccine Initiative is accelerating the development of a malaria vaccine. GSK clinical trials in 2004 and 2005 showed that the vaccine, Mosquirix , is efficacious in children aged 1-5 over an 18 month period. This is the first time a vaccine has been pr oved efficacious against a parasitic disease in humans. These r esults demonstrate the feasibility of developing an efficacious vaccine against malaria that could significantly contribute to r educe the intolerable global bur den of this disease.A prescription for combating global diseases Malaria kills over one million people a year, mostly children in developing countries. Beyond the humantoll, malaria costs Africa at least $12 billion a year in lost growth and accounts for around 40% of public health spending. Until recently there was little research devoted to malaria and other developing world diseases. Developing countries often don' t have the money to pay for new medicines so there is little incentive for companies to develop them. In the last five years, public private partnerships (PPPs) have transformed the research landscape for malaria and other developing world diseases. GSK is involved in several such partnerships. In a PPP , public sector organisations including gover nments and private foundations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, help fund research and may also help developing countries purchase new products once they are registered.

New medicines and vaccines have brought huge benefits to the health and quality of life of millions of people over the last 100 years. But continued R&D remains as important as ever. There are still many serious, debilitating and life threatening illnesses for which there are no effective treatments or where treatments could be significantly improved.Research In 2005 we invested \u00a33.1 billion ($5.6 billion) and employed over 15,000 people in R&D. Our goal is to build the best product pipeline in the industry. Ourresearch aims to meet unmet medical needs. Our pipeline includes compounds with the potential to make a major contribution to healthcare in developing countries (see Access to medicines). Although this work is essential, there is often little or no return on investment for newtreatments in this area. We seek partners to help fundthese projects. Throughout the R&D pr ocess we seek the views of patients to inform our r esear ch. Focusing on patient needs drives innovation which brings commercial success. We recognise that biomedical and pharmaceutical resear ch raises ethical concerns - from the use of new technologies to the objective r eporting of clinical trial results. W e are committed to attaining high ethical and scientific standar ds in all our R&D work. This section explains our appr oach to: Animal research, and our efforts to reduce, refine and replace animal testing. The conduct of clinical trials. How we ensure GSK- sponsor ed clinical trials are carried out to the same ethical standards irrespective of where they areconducted. Training and auditing for clinical trials. How we train GSK employees involved in clinical trials and how we check that trials are carried out to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standar ds. Clinical trial information and results. How we publicly disclose trial information and results through journal articles, the GSK Clinical Trial Register and other public databases. Backgr ound information on our appr oach to new technologies is available on our website. ANIMAL RESEARCH Animal research is essential to understand disease and to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new medicines and vaccines before they are given to people. Regulations r equire new medicines to be tested on animals before being tested on humans for safety reasons. Some vaccines have to be tested on animals each time a new batch is pr oduced. W e estimate that animal r esear ch accounts for ar ound esear ch expenditur e. GSK has 14 animal research laboratories in Europe, Japan, Singapor e and the US. Some r esearch (around 7% of our total animal r esear ch) is conducted by exter nal contractors on our behalf. This percentage has remained relativelyconstant over the last thr ee years. Over 98% of the animals used by GSK are rodents (such as rats, mice, guinea pigs) and rabbits. The remaining 2% includes fish, ferrets, pigs, dogs, cats and primates. Our goal is to use animals only when scientifically necessary, and then to use as few animals as possible andminimise their distr ess. Our animal r esear ch laboratories are subject to strict internal and legal controls. GSK is committed to the 3Rs - reduction, refinement and replacement - and to achieving the highest standards of animal welfare. We run award programmes to encourage implementation of the 3Rs, share best practice with othersin our industry and communicate our approach to interested parties. This approach is having an impact. Despite a significant increase in R&D activity since 1994 the number of animals used by GSK in our laboratories is br oadly similar to that of eleven years ago.26GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3 1.1%Animals u sed by GSK in 2005 62% 30%6%Mous e Rat Guinea pig Othe r Rabbi t 0.3%0.6% Othe r rodent Animals used by GSK in 2005 Animal % Used Mouse 62.0% Rat 30. 0% Guinea pig 6. 0% Other 1.1% Rabbit 0 .6% Other rodent 0 .3%27GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20053 Research continued Change in R&D activi ty comp ared to chang e in nu mbe r of ani mals used in GSK resear ch labor atories (f igures n vels)* Chang e R& D act ivity compa red to ch ange in numb er als used in GSK researc h laboratorie s* Year A nimals Us ed Acivity 1994 1 00.0% 100 .0% 1995 8 5.9% 120 .4% 1996 8 3.1% 128 .8% 1997 8 03.3% .8% 2003 1 05.0% 195 .8% 2004 1 03.9% 203 .0% 2005 1 02.3% 227 .6% * Aro und 7% of ou r tota l animal research is condu cted by external con tract ors on our b ehalf.

Recent GSK advances in research techniques supporting the 3Rs and animal welfare: 1.Redesigning animal studies and r efining testing methods so that more outputs (e.g biomarkers similar to those measured in blood tests in human clinical trials) can be obtained from the same animal, while it is alive.This reduces the total number of animals needed toobtain this data. 2.Use of radio-telemetry technology that enables continuous measurements to be made (e.g. for bloodpressure, heart rate, and temperature), without disturbing or restraining the animal. 3.Observation of the night-time activity of marmoset monkeys which r esulted in impr ovements to their nest boxes for resting and sleeping. See our website for more background information on implementation of the 3Rs at GSK. Training and awareness We provide extensive training on the 3Rs to staff who are involved in the care and use of animals, and we have a number of initiatives to incr ease awar eness of animal welfar e. For example, we produce quarterly bulletins which review recently published journal and news items on these subjects. A UK-based 3Rs committee made up of GSK scientists, statisticians, senior managers, animal technicians and veterinarians encourages a 3Rs culture at GSK thr ough seminars and pr oduction and promotion of 'Recommended Practice' guidelines for scientific procedur es and animal welfar e. Our Animal Welfare Awards encourage employees to find alternatives to animal research. The awards, presented by GSK's R&D Chairman, recognise employees who have made outstanding advances in implementing the 3Rs. In 2005 awar ds wer e made for further development in the use of advanced medical imaging systems to minimise animal use. A GSK animal technician was awarded the 2004 Andrew Blake Tribute Award by Seriously Ill for Medical Research - the UK national patients' group in support of humaneanimal research - for a paper on 'Improvements in the housing, husbandry and welfare of ferrets at GSK'.Sharing best practice GSK participated in a study by the UK Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare on 'The use of animals in vaccine testing for humans'. Information on our work to develop new tests for vaccines, such as the replacement of primates with mice in testing for oral polio vaccines, is included in the final report published in March 2005, seehttp://www.apgaw.org/userimages/Vaccinetesting.pdf. The annual GSK Laboratory Animal Welfare Prize recognises external researchers or laboratories developingthe best new techniques for implementing the 3Rs. Fr om 2006, we will increase the prize to \u00a310,000 and it will be awarded through the new UK National Centre for the 3Rs. Together with industry partners in the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry , we ar e funding a new three-year post at the National Centre for the 3Rs to encourage sharing of industry best practice. Regulation and internal controls Our laboratories comply with strict national laws, guidelines and codes of conduct on animal welfare.Regulators carry out regular unannounced inspections of our sites to check standards of animal care. To ensure appropriate use of animals, all proposed animal tests must be r eviewed by our Ethical Review Committee. GSK laboratories, and any exter nal laboratories conducting research on our behalf, must follow our Code of Practice on animal research which includes best practice standards for animal care and use. We reviewed and updated our Code of Practice and Policies in 2005. 'Best practice' is defined as a combination of what is currently known from the scientific literature, from published recommendations, and from the knowledge of experts within and outside GSK. Independentaccreditation by the Association for the Accreditation and Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)International is one way laboratories can demonstrate that they meet best practice. Ten of our laboratories ar e accr edited by AAALAC including all our animal laboratories in Belgium, Italy, Spain, the UK and US. At pr esent the vast majority of the animals used by GSK are in AAALAC accredited facilities.We aim to achieve AAALAC accreditation for all our laboratories conducting animal r esear ch. Communicating our approach Animal testing is clearly a very sensitive issue and some people hold str ong views on it. We believe it is important 28GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3to explain the need for animal research and to be open about what we do. GSK took part in a two-year detailed ethical review by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics on 'The ethics of research involving animals' , published in 2005. This concluded thatanimals can be useful models for studying specific aspects of human biology and disease and the likely effects of chemicals and medicines in humans. However, the usefulness of animal models has to be judged on a case-by-case basis for each type of r esearch or testing. The report recommended that more information be made available on the goals and welfare implications of animalresearch and alternative scientific methods to enable interested parties to judge whether specific types of research are justifiable. It emphasised the importance of using alter natives to animal r esearch and the development of new alter native methods. It condemned the use of violence and intimidation by those opposed to animal resear ch. GSK endorses the r eport's findings. Our laboratories host visits from schools, colleges, animal welfare organisations and others. In 2005, we also madeover 25 visits to UK schools and about 10 visits to US schools and community groups to discuss issues around animal research. We engage regularly with animal welfareorganisations, our investors and other inter ested parties, as well as contributing to the debate in the media. In an article on animal research and the impact of animal rights extremism the Financial Times noted that \"GlaxoSmithKline has led the UK pharmaceutical industryin a cautious move towards more openness about its useof animals\" (20 October 2005). We accept the legitimate right to lawfully protest against animal r esear ch as a part of a fr ee society but condemn the use of violence and intimidation by those opposed to animal use. CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS The safety and effectiveness of new medicines must be evaluated in human clinical trials before they can beapproved for marketing. Regulators will only give approval if trials demonstrate that a product is safe and effective and that its benefits outweigh any risks from potentialside effects. A new product will typically be tested through three stages of clinical trials. These involve both healthy individuals and patients with the relevant disease. In 2005 there were 149 projects in clinical development. All clinical trials, wherever they are carried out, are conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP)guidelines developed by the International Conference onHarmonisation (ICH) and the principles contained in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on the'Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects' (2004). The ICH guidelines provide an internationally accepted ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials. They cover issues such as the selection andtraining of trial investigators, gaining informed consent from trial participants, monitoring and quality assurance. We have policies to ensure that medical practitioners running GSK-sponsor ed clinical trials are selected and recompensed appropriately. Our policy on Payments to Healthcare Practitioners and Institutions Conducting GSK-Sponsored or GSK-Supported Clinical Studies states thatclinical trial investigators must be selected solely on their qualifications to conduct clinical research. Their history of using GSK products must not be taken into account.Payments to practitioners reflect fair market value for thework performed and no payments ar e offered or made that could influence their judgement on whether to enr ol or maintain a participant in a clinical study Standards for clinical trials Trial protocols (the plan for how a clinical trial will be conducted) ar e reviewed by external regulatory agencies in the relevant countries when r equired and all protocols are considered by relevant ethical review committees whose remits cover the sites where studies will take place. An ethics review committee is composed of lay people, medical professionals and scientists. They assess whether a trial is justified and whether it is designed and will be conducted according to appropriate ethical standards. Ethics committees have the power to reject or stop aclinical trial. Safety data are routinely collected throughout development programmes and are reported to regulators in line with applicable r egulations as well as being reviewed by GSK on an ongoing basis for any safety signals. The GSK Global Safety Board is responsible both for approval of pivotal protocols and internal assessment of any issues related to patient safety that arise during thedevelopment programme. We audit clinical trials to ensure they are conducted to the appropriate standards, see Training and Auditing for Clinical Trials. 29GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3Clinical trials outside Western Europe and North America GSK conducts clinical trials to answer scientific questions and to meet regulatory requirements. We seek to conductclinical trials where: The population is relevant to the scientific question and where the results can be generalised to broaderpopulations. High quality data can be obtained. Costs can be minimised. Most clinical trials take place in Western Europe and North America. Trials in developing countries are also conductedto evaluate new medicines for many different diseases.These include diseases that were previously considered as only pr evalent in the developed world, but which ar e now common in developing countries. W e are ther efore looking to increase the number of patients we recruit into trials in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, South Americaand South Africa. In addition, GSK has an ongoing commitment to invest in r esear ch and development that targets diseases which disproportionately affect developing countries (e.g., malaria). Clinical trials indeveloping countries are usually required to develop these investigational compounds. It is important to notethat clinical trials of investigational medicines are not conducted in countries when it is known at the outsetthat there is no intent to pursue registration and make the medicine available for use in that country . Development of medicines GSK is starting to perform more trials in regions such as Central and Easter n Eur ope, South Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia. There are several reasons for this: Healthcare infrastructure and clinical trial capabilities in these r egions have improved significantly in recent years. For example, many physicians, now working in developing countries, have been trained and educated to global standards. Therefore, clinical trials can now be more readily conducted and ef fectively monitored in these countries. Changes in living standar ds mean diseases pr eviously common only in the developed world (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) are now becoming prevalent in developing countries. Including patients from many ethnic backgrounds enables us to develop medicines in a truly global fashion and helps us to evaluate whether newtreatments are suitable for different ethnic groups.As the number and scale of trials taking place in North America and Western Europe increases it is more difficultto find experienced investigators who are able to starttrials and recruit suitable patients quickly. Fewer patients are enrolled into trials in other countries so it is easier tofind participants. This speeds up the research process and helps ensure new medicines get to patients more quickly. Patients in these countries have often used fewer medicines than those in North America and WesternEurope. This makes them good candidates for a clinicaltrial because it is easier to assess the effect of themedicine being tested. Regulators around the world now require significant amounts of clinical data to approve a medicine. Thisimpacts both the pool of available patients in North America and Western Europe and increases the costs associated with conducting clinical trials in thesecountries. Recruitment costs per patient in countriesoutside North America and W estern Eur ope ar e lower , thereby allowing pharmaceutical companies to meet regulatory requirements and financial demands. Relevant populations GSK is committed to investing in R&D for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries, see Access to Medicines. These compounds must usually be tested through clinical trials in developing countries wherethe disease is prevalent and the medicine is relevant forthe local population. For example, the incidence of malariain the developed world is very low. This means we can only conduct scientifically r obust clinical trials for new malaria tr eatments in developing countries. There are concerns that trials in these regions may not be carried out to the same high standards as those in Western Europe and North America. GSK-sponsoredclinical trials ar e conducted to the same ethical standar ds irrespective of the location. All studies meet international and national r egulatory and legislative r equir ements and are conducted in accor dance with principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the principles contained in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on the 'Ethical Principles for Medical Resear ch Involving Human Subjects' (2004). In some of the least-developed countries additional measur es are often needed. For example, in cultures other than those in W estern society , while still complying with ethical and legal requirements, additional steps are taken to match the objectives of informed consent to local cultur e. For example local leaders and/or family members may need to be involved. 30GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3Post-trial treatment We are sometimes asked what happens to a patient's treatment at the end of a trial. It is important to realise that GSK is not, in general, responsible for the provision of nationally licensed medicines (treatments already approved for use) after a trial. For this reason, GSK-sponsored clinical trials in chronic conditions will not be carried out unless we are assured at the outset that the national healthcare system is able to provide, and is responsible for, the continued care of trial participants, after the trial. Importantly where patients are initiated on nationally licensed medicinesduring a trial in a chronic disease, we need to be assuredthat, where there are no suitable alternatives, these medicines will be made available after the trial to those patients who derived a measurable medical benefit. GSK also r ecognises that ther e may be cir cumstances when there is a compelling medical rationale for patients who have derived a measurable medical benefit from an investigational compound (a medicine that has not yet been approved) during a clinical trial to continue toreceive that compound. For example, if the illness beingtreated is life threatening or seriously debilitating andthere are no other treatments available or there are significant risks in switching patients to alternative treatments. When this is the case, post-trial treatmentwith the investigational compound is pr ovided with appropriate oversight, for example in a clinical trial setting. GSK commits to provide the investigationalcompound for as long as necessary or until thecompound is approved and licensed in that country. TRAINING AND AUDITING FOR CLINICAL TRIALS We provide training to ensure that clinical trials are performed to high ethical and quality standards. We audit the conduct of clinical trials to ensur e they ar e carried out accor ding to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. All employees involved in designing, conducting and monitoring GSK-sponsored trials are trained in GCP . Training is mandatory and employees must have completed the r equir ed training before starting or changing jobs. In 2005 ther e were 13,085 training activities r elated to GCP . Each 'training activity' represents a successful completion of an e-lear ning module or instructor-led course related to GCP by one of our employees or complementary workers. We keep detailed training records which are routinely requested by regulatory authorities when undertaking an inspection to assess the competence of employeesundertaking clinical trials. GSK's internal audit department conducts audits of GSK systems and processes involved in the conduct of trials, as well as auditing clinical research organisations and investigators performing clinical research on our behalf. In 2005, 170 audits were conducted: 106 audits of investigator sites conducting GSK- sponsored trials. This represents approximately 5% of investigator sites participating in pivotal clinical trials(pivotal clinical trials ar e those trials that provide the primary data on which regulatory approval is based). 13 audits of internal GSK systems and processes used in managing clinical trials/data. 32 audits of clinical research organisations carrying out clinical trials on GSK' s behalf. 9 audits of GSK Medical Departments based in specific countries. 10 audits conducted in response to suspected irregularities. In 2005, these audits r esulted in 127 findings that needed further investigation and 3 investigators wer e reported to regulatory agencies. Audit results are reported quarterly to the R&D Risk Management & Compliance Board, and annually to the GSK Audit Committee. Any concerns or issues identifiedduring audits are fully investigated and appropriate action taken. This may include r etraining or, in severe cases, dismissal for the individuals concerned as well as development of new training programmes or procedures to prevent a reoccurrence. Trial data may also be re- analysed. Inspections of investigators, clinical research organisations, independent ethics committees (IECs)/Institutional ReviewBoards (IRBs) and sponsors of clinical trails ar e also carried out by regulatory authorities to ensure the safety of trial participants, the quality of data, and that trials areconducted accor ding to GCP . During 2005 there were more than 50 such inspections of GSK and investigators used by GSK to conduct clinical studies. 31GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION AND RESULTS We make the results of our clinical trials widely available to healthcare practitioners and others who use or evaluatethe use of our medicines. We also publicly disclose information on ongoing trials. Ongoing clinical trials Publicly available internet-based registration of ongoing clinical trials can provide a stimulus for increased participation in clinical research. It also provides animportant reference point so interested parties can track the subsequent disclosure of clinical trial results. GSK is legally required to post summary protocol information for ongoing studies of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases conducted under a USInvestigational New Drug Application on the National Institutes of Health website (www.ClinicalTrials.gov).During 2005, we made an additional commitment to postprotocol summaries of all patient clinical trials, irrespectiveof the countries involved, initiated on or after 1 November 2004 or ongoing as of 1 July 2005 to clinicaltrials.gov . At the end of 2005 there were 159 protocol summaries of actively recruiting clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov. Our postings meet the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Jour nal editors. For non-phase III trials, our policy is to delay r egistration of certain data elements on an exceptional basis when they arecompetitively sensitive. Clinical trial r esults Pharmaceutical companies are legally required to disclose all relevant data from clinical trials to the appropriate regulatory authorities when seeking appr oval for a new product. After appr oval, sponsors have a continuing obligation to provide regulatory authorities with updated safety information fr om clinical trials. This ensures regulators can accurately assess the safety and ef fectiveness of new medicines and monitor their safety. Safety and efficacy information is pr ovided to doctors thr ough pr escribing information which is approved by regulators. In addition ther e is a need to use other ways to appropriately communicate the results of our clinical trials to healthcar e practitioners and others who use or evaluate the use of our medicines.GSK follows the PhRMA Principles on the Conduct of Clinical Trials and the Communication of Clinical TrialResults and is committed to timely communication ofresults for all products approved for marketing. Wherever possible we publish our trial results in peer- reviewed scientific and medical journals, or in conference abstracts and proceedings. These are used by research and healthcare communities to obtain the latest information on treatments. GSK cannot guarantee publication by these methods since this is at the discretion of journal editors and conferenceorganisers. For this reason, we launched the GSK onlineClinical T rial Register in 2004, to supplement prescribing information and publications in the scientific literature. The r egister contains results and protocol information from GSK-sponsor ed trials of marketed medicines. It also provides r eferences to publications that have appeared in medical journals. Anyone can use the internet to access the register . There have been concerns about ghost writing of journal articles, where doctors put their names to articles writtenby pharmaceutical companies. GSK' s approach is that authorship and acknowledgements for articles must be consistent with journal guidelines and must bedetermined based on the level of contribution to studydesign, data acquisition, analysis and interpr etation, and writing or revising the manuscript. The named senior author for a paper must actively participate in the drafting process and lead the content development of manuscripts. The senior author works closely with co-authors and retains final approval authority for themanuscript. Any GSK staf f or contractors who contribute to the development of manuscripts for external authors must be named in the article. Activity in 2005 At the end of 2005 ther e wer e 2,125 clinical trial summaries on the GSK Clinical Trial Register (http://ctr.gsk.co.uk/welcome.asp). This includes over 98% of the clinical trials of our major marketed pr oducts which have been completed since the merger of GSK or were completed before the merger and are likely to inform medical judgement. We are continuing to populate the register with clinical trials that relate to other marketedmedicines and this will be completed during 2006. 32GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued333GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20053 Research continued Number o f publications of GSK cl inical trials on the GSK Clinical Trial Register (cumulat ive tot al) Number of publications of GSK cl inical trials on t he GSK Clinical Trial Register (cumulative tota l) Year P ublications 2004 1 43 2005 2 ,125 2004Number of publications 200505001000150020002500 Our objective is to publish trial r esults for all new pr oducts within 10 months of the product reaching the market and to publish the results of trials completed after a product is approved for marketing within one year of trial completion. An independent assessment of documentation pr ocesses and procedures used by GSK in populating the Clinical Trial Register (http://ctr.gsk.co.uk/welcome.asp) has been conducted by an external organisation. We will continue to engage the services of this organisation to ensure thatGSK complies with the corporate policies and pr ocedur es that it has established to fulfill our commitment to make information from our clinical research activities available to the public. In addition we are actively involved in sharingour views and experiences on clinical trial registrationthrough an advisory board process established by the World Health Organization which is establishing an International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/).34GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Research continued3 and potent compound that was first tested in human clinical trials in 1993. With complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes, the failure rate in research is high. Despite significant investment in R&D by the pharmaceutical industry, no new drugs were introduced for more than 40 yearsbefore insulin sensitisers, such as Avandia , became available. Avandia has now been used by more than seven million people worldwide, helping them to control their disease and improve their quality of life. Diabetes r esearch at GSK has not stopped. We are investing more than \u00a3175 million in several large outcome studies to assess the effect of Avandia on the long-term complications of diabetes and to see whether it can be used to pr event at-risk people from developing the disease. Two new combination treatments, Avandamet and Avandaryl , have been launched that combine A vandia with other diabetes treatments. This makes it easier for patients to maintain their treatment regime. GSK has anothernovel diabetes drugs in clinical trials and an ongoingresear ch pr ogramme at our metabolic r esear ch centr e in North Carolina. The rapid incr ease in obesity , a major cause of type 2 diabetes, and the appearance of the disease in children, makes this r esear ch mor e important than ever . Diabetes research at GSK Avandia , for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, is one of GSK's top selling medicines. Avandia was launched in 1999 but it is the outcome of research that begansome 20 years earlier. Type 2 diabetes has two causes - an inability to produce enough insulin; and insulin resistance, an inability to respond to insulin that is available. It causesa rise in blood sugar which can have devastating consequences for the patient including blindness, heart attacks and strokes. Beecham, a GSK legacy company, began researching type 2 diabetes in the 1970s. At that time there weretwo types of oral sugar-lowering drugs available. These worked by stimulating the body to pr oduce more insulin or by helping the liver to control blood sugar levels. But the tr eatments were not successful for everybody . Furthermor e, no diabetes treatment remains effective in one patient forever. As the disease progresses, patients must combine a number of different drugs. Beecham focused its research on treatments that used a new mechanism - combating insulin r esistance - an area that little was known about. It took about six years of research before a promising compound was identified. By 1990 the team had developed a novel CASE STUDY1 Introduction 2Access to medicine 3 Research 4Ethical conduct Page Code of Conduct 35 Marketing ethics 36 Marketing codes of practice 37 Consumer advertising 38 Training and awareness 39 Monitoring and compliance 40 5 Employment practices 6 Human rights7 Environment 8 Community investment9 Data summary 4Ethical conduct35GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20054 GSK is fully committed to ensuring that our business practices meet high standards of ethics and legal compliance and that our employees behave with honesty and integrity. It is important that we get this right. The way we conduct our business affects the patients and consumers who use our products, the doctors who prescribe our medicines,the governments that regulate our industry, and our reputation. Our reputation with these stakeholders is critical to our business. Our reputation also affects our ability to attract, retain and motivate the best people. Meeting high ethical standards enables us to maintain the support of these stakeholders and retain our 'licence to operate'. Ethical conduct This section explains our approach to business and marketing ethics and our performance in 2005. It covers: GSK's Code of Conduct and management certification on business ethics. Our approach to marketing ethics, including our marketing codes of practice and updated policy ondirect-to-consumer advertising. Training and awareness programmes to reinforce the importance of ethical conduct and to ensure that employees understand what standards of behaviour are required. Monitoring and compliance systems, including the role of our Corporate Ethics and Compliance department,channels for r eceiving reports of alleged cases of misconduct and data on the number of employees dismissed or disciplined for violating company policies including our Code of Conduct. Information on ethical issues in R&D is available in the Research section of this report. This includes our policies governing our relationship with doctors involved in clinicaltrials (see Conduct of Clinical T rials) and our policy on disclosure of clinical trial results and writing of articles for medical journals (see Clinical Trial Information and Results). Information on our relationships with governments is available in the section on Government and external affairs. For our policies on making our products more widely available, see Access to medicines. More background information on our ethics policies is available on our website. CODE OF CONDUCT Our Employee Guide to Business Conduct sets out the standards of behaviour we expect from employees as well as the key compliance and ethics policies that guide our business activities. It r equir es all employees to act with integrity , comply with the law , avoid conflicts of inter est and report any violations of the law or GSK's policies or any unethical behaviour. Guidance is provided, including real-life examples, on what constitutes acceptable or unacceptable behaviour.GSK employees have access to the guide via the companyintranet. Our induction training familiarises new employees with business conduct standar ds and provides information on where they can obtain support andanswers to questions. Management certification on business ethics Commitment to our Code of Conduct is reinforced by an annual management certification programme. Thisrequires managers to certify that they comply with the statement below. In 2005 we expanded the programmeto include over 12,000 managers worldwide. Eligiblemanagers fr om all business units worldwide have completed the certification. Certification documentation is managed electr onically and non-certification is tracked and followed up. Non-certification is typically due to extended leave of absence, such as maternity leave or long-term sick leave.The full certification statement is reproduced below. The links have not been included below, as they are onlyaccessible via the internal intranet. However, the Code ofConduct and The Employee Guide to Business Conduct documents are available from the 'Responsibility' sectionof www.gsk.com. \"I certify that: I understand that GSK is committed to the principle of 'Performance with Integrity ' , and in particular, to ensuring that its activities comply with all applicable laws. I have received a copy of or have access to the GSK Code of Conduct (POL-GSK-001) and otherGSK corporate policies through the Corporate Policy Index page at [link to intranet site] I have read and understand The Employee Guide to Business Conduct, accessible at [link to intranet site] I have complied with applicable laws, regulations, and GSK corporate and localpolicies and procedures.

I understand my responsibility to promptly report any actual or suspected violations of the law, regulations, or GSK corporate and local policies and procedures. I have reported all actual or potential compliance issues of which I am awareconcerning legal requirements or companypolicies. Exceptions (list any compliance issues that should have been reported previously but were not):\" In three markets, France, Germany and Belgium the statement and certification process are slightly different to reflect local legal requirements. Business ethics and our suppliers In 2005 GSK produced a booklet to help suppliers to understand the requirements that they must meet in order to work with GSK. The booklet outlines the importance that GSK places on operating to high ethical standards and includes reference to the GSK policy, to which GSK employees are bound, that prohibits the acceptance of gifts and entertainment. In working with GSK, suppliers are asked to understand and respect this position and as a supplier to GSK, they are asked to adopt and follow thesame high standards within their business and in their interactions with GSK. MARKETING ETHICS GSK markets its medicines to doctors, hospitals and governments. In some countries, such as the US andJapan, we also advertise medicines directly to consumers. Our specialist sales r epresentatives meet r egularly with doctors and pharmacists to inform them about our medicines and their approved uses. We believe that our sales representatives play an important role in providing up-to-date information to doctors on our products and their benefits to patients. However , we recognise that the marketing of pharmaceutical products raises some challenging issues. In particular, some people are concerned that marketingby pharmaceutical companies exerts undue influence on doctors, that sales representatives do not always givedoctors full information about potential side ef fects, or that promotion for unapproved uses may be common despite incr eased compliance training and monitoring activity and oversight by governments. The sale and promotion of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated by governments and medical agencies. Several governments are extending legislation in this area.For instance, in the US, there are 39 proposed laws pending in 20 state legislatures that could require pharmaceutical companies to restrict or report on interactions with doctors. All GSK employees must also comply with our Marketing Codes of Practice and our policies governing consumer advertising. These codes require that marketing be based on valid scientific evidence, be consistent with national prescribing documentation, and comply with the law. 36GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued4During 2005 we have updated and strengthened our policies and procedures. Sales and marketing employees receive training to ensure they have a good understanding of our marketing policies and the legal framework governing their sales activities.We also have programmes to monitor compliance, including in some regions feedback from doctors on our sales practices. In 2005, GSK was rated third in a survey of French doctors conducted by Insemma Marketing Research Institute that assessed how well 26 pharmaceutical companies complywith the industry marketing code. Doctors ar e noticing that GSK is taking a leadership stance in the ar eas of gifts and entertainment in particular. Reactions vary from \"well done GSK for setting a good example that others in the industry should follow\" (themajority r eaction) to \"if you won' t pay for my spouse to travel, I'll go with another company who will\" (the minority reaction). In one particular case in the UK recently, GSK offered to sponsor a doctor to attend acongress. He asked for GSK to pay for his wife toaccompany him to the congr ess. The GSK manager refused the request, as this is contrary to our marketing code of practice. The doctor was sponsored by anothercompany to attend the congr ess. Marketing codes of practice Our Pharmaceutical Marketing and Promotional Activity policy applies to all employees and agents. It commits us to promotional practices that are ethical, responsible, principled and patient-centred. It prohibits kickbacks, bribery or other inducements to doctors. This policy is supported by r egional marketing practices codes in Eur ope, our Inter national region, Japan and the US. These codes apply the same ethical standards but reflect dif ferences in market structures, national healthcare systems and regulations. They incorporate the principles of industry codes of practice such as the EFPIA, IFPMA, JPMA, and PhRMA marketing codes. The codes explain our policies on issues such as:Providing full and accurate information - information can only be provided on approved uses for a medicine.Information must be accurate, balanced, fair, objective, unambiguous and up-to-date. Gifts to healthcare professionals - gifts must be given only occasionally and must be r elevant to the practice of medicine. Gifts cannot be made as an inducement to prescribe any of our medicines.Appropriate hospitality for meetings - no entertainment is permitted. Hospitality (such as travel costs or food)may only be provided for meetings with an educationalpurpose. The level of hospitality must be appropriate to the occasion and must only be provided for relevanthealthcare professionals, not spouses, children, office personnel, or any other guests. Travel costs are not provided in the US. Our regional codes are available in more than 30 local languages and employees can access them via theintranet. All sales and marketing staff receive training on the codes; see Training and Awareness. A copy of the GSK Eur opean Promotion of Medicines Code of Practice is available in our online report. Progress in 2005 In 2005, GSK's president of pharmaceutical operations and his dir ect reports conducted a r eview of our regional marketing codes to confirm that GSK' s codes ar e comprehensive and consistently applied in all regions. We identified certain areas for improvement, and willupdate the codes in 2006 accordingly. Changes will include r educing the maximum value of nominal gifts to healthcare professionals to $10 (less than \u00a36), andprohibiting gifts and entertainment for medicalprofessionals retained as consultants to GSK. We will also ensur e that decisions about grants for medical education, and about donations for charitable purposes, are reviewedby departments independent of sales and marketing. We launched a new procedure in Europe on sponsored attendance of doctors at medical conferences. This procedur e specifies the cir cumstances under which sponsorship is appropriate and governs the provision of appropriate travel, meals and accommodation. Compliance with policies and procedures is a formal performance objective for sales and marketing employees in the US. This is evaluated as part of employeeperformance reviews, thus encouraging employees to viewcompliance as an integral part of their overall performance. US employees in our pharmaceutical business were appraised against the following objective in 2005: \"Consistently follow company policies and procedures, take and complete required compliance training in a timely manner , and report compliance issues to manager, Legal or Compliance.\" 37GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued4In addition, managers are evaluated against the following objective: \"Ensure that supervised employees are trained on company policies and procedures and have taken all required training, and provide oversight anddirection to supervised employees so that they are in compliance with company policies and procedures.\" Consumer advertising This section explains our appr oach to advertising our prescription medicines in the US and our advertising for our consumer healthcare products in other markets. Direct-to-consumer advertising In the US* we advertise our prescription medicines to consumers through TV and print advertisements. This is known as dir ect-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. DTC advertising is not permitted in most other markets, although New Zealand, Bangladesh and Korea do allowlimited DTC advertising. Promoting the use of prescription drugs directly to consumers can be controversial. Critics believe that itencourages people to r equest unnecessary tr eatment, adding to the bur den on healthcar esystems. We believe that responsible pharmaceutical advertising is a useful source of health information for patients. It helps to increase awareness of conditions patients mightnot appreciate or otherwise know about and educatespatients about treatment options. Patients must still consult with their physicians about their condition, theappropriateness of a pr escription medicine, and obtain his or her consent before receiving such medicines. In countries such as the US wher eDTC advertising is common industry practice, we need to ensure that our products are also promoted in this way. In Bangladesh, we run a DTC campaign for our vaccines, which includes a television commer cial and newspaper advertisements. This campaign is titled 'vaccination for all' and has been run over a period of three years. It won theInternational Commer cial Excellence Exchange A ward 2003 (an inter nal GSK awar d)and has been appr oved by the local regulatory authority. In 2005, the US pharmaceutical industry association, PhRMA, intr oduced new Guiding Principles on DTC advertising for pr escription medicines. These wer e launched in January 2006. The principles state that companies should spend an appropriate amount of time educating doctors and healthcare professionals about new drugs beforeconsumer advertising begins. Advertising should bedesigned to educate consumers about the medicine and the condition for which it is prescribed. DTC advertisingfor pharmaceuticals must be accurate and supported byevidence. It must also include information on the risks and benefits of treatments and other options such as diet andlifestyle changes. The principles are available at www.phrma.org. GSK was an early supporter of the new principles and we have reviewed and updated our marketing policies to incorporate all of the PhRMA Guiding Principles, as well as additional requirements, and to ensure compliance withthem. Some new provisions implemented in our updatedDTC policy include: Elimination of 'reminder' advertisements - short advertisements that mention the pharmaceutical brand name but not the medical condition it isdesigned to tr eat Submission of new television ads to FDA for review at least 30 days in advance and at the stage ofdevelopment where audio and visual components areavailable. Providing information on other tr eatment options (such as diet and lifestyle changes) for the advertised condition, where such treatment options are referenced in the prescribing information for a product. Requiring a reference to PhRMA's Partnership for Prescription Assistance in branded print ads andbranded websites - this programme directs patients to members companies' low income Patient AssistancePrograms. Marketing practices for non-pharmaceutical products We advertise our over-the-counter medicines, oral healthcar eproducts, and nutritional products to consumers worldwide. Our advertising is gover ned by national regulations or codes of practice for advertising.Our inter nal policies and procedures meet or exceed local laws. Advertising of consumer healthcare medicines and nutritionals is generally subject to less stringent direct-to- consumer advertising requirements than prescriptionmedicines. GSK Consumer Healthcare has globaladvertising guidelines which r equire that claims in consumer healthcar emedicine advertisements be consistent with product labelling. In markets that allow comparative advertisements, GSK Consumer Healthcare guidelines r equire that a comparison of a GSK product to acompetitor' sbe supported by adequate data. 38GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued4 *In a pr evious version of this report we incorrectly stated that we advertise our prescription medicines to consumers in Japan. Advertising of prescription medicines to consumers is illegal in Japan. We do not advertise prescription medicines to consumers in Japan, however we do run DTC advertisments to raise awareness of disease among patients and the general public without mentioning prescription brandsIn the UK, there are concerns that advertising for food and drink is contributing to the rise of childhood obesity.The UK Government's Health Select Committee has made recommendations for tackling obesity, including restrictions on advertising to children and the placementof vending machines in schools. GSK Consumer Healthcare has guidelines for advertising to children that meet or exceed local laws and codes of practice. The guidelines on advertising to children prohibit drug advertising designed to appeal to, or targeted at, children below the legally mandated minimum age. Forexample, in the UK we do not buy advertising space inchildren's media and we do not supply vending machines to primary schools. Sports star sponsorship is important to brands such as Lucozade Sport . Our guidelines on sponsorship state that only people who set an appr opriate example should be used for sponsorship, and they should have an appeal that is not solely to childr en below the age of 13. In the US, advertising of over-the-counter medicines must comply with governmental advertising guidelines. Anadvertiser must have a r easonable basis for making a claim before publishing it. Comparative advertising of over-the- counter medicines is permitted in the US as long as theclaims ar e truthful and not misleading. Consumer testimonials and celebrity endorsements ar e permitted as long as the statements made reflect the honest opinion of the speaker , are true and not deceptive. GSK Consumer Healthcar e is a member of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA) which has a voluntary Code of Advertising Practices forNonprescription Medicines. The guidelines advise against practices such as advertising that implies a casual attitude toward using drugs and suggests an over-the-counter drug can prevent or cure a serious disease that must be treated by a licensed practitioner. GSK ConsumerHealthcare advertising is reviewed to ensure it meets government and industry standards. TRAINING AND AWARENESS We have training and awareness programmes to make sure employees understand our policies, comply with the law and know what standar ds of behaviour ar e required. Training starts with an induction course for new employees in the UK and the US. This covers the GSKCode of Conduct and other relevant policies. Inductiontraining for new sales and marketing employees covers our marketing codes of practice. These induction coursesensure that new employees understand the importance of ethical conduct from day one, know how to deal with dilemmas and where to seek help. We provide additional training for employees who will be working in areas where there are additional regulatory requirements such as R&D, manufacturing and sales and marketing. Sales representatives receive detailed training on the medicines they promote and the diseases they aredesigned to treat. Sales employees are given training onappropriate marketing practices and are required to pass a test on our marketing code before starting their sales role. Regular refresher courses are held for all sales and marketing employees at least annually. For example, in some markets, employees look at examples of ethicaldilemmas and issues that they could face in their work and guidance is provided to help them understand appropriate responses. Employees are encouraged to askthemselves the following questions before making adecision: Would I be embarrassed if my friends or family knew what decision I have made? How would my decision look to a cynic? What could the newspaper headline look like? Am I still confident that this is the right decision for GSK? We monitor the success of our training and awareness programmes. For example in the US we conduct surveys of GSK sales representatives. In 2005, the survey revealed that: More than 98% of employees rated efforts to promote compliance as effective. More than 90% of representatives correctly answered questions on the promotional materials and sample management policies. Over 175 employees suggested solutions to handle compliance challenges. We also conduct a global management survey every two years. The 2004 survey showed that 92% of managerssaid they understood how the GSK Code of Conduct applied to their jobs. 39GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued4Activity during 2005 We launched a new half day workshop on \"Ethical Decision Making\" , which was attended by almost 500 senior managers in the US and UK, including staff incorporate functions (such as Finance, HR, IT and Communications). This workshop gave participants practical tools to help with making ethical decisions, and highlighted managers' obligations under the Employee Guide to Business Conduct and the risks associated with non-compliance. The managers who attended the \"Ethical Decision Making\" workshops chose to attend. It was recognisedthat there is a need to involve and engage more managersthroughout GSK on an ongoing basis. So, in 2006 we will launch an additional ethics eLearning and face-to-face training package for managers. Over 1,000 new sales and marketing staf f in the US received training on compliance policies and more than 10,000 existing staff received two hours of annual refresher training in 2005. We do not track sales and marketing training hours in other countries. Antherinitiative to improve employee understanding is a yearlybulletin launched by the US Pharma Compliance Office on the major types of unethical conduct detected and the actions taken. Over 1,200 R&D employees completed the 'Performing with Integrity' course during 2005. This course was established in 2004, when more than 9,000 R&D employees completed the course. This includes training on the Code of Conduct, and our policies on Conflicts of Interest and Acceptance of Gifts and Entertainment by GSK employees. Objectives for 2006 Review the 'Performance with Integrity' face-to-face induction training session and make appr opriate changes for new staf f in the UK and the US during 2006. Launch an additional ethics eLearning and face-to-face training package, building on the 'Ethical Decision Making' workshop for managers.MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE We recognise that strong policies, codes of practice, and good training do not guarantee that all employees willmeet our standards. Our internal compliance systems aredesigned to identify and address breaches of our codes. This section covers: The role of our Corporate Ethics and Compliance department. Channels for employees to report concerns or suspected cases of misconduct. The number and type of contacts through these channels in 2005. How we address misconduct. The number of employees dismissed or disciplined for misconduct in 2005. Corporate Ethics & Compliance function Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance department works with the GSK business units to promote effective risk management and compliance programmes, identify and address compliance issues, and to ensur e appr opriate oversight and upward reporting for GSK senior management and the Board. We now have a dedicated,full-time compliance officer in each of our seven major business units - R&D, Manufacturing, Biologicals, Pharma Europe, International Pharma, Japan Pharma and USPharma, in addition to the corporate compliance of ficer, who reports directly to the CEO. Compliance officers are senior managers with direct access to the leadership teams of GSK functions. They ar e a source of expertise for anyone with a question on ethics or compliance with GSK policies. Compliance officers define training needs and communicate the latest developments on new policies and legislation affectingGSK, as well as deliver training and assess compliance issues in their business units. Many markets also appoint local compliance champions. In the US we appointed four compliance staff as sales and marketing compliance advisers. Their role will be to provide feedback on infractions, conduct customised training, and recommend process improvements. We have also hired and trained staff for a new compliance data analysis and reporting group. This group has alreadybegun to analyse monitoring and investigation data to highlight suitable areas for focus and follow up for eachbusiness unit in the US. 40GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued4Sales representatives are supervised by sales managers who regularly monitor educational events, visits to doctors, and expenses. We also have independent monitors to review records in a number of key risk areas inthe US. Our internal audit department continues to deploysignificant resources to provide regular audits of businessprocesses, including auditing our sales and marketing practices globally. As a result of the audit findings the decision making process for grants and donations is beingupdated. In Europe and our International region, these decisions will now be made by the relevant medical department, instead of commercial staff. The European code of marketing practice includes a quarterly reporting mechanism where the markets confirmwhether any breaches of the code of practice haveoccurred, the severity of any breaches and what actions have been taken to prevent recurrence. These reports are reviewed by senior managers. A similar procedure formonitoring expenses was launched in 2005, whichhighlighted some inconsistencies acr oss countries, and other areas for improvement. During 2006, the countries in our Eur opean r egion will receive more central direction regarding monitoring of expenses and other r elevant expenditure. Reporting channels Employees ar e encouraged to seek help and to report any concer ns or suspected cases of misconduct. They can do this thr ough their line management, a compliance of ficer, or through our confidential Integrity Helplines or offsitepost office box (in the US). The Helplines and post office box are promoted through the Employee Guide to Business Conduct, on the GSK intranet and during training. The Corporate Ethics and Compliance function is promoted as a source of information and advice, as well as a mechanism for reporting concerns. In 2005 there were: 3,644 contacts with the compliance functions, mainly in the US. This is an increase from 2,593 last year. Of these, 77% were from employees seeking advice or information; 23% were from employees reportingsuspected cases of misconduct. Outside the US, mechanisms to track this information are evolving with general tr ends and issues being visible to senior management and addr essed thr ough action wher e necessary.Doctors can raise any concerns or report unethical conduct by GSK sales representatives through ourcustomer response centres, during our market research or via industry associations such as PhRMA and the ABPI. Staff retrained to deal with concerns about marketingpractices that might be raised by healthcare professionals, patients or the public. They redirect calls to appropriate senior management or a compliance officer if necessary. Addr essing misconduct Our Corporate Ethics and Compliance department monitors and tracks allegations and suspected cases of legal, ethical or policy infractions. It also ensures that allsuch allegations are appropriately investigated. Disciplinaryaction, up to and including dismissal, is taken where necessary. In 2005:1,126 employees were disciplined for misconduct (compared with 954 in 2004). Of these, 331 were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily, compared with 256 in 2004. Other disciplinary actions included verbal and written warnings (795 instances) and financial penalties. Employees staying with the company received re- training and increased monitoring. The numbers have increased since 2004. We believe this is probably due to better r eporting of breaches, as people become more familiar with what should be reported and when. It is anticipated that the numbers may continue to increase during 2006, as detection and r eporting mechanisms are further refined. The 1,126 disciplinary actions included 278 cases of employees breaching sales and marketing codes. These 278 cases r esulted in 91 dismissals or separations fr om the company. There were also 100 verbal warnings and 87 written warnings. These included many small over spends on the allowed limits for hospitality during scientific meetings. 41GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Ethical conduct continued41Introduction 2Access to medicine 3 Research 4Ethical conduct 5Employment practices Page Employee surveys 42 Diversity 43Employee development and talent management 45 Internal communication 46 Health and safety 47 How we manage health and safety 47 Injury and illness rates and causes 49 Serious incidents and fatalities 61Employee health 61Safety programmes 63 6 Human rights 7 Environment 8Community investment 9Data summary 5Employment practices42GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20055 GSK employs over 100,000 people in 119 countries. Our goal to be the best place for the best people to do their best work is central to our business strategy and key to business success. We aim to create a positive workingenvironment, offer competitive reward packages that emphasise performance, provideopportunities for training and advancement, and listen and respond to employee feedback. (See our Annual Report for more details on our business strategy).Employment practices We expect employees to meet high standards in the way they carry out their work for GSK. The GSK Spirit definesour culture and the principles we expect employees towork by. These are: Performance with integrity Entrepreneurial spirit Focus on innovation A sense of urgency Passion for achievement Regular performance appraisals assess whether employees have upheld these principles and the requirements of our Code of Conduct in their work (see Ethical Conduct for more on our Code). The r esults af fect bonuses and car eer progression. This section explains our appr oach and performance in 2005. It covers: our regular employee surveys our programmes to recruit and retain a diverse workforce; employee development, performance appraisals and talent management; how we communicate with employees and get their feedback; our health, safety and wellbeing programmes. EMPLOYEE SURVEYS The sustainability of our business rests on factors that are difficult to measure such as the quality of our leadership, our culture and our ability to develop talented people. Regular employee surveys help us to monitor the evolution of GSK's culture and overall employee satisfaction. Theresults are used to assess the effectiveness of our peoplemanagement practices and identify areas forimprovement.We conduct a Global Leadership Survey every two years. Over 10,000 managers took part in the last survey in2004. Results showed a significant improvement on 29 of 31 items compared with 2002 results. For details of theresults see our 2004 Corporate Responsibility Report. The survey findings are reviewed by GSK's Corporate Executive Team and our business units have implemented actionplans to deliver impr ovements in key areas. For example, GMS have extended our cor e Leadership Edge pr ogramme to over 1000 leaders and have incr eased focus on staf f development, including through mentoring and coaching.R&D have implemented a quarterly \"pulse\" employeesurvey to understand better wher e ther e are opportunities to enhance employee engagement and satisfaction. They have also launched the \"Focus on the Patient\" initiative to build on our str ength of putting the patient first in our plans and decision making. Activity in 2005 We conduct a range of interim employee surveys to gauge satisfaction, motivation and engagement between Leadership Surveys. Our annual US Inclusion and Resilience Poll was sent to 1,000 US employees in 2005. The survey gathers feedback on work-life and resilience issues and how we are progressing towards our diversity vision. The scores fordiversity were all higher than 2002. Other results included: % favourable Question 2002 2004 2005 How would you rate your overall 64 72 75 satisfaction with GSK at the present time?

My work environment enables me 57 61 60 to maintain a healthy lifestyle. DIVERSITY GSK is committed to employing a diverse workforce in an environment where all employees are treated with respectand dignity. Diversity benefits our business. A workforce with diverse backgrounds, cultures and outlooks helps us to understand the needs of different patients and customers. Only by delivering genuine equality of opportunity can webe sure that we have the best people in the right jobsdoing their best work for GSK. We have a range of initiatives to ensure we meet our diversity commitments. We also monitor and report dataon gender diversity by management grade worldwide andon ethnicity in the UK and US. For more backgroundinformation see our website. Activity and performance in 2005 Our annual US Inclusion and Resilience Poll includes questions on diversity. These were all rated higher in 2005than in 2002: 56% of respondents agreed that senior management shows by its actions that creating an inclusive environment is a top priority at GSK (compared with50% in 2004 and 44% in 2002) 77% thought their workgr oup has a climate in which diverse perspectives ar e valued (compared with 65% in 2004 and 67% in 2002); 77% thought their manager demonstrates the ability to manage a diverse workgr oup (compared with 66% in 2004 and 68% in 2002). GSK received a 100% score for corporate equality from the US Human Rights Campaign Foundation that measures companies' treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees, consumers and investors. Companies scoring 100 per cent ar e included in the organisations' \"Best Places to Work for GLBT Equality\" list.Gender diversity (worldwide) Women in Management % of positions held Grades by women 2003 2004 2005 A&B Bands* 20 19 21 C01 - C03** 31 33 33C04 - C05*** 37 38 38Total for all management grades 34 35 35 * Corporate Executive Team, Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents ** Director Level *** Manager Level Women remain under-represented in senior grades. We will continue to focus on ways of ensuring women have genuine equality of opportunity in GSK. We hold a Women in Science event in the UK each year, enabling female science graduates to give feedback on how GSK could attract mor e women scientists. A similar event was launched in the US in May 2005, attended byover 100 female and male employees. The focus was ondevelopment of women scientists in GSK. 43GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued544GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20055 Employment practices continued Ethn ic divers ity Ethn ic min oritiesPeople of col or 14.9%19.6% Empl oyees % People o f color in emplo yee popul ation 1 9.6% from ethnic minori ties 1 4.9%In the US, people of colour made up 19.6% of our workforce, compared with 19.5% in 2004. In the UK,ethnic minorities (as defined by the UK Commission forRacial Equality) accounted for 14.9% of employees, compared with 14.8% in 2004. In our 2004 CR Reportwe wrongly reported the number of ethnic minority employees as 19.8%. This was due to an error in our data collection system which we have now corrected. Multi-Cultural Marketing and Diversity A wards Our annual Multi-Cultural Marketing and Diversity Awards recognise staff who have found creative ways to reach awider audience of employees, customers andcommunities. Awards are given in several categories including one for Employee Attraction, Development and Retention. This year' s winners included: The UK R&D Residential Chemistry T raining Experience, designed to increase the diversity of candidates attracted into chemistry roles. Final year undergraduates spent a week with GSK on the programme. Applications were particularly sought from ethnicminority students from non-traditional universities forGSK r ecruits. The 20 participants r eceived coaching on technical, personal and professional subjects andinteracted with GSK employees at all levels. The Niquitin team, Birmingham, UK, who raised awareness of smoking cessation among ethnic populations who have higher than average smokingrates. The US Consumer Healthcare Hispanic Employee Network who worked with a number of GSK brands to help them understand and improve their appeal to the Hispanic community . This included our Sensodyne brand, which with the network's input, increased sales by 22.1% in the Hispanic community, compared withthe general market incr ease of 7.2%. Employee networks Our employee networks include programmes for Asian, African American, Hispanic and gay and lesbian employees. They provide a forum for employees with similar backgrounds to meet and discuss issues of shared concern. \"I set up the Gay and Lesbian Staff Network UK for a very simple r eason: to enable positive inclusion of lesbian, gay , bi and transsexual staff in the GSK culture. Team work is an essential requirement of the modern pharmaceutical industry. Exclusion on grounds of sexuality or sexual orientation is an obstacle to effective team work and personal development.\" Chair and Founder , GSK R&D UK GLSNEMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND TALENT MANAGEMENT GSK invests in training and development to enable employees to perform to the best of their ability and todevelop their careers. Our talent management processes help us identify and develop leadership candidates. Training We provide job-related training courses for all employees and leadership training for managers. Employees can enrol in training programmes through our myLearning intranet site in the UK and US. During 2005, 4,886 employees attended 368 development programmes in thesecountries. Similar opportunities exist for employeesworldwide but data are not currently collected on the take-up of programmes. In 2005, 97 people attended Leadership Edge, our global programme for senior managers, and 108 attendedLeadership@GSK, the programme for middle managers.We ran five Inspirational Leadership W orkshops attended by 72 executives and senior leaders, with significant influence over large numbers of staff. These focus on the senior leadership role of inspiring and motivating peopleto high performance to meet business challenges. Afurther 79 employees attended our foundationprogramme for new managers, Management@GSK. This programme is designed to help managers improve the performance of their staf f and to increase their insight into differing work styles, strengths and motivation. Development Regular performance appraisals reward strong performance and help employees set objectives andidentify the training they need. More than two-thirds of GSK employees receive an annual performance appraisal through our Performance and Development Planning (PDP) programme. PDP includes an assessment of how well employees have implemented the GSK Spirit - the principles we use todefine our culture. It can have a significant impact onbonus payments, potentially reducing them to zero if an employee is found not to have followed the Spirit, and can also affect future career development. Talent management We identify the highest performing employees in each business and function thr ough our annual talent management cycle. Talented individuals take part in our leadership programmes and are exposed to top management thr ough pr ogrammes such as the Chief Executive Forum. 45GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5A pool of potential successors is identified for all Vice- President and senior management positions. These arereviewed annually by the appointments sub-committee ofthe Board. INTERNAL COMMUNICATION Good internal communication is important in achieving our business objectives as well as creating an open andinclusive work environment. We have a range ofcommunications channels to keep employees up to datewith company news and enable them to give feedback. These include: myGSK, our global intranet site, provides news and updates and a Q&A section where employees can putquestions directly to the CEO and other seniorexecutives. In 2005, JP Garnier, GSK's Chief Executive answered 364 questions. Behind the News, a section of the GSK intranet, gives the company's position onimportant issues linked to press stories about GSK.myGSK was updated in 2005 to ensur e that all employees can access news and policies. Web-broadcasts from GSK senior management, including 18 from executive team members, for employees at our major sites. In February, GSK's CEO, Chairman and head of R&D hosted a global br oadcast viewed by 30,000 employees at 86 sites. More than 1,000 employees completed a follow-up survey, with92% agreeing that the broadcast had increased their understanding of GSK's priorities for 2005 and beyond. A second broadcast in December celebrated 'The yearof the vaccine', was shown in over 140 venues and recognised employees that have made outstanding contributions to the company. Spirit, our internal magazine, reaches around 50,000 employees throughout the company four times a year. Many sites also produce local newsletters. Confidential feedback mechanisms enable employees to raise concer ns. These include our integrity helpline. See Ethical conduct. Employee surveys ar e carried out r egularly thr oughout the organisation, see Employee surveys. We will conduct our next biannual Leadership Survey in 2006.We consult employees on changes that affect them and discuss business developments through our WorksCouncils and European Employee Forum. We havesimilar forums in other countries where this is national practice. In 2005 the European Employee Forumdiscussed topics including the transformation and optimisation programme for Europe IT, proposals for change to GSK's European Distribution and Supply Chain and the company's approach to stress in the workplace. A new UK Information and ConsultationForum will be established during 2006 to address strategic level business developments and company proposals for change in areas such as employment policy and pensions. 43 'townhall' sessions for employees at all levels of the company were hosted by senior management. Employees have the opportunity to discuss the pr ogress of the business, raise questions and give feedback. We also keep employees informed about corporate responsibility (CR). During 2005, 55,000 copies of our CR Overview brochure were distributed to employees directly and thr ough Spirit magazine. An online CR survey was sent to 980 randomly selected GSK employees to assessawareness of our approach to CR and CR reporting, seeStakeholder Feedback. We are developing an internal communication initiative on ethical leadership and the role of every employee inprotecting and enhancing GSK's reputation. It will belaunched in 2006 and will include an e-learning module, guidance for managers on facilitating discussions on GSK' s ethics policies with their team and new material on myGSK. We track the effectiveness of communications through questionnaires and employee surveys. We monitor the questions employees put to senior managers thr ough the Q&A pages on myGSK to ensure we pick up potential areas of concern. We also track readership of news stories on myGSK to help impr ove the relevance and interest of the content. 46GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5HEALTH AND SAFETY The health and safety of employees and contractors is an absolute priority for GSK. We have programmes to systematically assess the risks associated with ouroperations. We monitor performance and the causes ofincidents. We aim to assess what can be learned and take action to protect employees and others in the workplace. We need to improve implementation at some sites. Our aim is to eliminate all work-related injuries and illnesses (I&I). Our main measure is the number of cases resulting in time off work (lost-time cases) and our target over the last 5 years has been to reduce the number per100,000 hours worked by 15% every year. We achievedthe target on average for the first two years but the ratehas remained almost constant since 2003, so we did not meet the five-year target. We will be setting a new I&I target for 2006-2010 as part of the Plan for Excellence 2006-2015, and will set targets for reportable I&I - cases that GSK defines as more serious than first aid. Some of these may also be reported under gover nment r egulations in some countries. Safety theory suggests that addressing reportable I&I will help to eliminate risks and hazards, which should lead to fewerreportable cases as well as lost-time I&I cases. About the Health and Safety Section of This Report This section contains information about how we manage health and safety as part of overall EHS management and describes our programmes. It reports injury and illness rates highlights serious incidents and fatalities, and covers health and safety audits of GSK operations. Our programmes cover a wide range of H&S aspects, from providing safety training for sales employees, who tend tohave the highest number of fatalities, to working with all employees to improve their general health. This is the 6th year that we have r eported on our health and safety performance. The legacy companies (Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham) individually published EHS r eports for a number of years prior to the formation of GSK in 2000. Copies of these reports are available on the Corporate Register website [www.corporateregister.com]. Scope of Data The health and safety data covers the calendar year 2005. It is collected from all of our 81 pharmaceutical and consumer manufacturing sites, seven of eight biologicalsmanufacturing sites, and all 20 pharmaceutical andconsumer research and development sites, as well as all seven distribution centres, all eight major office locationsand 56 of approximately 65 smaller offices and saleslocations. We include available data for sites that were in operation for all or part of the year. Notes attached to thecharts explain the scope and data collection process for each parameter in more detail. We also include data (in the injuries and illness page) for a number of suppliers who provided information. Verification The environment, health and safety sections of this r eport are externally verified by ERM (Environmental Resources Management). Web pages to which the verification applies are indicated by this symbol. ERM's verification statement is on page 70. How we Manage Health and Safety We manage health and safety thr ough an integrated environment, health and safety (EHS) management system. The system incorporates our EHS and EmployeeHealth Policies, EHS V ision and 64 Global EHS Standar ds. Our EHS Plan for Excellence sets out our strategy for improving EHS performance up to 2010 and is currently being renewed to extend to 2015. Our Corporate Environment, Health and Safety (CEHS) and Employee Health Management (EHM) teams helpcoordinate our health and safety programmes. In these pages we summarise activities during 2005 that relate specifically to health and safety. See the EHS Management pages for information on how we manage environmental and broader EHS issues. Training and awareness EHS training is targeted to match employee responsibilities. Employees with responsibility for H&Sissues receive regular training about initiatives in areassuch as ergonomics, chemical exposures and driver safety. This is handled through regional meetings of H&S staff. They in turn train employees in manufacturing, research,sales and other divisions. CEHS and EHM arrange annualmeetings to determine training issues and provide training materials. We also want employees to be aware of health and safety in their personal lives. Employee bulletins, announcements on the myEHS website, the CEO's EHS Excellence awards programme and Health and SafetyWeek activities aim to raise employee awareness of issues such as wearing seat belts, being careful with electricity and using ladders appr opriately . 47GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5 We conduct a Health and Safety Week every October (to coincide with the European Health and Safety weekand Fire Safety Awareness Month in the United States).Information kits are sent to all sites to help them develop ideas and plan activities. In 2005, over 17,500 employees from 70 sites in 32 countries took part in the Health and Safety Week. Activities included sports days, safe driving education, ergonomics training, awareness-raising on noise and safeguar ding hearing, healthy eating and lifestyles, and family participation events. Health and Safety Feedback From our EHS Audits We aim to conduct EHS audits at each operational site at least once every four years. We carry out more frequent visits at selected sites, depending on an assessment of risk and the issues raised by pr evious audits. At the end of 2005 we assessed the performance of all facilities (except small commer cial sites) using self- assessment and inter nal audit. (W e audited 33 sites). The average score was 77%, but 3 sites achieving a score below 50%, which we regard as unacceptable. While theaverage scor e exceeds our target of 75% we will aim to correct unacceptable performance and continue to pursue further improvements to achieve best practice. Our audits identified several priority areas: Chemical exposure risks Chemical risk assessment and control Managing r esilience and mental well-being Ergonomic risk assessment and contr ol Scope and adequacy of workplace risk assessments Self-auditing of health and safety pr ogrammes Management systems implementation We aim to drive impr ovements in poorly-performing areas through actively tracking audit findings and identifying improvements with follow-up audits. For sites scoring less than 50%, we also provide increased support from theaudit team, including follow-up visits to ensure progress, and discussions with senior business management about increased site resources. Many sites require several years to put adequate systems and programmes in place in these areas.We also introduced or continued specific work in the following areas in 2005 to achieve improvements: Chemical Agents - targets set within manufacturing for promoting more accurate exposure determinations and ensuring adequacy of respiratory protectiveequipment at unit operations; discussions and presentations during Network Meetings Resilience - rollout of the tool for assessing team resilience, training during EHS Network Meetings Ergonomics - training in ergonomic risk assessment during Network Meetings as well as regional training Risk assessment - the Guideline was revised and aligned with the risk assessment requirement in theQuality group Self audit - training and workshop on self-auditing conducted at EHS Network Meetings Management System elements - rollout of the Management System Toolkit as described below All sites ar e requir ed to develop plans to addr ess any weaknesses and potential improvements identified in the audit. Auditors monitor sites' progress inimplementing the plans. Auditors ar e trained and their findings compared to ensure consistency. In 2005 we continued to refine the EHS audit process and scoring system based on experience and feedback. W e have also installed EHS auditing software on our intranet to help sites and auditors track progress. OHSAS 18001 Certification In 2005, two additional sites achieved certification to the international health and safety standar d OHSAS 18001. This brings the total number of manufacturing sitescertified to 16 out of 89 pharmaceutical, consumer and vaccine manufacturing sites, with one additional site that certified only the utilities area. The certified sites are inChina, Egypt, France, India, Kenya, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, T urkey and the UK. See audits and certification for information on certification to the environmental management standard ISO14001. 48GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5 Excellence Awards The Chief Executive Officer's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Excellence Awards recognise and reward innovation by GSK sites. These were the winning entries in the EHS Initiative health & safety category in 2005: First Place: Barnard Castle, UK for \"Proven Capability for the 'Shirt Sleeve' Working Environment\" The site has moved toward controlling operator exposure to highly potent compounds by using containment forroutine tasks, rather than using respiratory or protective equipment to guard against exposure. EHS considerations are integrated into the site's business model for introducing new products, which has allowed containment to be integrated into the design formanufacture. Second Place: Wavre, Belgium for \"SOBANE\" an Innovative Approach to Safety\" Wavre introduced a new approach to safety management in 2005 that has significantly reduced the number ofinjuries. It is one of thr ee GSK Biologicals sites in Belgium involved in the research, development and production of vaccines. The site has a specially-designed building where more than 100 employees work filling vials and syringes withvaccines. During 2003 ther e were seven lost-time injuries in the building and in the first nine weeks of 2004 ther e were five accidents resulting in disability, with the type of injuries sustained getting significantly worse. The EHS department responded by introducing a new safetymanagement methodology known as 'Sobane'. The Sobane method involves the active participation of staff in screening for potential safety risks and findingsolutions. Every member of staff becomes a member of a team with an active safety role. The method was intr oduced in May 2004 and has r esulted in 96% of potential safety risks being solved by staf f. Between May 2004 and May 2005 there were no lost- time injuries and mor e than 400 days passed without an accident resulting in disability. The method has since been expanded to all GSK Biological sites in Belgium and we plan to introduce it to all GSKBiological sites ar ound the world. Third Place: Cork, Ireland for \"Bulk Solvent Metering in a Research and Development Pilot Plant\" The introduction of bulk solvent metering at the Cork pilot plant has eliminated the need for handling of 2,018drums of solvent per year. This has reduced the risk of solvent being spilled as well as reducing cleaning anddisposal requirements for waste drums and pallets. No musculoskeletal injuries were reported nor were there any incidents involving chemical burns or solvent splashesfrom the time the metering system was introduced until the award was given. See CEO's EHS Excellence Award on the website for more about the awards programme and winners from previous years. Injury and Illness Rates and Causes Our main measure of injury and illness is the number of incidents which result in one or more days away fromwork (lost time). We express this as a rate per 100,000 hours worked. Our target was to reduce this lost-time rate by 15% each year to the end of 2005. In fact this rate has not impr oved since 2003, which suggests that we have reached aplateau in the ef fectiveness of our pr evention programmes. In 2006 we will renew efforts to improve the effectiveness of these programmes, but will also focus on reportableinjuries and illnesses that do not r esult in time off work. (Reportable incidents ar e mor e serious than first aid, even though they do not result in a day off work.) Safety experts believe that addressing the causes of these lessserious injuries will result in improvements in bothcategories. We also measure the number of days lost from injuries and illnesses. This pr ovides an indication of the severity of the incidents, although it is only a rough guide. For example, an illness could lead to permanent hearing loss or other disability without r esulting in significant lost time. The main data covers GSK employees and contract workers who we directly supervise. Separately, we reportdata for contractors who work on GSK sites but supervisetheir own staf f. (This data is not covered by the ERM verification). Causes of Injuries and Illnesses Injuries with and without lost time arise mainly fr om slips, trips or falls, over-exertions or strains and motor vehicle accidents. Lost-time illness stems mainly from mental ill-health and musculoskeletal problems (primarily repetitive strain injury). Musculoskeletal illness is the main cause of reportableillness which does not lead to days off work, accounting for almost a third of the total. 49GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5Mental ill-health Cases of work-related mental ill health are excluded from the overall illness rate. This is because the consistency of reporting such cases is less robust than other occupationalillnesses and there are variations in the way these illnesses are defined under local legislation which affects reporting. We are working to address these inconsistencies and aim to include these cases in the future. In 2005, the mental illhealth rate (involving lost time) was 0.01 per 100,000 hours worked. Mental ill-health was the second most significant cause of work-related sickness absence, accounting for 41% (1026 days) of the total. For information on programmes to reduce illness and injury, see Health Programmes and Safety Programmes. 2005 Highlights At 77 sites in 30 countries, there were no lost time injuries or illnesses during the year . In addition: one site in India achieved 5 million hours worked without a lost time injury or illness; one site in Singapor e achieved 4 million hours worked without a lost time injury or illness; six sites in Canada, China, India and Pakistan achieved 2 million hours worked without a lost time injury or illness; fourteen sites in China, France, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, UK, and the US achieved 1 million hours worked without a lost time injury or illness. Performance The table summarises our experience in 2005, while the charts illustrate trends. In 2005 we recorded 984 injuries and 344 illnesses, compar ed to 949 and 406 r espectively in 2004. Employees lost working days in 624 of these incidents (580 in 2004). Comparing our record with the expected relationship between incidents that result in lost time andthose which don't suggests that we undercount the real number of injuries and illnesses that do not result in lost time. We are working to improve our reporting of these injuries and illnesses. In 2005, approximately 17% of illnesses resulted in permanent disabilities, such as noise-induced hearing loss, sensitisation to chemicals and some musculoskeletalillnesses. GSK's injury and illness performance placed us in the third quartile of a benchmark industry group in 2004. Causes of injuries and illnesses The main causes of injuries were motor vehicle accidents, slips, trips and falls. Illnesses leading to lost time wer e mainly musculoskeletal or concerned with mental ill- health. Chemical-related dermatitis following exposure tochemicals at work caused a significant number of illnesseswhich did not lead to lost time.

Calendar Days Lost from Injury and Illness There were 2,668 lost days from injuries and 940 days lost from illnesses, 11.03 calendar days lost per 100,000 hoursworked. 60GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5 Notes to charts The health and safety data cover both our employees and contract workers who are directly supervised byGSK employees. All injury and illness rates are per 100,000 hours worked. Lost time injuries and illnesses are work-related injuries and illnesses that are serious enough to result in one or mor e days away from work. Lost calendar days ar e the calendar days that employees could not work because of work-related injuries and illnesses. This helps to pr ovide a measure of the severity of injuries and illnesses. Reportable injuries and illnesses without lost time are reported incidents that did not result in time away from work (lost time). They are more serious than first aidbut generally less serious than lost time. We do not include cases of mental ill health in our lost time or reportable illness rates. This is because of variations in the way mental ill-health is defined and reported across sites globally, which we are working to address.Serious Incidents and Fatalities We deeply regret that one employee died in a work- related driving incident in Egypt, and two members of the public were killed during 2005 in driving accidentsinvolving GSK employees. We are working to reduce traffic related accidents through our driver safety programme (see safety programmes). We have seen a reduction in the number of work-related fatalities in the last few years. This is consistent with the targets for improving health and safety performance set out in the Plan for Excellence. Contractor fatalities have remained largely constant over the same period. Five year trend in employee fatalities: Fatalities 2001 5 2002 3 2003 52004 2 2005 1 We also report serious incidents ie incidents that result in permanent disability or those that are reported toregulatory authorities. In 2005, accidents involving machinery resulted in three employees (at sites in SouthAfrica, the US and Puerto Rico) suffering finger amputations. One contract temporary worker at a site in the US had to have his lower leg amputated as a r esult of a forklift incident. Twenty two employees had to be evacuated from a site in France following the accidental release of a hazar dous chemical. Nine needed medical treatment, eight of whom were hospitalised for the night. One sales employee in the US was involved in a multivehicle road accident that resulted in severe injury and hospitalisation. An employee in the UK suffered burns to18% of his body as a r esult of burst pipework r eleasing boiling water and steam. We investigate the cir cumstances of all fatalities and other serious incidents and assess what can be learned to reduce the risks. W e also issue global alerts (posted on our intranet site) to communicate information that could help prevent similar incidents at other sites.Employee Health A workplace culture that supports a healthy and resilient workforce drives positive business performance. Protectingand promoting the wellbeing of our employees increasesemployee productivity and attendance, reduces health care and health insurance costs and supports us in our goal to be an employee of choice. This is aligned with GSK's mission of improving quality of life. In the sections below, we focus on the steps we have taken to improve ergonomics, resilience (managing pressures and stress) and attendance. We also provide information on our HIV initiatives and planning process for a potential worldwide influenza pandemic. Health Programmes Our health programmes enable employees and their families to benefit from better health and enhancedquality of life, while the business gains fr om incr eased employee commitment and pr oductivity and fr om reductions in the financial impact of ill-health. We have a range of programmes to support employee wellbeing including on-site health and fitness centres,flexible working arrangements, and family supportservices. Healthcare benefits focus on prevention and access to innovative and proven treatments. For example, in the US employees receive free immunizations, cancerscreening, help with smoking cessation and regular checkups. We assist employees suffering from chronic diseaseswith their medical plans and pr ovide support to help them continue with treatments. We have developed a scorecard to measure and track our progress in improving employee health and adding value to the business. The scorecard contains quantitativemeasures including ill-health absence rates. We will report our performance against these measures and targets in 2006. In 2005 we held five workshops globally with Environment Health & Safety and Human Resources to share information and best practice. Our Employee Health Management Department supports sites across GSK in implementing our Employee Health Policy and achieving consistent standards. . We carry out internal audits tomonitor site performance and oversee impr ovement plans. Ergonomics Musculoskeletal illness and injury is one of the leading causes of ill health resulting in time away from work. In2004 we appointed a full-time professional ergonomist to lead the development of our ergonomics strategy. We have set a target to r educe the number of ergonomic 61GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5illnesses and injuries 10% by 2010. Improving workplace and job design will also improve efficiency andproductivity. An internal 'ergonomics university' was established in 2005 to increase knowledge of ergonomic issues andbest practice among GSK employees. We introduced computer presentations on a variety of ergonomic topics and a CD-based programme for commercial field-based employees covering ergonomics \"on the go\" . A Global Ergonomic Community website was developed for employees to discuss issues, share ideas and accessresources. It includes best practice examples ranging from laptop ergonomics to lifting. We launched an on-line ergonomics risk assessment for office-based employees to help reduce ergonomic injuries associated with computer use. The pr ogramme is used at over 150 GSK sites worldwide and has been translatedinto Spanish, French, Italian and Polish. In 2005, 5,540 employees completed the computer -based risk assessment. W e are developing a similar risk assessment tool for non-office based employees that will be piloted in our US manufacturing sites. In 2005 we established employee-led ergonomic improvement teams at 26 manufacturing sites in the UK,US, and Latin America. Their r ole is to embed ergonomic design considerations into workplace practices andprocedures. For example, the team at our Zebulon site in the US has made a number of impr ovements to the work environment. These include the use of adjustable height carts to r educe injuries from lifting heavy items such as rolls of material. It also reduces waste due to reduced manual handling of the materials. W e will launch ergonomic improvement teams at manufacturing facilities across Europe and Asia in 2006. Resilience Mental illness is another one of the leading causes of ill health r esulting in time away fr om work. We use the term 'r esilience' to describe the set of skills and behaviours needed to be successful in a highly pressured, fast-paced and continuously changing envir onment. This enables us to support employees to manage work and home demands mor e effectively , and minimises the adverse health af fects of str ess. Data fr om our r esilience programmes show that this can improve business results along with employee commitment and engagement. These pr ogrammes fully support UK legislative requirements to tackle sources of workplace stress. Our team resilience programme is a participatory, proactive quality- improvement process utilizingassessment tools to identify sources of workplace stresswith a team-based solution focused process. It looks at issues that can cause pressure and affect performancesuch as work demands, team relationships, management practices, career and development concerns and work culture. Individual team members get a confidential personal profile and a tailored action plan is developed by the whole team. In 2005, 5,800 staff took part in teamresilience programmes. The programme has been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Mandarin. The majority of GSK sites have pr ogrammes to reduce workplace pressures and help employees achieve a good work-life balance. These include time managementtraining, flexible working options, health awareness andeducation initiatives. Over 50% of our employees worldwide have access to Employee Assistance Programmes that provide confidential support 24 hours aday along with additional counselling as needed. The team resilience programme received external recognition from the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE), and was nominated for several awar ds which included winning Personnel Today's Managing Health at Work award. Attendance Long-term employee absence has a financial impact on GSK through lost productivity and efficiency. By limitingemployee absence and helping those of f work r eturn as soon as appropriate, we can minimise these costs and improve employee wellbeing. In 2004 we launched a new case management approach to long-term employee absence in the UK. This involves close collaboration between the EHM team, HR staf f, line managers and the employees themselves. Key elements include accurately measuring absence and ensuring thatwe maintain r egular contact with employees who ar e off work. We make sure that employees and their doctors know about the wide-range of in-house support available at GSK, including access to physiotherapists, counsellors and occupational health physicians. A rehabilitation plan is agreed with the employee. This may include making modifications to their workplace,reducing work hours or finding alter native work until they are fully recovered. 62GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5Initial results suggest that this approach has led to a fall in absence rates at several sites from approximately 7% to around 3% over 2 years. It is estimated that onemanufacturing site in the UK has experienced cost savings of about \u00a31.5 million based on the direct and indirectcosts of absence. Employees are returning to work more quickly as they are not being signed off for longer than necessary. Staff feedback indicates that the majority of employees feel better-informed, valued and supported. During 2006 we will continue to r oll out the new procedures across our sites in the UK. We plan to complete this process by mid 2006. Our target in the UKis to reduce the number of days lost due to long-term absence by 10% in 2006. W e have set a target for our manufacturing sites worldwide to achieve at least 98% attendance by 2010. HIV/AIDS We provide antiretroviral treatment (ARV) to all HIV positive GSK employees (full and part-time) and their families in the developing world where treatment is not provided adequately or consistently by the localhealthcar e system. We offer pr eferentially priced AR Vs to other employers in Sub-Saharan Africa who provide care and treatment for staff. See Preferential Pricing. We have developed awareness-raising initiatives for use worldwide. In 2005, educational materials developed by GSK Kenya and the Positive Action Pr ogramme [www.gsk.com/positiveaction] were adopted by other companies in Kenya, reaching an estimated 10,000employees in the public and private sectors. The materials have been translated into French and are now available to companies in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Madagascar and Mali. In early 2006, the materials will be translated into Arabic with help fr om companies in Morocco. GSK Mexico and GSK Dominican Republic will develop similar , Spanish-language r esources for use in Central America. GSK India has also started this pr ocess with three employee workshops on HIV and AIDS and a pilot survey demonstrating the need for mor e employee HIV education. Influenza Pandemic Global outbr eaks of A vian Influenza (bir d flu) have highlighted the danger of a potential worldwide influenza pandemic. Externally, we are working with governments and the WHO to assist with the pr ovision and development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to manage a potential pandemic. Inter nally, we have a cr oss businessteam that has developed a global policy and plan for GSK business continuity and employee health preparedness. A plan that minimises the impact of a pandemic on ouremployees, and ensures we are able to continue manufacturing medicines and vaccines. Safety Programmes We systematically assess risks to anticipate potential accidents, and put programmes in place to minimise them. We learn from investigating the causes of accidents and make improvements accordingly. In this section we cover three key areas: driver safety, process safety and chemical exposure. For information on our approach to ergonomics see Employee Health. Driver Safety Our sales representatives drive long distances every year and are therefore particularly at risk of being involved inwork-related road traffic incidents. In 2005, there were 137 driving accidents r esulting in lost time, and these accounted for 25% of lost-time injuries. Our Global EHS standar d on Occupational T ravel includes requir ements on driver safety . In 2004 we developed 11 technical instruction documents to help GSK businesses comply with the standard. These cover topics such as training, vehicle selection, risk assessment, accidentreporting, driving and the environment. In 2005 we combined these documents with additional safety guidelines to create a compliance tool for commercial businesses called 'EHS Essentials'. Approximately 60% of GSK's Commercial businesses have extensive driver safety pr ogrammes in place. They include driving licence checks, guidance on the use of mobile phones in vehicles, driver safety training, tracking and reporting incidents. W e are working to ensur e all sites have the same high standards in place. In a few countries we pr ovide motorbikes or scooters for employees and have produced a GSK Motorbike Rider Safety Manual. This has been translated and distributed to employees in countries such as Bangladesh, India,Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. These countries havenow also fully implemented the GSK r equir ement for every driver of a motorbike to wear a helmet. We willcontinue to follow up and monitor the implementation of the motorbike safety pr ogramme. 63GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued5Process Safety and Safety Engineering Our process safety programme ensures that safety is built into all manufacturing, research and development processes. The programme is based on hazardidentification, control and risk assessment. During 2005 we expanded our Risk Assessment Tools & Evaluations (RATE) System. It now includes tools covering: Failure Mode & Effects Analysis, Hazard & Operability, and FailureMode Effects Criticality Analysis. The programmes apply globally, allowing us to standardized assessment documentation and share safety information across all business sectors. In 2005 we launched an initiative to ensure our Primary Supply and Antibiotics Supply Chain has updated safety plans that focus on key risks and r egulatory compliance. Material Hazard Information Our HazClass System tracks hazar dous material shipments worldwide and monitors the transportation of over 10,000 materials per month. We have developed safety data sheets (SDSs) for more than 1,200 of our products. Some 600 of these forpharmaceutical products that are sold in the US or Europe are available on our website www.msds-gsk.com]. An email notification tool automatically keeps employees up-to-date with changes to SDSs. W e have started to make environmental testing data available on our SDSs. Occupational Hygiene and Control of Chemical Exposure In 2005, exposure to chemicals resulted in 4 respiratory or skin-related lost-time incidents and 101 cases which did not result in lost time. Together, they accounted for 31%of work-related illnesses. In 2004 we developed a strategy to control chemical exposure up to 2010. This sets out a plan of action forachieving our 2010 goal of a 'shirt sleeve' working environment - a workplace where we contain chemicals using engineering controls during manufacture so thatemployees do not need to wear protective equipment. In 2005 we introduced several steps to help us achieve this goal: we began r ecruiting Regional Hygienists to deliver an improved Occupational Hygiene (OH) service to businesses we began to design dispensary equipment for powder ed pharmaceutical ingr edients which eliminates the need for protective equipmentwe commissioned a benchmarking study of containment methods for potent chemical compounds we seconded a member of Engineering staff to Corporate EHS to work on ensuring that all relevant operations have engineering controls our new product support process is designed to integrate EHS considerations into product design. Teams include a product stewardship/occupational toxicologyexpert whose role is to ensure that chemical exposureand other EHS considerations are built into productdesign 64GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Employment practices continued51 Introduction 2Access to medicine 3 Research 4Ethical conduct 5 Employment practices 6Human rights Page Employee human rights 65 Supply chain human rights 65 7 Environment 8 Community investment9 Data summary 6Human rights 65GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20056 Human rights is a broad subject that is relevant to GSK in a number of different contexts. In this section we discuss human rights for GSK employees and human rights in our supply chain. For information on our preferential pricing arrangements for HIV/AIDS medicines, see Access to medicines. Human rights Most of our dir ect employees are well educated and skilled people for whom we are striving to make our company an attractive employer. Generally our employment standards on issues such as diversity, equal opportunities and health and safety provide adequate safeguards on human rights for these employees. Our supply chain is complex, diverse and global. We recognise it is possible that suppliers in some countries do not fully respect the human rights of their workers or local communities. Within our sphere of influence, we have begun work to ensur e that our suppliers observe similar standar ds to ours in their r elations with employees and communities. The risk of human rights issues occurring is not as significant for GSK as for companies in some other industries. Nevertheless there are several reasons why we need to take human rights seriously . Achieving high standar ds on human rights supports our r eputation and our goal of operational excellence. It helps us to get thebest fr om our employees. By working with suppliers that match our standards, we help ensure the smooth operation of supplier contracts and therefore a reliable supply of high quality products. EMPLOYEE HUMAN RIGHTS The human rights of our employees at work ar e protected by our employment policies and pr ocedur es. For mor e details see Employment. We operate globally , including in countries where the gover nment does not fully respect human rights. We believe our pr esence in these countries is vital to ensur e continued access to medicines for their people. We aim to create a workplace for employees in these countries wher e the standar ds match those in our operations elsewhere, and thereby contribute to improving employment practices generally . We conduct an annual human rights employment audit to make sur e we are delivering our commitment to international human rights standards. The head of Human Resour ces in each country wher e we operate is required to report on whether GSK employment practices meet thesestandar ds via a self-assessment questionnaire. In 2005 this audit did not identify any human rights issues in our workforce We can confirm that GSK does not employ children or anyone younger than 16. All our employees are entitled tojoin trade unions and to organise, in countries where this is permitted by national legislation. We are committed tolistening and r esponding to the views of our employees, including through works councils and staff consultation committees, see Internal communication. Discrimination and harassment are not tolerated under any cir cumstances. Employees can r eport any concer ns to senior management on a confidential basis, using our global integrity helpline. During 2005 there were no cases reported by employees to our compliance function that directly raised human rights issues. SUPPL Y CHAIN HUMAN RIGHTS Our supply chain is complex, with over 75,000 suppliers worldwide. It ranges from major strategic relationships with suppliers that manufactur e raw materials and packaging for GSK medicines through to local contracts for goods or services such as office equipment, cleaning and security . We endeavour to ensure that all our suppliers follow the same high standards on human rights that apply to GSK. Given the size and global scope of our supply chain we recognise that some suppliers may not fully r espect the human rights of their workers or local communities. We have started to work with suppliers on these issues through the inclusion of human rights clauses in suppliercontracts (see next page). We also cover human rights issues during our r outine interactions with two categories of critical suppliers - the contract manufacturers that make GSK-branded medicines and consumer health products and the suppliers of raw materials and packaging to our manufacturing sites. Historically these suppliers have tended to be based in Europe and North America, but there is a growing trendtowards sourcing these materials from other areas of theworld such as Asia. We visit our critical suppliers regularly to review performance and to identify and resolve any issues, including any potential human rights issues.These interactions include: Pre-assessment of potential new critical suppliers through questionnaires, on-site reviews and Quality and EHS Audits. These assessments cover facilities which will directly supply GSK. On-going critical supplier reviews include follow-up visits by Procurement, Quality and EHS staff. We alsohold global and regional supplier review meetingswhere senior GSK managers address and interact with suppliers on key issues. It is important that our procurement teams understand our human rights standards. We provide training and guidance on human rights for GSK procurement staff as part of our Sourcing Group Management programme.This explains how we develop sourcing strategies and our criteria for supplier selection, including human rights.The training is compulsory for all new procurement staff. Given the size and complexity of our supply base it is not possible to engage dir ectly with all our suppliers on human rights. As well as our routine engagement withcritical suppliers, during 2006 we will start a pilot project to assess the risk of human rights issues occurring among suppliers of services wher e there is a large labour input, for example cleaning or security. We also engage with suppliers on environmental, health and safety issues, see Environment and Working with our Ribena suppliers to improve biodiversity, below. Supplier contracts We are adding human rights clauses to our supplier contracts. These require suppliers to confirm that they comply with minimum wage legislation; pr ovide a healthy , safe workplace fr ee from discrimination; and do not use any form of slavery or exploitative child labour. So far, we have incorporated human rights clauses into all central contract templates for use with new suppliers. Human rights clauses are also being introduced intocontracts for existing suppliers as they are renewed. Most contracts are renewed on a three-year cycle. During 2005 we worked with our local procurement teams to incorporate human rights clauses into local supplier contracts. Given the size of the supply chain wehave prioritised contracts into which the human rights clause must be inserted. The initial focus is:1.Suppliers providing goods that are used to make GSK- branded products e.g. contract manufacturers, rawmaterials and packaging; and 2.Suppliers providing human resources e.g. cleaning services, security services, contingent worker services,outsourced services, testing, research and development services. This scope will eventually be extended to all contracts. Engagement with critical suppliers Our critical suppliers must work to the highest quality standards and produce an uninterrupted supply ofmaterials and services to GSK. If they do not, the safety,effectiveness or availability of our medicines could beaffected. For these reasons, we seek long-term relationships with critical suppliers and regularly monitor all aspects of their performance, including human rights. Critical suppliers must pass a detailed assessment befor e they can be selected. As well as looking at quality issues,we also assess their policies and procedures for health and safety , human rights, and envir onmental issues. These rigorous assessments reduce the risk of issues of non- compliance after the contract has been signed.Wher e suppliers do not meet our required standards, we work with them to agr ee a r emedial pr ogramme which must be implemented or completed before we award any new business to them. All contract manufacturers mustalso be approved by the applicable regulatory authoritybefor e they can start manufacturing GSK medicines. After a contract has been awar ded we seek to develop str ong, open relationships with critical suppliers. This includes formally agreed Supplier Reviews, to assess performance and identify and agr ee areas for improvement. After a Supplier Review the agr eed action plan is signed off by GSK and the supplier. Where a supplier can' t or won' t impr ove their performance we will move our business to an alternative supplier. We have launched a preferred global vendor programme to reduce the number of suppliers. As well as reducing costs and incr easing efficiency this will make it easier to monitor and influence supplier standar ds. Supplier audits We conduct r egular Envir onment Health and Safety audits of our contract manufacturers that include questions on human rights. In 2005 there were 41 audits conducted and no human rights issues of significant concern were noted. 66GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Human rights continued667GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Human rights continued6 GSK Supplier human rights clauses The human rights clause (below) is based on international workplace norms in the International Labour Organisation conventions and the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The text below sets out the standard English-language version of the contract clause, but it must be noted that the exact wording may vary between contracts. GSK attorneys may amend the wording of the HR Clause during negotiation with third parties or during translation to suit local law. However GSK attorneys have been instructed not to change the Human Rights Clause in any way that reduces itscontractual impact or intent. THE GSK STANDARD CONTRACT CLAUSE FOR ETHICAL STANDARDS AND HUMAN RIGHTS Ethical Standards and Human Rights Unless otherwise required or prohibited by law, the Supplier warrants, to the best of its knowledge, that in relation to the supply of goods or services under the terms of this Agreement: (a)it does not employ engage or otherwise use any child labour in cir cumstances such that the tasks performed by any such child labour couldreasonably be foreseen to cause either physical or emotional impairment to the development of such child; (b)it does not use forced labour in any form (prison, indentur ed, bonded or otherwise) and its employees are not required to lodge papers or deposits on starting work; (c)it provides a safe and healthy workplace, presenting no immediate hazards to its employees. Any housing provided by the Supplier to itsemployees is safe for habitation. The Supplier provides access to clean water, food, and emergency healthcare to its employees in the event of accidents or incidents at the Supplier's workplace; (d)it does not discriminate against any employees on any ground (including race, religion, disability or gender). (e)it does not engage in or support the use of corporal punishment, mental, physical, sexual orverbal abuse and does not use cruel or abusive disciplinary practices in the workplace;(f)it pays each employee at least the minimum wage, or a fair r epresentation of the pr evailing industry wage, (whichever is the higher) and pr ovides each employee with all legally mandated benefits; (g)it complies with the laws on working hours and employment rights in the countries in which itoperates; (h)it is respectful of its employees right to join and form independent trade unions and freedom of association. The Supplier agrees that it is responsible for controlling its own supply chain and that it shall encouragecompliance with ethical standards and human rights by any subsequent supplier of goods and services that are used by Supplier when performing its obligations under this Agreement. The Supplier shall ensur e that it has ethical and human rights policies and an appropriate complaints procedur e to deal with any br eaches of such policies. GSK reserves the right upon reasonable notice (unless inspection is for cause, in which case no notice shall be necessary) to enter upon the Supplier's premises to monitor compliance by the Supplier of the warrantiesset out in the clause above and the Supplier shall, subject to compliance with law, furnish GSK with any relevant documents requested by GSK in relation thereto. {this sub-section will only be r equir ed wher e there is no general right of audit elsewhere within the Agr eement}Energy and global warming potential 88 Energy consumption 90Transport 96 Water 98 Water use 98Wastewater 101 Waste 106 Hazardous waste 106Non-hazardous waste 111Recycling 115Non-routine waste 119 Ozone depletion 121 Ozone-depleting substances in manufacturing 121 Ozone-depleting substances in ancillary equipment 124 Volatile organic compounds 127 Biodiversity 131 Suppliers 132 8 Community investment 9Data summary1 Introduction 2Access to medicine 3 Research 4Ethical conduct 5 Employment practices 6 Human rights 7Environment Page Introduction 68 ERM Verification statement and GSK response 70 Environmental management 72 Plan for Excellence 75 Audits and certification 76 Stakeholder engagement 76 Training and awareness 78 EHS Excellence awards 78 Progress towards targets 80Materials ef ficiency 82 Product stewardship 85 Product design the environment 86Metered dose inhalers 87 7Environment 68GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 This year we have completed the first five years of our Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Plan for Excellence, which marks an important milestone in our journey toenvironmental sustainability. Environmental performance is reported in these pages. Health and safety performance is reported in the Employee sectionEnvironment INTRODUCTION In 2001, we set \"stretch\" targets in consultation with the business to address EHS issues of concern to ourstakeholders. When we set these targets we had identifiedsome proposed improvement projects which would help us to achieve them but we did not have specific underpinning projects to achieve all the environmental targets. Performance We have achieved many of the EHS targets. We met or surpassed targets in energy consumption (and related carbon dioxide emissions), water consumption, wastewater organic material (measured as chemicaloxygen demand), non-hazardous waste, and ozonedepleting substances used to pr oduce our inhalers. For volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions to air we achieved a significant r eduction and almost achieved our ambitious target of a 30% reduction. We also set an ambitious target for ozone depleting compounds in ancillary equipment, where we achieved a 36% improvement. In some cases changes in the business helped us to make progress (eg wastewater quality and emissions of solvents to air). But in two cases - hazardous waste disposal and recycling - changes made progress more difficult. We did not meet targets in these areas due to factors such as maintenance of recycling systems, movement of products to production facilities without recycling equipment, and new product introduction. We provide details of performance in each area on the performance pages of this section. EHS Management A solid foundation of pr ogrammes and management systems contributes to the progress we have made. GSK has moved towar ds what I describe as a \"self-r egulatory\" EHS cultur e, which focuses first on achieving legal compliance and manages EHS proactively based on our understanding of the risks, liabilities and opportunities. Itis part of our strategic objectives to achieve operational excellence and to be a responsible company.Our EHS structure includes: 1.Management system based on a set of Global Standards incorporated into a framework of EHSprogrammes 2.The EHS Plan for Excellence, which identifies our vision for EHS in GSK 3.The CEO's EHS Excellence Awards which recognise outstanding projects at GSK sites around the world [link to Excellence awards in this document] We feel that we have made significant progress in improving the performance of EHS in GSK but we realisethat ther e is always more to do. First, we need to embed this culture so that people really understand the business benefits of good EHS practice: enhanced productivity,quality and employee relationships, which are beneficialfor GSK's performance and reputation. Investors This is already understood by investors. They appreciate not only our progress but the transparency which meanswe are open about the areas where we have not done aswell as we had planned. This has been borne out by the positive ratings that GSK receives from the various investor ratings. GSK has been recognized in these indices: Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for 2005: DJSI members are the top 10 per cent of their industry sector. They are selected from the 2,500 largest companies in the world. Selection is based on a best-in-class approach covering economic, social andenvironmental criteria. Business in the Environment Index Premier League: This is the third consecutive year that GSK has been listed in the Pr emier League, achieving a scor e of 97 per cent for 2004 data. The index rates envir onmental management and environmental performance. Carbon Disclosure Project's Climate Leadership Index: GSK is one of only three pharmaceutical companies named to the Climate Leadership Index. The Carbon Disclosure Project is a coalition of 155institutional investors with more than $21 trillion in assets. The Climate Leadership Index includes onlycompanies that are well positioned to respond to thefinancial implications of climate change, compared to their FT500 peers. FTSE4Good 2005: The FTSE4Good Index Series only includes companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards, and facilitates investment in those companies. 100 Most Sustainable Companies: GSK was one of only four pharmaceutical companies identified in the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World. This is a project initiated by Corporate Knightswith Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, a leadingresearch firm specialising in analysing \"non traditional\" drivers of risk and shareholder value covering performance on social, environmental and strategicgover nance issues. Launched in 2005, the annual Global 100 is announced each year at the W orld Economic Forum in Davos. Ratings like these help investors identify companies that will meet their investment goals and are important toGSK's reputation. They are achieved by our pro-active approach to EHS and sustainability and the company-wide reporting of EHS performance data. These index listings are a tribute to the many EHS professionals and othermanagers and staf f at all the GSK sites who report the data on which these listing are based, Investors and other stakeholders also appreciate our commitment to dialogue - just as much as we appr eciate the value of stakeholders' perspectives. We have now created a formal Stakeholder Panel but we have also consulted widely with GSK people as we move to the next five-year plan period. The Future Internal and external engagement has helped us to focus on these major challenges for the immediate future: Occupational exposure to chemicals [see occupational hygiene page nn] Driver safety [see page nn] Process safety [see page nn] Pharmaceuticals in the environment [see page nn] Hazardous chemicals usage Energy conservation In the longer term, we can see three possible steps to becoming a more environmentally sustainable business: Improve natural resource efficiency and decrease the amount of waste we generate. We are looking morebroadly than production to include the efficiency of allour operations [LINK to Materials efficiency] Move from relying on non-renewable chemicals to renewable materials Move from using synthetic chemical routes to biological systems to create medicines It will take many years to achieve this transition, but it is part of the journey towards being an environmentally sustainable company. James Hagan Vice President, Corporate Envir onment, Health and Safety About the Environment Section of This Report This is the 6th year that we have reported on our environmental performance. The legacy companies (Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham) individually publishedEHS reports for a number of years prior to the formation of GSK in 2000. Copies of these reports are available on the Corporate Register website[www.corporateregister.com]. Further background information on our approach to managing environmental issues is available in the Environment, Health and Safety section of our website [www .gsk.com]. Note on the scope of the data The environmental data covers the calendar year 2005. It is collected fr om all of our 81 pharmaceutical and consumer manufacturing sites, six of our eight Biologicals manufacturing sites and 18 of 20 pharmaceutical andconsumer r esear ch and development sites as well as all seven distribution centr es, six of eight major of fice locations and four of the smaller office and sales locations. We include available data for sites that wer e in operation for all or part of the year . Notes attached to the charts explain the scope and data collection process for each parameter in more detail. Unless specified as being per unit of sales, figures are absolute numbers (ie total consumption of energy , water etc.) 69GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Verification The environment, health and safety sections of this report are externally verified by ERM (Environmental Resources Management). Pages to which the verification applies are indicated by this symbol. ERM's verification statement and our response follow. ERM VERIFICATION STATEMENT Environmental Resources Management Limited (ERM) was appointed by GSK to undertake an external verificationassessment of its environment, health and safety (EHS)reporting within the GSK 2005 Corporate Responsibility report (The section on Environment and the Health & Safety pages within the Employee Practices section). This is the fifth year of our involvement as an exter nal verifier with GSK. The objectives of our assessment wer e to: check that the EHS data presented are accurate, and that they represent GSK's performance fairly; critically review the completeness and r elevance of the information presented; and, assess the effectiveness of GSK's data management and reporting systems. The pages of GSK'sreport that contain EHS data verified by ERM are marked with the following symbol. Scope of assessment During the period October 2005 to February 2006 we conducted the following tasks: Assessments at six globally significant sites ( ) and telephone interviews with 13 additional sites to review EHS data management and reporting processes; Review of corporate data collation and internal verification pr ocesses at GSK of fices in the UK; Review of the content of the EHS sections of the 2005 Corporate Responsibility report, including checking sample group data, to assess its completeness,relevance and accuracy; and Interviews with corporate personnel to obtain supporting information on GSK's EHS performance in the following areas: acquisitions and divestitures;contaminated land; auditing of GSK sites, suppliers and contract manufacturers; H&S reporting relating to the US sales force; and, setting of performance targets.Overall assessment Subject to the scope of our assessment and comments set out below, we believe GSK's EHS reporting in the 2005Corporate Responsibility report is a complete, relevant andaccurate representation of GSK's performance. From our review we have made the following findings and recommendations. Findings Reporting This year, GSK has reported on its progress against the five year performance targets it set in key areas of environment, health and safety. We found that GSK hasmade good progress on strengthening internal reportingprocesses and better understanding the reasons for EHSperformance change against its targets. GSK provides a wide range of information in its report but it is not always clear which are the material issues facingthe business. We found inconsistency in the level of detailprovided on r easons for performance change, for example how changes at major contributing sites significantlyaffect the Group total. GSK has impr oved collection of data fr om contract manufacturers and suppliers, and has expanded the number of contract manufacturers from which it collects key EHS data in 2005. Ther e are ongoing challenges in collecting complete and accurate data for GSK to be ableto report on its br oader EHS footprint. One of our 2004 recommendations related to the limitations of EHS performance data, in particular the potential scale of statistical uncertainty, which is under consideration by GSK. The 2005 r eport does not consistently cover the significance of potential limitations of the data such as calculation method or robustness of sampling techniques to understanding performance change, for example calculating VOC emissions. Data Accuracy GSK has continued to make pr ogress to impr ove the accuracy of its EHS data by introducing further internal data checks with the globally significant sites. ERM identified a number of material data inaccuracies thr ough its assessments at site level and checking of sample group data, in part due to changes in the reporting schedule in 2005 that were introduced to meet the deadlines of theCorporate Reporting program. These inaccuracies were subsequently addressed by GSK to ensure accuratereporting in the 2005 Corporate Responsibility report. 70GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 There have been improvements in energy performance following the introduction of a business-specific energymanagement programme which have also helped toensure more accurate data reporting. GSK is rolling out new system functions to help integrate EHS managementand data collection. We found challenges associated with accurate and complete health and safety incidents reporting and investigation at site level, including a weakness in formal internal processes to check compliance with GSK's requirements on accurate reporting and full investigation of incidents. In addition, we found examples ofmisreporting due to poor understanding of the corporate reporting requirements and data entry errors. Recommendations We recommend that GSK: Explains which of the issues it reports on are material to the business and prioritises its reporting accordingly; Reports further on how trends in outsourcing affect its overall EHS footprint and performance, and expandfurther the reporting on EHS impacts of contractmanufactur ers and suppliers; Improves the accuracy of environmental and incidents data by introducing additional mechanisms to checkcompleteness of data r eported by sites and by providing additional training to sites on r eporting and data management; Reviews formal processes to check compliance with GSK's requir ements on accurate r eporting and full investigation of incidents; and Looks for opportunities to further align data management at corporate and site level, integrating reporting and core business processes wherepracticable. ERM March 2006GSK RESPONSE TO VERIFICATION STATEMENT After verifying GSK's EHS reports for five years, many of ERM's recommendations point to improvements that wework on every year. For example, every year we improveprocesses for collecting data, clarify definitions andinstructions, provide training to the people at sites who gather and enter their site data, improve the processes for analysing and summarising the data and try to understandthe changes from year to year. 1. Explain materiality: In 2001, as part of the planning process that resulted in our 10-year EHS Plan for Excellence, we conducted a review of reporting. We considered the measures of our EHS impact used within the company. We used the Global Reporting Initiative and surveys from investmentrating organisations and environmental organizations as indicators of stakeholder expectations for EHS reporting by companies of our size. From this exercise weconcluded that the information and metrics we includein this r eport are material to GSK. We decided to be consistent in our r eporting for the five year period of our Plan for Excellence. As we move into the next five year period, we will again review the materiality of theinformation and metrics we r eport and will continue to report what our exter nal stakeholders consider important. 2. Trends in outsourcing: It is our goal to report, in the aggregate, the EHS performance of our contract manufacturers and keysuppliers. W e hope to use this to r eport the total EHS footprint for GSK products and to use this as the basis for our impr ovement targets. W e request EHS information fr om all our contract manufactur ers and key suppliers every year but response is voluntary and the rate is very low . We intend to make r esponse to this questionnaire an integral part of future contracts. 3.Accuracy of site EHS data A comprehensive global EHS information management system is in place to help sites manage their EHS data.We use the same system to collect the data for thisreport and for internal reporting. We recognise that the past error rate of initial entry varies between 25% and 50% and we have put in place a thorough dataverification process to correct the errors. We are attempting to address this situation by providing additional web-based training. We are also conducting a formal review of the information that has been requested from sites to see if it can be simplified, while still meeting the needs of our stakeholders. 71GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued74. Review the processes to check compliance with reporting and investigation of incidents We have completed the first phase of our audit programme, conducting a comprehensive baselinereview. In 2006 we are starting a risk-based auditprocess. We will include a review of reporting EHS data and investigation of incidents as part of this process.We will also increase our level of training in these areas. 5. Align Corporate and site data management We will be conducting a formal review of our information management practices to identify improvements that can be made in both the Corporate and site processes. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Environmental issues are managed together with health and safety through an integrated EHS system that aims to ensure issues and risks are identified, standards areestablished, training is provided, targets set and auditsconducted. We have a clearly defined EHS management structur e. Overall r esponsibility r ests with the Corporate Executive Team and the Board. The Board champion for EHS is JP Garnier, the Chief Executive Officer. Rupert Bondy, General Counsel, is the operational champion of EHS on the corporate executive team. W e also have a Corporate Responsibility Committee and Corporate EHS department.See more on our EHS management organisation andsystem on our website Our EHS Policy, Vision and 64 Global EHS Standards set the overall framework for managing issues. In 2005 we distributed an EHS management toolkit which provides sites with instructions and descriptions of appr opriate procedur es for managers worldwide. Our EHS Plan for Excellence which was developed in 2001, sets out our 10-year strategy for improving our environmental performance. In 2005 we came to the end of the first 5-year period and began revising and extending the Plan to 2015.Stakeholder engagement plays an important role in how we manage EHS. In 2005 we carried out a specialengagement exercise with employees and set up astanding panel of external EHS stakeholders. Feedback from staff and external sources identifies issues andprovides insights that help us determine how to move forward. Our CEO's EHS Excellence Awards recognise and reward GSK sites that show leadership in EHS. The Awards highlight sites that have demonstrated exceptional commitment, with innovative approaches that provideexamples of good practice on EHS management to sharewith other sites. The winners of our 2005 Excellence Awards demonstrate that many projects which improve environmental performance also save money. We carry out r egular EHS audits of GSK operations, contract manufactur ers and key suppliers to assess the extent to which management systems and standards are being implemented to impr ove performance and achieve compliance. Environment Costs In 2005, our capital investment in envir onmental pr ojects was \u00a311.2 million and our operating and maintenancecosts were \u00a337.8 million. This expenditure relates towastewater treatment, waste management and airpollution contr ol. 72GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued773GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 051015202530 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004Waste Wastewater Air(million \u00a3) Capital invest ment Year A ir W astewate r W aste T otal 2001 9 .8 1 0.9 3.2 23.9 2002 4 .5 1 0.5 2.0 17.1 2003 4 .4 1 .3 4 .0 9 .7 2004 3 .4 2 .4 3 .3 9.2 2005 3 .4 3 .1 4 .7 11.2 Capital investm ent74GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Opera tions and ma intenance c osts Operation s and maintenance costs Year A ir W astewate r W aste T otal 2001 1 .5 1 0.1 29. 8 4 1.3 2002 2 .3 1 4.6 31. 3 4 8.2 2003 1 .7 1 0.0 23. 8 3 5.4 2004 2 .2 1 0.2 29. 2 41.6 2005 1 .4 9 .3 2 7.1 37.8 01020304050 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004Waste Wast ewater Air(million \u00a3)Compliance As a minimum we aim to comply with all legal requirements.

W ith the end of the first five year period in 2005 we have taken stock and begun extending the Plan for afurther five years to 2015. We developed the plan following the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. It aligned the EHS systems of the two par ent companies and laid out an approach for establishing a new EHS framework for GSK. We use annual action plans to focus our ef forts on selected priority issues. As the half-way point in the ten year plan, 2005 was important because it was the year when we aimed to have our fundamental EHSprogrammes in place, and to r each our first set of EHS targets. The theme for the year was 'Completing Cor e Programmes'. Our goal was to ensure that core programmes covering health & safety and the environment were in placethroughout the global business, measured by thefollowing: implementing at all operations our EHS management system - which is aligned with ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001 achieving acceptable audit scores at all our manufacturing and R&D operations. We aimed toachieve an average score of at least 75% in eachbusiness unit, with no site achieving less than 50% achieving the 5-year EHS global targets (see Progress Towards Targets) analysing performance against the first set of targets in the Plan for Excellence formalising our exter nal stakeholder engagement process We report performance against these objectives in these pages. In 2005 we began extending the Plan for Excellence to 2015. We aim to move from a focus on fundamental EHS pr ogrammes to addr ess br oader envir onmental issues. This r equir es a new appr oach to manufacturing processes and measuring progress. We began our review of the Plan for Excellence with an extensive consultation with key internal and external stakeholders to ensure relevant EHS concerns and the needs of the business would be r eflected in the extended plan. We engaged with external stakeholders about key EHS concerns and expectations of GSK and the pharmaceutical industry We undertook a company-wide intranet survey seeking comment on a discussion document that r eviewed emerging issues for the business and EHS We held individual discussions with selected senior managers in all parts of the business We held workshops ar ound the world with GSK's site- based EHS professionals, including sessions on vision and strategy with the Corporate EHS team. Our managers and EHS professionals told us they want GSK to be among the top pharmaceutical companies inthis area, but also that our activity must \"add value\" to the business. 75GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 They want us to work with external organisations, and to be flexible in embedding EHS in business practices -adopting approaches which are appropriate for eachbusiness unit. External stakeholders highlighted climate change, pharmaceuticals in the environment and our policy on the use of chemicals as key areas of concern. They told us GSK should be at the forefront of EHS and sustainability issues and exert a positive influence over others in the industry and in its supply chain. We published feedback from these discussions in a consultative document for further comment by bothinternal stakeholders and GSK's new EHS External Stakeholder Panel. See Stakeholder Engagement for more information. We expect to publish the renewed 10-year EHS Plan for Excellence in mid-2006. Audits and Certification Our audit programme requires all manufacturing and R&D sites to be audited. Inter nal auditors (who ar e certified as lead auditors against the international environment health and safety management standards: ISO 14001 andOHSAS18001) assess how well EHS management systems and standar ds are being implemented and how well our sites comply with key legislation. In 2006 we are revising the audit process to focus on significant health and safetyrisks and environmental impacts. The frequency of siteaudits will be determined by factors such as EHS risks, profile and performance. At the end of 2005 we assessed the performance of all facilities (except small commercial sites) using self- assessment and inter nal audit. (W e audited 33 sites.) The average scor e was 77%, but 3 sites achieved scor es below 50%, which we regard as unacceptable. While the average scor e exceeds our target of 75% we will aim to correct unacceptable performance and continue to pursue further improvements to achieve best practice. In 2005, two sites (in the US and Spain) achieved \"leadership\" scor es above 90%, while a further seven achieved scor es over 80%. The best performance on environmental issues was in air emissions, ozone depleting substances and waste management. Sites were generally weakest on biodiversity, risk assessment and self-auditing. Self-audit nevertheless achieved one of the biggest improvements over the year, along with pr ocess risk management. Sites are required to develop plans to address any weaknesses and improvements identified in the audit.Auditors monitor sites' progress in implementing theplans. In 2005 the EHS audit process and scoring system were further refined based on experience and feedback,including assessing auditors' reports to ensure greater consistency. EHS auditing software is available on our intranet to help sites and auditors track progress. EHS Certification At the request of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, GSK has embarked on a programme to achieveISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification. In 2005, thr ee additional sites achieved certification to the international environmental management standard, ISO14001. Two of these also achieved certification to the inter national health and safety standar d OHSAS 18001 bringing the total of dual certified sites to 16. One certified site left the GSK network. This means that 23 out of 89 pharmaceutical, consumer and vaccine manufacturing sites ar e now certified (6 sites are certified to ISO 14001 only) and onesite's utility area is certified to both. The certified sites arein China, Egypt, France, Germany , India, Italy , Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, T urkey , Kenya and the UK. In 2006 we continue to work on incr easing the number of certified sites by encouraging sites to volunteer forcertification. W e will also launch a pilot project to investigate the feasibility of certifying Research & Development sites. W e will then be in a position to move towards global certification. Stakeholder Engagement We have frequently engaged through ad hoc meetings with a range of external stakeholders to help usunderstand their perspectives and identify emerging issues. In 2005 we stepped up our internal and external engagement on EHS issues. External engagement We established a standing panel of external stakeholders to provide ongoing advice and comment on our EHS performance. The panel is facilitated by The Environment Council, an independent charity which brings people together to develop long-term solutions to envir onmental issues. The 10 members include representatives from our customers, suppliers, r egulators, envir onmental organisations and socially responsible investors. The panel met for the first time in September 2005 to review our draft position papers on pharmaceuticals in the environment, climate change, and policy on the use of chemicals - issues identified as important in pr evious 76GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7stakeholder discussions. Members wanted us to show leadership on all three issues, and provide a betterexplanation of how the papers fit in with our EHS strategy. Their comments were considered in our internal discussions, before we finalised the position papers, whichhave been approved by the Corporate Executive Team. These position papers are available via the relevant sections of this site. The Panel also reviewed our proposal for revising the EHS Plan for Excellence Members expr essed a desire to see us at the forefront of EHS and sustainability issues, exerting a positive influence over others in the industry and its supplychain. Their comments (see side panel) will be considered in developing the Plan further . Internal engagement We regularly gather staf f feedback thr ough employee surveys but in 2005 we used the intranet to conduct our most extensive survey yet about the views of all employees on our EHS plans. This feedback will also be used to revise and develop our Plan for Excellence Employees told us:The EHS strategy must add value to GSK's business as well as \"doing the right thing\" Employees want GSK to be among the top pharmaceutical companies in EHS and to collaborate with other major players in the industry We need to embed EHS into the business, not just with systems but by instilling a culture where all employees contribute to EHS GSK should be a champion for transparency in EHS We should do more to track and influence new regulations thr ough more involvement in trade associations We need to do mor e to addr ess EHS issues in contract manufacturing The Plan for Excellence must be flexible enough to allow for different rates of progress in different parts of the business Partnerships We also partner with a number of environmental organisations in specific areas. For example, in 2005 we worked with Forum for the Futur e to evaluate the r ole of a pharmaceutical company in a sustainable society. We also worked with the environmental organisation Earthwatch Institute (Eur ope) to look at ways to addr essbiodiversity more effectively in our audit programmes, and we sponsored the policy group Green Alliance toconduct a study on how to achieve better environmentalregulation. We are conscious that our stakeholder engagement activities are heavily focused on the UK. We have begun to explore ways to extend them to Europe, the US and beyond over the next few years. Many of our sites also engage with stakeholders locally, for example, through open days, newsletters and community projects. Regulation GSK is keen to see proper measures in place to protect the environment and safeguard the development and launch of new medicines. In 2005 we engaged with r egulatory agencies in Eur ope and the USA on the issues of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE) and the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. In the US, we engaged with the newly established intergovernmental task force on PiE through the tradeassociation PhRMA; We are an active member of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries' working group on PiE which has been liaising with the UK Environment Agency; In Sweden we participated in an initiative organised by the trade association LIF to develop a voluntary schemeto classify pharmaceuticals by their environmentaleffects. The scheme has now been published [see http://www .fass.se] and an initial set of pharmaceuticals have been evaluated. Through the European trade association EFPIA, we contributed to the development of guidelines for the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals bythe European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The guidelines are expected to be finalised in 2006. We welcome the intr oduction of formal r equirements for the conduct of environmental risk assessment established in the EU' s New Medicines Legislation. GSK has lobbied for the environmental impacts of pharmaceuticals to be regulated solely through the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Pr oducts, and not also thr ough the proposed framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH). We believe thiswould lead to duplication of ef forts and place an unnecessary burden on the pharmaceutical industry. 77GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Training and Awareness Raising employees' awareness of environment, health and safety issues and improving their skills throughtraining are key parts of our EHS programme. Employeesat all levels need to understand the EHS issues in their working environment. For example, employees who handle waste at GSK sites need to know about its properties, the regulations that govern its disposal, and which materials can be r ecycled. We help employees deal with these issues through meetings, bulletins, and information on our intranet site, as well as specific training events The intranet site, myEHS Community, contains links to a range of programmes, including the EHS Manager information system which contains policies, standards, guidelines, tools, training materials, examples of bestpractice and news. It also pr ovides customised management reports on EHS performance by site. EHS training is also accessible through myLearning, GSK's online training service. Training Training takes place at site level, in accordance with our EHS Standard on training. EHS requirements and programmes are routinely included in site induction training for new employees. We regularly assess additionalneeds to make sure they match employee responsibilitiesand local regulatory requirements. In 2005 we carried out additional EHS management training for our Consumer Healthcare and Regional Pharma Supply organisations. We made site visits for one-on-one training, and sent EHS Essentials (a CD-based compliance tool) to 140 sales offices around the world toimprove EHS awareness. During 2005 we held r egional meetings in the UK, Mexico, China and Spain for EHS and Employee Healthprofessionals to share information and best practice. More than 120 employees from 79 sites took part. The meetings included training on EHS management system auditing, auditing of hazardous waste disposal sites, injury and illness reporting, ergonomic risk assessment, resilience and mental well-being. EHS managers are encouraged to attend conferences and training programs sponsored by local environmental organisations and academic institutions. Awareness We use several means of raising awareness of EHS issues and complementing our training programmes: the Chief Executive Officer's EHS Excellence Awards scheme recognises outstanding efforts in EHS and helps raise the profile of these issues around the business. We publish regular bulletins which are distributed to all sites for posting on bulletin boards. Three bulletins were circulated in 2005. We include articles on EHS in our internal magazine (GSK Spirit), our manufacturing magazine and site newsletters. We run an Environment Week every June (to coincide with the World Environment Day). Information kits are sent to all sites to help them develop ideas and planactivities. In 2005, over 11,000 GSK employees frommore than 60 sites worldwide took part in Environment Week. Activities focused on issues as varied as biodiversity , sustainable purchasing and waste management. We also encourage employees to consider environmental issues outside the workplace, such as minimizing household waste, energy and water conservation, and encouraging the use of fuel-efficient vehicles. EHS Excellence A wards The Chief Executive Officer's EHS Excellence Awards recognise and reward GSK sites for innovation in EHS Community Partnership, Gr een Chemistry/T echnology , and EHS Initiative (one for envir onment, one for health and safety). Each winner receives a trophy and selects a charity to r eceive a donation fr om GSK. The V anguard Award was introduced in 2005. It is given at the discr etion of the CEO to honour r ecurring, lasting and far reaching accomplishments in EHS. In 2005 - the fourth year of the Awards - there were 120 entries from 26 countries, the same as in 2004. There were applications from all GSK's business sectors: R&D, Manufacturing and Commercial, and for the first time entries from Facilities Management teams. The winners were chosen by a panel that included experts from academia, government and NGOs. In 2005, 12 projects representing sites in Europe, North America, and Asia received top honours. The winning projects covered areas as diverse as safe driving programmes and new product processes that use less energy and reduce waste. 78GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7The 2005 award winners were: Vanguard Award Rajahmundry, India received the first ever Vanguard Award for recurring, lasting and far reaching accomplishments in EHS Rajahmundry, where Horlicks and related products are made, has an outstanding record in the EHS Excellence Awards. In 2003, they received two First Place awards and one Second Place, and wer e awarded a Special Commendation in 2004. This year they received another First Place in the EHS Initiative category. Their first rate2005 EHS Community Partnership entry demonstrated a continuing passion for building good relationships between GSK and the local community though imaginative environment, health and safety partnerships. Also, in 2005 they became the first GSK site to achieve accreditation to the international standard for SocialAccountability, SA-8000, following ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 accreditation for Environment and Health & Safety. Community Partnership First Place: Aranda, Spain for: Supporting Implementation of 'Agenda 21' in Schools Agenda 21 emerged from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 as a plan for sustainable development.Aranda has contributed to its introduction at eight schools in the local community, promoting environmental education. Second Place: Nabha, India for \"Ignited Minds - Building Awareness of Road Safety\" The project aimed to raise children's awareness of safe driving and road safety in five government schools inNabha, reaching a total of 7,000 children. Green Chemistry/T echnology First Place: Tonbridge, United Kingdom for: Development of a Green Process for GW873140A This new manufacturing process for the antiretroviral drug GW873140A has significant environmental benefits aswell as cost savings. It produces no solid waste to be sentto landfill, reduces liquid waste by 37%, and the uses 16% less energy . Second Place: Research Triangle Park, United States of America for: Development of the Manufactur e Route for GW677954X A new manufacturing process for this diabetes drug has reduced the number of stages required for its synthesis,increasing yields by 39%, reducing waste by 70% andavoiding the use of some hazardous materials Third Place: Tonbridge, United Kingdom for: Development of an Environmentally Friendly Process for Manufacture of GW274150F Tonbridge developed a new process for synthesising this potential asthma drug, using cheap and readily available materials which reduce health and safety concerns and the amount of solvent required in manufacturing. EHS Initiative - Environment First Place: Rajahmundry, India for: Use Methane A Waste Management review revealed that most of the methane generated at the Rajahmundry's effluenttreatment plant was bur nt thr ough a flar e stack. The EHS team diverted the methane to use as fuel in the site canteen instead of liquefied petroleum gas Second Place: Rixensart and W avre, Belgium for: Management of Green Spaces The Rixensart and Wavre sites in Belgium have teams to develop and manage green spaces. They have developed a number of short and medium term projects to protect the natural environment and improve biodiversity in andaround the sites. Third Place: Thane, India for: Water Conservation The site carried out a water conservation project that included raising employee awareness and focused on three initiatives: harvesting rainwater for reuse, introducing water saving and recovery measures in thesite's heating and cooling systems, and recycling treated effluent water for gardening. 79GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7PROGRESS TOWARDS TARGETS Our EHS Plan for Excellence identified targets in 10 areas, with interim targets for 2005 - halfway through the planperiod. So we can now review progress over the fiveyears, as well as beginning work to extend the Plan for a further five years to 2015. We have achieved six targets and missed four. Targets achieved Energy use Global warming potential from energy use Ozone depletion potential from production of inhalers Water consumptionWastewater quality measured by chemical oxygen demand Non-hazardous waste disposed Target nearly achieved Volatile organic compounds emitted to air Targets not achieved Ozone depletion potential from ancillary equipment Hazardous waste disposed Waste recycled The chart summarises our progress since 2001 and in comparison to our targets (per unit of sales). 80GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Targe ts achieved Targets are pe r unit sales as compared to a 200 1 baseline Water Energy0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% 100% Non-hazardous waste COD ODP production Global 8% Ozone de ts not achi eved Targets are pe r unit sales as compared to a 200 1 baseline Waste recycled VOCs0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% 100% Hazardous waste ODP ancillaryTarget2005 performance Targets no t achieved 2005 performanc e T arget Volatile o rganic compound emissions to air 28% 30% Ozone de pletion po tential from -6% 10%(% Improvement) Our performance has been affected by significant business changes such as outsourcing, which has reduced ourwater consumption and improved wastewater quality. In other cases, such as solvent recovery, product transfers and new product introductions have made it more difficultto achieve targets. We met the targets for energy consumed and the associated global warming potential. This is largely due to significant improvements in energy savings in our primary manufacturing plants, while Resear ch and Development used more energy due to increased activity. We missed targets for recycling and for disposal of hazar dous waste (four-fifths of which is solvent). Performance was affected by a complex mixture of factors. On the one hand: Phase-out of some older products over the years (some with more steps) contributed to a reduction in solvent waste; New pr oducts being made tend to have fewer manufacturing steps than old products, which means less solvent and energy is used Some sites modified their equipment to recycle solvents that had been received when processes were moved from other facilities in pr evious years However New products mean our pilot plants are running more and manufacturing plants will take some time to adjustsolvent recycling operations to new solvents It will take some time to adjust solvent recovery operations to the new products And in one case a site needed to refurbish its solvent recovery equipment and so had to dispose of solvent that would or dinarily be r ecover ed and r eused The plan for the next 10 years, with interim targets for 2010, is now under construction. [link to Plan] It will be aligned with the GSK business drivers and will state aspirations to move towar ds envir onmental sustainability . We have consulted internally and externally on the Plan to ensure that it is reasonable and reflects measures which drive positive practices in the businesses and align withstakeholders' expectations. The extensive consultation means that the full plan will not be ready for publicationuntil at least mid-2006. Full details of performance ar e shown in each section of this report. MATERIALS EFFICIENCY Improving the efficiency with which we convert raw materials to finished product is an important objective forenvironmental sustainability. It will help us to reduce ourconsumption of natural resources, waste generation andthe cost of production. We believe we will be able to double material efficiency by 2010 for new processes coming out of R&D Chemical Development, achievingmaterial efficiencies for active pharmaceutical ingredientof 2% (i.e. 2 tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredient for every 100 tonnes of input chemicals) for these new processes. We will propose this as a target for the new 5-year plan. Our efforts are supported by the US drug regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is now focussing on process technologies and recommends that pharmaceutical manufacturers increase their focus onmanufacturing processes. The pharmaceutical industry has tended to use much more raw material for every kilo of finished product than other pr ocess sectors such as the agr ochemicals and fine chemicals industries. Pharmaceutical processes are typically very complex, usually involving many separate operationsand often requiring relatively large amounts of solvent. Typically , the industry uses about 100 kg of material for every kilogram of active pharmaceutical ingredient produced. That 1% material efficiency compares to about20% for fine chemicals and 50% for bulk chemicals. It represents a waste of valuable resources, with financial as well as envir onmental consequences, and GSK aims to make impr essing EHS issues already includes minimising the amount of material used. The FLASC green chemistry tool (see Product Design) includes the mass ofmaterial used as part of the lifecycle assessment of material impacts. But Chemical Development scientists have other targets, especially quality issues and minimising the timescale for developing the manufacturing pr ocess, which may conflict with improved material efficiency. We have begun placing a higher priority on improving our use of materials and are bringing together R&D and manufacturing teams to incr ease the focus on material efficiency in the product development stage, as well as for selected existing pr oducts. W e use two key measures of production ef ficiency: Mass pr oductivity - the mass of all materials used in the process compared to the mass of product produced 82GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), which gives a measure of the efficiency of putting together the key buildingblocks of a drug molecule - excluding the largevolumes of solvents which are normally used as a medium for the chemical reactions, and other materialswhich are essential to the reaction or process We are already making dramatic improvements to materials efficiency. For example, the R&D team at Tonbridge, UK, increased production mass efficiency to2.7% in the production of an anti-retroviral drug. Thechart shows substantial efficiency improvements duringthe development phase of several new compounds during 2005. These examples demonstrate the potential for improvement, although this scale of improvement cannotbe achieved in all processes. We aim to build on such successes in R&D and manufacturing. The EHS Plan for Excellence will include an impr ovement target for material efficiency for products emerging from R&D. 83GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Material Efficiency at Tonbridge GSK's Research and Development site at Tonbridge, UK, has dramatically improved the material efficiency in developing a robust manufacturing process for anantiretroviral compound for treating HIV. The original process required substantial energy, both in manufacturing and for dealing with waste. It also used a hazardous solvent (Dimethylformamide) and acid(Methanesulfonic). The final process, which is based on the same chemistry, does not use these hazardous materials. The new process increased mass efficiency from 2.2% to 2.7% (an increase of 23%) because the Tonbridgeteam identified more effective reagents - which mayalso be potential substitutes in other GSK pr ocesses. The process requires 16% less energy than the original route because the cycle time is shorter and it useslower processing temperatures. a reduction incontaminated aqueous waste also results in significantenergy savings because this waste requires energy- intensive incineration. Tonbridge estimates that the new process requires only two-thirds of the incinerationenergy for waste disposal, which at peak pr oduction rates could avoid 600,000 kg of carbon dioxideemissions a year - equivalent to driving an average family car more than two million miles. Tonbridge won first place in the Green Chemistry/Technology section of our EHS Excellence Awards for its work on this process.

This begins withproduct design and continues through managing theimpacts of our manufacturing operations, includingcontract manufacturing, to eventual disposal. We refer to this as product stewardship. This section focuses on: Product design - how we are incorporating environment, health and safety considerations into the design of new products Pharmaceuticals in the environment - what we are doing to understand and minimise the impact ofpharmaceuticals released to the environment after use Specific issues with meter ed dose inhalers - how we are progressing against our target to eliminate the useof CFCs (an ozone depleting gas) from our productportfolio by 2010. You can see more about other environmental issues associated with our products on our CorporateResponsibility website, including the use of geneticallymodified organisms, the use of natural resources, andpotential impacts on biodiversity. The research and development section of this report covers our approach to animal testing. Product Design We are working to incorporate environment, health and safety considerations into the design of new pr oducts through EHS staff participation in and support for newproduct teams, and thr ough the use of our Eco-design Toolkit. In 2005 we continued to integrate the EHS Milestone Aligned Pr ocess (MAP) into our product development and supply processes, including the R&D \"design for manufactur e\" initiative. About 500 R&D and manufacturing staf f have been trained over the past two years on the EHS Map Pr ocess. EHS involvement in the new product teams also provides a unique opportunity to influence supply chain decisions and highlight systemic EHS issues early in the product development process. Involvement in the teams which are responsible for products as they move from R&D to manufacturing also means that residual EHS risks are identified so they are managed appropriately in manufacturing.Toolkit Our Ecodesign Toolkit is used by R&D and manufacturing scientists and engineers to highlight potential EHS issues as early in the development process as practicable. Thetoolkit currently has five modules. Four of these were significantly revised during 2003 to make them easier to use, and they continue to be updated as appropriate. In 2005 we added a guide to hazardous chemicalslegislation. The toolkit is available on the GSK intranet and consists of: A Green Chemistry/T echnology Guide , which helps GSK scientists and engineers apply Green Chemistry concepts to achieve more efficient use of resources, reduce environment health and safety impacts, minimise costs and r educe EHS impacts materials guides , containing information on a range of materials used within GSK operations, includingsolvents that should be avoided. One guide coverssolvent selection while a second deals with chemicalbase selection a Green Packaging Guide - an assessment tool which includes guidance and a business pr ocess for evaluating and selecting packaging options for the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Healthcar e businesses. FLASC (Fast Lifecycle Assessment for Synthetic Chemistry) - a web-based tool and process launched in 2003 that allows bench chemists to perform a streamlined lifecycle evaluation of the environmentalimpacts of new or existing processes based on the materials used. FLASC helps scientists and managers to rapidly identify the \"greenest\" materials option by comparing and benchmarking pr ocesses and r outes to make GSK pr oducts. It identifies the materials that have the most significant lifecycle environmental impacts and provides guidance on how to r educe those impacts The Chemicals Legislation Guide (CLG) is the newest product stewardship tool. It identifies chemicals legislation in various parts of the world aimed at phasing out hazardous substances from routine use.The CLG incorporates hazard information, volume and the phase of use to provide risk-based guidance abouta variety of chemicals of concern, in a form that is easyfor scientists to use. Each module was designed to ensur e that all EHS impacts of materials, pr ocesses and services ar e consider ed, fr om the manufacture of the raw materials through to the ultimate fate of pr oducts and wastes in the envir onment. 85GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7During 2005 we have been working with key R&D groups to make the Eco-design Toolkit more compellingand useful to our R&D and manufacturing scientists andengineers. Pharmaceuticals in the Environment Drugs work through active pharmaceutical ingredients that are absorbed in the patient's body. These materials - including anything that is not absorbed - are eventually excreted through the body's normal mechanisms and enter the sewage system. Wastewater treatment plants remove most pharmaceutical residues, but small concentrations do end up in rivers or in the sea. In areaswithout wastewater treatment, higher concentrationsenter the environment. Pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface, ground and drinking waters in the US and Eur ope. This has raised concer ns about potential impacts on people, animals and the environment, eg: contributing to antibiotic resistance; feminisation by oestrogens; the effects of highly potent drugs on environmental organisms; the presence of anti- depressants in drinking water; the effects on wildlife ofveterinary drugs such as pain killers. Regulators are nowacting on these concerns. For example, the Swedishauthorities now require additional information to classify pharmaceuticals by environmental impacts, the European Union is proposing more extensive environmental testingfor pr oduct registrations, while others are investigating mitigation measur es such as take-back schemes, water treatment upgrades, and labelling revisions. GSK has developed business processes to ensure that we carry out appropriate environmental tests. Environmental risk assessments are part of the approval process for newdrugs in the EU and US, so we provide regulatory agencies with assessments to evaluate and allow for mitigation of any potential environmental impacts. We also work with other pharmaceutical companies, universities and research groups to develop the science and methodologies to assess the environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in the envir onment and incr ease understanding of such risks. For example, in the US, GSK has been involved with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in developing the PhATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and TransportEvaluation) model based on specific local hydrology and population patterns. Action in 2005 We finalised the position paper on pharmaceuticals in the environment which was developed in 2004, afterextensive internal consultation. The paper was approved in December 2005. We engaged with the US Interagency Task Force on Pharmaceuticals in the Environment, and with the UK Environment Agency through PhRMA and the Associationof the British Pharmaceutical Industry respectively. We are interacting with other governmental groups working in this area, such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Geological Survey and are establishing relationships with groups working on this issue in Europe. GSK scientists who had been part of the team of experts at an international scientific workshop in 2003 on humanpharmaceuticals in the envir onment co-authored a number of chapters in a book: Human Pharmaceuticals: Assessing the impacts on aquatic ecosystems , published in 2005. This work pr ovides a r oadmap for industry, gover nment and academia for r esear ch in this area. We have worked with PhRMA to develop a database of scientific literature on the impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic life. We have also collaborated to prepare detailedhuman health and environmental risk assessments onseveral fr equently-detected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, aspirin, paracetamol, part on-going PhRMA researchto impr ove understanding and pr ovide data needed to prioritize further investigation. We continued comprehensive environmental risk assessments using the PhATE model for the US and the GREA T-ER model for Eur ope for about 35 active pharmaceutical ingredients. We developed Allowable Daily Intake levels for human consumption through drinkingwater and fish consumption, as well as No-Effects Levels for aquatic organisms. We can make quantitative risk assessments by comparing these with predicted environmental concentrations. These assessments will be published on our website and in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. The underlying environmental fate and effects test data forpharmaceutically active components of GSK-marketedproducts are now being embedded in Safety Data Sheets (SDS). These are available on our website at www.msds-gsk.com The risk assessments carried out to date indicate that our products do not appear to pose an appreciable risk forhumans or the environment based on current methods for ascertaining ef fect levels. But we continue to monitor the latest scientific studies and findings to improve our risk assessments in this area. 86GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Metered Dose Inhalers Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are used to deliver the main forms of treatment for asthma sufferers. They arepressurised, hand-held devices that use propellants todeliver doses of medication to patients' lungs. They were first introduced in the 1950s and CFCs were traditionally used as the propellant because they are non-toxic, non- reactive, non-flammable, and do not have any odour or taste. When a patient uses the MDI, the propellant is released into the atmosphere. In 2005, 198 thousand kilograms of CFC propellant were released when patients used ourproducts in the EU and US (we do not have data for therest of the world). A much smaller proportion of CFCs - 51 thousand kilograms - escaped to air during production of inhalers worldwide (see ozone depleting substances). The Montreal Protocol bans the production of CFCs but it exempts a number of \"essential uses\" which includeMDIs. Nevertheless we plan to eliminate the use of CFCsfrom our worldwide product portfolio by 2010. We are committed to stop making CFC devices for developedcountry markets by the end of 2006 and we will not request any more essential use CFC allocation for the US or the EU after 2005. We now offer a selection of alternatives in most countries. The main alter native propellant we use is HFC 134a, which does not affect ozone but does have high global warming potential. We have also invested heavily in dry powder delivery systems that do not use CFCs or HFCs. We estimate that we have invested mor e than \u00a3550 million ($1 billion) on new plant and R&D for CFC-alter natives since we identified this as an issue in the 1980s. 87GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Ozone depl etion potential from patient use of metered dose in halers 0.00.51.01.52.0 20012002 2 003 2 005 2004(million kg CFC-11 equivalent) Ozone de pletion potential from pa tient use of metere d dose inh alers Year O DP 2001 1 .900 2002 1 .500 2003 0 .782 2004 0 .464 2005 0 .198 Note to Ozone Depletion Potential Charts We report ozone depletion potential in CFC-11 equivalents as defined by the United Nations Environment Pr ogramme (UNEP) Ozone Secr etariat. The data only include EU and US.ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL An increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is thought by many scientists to be causing a rise in theearth's temperature, known as \"global warming\" . Burning fossil fuels for heat and power releases carbon dioxide(CO 2) - the most significant greenhouse gas. In 2001 we set a target for 2005 to reduce the global warming potential of energy per unit sales by 8%. Wemore than met this target and achieved a 13% reductionper unit sales, as we report in the energy section. GSK's global warming impact comes mainly from the energy used in our facilities (manufacturing, R&D andoffice sites) which accounts for two-thirds of our carbondioxide emissions. This is where we are concentratingefforts to reduce emissions, although we are also working on emissions from transport, and compounds we use in our pr oducts. We use compounds that contribute to global warming in producing metered dose inhalers and in some ancillary equipment. Compounds which contribute to global warming ar e also r eleased when patients use metered dose inhalers. They include CFCs and HCFCs (which also deplete the ozone layer) and HFCs. W e report emissions of ozone depleting compounds in the ozone depletion section. See also pr oduct stewar dship for mor e about the use of ozone depleting compounds in our pr oducts. Carbon dioxide and methane from waste treatment and fermentation also account for 6% to our global warming impact. We will continue working to minimise energy use and emissions in the face of significant challenges. Expected growth in new products will require additional equipment which will require additional energy. We will work tobalance this gr owth by continuing to find opportunities for greater efficiencies in new and existing facilities and operations. As a result, we expect energy use and related CO 2emissions to r educe by 1% per unit sales each year until 2010. Performance Global warming potential decreased in 2005 by 1% (compared to 2004) and 25% since 2001. Note to Global Warming Charts Our global warming impact from energy is calculated using conversion factors from the World BusinessCouncil For Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/World Resources Initiative (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, September 2001, its Stationary and Mobile Combustion Workbooks, and the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (1996). We use conversion factors from the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs to calculate CO 2from business air travel and air freight. We will investigate and assess the use of updated conversion factors for energy beginning in 2006. Energy Use From our Facilities includes all energy consumed at GSK facilities in the form of electricity and steam pur chased and fuels bur ned in fixed combustion equipment on site, including emergency generators. Figures include fuels used to generate steam and electricity on-site but not fuel for on-site transport. The energy consumption section of this r eport includes a breakdown of energy data. Transport includes business travel by air (including transatlantic flights between the US and UK, flights within the EU and US for r outine business activities, and flights originating in the UK to large gr oup events such as sales conventions), business travel by road (including company-owned vehicle fleets, primarily our global sales fleet), and product freight by air. The increase in globalwarming potential from transport since 2001 is mainlybecause we have improved our reporting systems tomore comprehensively collect transport data. For example, the 2001 data did not include business air travel within the EU and US and did not include UK and inter national sales fleet travel. The data do not include employee travel to work. We do not collect data for flights originating in the US tolarge gr oup events or for other modes of business travel including rail and bus. We do not calculate CO 2 emissions from road, rail or sea freight transport because our central data collection system is not as robust in these areas and the impacts are small when compared to those of air fr eight transport. The transport section of this r eport includes a breakdown of transport data. The ozone depletion data does not include CFCs released from patients' use of metered dose inhalers. Other is CO 2equivalents fr om waste tr eatment and fermentation. 88GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued789GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Global warming pote ntial 05001000150020002500300035004000 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million kg CO2 equivalent) Operat ions energy Transport energy Compo unds* Othe r** Glob al warmin g potential Year O peration s T ransport Co mpounds* Other ** Total 2001 1 903 124 133 9 1 45 3 510 2002 1 844 179 968 170 3162 2003 1 833 178 619 146 2775 2004 1 747 2 06 5 67 1 38 2 657 2005 1 759 232 488 155 2634 * compo unds th at to gl obal wa rming ** incl udes wast e treatment and ferment ation Energy Consumption Energy use from our facilities accounts for two-thirds of GSK's global energy consumption. In 2005, we used 19million gigajoules of energy which produced emissions of1,759 million kg CO2. We bought 43% of our energy as electricity and a small amount (about 1%) as municipal steam or hot water. We generated the rest at our sites. In 2005 we consulted, inside and outside the company, on a position statement on our future use of energy. This was drafted in 2004 in response to stakeholder feedback that energy use and its impact on global warming are key concerns. The draft position sets out a strategy for energyefficiency, renewable energy and emissions trading. We continued to work on energy efficiency initiatives in 2005, as demonstrated by the following site projects: Stevenage, UK - installed solar-powered street lights Port Fairy, Australia - assessed wind turbine and bioenergy potential Nashik, India - installed solar heating for canteen hot water Research Triangle Park, US - increased its sponsorship level in the state green power programme, which willadd mor e than 700,000 kWh of r enewable energy to North Car olina's power supply Zebulon, US - saved energy by better control of laboratory lighting, introducing motion-activatedlighting and reducing the temperature of the office buildings by 2 degrees US Pharma and R&D Site Operations - created the Strategic Energy Leadership Council to bring together managers with a common interest in energy management to pr ovide leadership on energy matters. The Council has implemented energy and utilities initiatives that have saved in excess of $2 million, including an Energy Conservation T racking database and Energy T echnology W orkshops Suzhou, China - modified the chilled water system to avoid using the chiller when the air temperature islow enough to ensure cool water. This has saved an estimated 550,000 kWh of electricity in a year.Emissions trading A number of our UK sites participate in the government's emissions trading scheme (ETS) - helping us to gain experience in carbon trading. The UK ETS is a voluntaryscheme which rewards companies with lower energy taxes if they improve energy efficiency. Sites that keep emissions below an agreed target can \"bank\" the spare credits to help comply with limits in subsequent years, or they cansell the credits to other participants in the scheme. We achieved the required emissions in the target year, 2004 and are on course for the next target year, 2006. The Eur opean Union trading scheme came into force at the start of 2005. The first phase runs from 2005 to 2007 and sites with greater than 20 megawatts of installed combustion capacity ar e required to participate. In total, 16 GSK sites will be r egulated under this scheme. Our performance in 2005 has been verified by external auditors and although some sites have exceeded their cap, we anticipate that overall we will have surplus carbon credits under this scheme. We plan to bank some of thesecredits to help us comply with future limits, and expect totrade the r emainder of the cr edits. Performance Energy consumption (excluding transport) Total energy consumption increased by 2% from 2004 to 2005 (but decr eased by 8% since 2001). Energy consumption per unit sales decr eased by 4% from 2004 to 2005 and 13% since 2001, so we have met our 2005target of an 8% r eduction per unit sales since 2001. Global Manufacturing Supply (GMS) and Research and Development (R&D) have the greatest impact on GSK's energy consumption profile. They account for 59% and 26% of GSKs energy consumption respectively. In 2005 R&D used almost 4% more energy because it is expanding as products move through the R&D pipeline. This is partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives to keep the increase in energy use to a minimum. Energy managers are working on projects to improve energy efficiency so that the expanded activity will not require an equivalent increase in energy use. Our Primary Supply & Antibiotics group within GMS reduced its total energy use by more than a third since2001 - the greatest reduction of any GSK supply group oroperation over the same time period. This significant reduction was the result of a focus on energy efficiency and a coordinated effort to identify and implement site-specific programmes at the sites in that supply group. 90GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued791GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Energy c onsumpt ion (excluding tra nspo rt) 0510152025 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million gigajoules) Non- 94% 92% 88%91% Per u as bas eline (RH axis)Target Energy c onsum ption (exc luding transpo rt) Year St eam Electric Non -transport fuels Total 2001 0 .3 8 .1 1 2.3 20. 7 2002 0 .1 8 .3 11. 7 2 0.0 2003 0 .2 8 .3 11. 4 1 9.9 2004 0 .2 8 .0 1 0.7 18.8 2005 0 .2 8 .2 1 0.7 19. 2 92GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Energy con sump tion by xcluding and ent11% s upply antibioti cs 5.3 New produ ct and g lobal supply 2.1 Regional Pharma supp ly 1.9 Consumer H ealthcare supply 2.1 Biolog icals 1.5 Research an d Deve lopment 5.0 Commercial 1.0 Other 0.3 Total 19.2 (millio n gig ajoule s) Global warming potential from energy Total global warming potential from energy use at our facilities increased less than 1% from 2004 to 2005 but decreased by 8% since 2001.

Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides In 2005, 87,842 kilograms of NOx and 364,014 kilograms of SO2 were emitted from sites with coal-fired power. Note to Energy Charts Energy consumption at our facilities is defined as all energy consumed in the form of electricity and steam purchased and fuels burned in fixed combustionequipment on site, including emergency generators. Figures include fuels used to generate steam and electricity on-site but not fuel for on-site transport.

The NOX and SO2 are calculated from the coal used at the only two GSK facilities(in India) that use coal, usingconversion factors from the National AtmosphericEmissions Inventory (UK national methodology). 93GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Saving energy by using waste methane GSK's consumer healthcare site at Rajahmundry, India, has captured methane generated by anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge, which was previouslywasted, and now uses it instead of liquefied petroleumgas (LPG) in the site canteen. The \"USE MEthane\" [correct double CAP] project, which was completed in March 2005, has reduced the risk from storing LPGcylinders as well as conserving resources, saving moneyand eliminating waste. Methane is generated by the factory's effluent treatment plant. Previously, the majority of this highly flammable gas was burnt through a flare stack, with some used in the production of distilled water. The USE MEthane pr oject examined how the gas could be put to productive use and identified canteen fuel as the best solution. The factory laid a pipeline fr om the anaer obic digestion to the canteen, and bought new stoves adapted to burn methane rather than LPG. The project has reduced the amount of LPG used in the site's canteen by 80%, saving 255 cylinders of gasa year , worth more \u00a31,000. LPG cylinders has also impr oved safety , significantly reducing the risk of an explosion.

In 2005 we emittedapproximately 232 million kilograms of CO 2from transport. Business air travel accounts for almost half (48%) of our travel-related CO 2 emissions. In 2005, employees travelled a total of almost 800 million kilometres by plane (a decrease of 2% since 2004) - resulting in 112 million kg of CO 2 emissions. This includes transatlantic flights between the US and UK, and flights within the EU and US for routine business activities, as well as travel originatingin the UK related to large group events such as salesconventions. In 2005, our global sales fleet drove a total of over 850 million kilometr es on business travel - r esulting in 102 million kg of CO2. In addition to business travel, we also transport products from our manufacturing plants to distributors. In 2005, GSK pr oducts wer e transported a total of 195 million kilometres - the majority (82%) by air freight. We estimate that the air freight resulted in 19 million kg of CO2. This 37% incr ease in 2005 is due to: improved data collection continued business growth increased sourcing from China a rise in clinical trials conducted outside the US and UK We have launched a number of initiatives to reduce the impact of transporting pr oducts. They include consolidating freight shipments so pharmaceutical and consumer products are transported together, consolidating shipping points, and making mor e use of r ound tripping (managing inbound freight trucks so they do not return empty). We also convert air transport to sea transportwhere possible. We have \"green travel plans\" at a number of sites to encourage employees to reduce the environmental impact of their travel to work. For example, at GSK House in Brentfor d, UK, privileged parking spaces ar e given to car - sharers and drivers of fuel efficient cars, buses run to and from the local train station, while changing rooms andshowers ar e provided for cyclists as well as discounts for bicycle equipment and repairs. We encourage employees to use video and teleconferencing where possible to reduce air travel.Virtual meeting software is available to employees formaking presentations and collaborative working. On average, GSK employees conduct 450 video meetings,30,000 teleconferences and 29,000 virtual meetings per month. Performance Total global warming potential from transport increased by 13% in 2005 and 88% since 2001. The increase since2001 is mainly because we have improved our reportingsystems to collect mor e comprehensive transport data. For example, the 2001 data did not include business air travel within the EU and US, and it did not include the UK and inter national sales fleets. We believe we are still under estimating our global warming potential fr om transport because we do not have a robust system to collect group air travel not originating in the UK. Note to Transport Chart Data for business air travel includes transatlantic flights between the US and UK, flights within the EU and US for routine business activities, and flights originating inthe UK to large group events such as sales conventions. Data for business travel by road is primarily our global sales fleet. W e do not collect data for other modes of business travel including rail and bus. The CO 2from air freight covers all global routes. We do not calculate CO 2emissions from road, rail or sea freight transport because our central data collection system is not as robust in these areas and the impactsare small when compared to those of air freight transport. We use conversion factors fr om the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs to calculate CO 2 from business air travel and air freight. 96GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued797GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Global warming potential from transport 050100150200250 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004Busin ess travel by road Busin ess travel by air Product freight by air(million kg CO2 equivalent) Glob al warmin g potential from tra nsport Year Fr eight Bu siness air Business roa d T otal 2001 1 9 71 33 1 24 2002 1 3 92 75 179 2003 1 3 95 70 178 2004 1 4 114 78 206 2005 1 9 112 102 232 WATER Water is a valuable natural resource that needs to be conserved and protected from pollution. Waterconservation is particularly important in areas where water shortages are common. GSK uses water in manufacturing (eg for processes, products, cooling and cleaning) and for general site uses including drinking, food services and sanitation. The amount of water our sites use varies according to the activities that take place. Primary supply sites - those that manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients - are typically heavy users of water, as are sites thatmanufacture vaccines or produce drinks. Those involved in research and development and commercial sitestypically use less. The GSK water standard requires sites to minimise water use and r e-use water whenever feasible. Sites ar e requir ed to minimise the potential environmental impacts of discharging wastewater. Water Use In 2005, we used 22 million cubic metr es of water . This is about average for the industry, based on benchmarking with other major pharmaceutical companies. We sourcewater mainly fr om municipal water supplies (59%), wells or bor eholes (40%), with a small amount from other sources. Total water consumption increased by less than 4% since 2004 (but is down 19% since 2001). Water consumption per unit sales decr eased by 3% since 2004 (23% since 2001). This means we met our 2005 target to cut water useper unit sales by 10%. This is mainly due to consolidating primary manufacturing sites following the merger in 2000, and outsourcing some fermentation processes. We have intr oduced water conservation measur es. For example, our site at Thane, India, won one of the CEO's EHS Excellence A wards for its water conservation measures (see below) and similar projects were submitted by sites in Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Poland and Canada. Note to W ater Use Charts Water use includes water sourced from wells/boreholes, municipal and other sources (mainly wastewater from external industrial sour ces). The data include water used in manufacturing processes and for general sites uses, as well as water incorporated into products 98GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Water conservation at Thasne, India GSK's site at Thane, near Mumbai in India, manufactures medicines for the local market. Thane introduced measures to conserve and minimise wateruse in 2004, including rainwater harvesting, improvingefficiency and installing water saving technologies. Between 2003 and 2005, the site reduced water consumption from 200,000 kilolitres per year to160,000 kilolitres per year. The site is located in a monsoon region, meaning it experiences irregular rainfall and water shortagesduring the dry season. This pr oblem is amplified by increasing urbanisation and agricultural development. Thane receives water from the municipal supply and uses it for cooling, generating steam in the boiler , and in the gardens. Thane installed rainwater catchment devices on r oofs near the site' s boiler and cooling towers. The rainwater is pumped to storage tanks ready for immediate use, or pumped into a borewell to replenish the water table. As a r esult, water consumption during the peak monsoon month of September dr opped fr om 16,000 kilolitres in 2003 to 12,000 kilolitres in 2004. Several measur es wer e introduced to save water, including a steam r ecovery device for the boiler, prohibiting hose cleaning of plant floors, installingphoto-sensors in the urinals and installing footoperated taps in the site's canteen. Thane installed a drip irrigation system in the garden and the sprinkler system was changed to reduce the amount of water lost thr ough evaporation. Other changes to the garden included altering the planting season to coincide with wetter months, watering plantsduring the early morning and allowing the grass to grow longer so it holds in soil moisture. Thane was awarded third place in the environment category of the CEO's EHS Excellence Awards for its water conservation impr ovements.

This is 1% less than 2004 (20% since2001). The decrease is mainly due to consolidating primary manufacturing sites following the merger in 2000, and outsourcing some fermentation processes. We reused, recovered or recycled 6% of total wastewater. GSK's EHS Standards require sites to reuse water whenever feasible and ensure that all wastewater is treated and discharged in a way that minimises adverse environmental impacts. Most sites discharge wastewaterto municipal treatment facilities either with or withoutprior treatment. Some large sites, especially primary manufacturing sites, have their own on-site wastewater treatment systems. Some sites are permitted to discharge wastewater direct to sea. All five of our sites in India have implemented \"zero wastewater\" discharge programmes - reusing and recycling all wastewater. They use processed wastewater for watering plants and trees, which help provide shade,improve the appearance of the site, and are also a sourceof food for employees. They do not discharge anywastewater to water bodies or to municipal sewers. Our site in Xochimilco, Mexico uses processed wastewater for watering gardens around the site, washing vehiclesand windows and other uses not requiring drinking water. Our sites in Turkey and the Philippines also re-use all wastewater . We assess the quality of our wastewater by measuring the chemical oxygen demand (COD) - the oxygen r equir ed to chemically oxidise organic and inorganic compounds present in the water. (The lower the COD, the cleaner thewater .) Total COD decr eased by 7% compar ed to 2004 (30% since 2001). Most of the reduction is due to our site at Ulverston, UK, outsourcing fermentation processes. COD per unit sales decr eased by 13% since 2004 and 34% since 2001 - meaning we have achieved our 2005 target of a 30% reduction per unit sales since 2001. Note to Wastewater and COD Charts Wastewater volume includes all manufacturing and site process wastewater as well as sanitary and food servicewastewater. Wastewater quality is measured by Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) which is a measure of the oxygenrequired to chemically oxidise organic and inorganiccompounds present in the water. The COD is measured when wastewater leaves our sites, following any on-site treatment. 101GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7102GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Waste wate r volume Wast ewater volume Year Se a E stuary Sewer Other * T otal 2001 3 .8 2 .1 9 .9 4 .9 2 0.7 2002 3 .5 2 .4 8 .1 3 .6 1 7.7 2003 3 .4 1 .8 7 .0 4 .1 1 6.4 2004 3 .2 1 .1 7 .9 4 .6 1 6.7 2005 3 .4 1 .1 8 .1 4 .0 1 6.6 * includ es direct to river and reused/recovered/recycled 0510152025 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million cubic metres) Direct to sea Direct to estuary Municip al sewer Othe r* 103GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Waste wate r volume b y busin ess 39% P rimary ly product C ct and g lobal supply 0.9 Regional Pharma supp ly 1.9 Consumer H ealthcare supply 2.8 Biolog icals 1.4 Research an d Deve lopment 2.3 Commercial 0.4 Other 0.4 Total 16.6 (millio n cub ic me tres) 104GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Waste water chemical oxygen demand 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004100% 90% 85% 66%76% 051015202530(million kg) Direct to sea Direct to estuary Municip al sewer Othe r*Per u nit sales as percentage of 2001 bas eline (RH axis)Target Wastewater che mical oxygen demand Year Se a E stuary Sewer Other * T otal 2001 1 3.0 8.1 6.0 0.2 27.3 2002 1 0.7 5.2 6.9 2.7 25.5 2003 11. 3 4 .7 7 .1 1 .3 2 4.3 2004 11. 4 3 .0 5 .9 0 .2 2 0.5 2005 11. 4 2 .3 5 .2 0 .2 1 9.1 * inc ludes reused/recovered/recycl ed, on-sit e irrigation 105GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Waste wate r chemi cal oxygen dem and by busi ness 83% P rimary supp ly product and gl obal supply 2% R egion al Pha rma supp ly Primary s upply and antibiotics 15.9 New produ ct and g lobal supply 0.2 Regional Pharma supp ly 0.5 Consumer H ealthcare supply 1.3 Biolog icals 0.4 Research an d Deve lopment 0.1 Commercial 0.0 Other 0.8 Total 19.1(millio n kg) WASTE Our research, production and commercial activities all produce waste, which we aim to manage safely andresponsibly. We manage waste from when it is generatedto its final disposal. We want to eliminate waste where we can, reduce it where we cannot, re-use materials if possible, recycle other waste and dispose of any remaining material sensitively. We generate different kinds of waste in different parts of the business: Production - hazardous wastes such as solvents and other chemicals. R&D and quality laboratories - small amounts of chemicals including products and intermediates, as well as broken glassware and plastics Offices - paper and other standar d commer cial waste Renovations take place in pr oduction, of fice and lab space which pr oduce non-r outine waste such as obsolete equipment, office furniture, structural materials Most of the active ingr edients in our pharmaceutical products are manufactured using chemical processes. This means that a significant pr oportion of our waste is classified as hazar dous because it contains solvents and chemicals used in these processes. We report hazardouswaste separate fr om non-hazar dous, and identify non- routine waste such as construction and demolition rubble because the volumes depend on building activity and tend to be inconsistent. Most pr oduction facilities segr egate their wastes, r e-use what they can, send what they can for r ecycling, and incinerate or landfill anything else. Incineration is usually the pr eferred choice for dealing with solvents that can' t be reused or recycled. Sites try to use waste management companies which use incinerators that recover energy from bur ning the materials. We aim to use r eputable waste handling companies for waste disposal. W e require disposal contractors to comply with our EHS requirements and local regulations. Our internal EHS audit team audits waste disposal contractors to make sur e they handle waste appr opriately . In the past, some waste and chemicals handling practices (which ar e no longer followed) contaminated land and groundwater. We are continuing to clean up these sites to deal with health and envir onmental hazar ds. GSK and its heritage companies have spent more then \u00a3100m cleaning up more than 50 sites in the US over thelast 20 years. We are continuing to clean up 25 of thesesites. Most of them are waste disposal sites where GSK is one of several responsible parties. We continue to work on reducing waste, especially hazardous waste. One of our material efficiency aspirations is to minimise the number of solvents used or use smaller amounts so we don't have so much to dispose of. Our Operational Excellence initiative, which started in 2001, has a strong focus on elimination of all types ofwaste from manufacturing processes. This is reflected inapplications for the CEO's EHS Excellence awards - 11 projects in 2005 involved eliminating or recycling waste. Our performance on waste is cover ed in the following pages. Hazar dous Waste More than 80% of our hazardous waste consists of solvents that ar e used in pr oduction pr ocesses. W e also dispose of some lubricants and fluor escent lights, while research waste includes animal carcases. Our labs generatevery small quantities of radioactive waste, which is highlyregulated. Regulations vary widely ar ound the world, but our first choice for solvents is to re-use or recycle material. When this is not possible the main disposal option for solvents isincineration. We aim to use incineration with energyrecovery wherever possible. The main focus of our work to impr ove material efficiency is to r educe the total amount of solvents we use. In 2005, we disposed of 68 million kg of hazardous waste (excluding demolition and construction waste). This is mostly solvents (81%), the rest being general site waste (18%) and chemical, biological or radioactive waste (1%). In 2005, 44% of hazardous waste disposed was incinerated with energy recovery, 54% was incineratedwithout energy recovery. The remaining waste was disposed to licensed landfill sites. 106GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Performance Total hazardous waste disposed decreased by 8% since 2004 (but is up by 9% since 2001). Hazardous waste disposed per unit sales decreased by 14% since 2004 (butincreased 3% since 2001) - meaning we did not meet our 2005 target of a 15% reduction per unit sales since 2001. Our previous trend of reducing hazardous waste per unit sales was reversed in 2004 by a combination of factors. GSK's hazardous waste is mostly solvents and one plant scheduled for closure had to dispose of redundant solventstocks. This had a one off impact on our data. In addition,changes to pr oduction at other plants included bringing in-house processes that were previously undertaken by contract manufacturers and moving existing processes among sites. Our engineers continued to assess how tooptimise the new and moved pr ocesses to r educe solvent use and increase recycling and in 2005 we resumed the downward trend. Solvent recovery was affected by several factors in 2005: we had to repair solvent recovery equipment at two sites, which resulted in complete shut-down of therecovery operation. No commer cial recovery operation was available, so solvent normally r ecover ed was incinerated instead new products using new solvents continue to come on line. It can take time for sites to gear up solvent recovery and recycling for these new materials pilot plants, which are producing our new products as they go into clinical trials, work with such a wide range of different solvents that recycling is not practical in 2004 some of our primary sites had difficulty handling solvents r eceived as a r esult of moving processes between sites. This year some of the sites began to recover from these moves and improved their solvent r ecovery , ther eby decreasing the amount of solvents disposed one new site which we acquired in 2004 contributed an additional 3 million kg to the total of solvent recycled this year . Note to Hazardous Waste Charts Although the external definition of what constitutes a waste varies, for GSK reporting purposes a material isconsidered a waste if it is no longer fit for its originally intended purpose. Hazardous waste disposed includes disposal to landfill and incineration either on or off GSK property. Incineration with energy recovery means burning the material and using the resulting energy. Incineration without energy recovery means burning the material without using the energy or heat generated. Hazardous waste disposed does NOT include recycling on-site oroff-site or non-routine waste. For consistent reporting, GSK considers a waste to be hazardous if it exhibits any of a number of properties asdefined by the Basel Convention in 1989 of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP). Included in these properties are flammability, explosivity, water or air reactivity, corrosivity, oxidising potential, acute orchronic toxicity, ecotoxicity or infection. In addition,because of their nature and potential impact onresearch and development activities, radioactive wastes are defined as hazardous. Bioengineered and biohazardous waste is included in hazardous waste. A waste is considered to be non-hazardous if it does not exhibit any of the hazardous properties notedabove. 107GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7108GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Hazardous wa ste dis posed 01020304050607080 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million kg) Incinerated with ene rgy recovery Incinerated without ene rgy recovery Landf ill0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 100% 96% 93%103%119% Per u nit sales 2001 bas eline (RH axis)110%120% Target Haza rdous wa ste dispo sed Year W ith re covery W ithou t recovery Land fill T otal 2001 2 8.7 30. 2 3 .4 6 2.3 2002 2 8.4 30. 7 2 .8 6 1.9 2003 2 6.8 31. 9 2 .2 6 0.8 2004 3 7.0 34. 9 1 .9 7 3.8 2005 3 0.0 36. 5 1 .4 6 7.9 109GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Hazardous wa ste dis posed by bu siness 80% P rimary supp 3% supp s upply and antibi otics 55.2 New ct and g lobal supply 1.9 Regional Pharma supp ly 1.9 Consumer H ealthcare supply 1.2 Biolog icals 3.4 Research an d Deve lopment 3.8 Commercial 0.4 Other 0.0 Total 67.8 (millio n kg) 110GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Hazardous wa ste dis posed sourc es 01020304050607080 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million kg) Solvent w aste Site w aste S olvent Sit e O ther* T otal 2001 5 0.3 12. 0 0 .0 6 2.3 2002 5 0.7 10. 3 0 .8 6 1.9 2003 4 8.7 10. 5 1 .8 6 0.9 2004 6 0.9 11. 4 1 .5 7 3.8 2005 5 4.9 12. 0 1 .0 6 7.9 * includ es ch emic al/biologic al/radioactive/ph armaceutical wa ste Non-hazardous Waste Most non-hazardous waste is general material such as office waste paper, kitchen waste and non-hazardoussubstances used in manufacturing. A very small part isbiological waste that has been treated so it is not hazardous. We do not include construction and demolition rubble and similar material not related to day- to-day operations, which we describe separately as non- routine waste. In 2005, we disposed of 41 million kg of non-hazardous waste. We continue to look for ways to reduce waste and have undertaken waste management reviews at many sites. Performance Total non-hazardous waste was 9% lower than in 2004 (23% lower than 2001). The weight disposed per unit sales decreased by 14% over the year (and by 27% since2001). This means we have considerably beaten our 2005target of an 8% r eduction per unit sales since 2001.

Non-hazardous waste disposal includes disposal to landfill and incineration either on or off GSK property.Incineration with energy recovery includes processesthat result in beneficial energy or resource recovery and includes a small amount of composting.

The largest waste component is solvent which has been used in the manufacturing process. Some solvent is purified on our sites and reused in the original manufacturing process. Sometimes we sell the solvent to commercial reprocessing companies, which we also include in the recycling statistics. Solvent which is not recycled in this way is usually incinerated. Recycling non-hazardous waste such as glass or plastic usually means sending it for reprocessing so it can bereused to make new products. Performance In 2005, we recycled 278 million kg of waste (72% of the nearly 390 million kg of waste generated). Over two-thirdsof the total waste recycled was hazardous waste, primarily solvents. The pr oportion of waste r ecycled was 2% higher than in 2004, but has decreased by 6% since 2001, mainly because we have generated less waste. This meanswe did not meet our 2005 target of a 10% increase in theproportion of waste recycled since 2001. Production changes in the last two years contributed to more incineration of solvent waste, so we r ecycled a smaller pr oportion. Three of our large primary manufacturing sites are now back on track with recycling solvent, which has reversed the decline at those sites, although in 2005 we continued to have difficulty with recovery at some sites. 115GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7116GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Propo rtion of total wast e recycled Proportion of total wa ste recycled Year W aste recycled 2001 76% 2002 75% 2003 76% 2004 71% 2005 72%40%45%50%55%60%65%70%75%80% 2001 RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20057 Environment continued Propo rtion of total waste recycled by busin ess 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Consumer Healthcare supply Primary supply and antibiotics Research and Development Biologicals Regional Pharma supply New product and global supply Other Commercial Proportion of total wa ste recycled by business Prima ry suppl y and antibio tics 77% New t and glob al suppl y 4 5% Region Ph arma 67% Consu mer He althcare suppl 20057 Environment continued Total waste rec ycled 050100150200250300350400 2001 2002 2 003 2 005 2004(million kg) Haza rdous Non-h azardous Total waste recycled Year Ha zardou s N on-hazard ous To tal 2001 2 88.4 79 .3 3 67.8 2002 255.9 8 5.6 341 .5 2003 2 35.1 90 .6 3 25.7 2004 1 82.4 104 .0 2 86.4 2005 1 93.8 84 .2 2 78.0 Non-Routine Waste Non-routine waste is primarily building materials from site demolition and construction activities and from smallremediation projects. In 2005, we disposed (via landfill orincineration) of 37 million kg of non-routine waste, and recycled 40 million kg. Performance The amount of waste fluctuates each year depending on plant upgrades and site closures. In 2005 new building at one of our vaccine plants accounted for nearly half of the non-routine waste Rather than sending this waste to landfill, the plant was able to provide excavated soil from the building expansionto another company to be used as clean fill. Note to Non-Routine W aste Charts Although the exter nal definition of what constitutes waste varies, for GSK reporting purposes a material is consider ed a waste if it is no longer fit for its originally intended purpose. Non-routine waste disposal includes disposal to landfill and incineration either on or off GSK property. Incineration with energy recovery includes processes that result in beneficial energy or resource recovery.

CFCs are the main ODSs we use - as the propellant gas in metered dose inhalers (MDI) for asthma sufferers. The CFCis released when patients use the inhalers. In 2005, 198 thousand kilograms of CFC propellant were released when patients used our products in the EU. We have stopped making these products in the US and theinformation on CFC releases from patient use is notcompiled outside the EU where this is not required byregulation. A much smaller amount of CFCs - 51 thousand kilograms - were released during worldwide production. W e now of fer a selection of alter natives to ODS-containing inhalers in most countries and plan to eliminate the use of ODSs from our product portfolio by 2010. See metered dose inhalers. We also use ODSs in some cooling systems and for other ancillary uses at GSK facilities. We have switched to usinghydrofluor ocarbons (HFCs) in some cooling systems. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer but do contribute to global warming. Ozone depletion potential fr om ancillary use per unit sales decr eased by 36% since 2001, meaning we have missed our 2005 target to completely eliminate theseemissions. We recognise that the only way to do this is toeliminate CFCs fr om cooling systems. Our new strategy will focus on installing new equipment to achieve this. We will set a new target in 2006 to eliminate CFC use in line with r egulations based on the Montr eal Protocol. Ozone Depleting Substances in Manufacturing A small proportion of the CFC used as a propellant in our Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) is released during themanufacturing process. We are working to eliminate use of ozone depleting substances in MDIs by switching toHFC and dry powder inhalers Performance Ozone depleting substances released Ozone from production activities Depletion Substance Kg Factor Potential CFC11/R11 14,658 1.000 14,658CFC12/R12 36,317 1.000 36,317 Total ozone from production decreased by 13% since 2004 (72% since 2001). Ozone depletion potential from production per unit sales decreased by19% since 2004 (74% since 2001) - meaning we have beaten our 2005 target of a 50% reduction per unit salessince 2001. As production of CFC-containing MDIs decreases, the amount of CFC lost during pr oduction also declines. W e will no longer manufacture CFC-containing MDIs in the US after 2005 and in Europe after 2006. We will continueto manufacture them in Bangladesh, China, India andPakistan until the end of 2010.

We missed our 2005 target to eliminate ozone depleting emissions from ancillary use. It has not proved possible to eliminate all emissions during servicing and maintenance of cooling equipment. This means that we need to upgrade or replace equipment to use non-ozone depleting gases. New cooling systems that don't useozone depleting gases are being introduced, in accor dance with regulatory requirements. In retrospect we believe the target we set was unrealistic, given the potential for improvement.

In2005, we released 5 million kilograms of VOCs to theatmosphere. VOCs react with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight, creating ozone in the lower atmosphere. This results in smog, which is a factor in human respiratoryillness. Workplace exposure to certain VOCs can also posea health risk. Performance Total VOCs emitted to air decreased by 5% in 2005 (24% since 2001). VOCs emitted to air per unit sales decreasedby 10% since 2004 (28% since 2001). That means we have missed our 2005 target of a 30% reduction per unit sales since 2001, but we achieved a substantial reductionand only narr owly missed the target. We achieved reductions since 2001 due to rationalising manufacturing operations following the merger in 2000, as expected when we set the target. The decr ease between 2004 and 2005 was due to our site at Ulverstonoutsourcing some manufacturing. Improved datacollection also contributed. Photochemical ozone cr eation potential decr eased by 7% since 2004 (23% since 2001).Note to VOC Charts Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including fugitive sources such as evaporation andleaks, are measured at GSK manufacturing operationsand research and development facilities. VOCs react with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight, creating ozone in the lower atmosphere. This results in smog, which is a factor in human respiratory illness. We report photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) in ethylene equivalents. Conversion to ethylene equivalents is based on the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) \"Responsible CareHSE Reporting Guidelines\" for VOCs (1998). 127GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 Reducing solvent use and waste in manufacturing GSK's R&D site at Research Triangle Park, US, is resear ching a new drug for the tr eatment of type II diabetes and metabolic syndr ome. The site has developed a new manufacturing process for the drug that r educes waste and solvent use, and eliminates the use of other harmful substances. Previous manufacturing processes for the drug were time-consuming and inefficient, involving up to eight steps with low production efficiency. The new processdeveloped by R TP has a number of envir onmental, health and safety benefits. The pr ocess is quicker, involving just three steps. Solvents are needed to aid synthesis at each step, so fewer steps mean less solvent is r equired. As a result, the amount of solvent used (and VOC emissions) has been reduced by 70%. The amount of waste produced has also been r educed by 70%. Importantly , the new process avoids the use of harmful alkylating agents which ar e hazar dous. RTP was awarded second place in the Green Chemistry/T echnology category of our CEO's EHS Excellence A wards for this achievement.

Wildlife can be threatened by new site developments and by existing operations which affect natural habitats.Habitats can be severely damaged by depletion of water resources so our use of water must be particularly sensitive (See Water for more information on water management) Any investigation and collection of natural products can also be disruptive and needs to be carefully managed tominimise adverse effects. We make only limited use of natural products in research, but where this happens we aim to ensur e that the investigation, collection and use of biological material for the purposes of research or manufacturing does not adversely affect biodiversity. Biodiversity is managed at site level because the issues and impacts are local. GSK sites are required to: identify and assess potential impacts of their activities on local habitats act to minimize any adverse effects of their activities on important habitats enhance biodiversity where that is feasible monitor their impacts to ensure action remains effective in protecting and enhancing local biodiversity Here are some examples: Nabha , India, has developed a biodiversity management plan to develop \"ecofor estry\" in 27 acres of land, using the water discharges from the site. Memphis , Tennessee, in the US has teamed up with the North American Butterfly Association (NABA) to impr ove the habitat and intr oduce species indigenous to the adjacent President's Island. Crawley , in the UK, has worked with specialist woodland contractors and the local Wildlife Trust to enhance an area 131GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7 both in the crop and on the field edges. Each farm has drawn up an envir onmental action plan. Measures include trimming hedges less frequently and only at certain times of the year. Hedgerows are the 'green veins' of the countryside providing food, shelter andbreeding sites for many native species. Less frequenttrimming, every 2-3 years, allows hedges to grow and produce fruit, providing food for birds, bats, small mammals and insects. Farmers also leave uncultivated margins around the fields, protecting hedges from spraying, adding bat and bir d boxes and planting new trees. Other joint projects with our growers include research with the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to increase the vitamin C content in Ribena. GSK has helped establish a blackcurrant gr owers gr oup that meets quarterly to share best practice, and the Blackcurrant Foundation, an organisation to promotethe health and envir onmental benefits of blackcurrants. Similar initiatives ar e underway with our gr owers in New Zealand, which supply blackcurrants for Ribenasold in Asia.Working with our Ribena suppliers to improve biodiversity GSK, and its heritage companies, have been making Ribena for 70 years. W e now buy 95% of the UK's blackcurrant crop, from 45 growers. Many of these farmers are family businesses that have been supplyingberries for Ribena for generations. It takes three years before a blackcurrant bush produces any fruit so it is a big investment. We buy directly fr om the gr ower and agr ee seven year contracts, helping them plan ahead. Blackcurrant farming is now mechanised with berries shaken from the bushes by harvesting machines, rather than picked by hand. This has enabled us to reduce thenumber of blackcurrant suppliers - and work mor e closely with a smaller group of growers. This close r elationship has led to farming and environmental improvements. One such initiative is a partnership with the W ildlife T rust to incr ease biodiversity. Helped by the W ildlife T rust, growers are introducing simple changes to improve the habitat for animals CASE STUDYof oak woodland on the site. They have created a pond, thinned the trees and installed 50 bird nesting boxes. Dartford , in the UK, supports a partnership which includes the UK's Environment Agency and is working to safeguard the historic Dartford Marshes - vital insafeguarding Dartford from flooding as well as supporting a host of rare and protected species, including the water vole. Rixensart and Wavre-Nord in Belgium are both close to woodland and have been working on improving biodiversity for several years. They have planted indigenous species of shrub, maximising the use offlowering plants that encourage bees and other insectsand established or chards with old varieties of apples, pears and plums. In 2005 Rixensart celebrated the fifth anniversary of a Natur e Path employees had created. SUPPLIERS Our supply chain is complex, which means that assuring the EHS performance of our suppliers is challenging. We currently provide oversight and audit of EHS issuescentrally for approximately 250 critical suppliers andcontract manufacturers of materials that are used exclusively by GSK. They are based primarily in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. When selecting, negotiating with and managing key suppliers of materials and products to our manufacturing supply chain, we take EHS and loss-prevention issues into account. This includes providing them with information onthe EHS risks associated with the GSK materials they ar e producing or handling. We carry out EHS audits before signing contracts with significant new key suppliers, and contracts containrequirements based on our Global EHS Standards. Subsequent EHS involvement is based on an assessment of EHS risks, focussing on: threats to continuity of supply hazards associated with manufacturing processes and materials environmental impacts regulatory r equir ements relevance to the supply of essential medicines The key suppliers that pr esent the gr eatest risk to GSK on these issues r eceive the greatest scrutiny. Sites are scored based on their performance against GSK's EHS Standards for key suppliers and against asupplementary, quantitative risk assessment scheme. Wemake recommendations following the audit and monitor progress, with a particular focus on poorly-performingsuppliers. Until they make significant improvements, we curtail or end procurement from sites that do not meet a minimal performance score against the EHS Standards, or that score an \"unacceptable\" rating on the quantitative risk assessment. For contract manufacturers, the minimum score was 30% until 2006, when we increased thisrequirement to 50%. (Supplier audits also cover basic questions on human rights. See human rights and suppliers) In 2004 we joined the USEPA Green Suppliers Network (GSN) [www .epa.gov/opptintr/p2home/gsn/pr ogram.htm]. The Green Suppliers Network is a programme to help small and medium-sized suppliers to reduce their environmental impact. GSK supports this programmethrough initiatives undertaken under an OperationalExcellence theme with specific suppliers. Supplier performance In 2005, we carried out 41 site-based EHS audits, approximately half of which were potentially newsuppliers. Of the 41 sites audited, 32 were producers ofingredients and raw materials for our manufacturingsupply chain. W e found a wide variation in performance, with scores ranging from 28% to 81%. Five supplierswere determined to be unacceptable against GSK's audit assessment standar ds so we decided not to pr oceed with these suppliers until significant improvements were made. The r emaining 9 audits wer e of sites supplying pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare products and materials to Resear ch & Development. Their performance against our EHS standards ranged from 40% to 95%. In general, suppliers based in North America and Eur ope performed well. But performance in Asia Pacific was variable, and in some cases ther e were significant gaps against our EHS standar ds. We found no apparent instances of non-compliance with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the core labour standards set out by the International Labour Orgainsation (ILO). 132GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued7Reporting EHS performance EHS information is collected where possible from selected suppliers. This data is not currently included in EHSperformance charts, contained in this report, and has notbeen subject to verification by ERM. In 2005 we requested information from 39 suppliers, 20 of which provided data. Some of these had not provided data in 2004 so we do not have comparative figures. These 20 suppliers produced a total of 83 m Kg of material, resulting in the following: energy use: 24m gigajoules water waste disposed: 5m RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Environment continued71 Introduction 2Access to medicine 3 Research 4Ethical conduct 5 Employment practices 6 Human rights7 Environment 8Community investment Page Value of community investment 134 Humanitarian relief 136Community partnerships 136Supporting education 138Employee involvement 138 9Data summary 8Community investment 134GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20058 GSK makes donations of money, medicines, time and equipment to support good causes. The strategy behind our community investment is improving health andeducation in under-served communities. We support public health initiatives and local community projects around the world and donate medicines to support disaster relief efforts and impoverished communities. Community investment Community investment is not linked to short-term business benefits and is not intended to create commercial markets for GSK. But it does support our r eputation by demonstrating our commitment to tackling healthcarechallenges. We believe that using some of our profits to benefit under-served communities is part of being aresponsible company. In 2005, our total community investment was valued at \u00a3380 million ($691million), equivalent to 5.6% of pr e-tax profits. Donations ar e made at gr oup level and by individual GSK sites to support local communities. Our objective is to ensure that projects are sustainable in the long-term and will continue once GSK funding comes to an end. Most of our community investment is madethrough non-profit organisations that are experts in thefield of healthcar e delivery and education. This helps ensure our giving is targeted at the communities that need it most. Information on our community investment pr ogrammes to incr ease healthcar e capacity in developing countries is included in the Access to Medicines section of this report. This covers our major public health initiatives tacklinglymphatic filariasis (LF), HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diarrhoea- related disease. This section pr ovides information on our other community investment programmes in 2005. It covers: A breakdown of our charitable donations in 2005. Donations of medicines for humanitarian relief including natural disasters. Community partnerships - local support provided at corporate level and by GSK sites. Our support for science education in the US and UK. Employee involvement in communities. VALUE OF COMMUNITY INVESTMENT GSK donations were valued at \u00a3380 million ($691 million) in 2005, compar ed with \u00a3328 million in 2004. This is equivalent to 5.6% of pre-tax profits. This figure includes medicines worth \u00a3255 million ($464 million) donated to low-income patients in the US through our Patient Assistance Pr ograms, \u00a327 million ($49 million) of humanitarian product donations for under-served communities around the world and \u00a314 million ($26million) in albendazole tablets for the lymphatic filariasis elimination programme. Our total community investment also includes \u00a361 million ($111 million) in cash grants and almost \u00a321 million ($38 million) in management costs. GSK is a member of the UK's Percent Club for companies which donate at least 1% of their pr e-tax pr ofits to charitable causes. GSK is regularly one of the top companies in the UK's Guardian Giving List which lists FTSE 100 companies by the per centage of pr e-tax profitsDuring 2005, we received the first Annual Scrip Award for Corporate Social Responsibility for GSK's role in the Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) elimination programme. Wealso received a Business in the Community 'Big Tick' for our UK Science Education Programme and our supportfor Barretstown. We were a finalist in a number ofother awar ds including: The Business in the Community Inter national awar d for the LF Elimination Programme The African Investor A ward 2005 for GSK' s support of the Integrated Management of ChildhoodIllnesses (IMCI) initiative in Africa The US Chamber of Commerce Center for Corporate Citizenship award for our US education programme.Awards in 2005contributed to charitable causes. In 2005, we were listed 10th, based on the percentage of our pre-tax profits donated in 2004, but for the fourth year in a row we were the biggest overall giver in the value of our donations. We are members of the UK's London Benchmarking Group (LBG) and the Committee to Encourage CorporatePhilanthropy (CECP) in the US. We report our donations inline with the guidelines set by the CECP , which values our medicines at wholesale acquisition cost, in line with otherpharmaceutical companies. Wholesale acquisition cost is the wholesale list price, not including discounts. 135GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Community investment continued8 Method o f giving - total \u00a3380m Method of Giving \u00a3million Cash 61 Product 296 In-kind 2 Mangement co sts 211% 16% 77%6%Cash Product In-kind Management costs 1%% Breakdown of cash giving - total \u00a361m 40% 35%21%Health Education Arts and Cul ture Environment Breakdown of cash giving % Health 40 Education 35 Arts and C ulture 3 Environment 1 Other 21Other3%HUMANITARIAN RELIEF GSK donates essential products such as antibiotics to help relief efforts in disaster areas and support basic healthcareprovision in impoverished communities. Donations are made at the request of governments and major charitable organisations and may be manufactured specifically for these partners. This enables charities to hold a range of medicines in stock so they can respondpromptly in an emergency. We work in partnership withseveral relief charities including AmeriCares, Direct Relief, InterChurch Medical Assistance, MAP International and Project HOPE. There is a limit to the amount of products we can give away, so donations must be carefully managed. We relyon the expertise of our partners to ensure that available medicines are targeted at the communities that need them most. GSK general managers must appr ove donations destined for their country to avoid any conflict with our commercial business. Our charity partners are required to track donations to make sure they reach their intended destination and ar e dispensed appr opriately . We do not donate medicines for diseases which require a continuous, assured supply. GSK follows the W orld Health Organization Interagency Guidelines for Drug Donations. These state that donations should be made in r esponse to an expressed need, sent with prior consent and must be labelled correctly and havea minimum one year shelf life. We are also a member ofthe Partnership for Quality Medical Donations (PQMD), an alliance of pharmaceutical companies and charities that encourages best practice in the donation and delivery of medicines. Activity During 2005 During 2005 we donated life-saving medicines worth \u00a327 million ($49 million), to support relief efforts in almost 100countries. Supplies of antibiotics and basic medicines were sent in r esponse to the South East Asian tsunami, hurricanes in the US and the Caribbean and the earthquake in Pakistan. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami we donated more than 3.6 million doses of antibiotics to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in affected countries. We have also committed \u00a32 million ($3.8 million) to supportorganisations working on r elief and r econstruction operations in the disaster area. Following hurricane Katrina we donated medicines valued at $10 million to relief facilities in ten US states. Thisincluded antibiotics, vaccines and consumer healthcareproducts such as toothpaste, antacids and pain relievers. GSK also supplied interim shipments of medicines fordiabetes, heart disease, and asthma for patients who had lost their supplies in the disaster. Some of the medicines were distributed to hospitals and shelters by our partner organisations such as Project HOPE and AmeriCares. GSK is the largest pharmaceutical company in Pakistan and we were able to deliver urgent supplies of freemedicines within 48 hours of the earthquake via our localbusiness there. Our product donations, including hepatitis- A vaccines r equested by the Ministry of Health, were valued at $6.5 million and we also gave a cash donation of $1 million to the South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund. COMMUNITY P ARTNERSHIPS We support a wide range of health and education initiatives in the communities wher e we operate. Donations are made centrally and by GSK sites to support local charities and good causes. Below are just a few examples of the many community partnerships we supported in 2005: Europe Barretstown in Ir eland and L 'Envol in France ar e residential camps wher e seriously ill children can have fun and develop their self confidence. GSK gave \u00a3250,000 ($455,000) and \u00a3100,000 ($182,000) respectively tosupport the camps in 2005. Employees also give their timeto Barretstown and L'Envol, with over 40 GSK employeesparticipating in 2005. GSK is also funding five Eur opean pr ogrammes, each with a grant of \u00a3300,000 over three years. These are: Change in Advance, a disease pr evention pr ogramme that promotes healthy eating and exercise, aimed at Slovakian children living on urban housing estates; Childrens' Shelters, a programme in Spain that provides healthcar e for homeless and abandoned childr en; Beacon of Hope, a palliative care programme for childr en in Romania; Reading for Growing, a programme in Italy which, through r eading aloud, helps childr en with neur o- functional disabilities and those who have endured long hospitalisation; 136GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Community investment continued8Multi Coloured Lives, an interactive education programme to help children with disabilities integrateinto Russian society. International GSK's PHASE (Personal Hygiene and Sanitation Education) initiative is providing education to over 270,000 school children in Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Nicaragua and Peru to improve their health and hygiene to fight infectious diseases. In 2005, we committed three-year funding of \u00a3300,000 to extend the programme to Bangladesh inpartnership with Save the Children USA, see Major publichealth initiatives above. GSK is funding a number of country programmes, each with a grant of \u00a3200,000 over three years: Pinoy Health Pass, Family Health and Well Being provides health education for families on low incomes in the Philippines Attituda Positiva, uses drama in schools to increase awareness and education on HIV and reproductivehealth for teenagers in Brazil '500 Midwives' helps impr ove mother and child health in rural areas of Vietnam by bringing birth attendants from ethnic minority groups for training in the capital'smajor hospital. UK In 2005 GSK supported over 80 charitable organisations in the UK. This included over \u00a3470,000 ($855,000) tosupport medical research undertaken by the charities Meningitis UK, The British Liver Trust, Alzheimer's Research Trust and The Samantha Dickson Research Trust. We extended our partnership with the British Red Cross, giving \u00a3350,000 over thr ee years to their Gateway pr oject in Scotland. Gateway helps young people with disabilities to gain the skills and self-confidence they need to liveindependently. Since 2001, Gateway has worked with asmall group of young disabled people helping them set personal goals and receive individually tailored trainingand support. More than 150 people with disabilities also visit the centre each year to take part in workshops and use its facilities. The new funding will enable Gateway to extend their service across Scotland and share their experiences with health and social care providers throughout the UK. GSK is giving \u00a3386,000 ($703,000) over two years to support the British Lung Foundation's Baby Breathe Easy programme. This is funding a pilot scheme in nine regionsacross the UK supporting parents and carers of young babies and children under five in dealing with diagnosedand undiagnosed recurring chest problems. US GSK is donating $350,000 (\u00a3192,000) over three years to the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health. The Black Pearls programme provides health education for low- income neighbourhoods by reaching into non-traditional venues, including African American and Afro-Caribbean churches, barber shops, beauty salons, laundromats and tattoo parlours. It provides culturally appropriate information to help promote early disease detection andencourage people in multi-ethnic communities to adopthealthier lifestyles. We continue to support the Children's Health Fund's Referral Management Initiative (RMI). A new , three-year grant of $2.6 million (\u00a31.4 million) will help RMI continue and extend its services into Philadelphia, helping high-riskand homeless children receive the specialist medical care they need. Foundations GSK does not operate a single charitable foundation for its community investment programmes but has several country-based foundations in Canada, Czech Republic,France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and North Carolina in the US. Our local foundations support a wide range ofcharities and healthcare initiatives. Since 1998 the GSK France Foundation has supported 68 programmes in 13 countries. These focus on people living with HIV/AIDS in developing countries, particularly in Africa, and aim to improve healthcare through prevention, education and training. During 2005, 13 new pr ogrammes wer e implemented in 5 countries with grants of 700 000 euros (\u00a3480,000). The GSK Foundation in Canada focuses much of its support on hospice care helping terminally ill patients and their families. The Foundation is also supporting community pr ogrammes in Africa, including AIDS Orphan Uganda, a three-year programme building communitysupport for vulnerable childr en in the Luweero District. The North Carolina GSK Foundation in the USA is an endowed, self-funding organisation. It supports initiatives in the areas of mathematics, science and health educationin North Carolina. In 2005, this Foundation awarded grants totalling $2.7 million (\u00a31.49 million). 137GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Community investment continued8SUPPORTING EDUCATION GSK supports education in the UK and US and has a particular emphasis on developing scientific literacy andencouraging the next generation of scientists. Science Education in the UK GSK is supporting the INSPIRE (Innovative Scheme for Post-doctoral researchers In Research and Education) scheme, developed in partnership with Imperial CollegeLondon and the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust,with a \u00a31 million ($1.8 million) donation over four years.INSPIRE aims to raise achievement by placing post-doctoral researchers in specialist science schools to train as teachers and support science teaching. In the fifth year of GSK sponsorship, a grant of \u00a3110,000 ($200,000) to the Association for Science Educationsupported Science Across the World, an international education programme that enables school children in more than 115 countries to discuss science issues over the internet. With a \u00a350,000 grant fr om GSK, 2,600 UK science teachers wer e able to participate in 'Active Assessment' training in 2005. This helps teachers improve their pupils' 'thinking skills' and empowers them to take moreresponsibility for their own lear ning. GSK has also committed \u00a31 million ($1.8 million) over four years to help build the new Darwin Centr e at the Natural History Museum in London, to enable better display of the museum's important collection. Education in the US During 2005, we increased our support for initiatives to improve overall education standards in the US. GSK is a founding partner of the US Chamber of Commerce's Business Education Network. The network will develop partnerships between the business community and education pr oviders to improve educational standards and bridge skills gaps. We also continued to support a range of science education initiatives: Science in the Summer is a free, library-based education programme in Philadelphia, giving childr en the chance to participate in hands-on experiments and science based courses. In 2005 GSK donated $300,000 to Science in the Summer, which enabled almost 6000 children to participate. Almost 75,000 children haveparticipated in the programme since it was launched nearly 20 years ago. We support Sally Ride Science Festivals which aim to increase girls' interest in science, maths and technology.The festivals feature workshops led by localveterinarians, astronomers, microbiologists and engineers. Workshops are also run for parents andteachers on how they can support girls' interests in science and technology careers. A three-year grant of $300,000 (\u00a3165,000) ) from GSK is helping the National Board for Professional TeachingStandards to increase the number of science teachers inthe North Carolina and Philadelphia areas EMPLOYEE INVOL VEMENT GSK employees are encouraged to contribute to their local communities as volunteers. Hundreds of employees give their time to good causes through our Days of Caring in the US, and to supportschool science education through our UK Science andEngineering Ambassador Scheme and US Partnership for Educational Discovery. In the UK and US we also make cash donations to charities wher e employees have done voluntary work. During 2005, our GSK Investment in Volunteer Excellence (GIVE) pr ogramme gave $300,000 (\u00a3165,000) to over 350 charitable organisations in the US wher e employees or their partners volunteered at least 50 hours during theyear. In the UK, our Making a Dif ference programme provided grants of almost \u00a3300,000 ($546,000) to over 440 charities where our employees had volunteered. In many countries we also encourage employees to donate money to charity by matching the money they give or by providing tax-efficient ways for them to make a donation, in accordance with local taxation guidelines. In 2005 in the USA, GSK matched donations by employees and retirees at a value of over $5 million (\u00a32.7 million). In addition, GSK gave $1.35 million(\u00a3742,000) to match donations by GSK employees through the annual GSK and United W ay campaign. 138GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2005 Community investment continued8139GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20058 Community investment continued The gift of life - GSK product donations GSK antibiotics fight both common and life-threatening infections. In 2005 we donated antibiotics and other medicines worth \u00a327 million in response to disasterrelief efforts, as travel packs for medics onhumanitarian missions and to support healthcare provision in impoverished communities. Three-year old Rosa Angelica Pravia is just one of the thousands of people to have benefited. She was admitted to a hospital in a remote part of South America where the doctor feared her infection couldresult in meningitis. Her father earns just $2 a day cleaning pineapples and there are 10 children in the family, so they could not afford medicine to treat her. Fortunately the hospital had just r eceived a donation of medicines from MAP International, including GSK's antibiotic Ceftin . Within three days Rosa was out of danger. Her doctor said the Ceftin had saved her life. Many of these products are donated in response to specific requests from relief charities such as AmeriCar es, Dir ect Relief, InterChur ch Medical Assistance, MAP Inter national and Pr oject HOPE. MAP Inter national uses donations of GSK antibiotics such as Augmentin and Amoxil in travel packs for its medical missions. The packs ar e compact, fully stocked, portable pharmacies that enable the teams to treat awide range of illnesses in developing countries. \"Theantibiotics treated many infections, some of which were life threatening,\" a MAP team reported recentlyafter a mission to Zambia. \"The local doctors told us that they can go to remote villages to see patients whodo not have the r esources to fill prescriptions. Without GSK's help we would not have been able to see so many patients and help them with medication.\" CASE STUDY1Introduction 2Access to summary 140 9Data summary 140GSK CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20059 Data summary Access to medicines 2002 2003 2004 2005 Number of countries supplied with preferentially priced ARVs1 50 56 57 56 Number of preferentially priced Combivir tablets shipped (millions)1 6.2 45 ($ per day)2 1.7 0.65 0.65 Voluntary licences granted to generic manufacturers for GSK ARVs 6 7 Number of albendazole tablets donated for prevention of Lymphatic Filariasis (millions) 66 94 67 136 Number of countries supplied with albendazole 31 34 34 36 Research and development GSK animal research facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and 7 7 10 10 Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care3 Number of trials published on the GSK Clinical Trial Register (cumulative total)4 - - 143 2,125 Ethical conduct Number of employees completing certification to the GSK Code of Conduct 700 9,000 9,600 >12,000 Number of contacts through our ethics compliance channels5 2,580 3,644 Employment Women in management grades (%) 32 34 35 35 Ethnic diversity - people of colour (US, %) 19 19.5 19.5 19.6Ethnic diversity - ethnic minorities (UK, %) - - 14.8 14.9 Lost time injury and illness rate (cases per 100,000 hours worked) 0.34 0.30 0.30 0.30Lost time injury and illness rate for contractors working on site (cases per 0.50 0.33 0.40 0.44 100,000 hours worked) Environment Number of contract manufacturers audited 16 28 35 41 Energy consumption (million gigajoules) 20 20 19 19 Water consumption (million cubic metr es) 24 23 21 22 Ozone depletion potential fr om meter ed dose inhalers (tonnes CFC-11 equivalent) 1,500 782 464 198 Ozone depletion potential from production (tonnes CFC-11 equivalent) 121 72 59 51 Ozone depletion potential fr om refrigeration and other ancillary uses 7 3 3 3 (tonnes CFC-11 equivalent) Volatile organic compound emissions (thousand tonnes) 7 7 5 5Global warming potential from energy sources (thousand tonnes CO2 equivalent) 1,844 1,833 1,747 1,759 Hazar dous waste disposed (thousand tonnes) 62 61 74 68 Community investment Total community investment expenditure (\u00a3 millions) 239 338 328 380 Value of humanitarian product donations, including albendazole (\u00a3 millions) 24 116 57 41Value of products donated through GSK Patient Assistance Program in the US (\u00a3 millions) 112 125 203 255 1Includes ARVs sold at not-for-profit and discounted prices.
