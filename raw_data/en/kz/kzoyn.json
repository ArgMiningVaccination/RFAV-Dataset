This theory asserts that within this system are larger energy centers where a higher concentration of arteries, veins, and nerves exist. These locations are called [chakras](https://consciousitems.com/blogs/practice/chakra-symbols?_pos=4&_sid=f4e7383c4&_ss=r). Chakras, meaning \"wheels\" in Sanskrit, are pools of energy with specific vibrations and colors that influence not only different physical regions of the body, but also emotional and spiritual well-being. Even though it's said we have 114 of these centers spread throughout our body, in the chakra system there are seven major areas: - Root chakra: located at the base of the spine - Sacral chakra: found in the navel region - Solar plexus chakra: situated in the belly button area - Heart chakra: located at the center of the chest - Throat chakra: comprises the shoulder and neck areas - Third eye chakra: found between the eyebrows - Crown chakra: resides at the top of the head In this guide, you'll learn about what might block these energy centers, the importance of chakra cleansing, and what you can do to keep them open and balanced. At the very end, you'll find a simple but powerful chakra cleansing meditation that can relieve stress, help you feel grounded, and align your energy. What Blocks Chakras? Many factors contribute to a blocked chakra, and you might be surprised to learn that they are quite similar to those linked to physical disease. For example, eating processed foods and not exercising may compromise the proper functioning of your energetic system. Likewise, holding on to painful emotions and old beliefs that keep you feeling stuck and unable to move forward can block your chakras and create stagnant energy. Here are some examples of energy-dense emotions and their corresponding chakras: - Root chakra: Fear, trauma, eating disorders - Sacral chakra: Emotional instability, addiction behaviors, fear of change - Solar plexus chakra: Bullying, lack of self-worth, mental, emotional, sexual, or physical abuse - Heart chakra: Stress, emotional pain, grief, unhealed emotional wounds, overthinking - Throat chakra: Low self-esteem, self-expression issues, fear of speaking your truth - Third eye chakra: A closed mind, blind obedience, not questioning your reality - Crown chakra: Overactive ego, deeply rooted negative beliefs, lack of meaningful relationships It's critical to identify and recognize these behaviors and patterns. When you do, you can focus on which energy centers you need to cleanse and begin to make positive changes. The Importance of Chakra Cleansing Closed or unaligned chakras can wreak havoc on you emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Keeping your energy flowing through clear and unobstructed paths is crucial to experience vitality, high energy levels, and a healthy appetite for life. It's believed that a blocked chakra stops the flow of energy, affecting you both psychologically and emotionally. If left unattended or unresolved, these issues could develop into physical symptoms that might lead to more significant health issues. You can unblock and balance your energy centers using various chakra healing techniques. Meditation, yoga poses (also known as asanas), reiki, mindfulness, healthy eating, and healing [chakra stones](https://consciousitems.com/blogs/lifestyle/chakra-stones?_pos=2&_sid=f4e7383c4&_ss=r) are all powerful ways to get stagnant energy flowing.

Using [essential oils](https://consciousitems.com/products/crystal-energies?_pos=1&_sid=71735620b&_ss=r), smudging herbs, or burning incense may be a great way to keep the crown chakra activated and balanced. - Crown chakra herbs and spices: Sage, frankincense, lavender, and juniper - Crown chakra healing crystals: [Clear quartz](https://consciousitems.com/products/intention-stone?variant=20454445023294), [moonstone](https://consciousitems.com/products/cure-bracelet), selenite, and Herkimer diamond Chakra Cleansing Meditation Chakra meditation is one of the most powerful ways to cleanse and balance chakras. This practice is not only a trusted technique to unblock your energy centers, but it can also help you manage stress and anxiety. Chakra cleansing meditation can be done once a week. Use it to restore energetic balance, or as part of deeper crystal healing therapy to treat more significant blockages and unaligned chakras. Before you start, choose a quiet and comfortable place and read through the meditation guidelines: - If you have your chakra healing stones, lie down and position each crystal close to its respective chakra. If you don't have any crystals, choose a position in which you're most comfortable, either sitting or lying down. - Close your eyes and take a deep breath. With each exhale, feel your body relaxing and becoming heavier. Feel the stress leaving every part of your body. Continue taking deep breaths until you're in a complete state of relaxation. - Picture a beautiful and warm red light forming at the base of your spine, in the center of your root chakra. If you feel like it, take a deep breath and chant the \"lam\" mantra. If you have your root chakra crystal close, feel how its energy interacts with your base chakra. Let the vibrations of this red light, the mantra, and your healing stone unblock and clear any stagnant energy, unresolved emotions, and things that do not serve you anymore. Take all the time you need in this area. When you feel you've finished, move to the next chakra. - Do this meditation for all seven chakras. Picture the light changing color as it moves from each chakra to the next. Stop at each one of them and take the time to tune in with your crystal (if that's the case). Feel the vibration of every energy center. Chant the appropriate mantra for each chakra. If you don't feel up for it, don't force yourself. This is your meditation practice, so do whatever feels comfortable. - Once you have reached the crown chakra, say a little gratitude prayer, take a deep breath, and slowly start to regain awareness of your body, starting with your feet, and moving upwards until you've reached the top of your head. - Slowly open your eyes. Once you're ready, remove your gemstones and sit up. Make sure you [cleanse your crystals](https://consciousitems.com/blogs/lifestyle/how-to-cleanse-chakra-stones)after you complete your chakra cleansing meditation. Unblock Your Chakras and Feel the Energy Flow Chakra cleansing is as vital to your overall well-being as taking care of your physical body. Your energy system is an integral part of your multidimensional existence that needs to be nourished and nurtured. The more you tune in to it, the more sensitive you'll become to its needs and vibration. Keep in mind that to keep a healthy chakra system, it takes more than just meditating or carrying your crystals with you. Eating nutrient-rich foods, getting good-quality sleep, and giving your body some daily movement is certainly a crucial part of keeping your body, mind, and spirit living well and thriving.
