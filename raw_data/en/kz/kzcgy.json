Through your generous support, CARE has made significant headway in increasing research, education, and community- building in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) health, as well as in educating patients, providers, and the community on health disparities within the AANHPI community. Thanks to your support, CARE has quickly established itself as a premier leader in Asian health research on a global scale. Our world-class faculty has conducted critical research focused on addressing the specific challenges in medicine and health care for AANHPI populations through the CARE Seed Grants program. This program provides important early-stage funding for Stanford investigators to pursue research dedicated to improving AANHPI health. We are excited to share that since its inception, 19 seed grants have been awarded to our pioneering researchers and scientists across multiple disciplines, leading to $10 million in follow-on research funding, 65 research articles published by CARE faculty, and the relaunch of the Journal of Asian Health . In 2020, CARE held its first-ever multidisciplinary Gastric Cancer Summit. This summit brought together 100 constituents from around the world to spark an international dialogue and create a roadmap to counter the disproportionate health care burden that falls upon AANHPI patients with gastric cancer. The period 2020-2021 was dominated by the pandemic, yet CARE responded to the unprecedented challenge by convening a group of leading experts in an International COVID-19 Conference to address urgent public health needs, share data and research, and provide critical medical care. Over 2,100 attendees from over 35 countries attended this event, which was followed up one year later by a second International COVID-19 Conference focused on \"lessons learned\". Within the education space, CARE offered a popular series of AANHPI health-related courses at the Stanford School of Medicine, one of which was titled \"Asian American Culture and Medicine\". Classes like this highlight how the psychology of Asian culture influences the professional and personal experiences of Asian health care providers and their patients. Through our flagship Stanford CARE Scholars program, we have also mentored over 40 future leaders in AANHPI health along with producing over 20 presentations, abstracts, and papers on AANHPI health disparities in the last two years.3Finally, we are pleased to share our successes in community outreach. CARE provided critical support to enable the signing of AB 789 into law for hepatitis B and hepatitis C screening coverage in California, a great success in closing the health disparity for underserved minority groups. In 2020, we launched a monthly Community Health Talk series featuring our own Stanford faculty to educate over 10,000 community members on pertinent issues and findings in the field of AANHPI health. In addition, CARE was covered in over 10 national news media outlets and our social media channels have reached 309,000 impressions globally. Yet, there remains much work to be done to ensure the highest level of culturally tailored, quality precision health care for AANHPI patients around the world. What lies ahead includes Project DAsH: Data on Asian Health, which aims to compile diverse datasets to understand complex health issues and find solutions using precision health for Asians, and Project COAVE: COVID Asian Vaccine Efficacy, which will study the effectiveness of COVID vaccines in Asian Americans. By increasing knowledge, empowering education, and positively impacting clinical care, we aim to improve the health of AANHPI patients everywhere and become the premier global leader in AANHPI health. It has been an incredibly busy and fulfilling inaugural chapter for CARE. Each and every one of us at CARE is grateful and appreciative of your time, effort, support, and counsel on CARE's journey to equitable health care for the AANHPI community. Thank you, generous donors, volunteers, and partners around the world\u2014the past three years would not have been possible without you. As CARE scales to the next chapter of growth, your pivotal support is defining new possibilities in our shared mission. Together, we look forward to ending Asian health disparities and transforming the health of AANHPI communities everywhere.

OUR GOALS ARE TO: Increase research and knowledge in Asian health Improve the delivery of health care for Asians Educate patients, providers, and the community about the health needs of Asians Asians are one of the most rapidly growing populations in the United States. According to U.S. Census data, between 2000 and 2019 the Asian population has nearly doubled. Although Asians currently represent only 6 percent of the total U.S. population, they are the nation's fastest-growing racial/ethnic group and encompass 25 percent of all foreign-born people in the country. By 2050, it is projected that the Asian population will reach nearly 34 million in the United States. Despite this exponential increase in the Asian American population, only 0.17 percent of all National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants awarded are dedicated to Asian health research. Similar to other communities of color, tremendous disparities exist in health outcomes and indicators among the Asian American community. Conditions that disproportionately affect Asian Americans include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis B, osteoporosis, and cancers such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer. The Stanford Center for Asian Health Research and Education (CARE) aims to end Asian health disparities and transform the health of the Asian community through increasing knowledge, empowering education, and positively impacting clinical care. CARE was founded in October 2018 to provide a common place for research, education, and clinical care support allowing disparate faculty, staff, community members, and trainees to share ideas, common resources, and implementation capabilities for Asian health. At Stanford, no other centers are significantly investigating and developing educational/clinical care for Asians. Thus, CARE fills the gap to uniquely focus on Asian health, leveraging Stanford's advantages over other universities in this area of health research, education, and care due to unique patient, faculty/ staff, and student demographics in addition to the disease, epidemiologic, health economics, and humanities expertise of the institution.Strategy and OperationsStrategy and Operations9To support CARE's vision to become the premier academic leader in Precision Asian Health, CARE's leadership team has developed a 10-year, long-range plan through a highly disciplined strategic planning process. Using a phased approach to support the long- range plan, each year CARE develops an impact- driven yearly plan and drives for executional focus. To facilitate implementational excellence, CARE has developed a comprehensive Precision Health Platform to deliver productivity and scale growth. The CARE Platform comes with a strong foundational base with integrated infrastructure capabilities and robust executional capabilities. It provides sustainable, predictable funding and financial services to enable infrastructural operations, provides a base layer of communication/digital marketing/web capabilities, and offers foundational operational support. It offers a single point of support for efficiency and productivities to empower the three strategic pillars of Research, Education, and Community. The CARE Precision Health Platform is serving as a cohesive vehicle to drive CARE's vision forward.CARE Precision Health Platform and Three Strategic Pillars Research Community Education Stanford CARE Precision Health PlatformPremier Academic Leader in Precision Asian Health Research Grant Support Operational Research Support Conference Management Impact Tracking and Optimization Administration/Business/Finance Program Management MarCom/Media/Web/Event Marketing Sustained and Predicted FundingMost studies group Asians together, obscuring important differences in health risks and outcomes. Strategy and Operations 10Strategy and Operations11Timeline CARE Founded 2019 CARE Scholars Program (Formerly CARE-SRI) Our inaugural CARE Summer Research Intensive Program (CARE-SRI) began with six students from a diverse array of places convening to study pressing issues in Asian health. Since then, we have expanded our program about three-fold, with 23 students across multiple time zones. 2019 Seed Grant Awardees CARE awarded six seed grants to Dr. Alan Louie, Dr. Benjamin Lindquist, Dr. Robert Huang, Dr. Kuldev Singh, Dr. Bertha Chen, and Dr. Ngan Huang. Their areas of research ranged from optic nerve damage to acculturative family distance and mental health. Asian Health Courses Through the courageous efforts of our CARE faculty\u2014including Dr. Latha Palaniappan, Dr. Bryant Lin, Dr. Malathi Srinivasan, and Dr. Alan Louie\u2014we established several undergraduate and medical school courses on the topics of \"Surveying Asian Health Issues,\" \"Tackling Cross-Cultural Boundaries in Asian Health,\" \"How to Change the World (for the Better),\" and \"Asian Culture and Medicine.\" Gastric Cancer Summit This multidisciplinary summit brought together over 30 global physicians, researchers, policy makers, patients, and advocacy groups to share experiences and discoveries in gastric cancer research, with the goal of creating a roadmap to address health care disparities in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and in the United States, it disproportionately falls upon ethnic minorities and immigrant communities\u2014particularly Asians. There exists no coherent national strategy for the early detection or risk attenuation of gastric cancer, even among identified high-risk groups. The under-recognition of gastric cancer risk among minority communities may be one of the most significant unaddressed health care disparities in the United States. OCTOBER 2018 WINTER 2019 WINTER 2019 FALL 2019 - SPRING 2020 MARCH 2020Strategy and Operations12International COVID-19 Conference In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading experts have come together across disciplinary and national borders to address urgent public health needs, share vital data and research, and provide critical medical care. At the International COVID-19 Conference, over 30 global speakers from across 14 time zones shared COVID research, discoveries, and stories. Garnering an audience of over 2,000 international attendees, this conference was the first of its kind to bring together policy makers, providers, patients, and advocates to look beyond America's borders to inform our domestic response to COVID-19. COVID-19 Discrimination Study Racialized language around COVID-19 has unjustly villainized East Asians everywhere, resulting in a public health crisis that has turned a racial identity into a basis for discriminatory behavior. Thousands of instances of violence or emotional abuse have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. In response, researchers at CARE, Stanford College, and the Stanford University School of Medicine have banded together to assess the mental health effects of COVID-related anti-Asian discrimination. By raising awareness of racial injustice as a public health crisis, we hope to combat this discrimination both in our communities and beyond. 2020 CARE Scholars Program This multidisciplinary summer research immersion program brought together 19 passionate students from across the world to tackle prevalent issues in the scope of Asian health. Students worked on two research projects\u2014a large database project focused on precision medicine and a specific mentored research project with faculty\u2014with the end goal of publishing their findings in academic journals over the next several months. Aside from the research aspect, the program placed much emphasis on career development and general professional guidance.2020 Seed Grant Program CARE awarded seed grants to five outstanding researchers in the field of Asian health and disease disparities. Our awardees\u2014Dr. Ying Lu, Dr. Ranak Trivedi, Dr. Freeborn Rwere, Dr. Uchechukwu Megwalu, and Dr. Karen Eggleston\u2014 investigated topics ranging from thyroid cancer in Filipinos to social support networks among Indian women with breast cancer. SUMMER 2020 SUMMER 2020MAY 2020APRIL 2020Strategy and Operations13Mental Health 101: When Should Parents Worry? Dr. Shashank Joshi presented on how parents and schools can promote youth mental wellness. This presentation in collaboration with the Parent Education Series informed parents on how to identify and support students impacted by mental health concerns, along with how to recognize the signs of suicidality. Garment Worker Health During COVID-19 This webinar, \"The Garment Sector Unraveling in Bangladesh: Rethinking the Health, Safety, and Livelihoods of Workers During a Global Pandemic,\" was a rare opportunity to bring together scholars in the social sciences, public policy, and health care to explore the role that workers' physical and mental health play in shaping our attitudes toward labor rights and how COVID-19 has provided us with an opportunity to rethink our approach. This webinar was a joint collaboration among the Subir and Malini Chowdhury Center for Bangladesh Studies at UC Berkeley, the UC Berkeley Institute for South Asia Studies, and the Stanford Center for South Asia. The COVID Vaccine\u2014 Perspectives & Expectations Dr. Aruna Subramanian shared her knowledge and groundbreaking research through a webinar on the COVID vaccine. Dr. Subramanian set the perspective on the critical role of vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic in this collaborative event with India Community Center (ICC)\u2014 Crack the Wellness Code.FEBRUARY 2021 First Community Health Talk CARE has launched a monthly series of Community Health Talks by our very own Stanford CARE faculty. Community Health Talks provide an exciting opportunity for the Asian community and the general public to learn about important Asian health issues, disease risks, and the latest research outcomes in Asian population health. Our inaugural Community Health Talk features Dr. Fumiaki Ikeno presenting a talk titled \"Japan's Innovations for an Aging Society\" that discussed how Japanese society has been innovating new ways to solve the unmet needs of its rapidly aging population. DECEMBER 2020 DECEMBER 2020NOVEMBER 2020Strategy and Operations14Heart Disease in Asians On February 23, Dr. Kiranbir Josan presented for our Community Health Talk series on how South Asians have a higher risk of heart and vascular disease compared to other ethnic groups. 2021 Seed Grant Recipients Announced CARE awarded seed grants to eight outstanding researchers in the field of Asian health and disease disparities. Our awardees\u2014Dr. Suzan Carmichael, Dr. Linda Geng, Dr. Matthew Wheeler, Dr. Richard Zare, Dr. Malathi Srinivasan, Dr. Stephen Rogalla, Dr. Randall Stafford, and Dr. Joshua Spin\u2014 investigated topics ranging from traditional Chinese medicine strategies for sleep problems to maternal health among Asian and Pacific Islander women. Evidence-Based Traditional Asian Medicine Conference (ETAM) Does acupuncture really work or is the placebo effect in play? Can certain Asian herbs or diets treat cardiac disease or treat depression? What do we mean by Traditional Chinese Medicine or Ayurveda, and can we integrate these healing practices into Western medicine to ensure the most effective care? This three-day virtual conference, hosted by the Center for Asian Health Research and Education at the Stanford University School of Medicine, investigated these questions and more. The conference investigated nutrition for preventing and controlling chronic diseases, pain management, and mental health. It addressed key questions in ETAM, fostered dialogue and learning, and identified areas of further research and development. Role of Data in Diversity: Genetics and Real World Data In collaboration with the Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCT) Center of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical Center, Dr. Palaniappan presented in a seminar that focuses on practical approaches and shared experiences for improving diversity in clinical trials. FEBRUARY 2021 FEBRUARY 2021 MARCH 2021 MARCH 2021 Strategy and Operations15Alcohol-Induced Facial Flushing and Health Implications Dr. Che-Hong Chen and Dr. Eric Gross presented on facial flushing and increased heart rate after alcohol consumption that frequently occur in Asian individuals for our April Community Health Talk. Dr. Chen and Dr. Gross covered the genetic cause of this phenomenon along with the related health issues. 2021 International COVID-19 Conference One year after our 2020 COVID-19 Conference, we asked experts to tell us: What lessons have we learned from COVID-19? This multidisciplinary conference brought together public health officials, researchers, and physicians to share lessons learned from COVID-19. Together we endeavored to increase knowledge, empower education, and positively impact our response to this pandemic. In funding innovative research, educating promising scholars, and providing community outreach, we sought to improve health care both locally and globally. We collaborated with the Center for Innovation in Global Health (CIGH) and the Center for Population Health Sciences (CPHS) to organize this event. How Do Your Genes Affect Your Medication Response? Dr. Latha Palaniappan shared her expertise on pharmacogenomics with us for our May Community Health Talk. Dr. Palaniappan discussed how precision health and individualized drug therapy can help prevent harmful drug reactions by pre-identifying at-risk patients through their genetic profiles. The Increased Risk of Gastric Cancer in Asians For our March Community Health Talk, Dr. Joo Ha Hwang delved into how gastric cancer disproportionately burdens ethnic minorities and immigrant communities in the United States, especially Asian populations. Along with describing gastric cancer and its risk factors, Dr. Hwang highlighted the need to address gastric cancer disparities on the national level. MARCH 2021 APRIL 2021 MAY 2021 MAY 2021 Strategy and Operations16Introduction to Ayurveda: \"The Science of Life\" For our June Community Health Talk, Dr. Neeta Gautam presented a webinar focusing on the ancient healing system of Ayurveda. This talk highlighted key aspects of Ayurveda such as the five elements and three doshas. Journal of Asian Health CARE relaunched the Journal of Asian Health to offer an academic home for Asian health research. As an international, peer-reviewed, open-access journal, the Journal of Asian Health has succeeded in obtaining support from leading researchers and physicians in the field, including Dr. Gloria Wu, Dr. Paul J. Wang, and Dr. JoAnn E. Manson. In June 2021, the first issue of the Journal was successfully published through Stanford University. 2021 CARE Scholars Program This year we accepted 23 scholars from 174+ applicants for our CARE Scholars Program. Throughout the summer, scholars participated with Stanford faculty and visiting faculty in ongoing seminars around Asian health, medical technology, AI, vulnerable populations, global health, and more.Celebrating Asian Grandmothers Concert In another senseless act of anti-Asian violence, a white man in San Francisco attacked Xiao Zhen Xie, a 75-year-old Asian grandmother. Ms. Xiao donated almost $1 million to charities combating hate against Asian Americans. We celebrated the power and grace of Asian grandmothers like Ms. Xiao with videos and performances from grandmothers and their children. The performances were followed by a discussion panel on experiences of generations of Asian American women. MAY 2021 JUNE 2021 JULY 2021 SUMMER 2021One in three South Asians will die of heart disease before the age of 65. One in four East Asians will die of cancer. Strategy and Operations 17Impact ReportImpact Report19Since 2018, CARE has made significant headway in increasing the research and knowledge in Asian health, as well as in educating students, patients, providers, and the community on health disparities within the Asian community.2018-2021 Impact Highlights 139 Journal articles 4 Conferences 63.9k Website page views 1400 JAH views 4.3k Attendees 9Monthly health talks 731 Peer citations 9 Papers published 309k Impressions 1st Issue of JAH published 13 Pursuing health careers 23 JAH authors 48 Scholars 12.8k On-demand views 20 Research presentations AB 789 Critical support provided19 Seed Grants 6 Country-specific data briefs $10M Commitment secured 4 Asian health courses RESEARCH EDUCATION COMMUNITY ResearchResearch21The term \"Asian\" encompasses many different subgroups, including people with roots in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, India, the Philippines, and many other countries. \"Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\" refers to people having origins in Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific islands. Recent research, including studies led by Stanford faculty, has found that these ethnic groups have widely divergent risk profiles. For example, in relation to Caucasians and other Asian subgroups, Indians are at significantly greater risk of heart disease; Japanese and Koreans have a higher-than-average risk of stomach cancer; and Filipinos are disproportionately affected by diabetes. In comparison to other ethnic groups, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS are more prevalent in Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander populations. Similarly, various ethnic groups may have very different responses to common medications. Clearly, a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to health care falls short and may even lead to inadvertent harm. CARE is optimally positioned to delve into the underlying contributors to such differences and to pioneer more tailored approaches to precision care. It provides seed grants so Stanford faculty members can pursue bold investigations and gather preliminary data, which will make their projects competitive for follow-on funding from federal and other funding sources.Research: Discovering Causes of Health and Disease Since CARE's inception in 2018, there have been: 2018: 19 5 2019: 38 8 2020: 32 4 2021: 32 1731 Peer citations 121 Journal articles18 Conference proceedings 139Publications by CARE facultyResearch22Journal of Asian Health Our newly re-launched Asian health journal will feature manuscripts, studies, reviews, and opinion editorials on health care issues and disease risks and outcomes in Asian populations.

Dr. Wang has over 26 years of experience in cardiac electrophysiology, was co-inventor of the catheter cryoablation, and has pioneered new techniques in managing heart rhythm issues. He has also served in numerous leadership positions including chair of the American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology ECG and Arrhythmias Committee and member of the Board of Trustees of the Heart Rhythm Society. 1,000 Readers 23Research presentations Issue1ST Research papers published5Research23Due to the generosity of philanthropic support, CARE has awarded five to eight seed grants per year to pioneering scientists across multiple disciplines (including in the fields of gastroenterology, ophthalmology, psychiatry, traditional Chinese medicine, and more) looking for early- stage funding to pursue research dedicated to improving Asian health. In 2021 and beyond, CARE intends to award its first $50K seed grants and to increase the numbers of grants awarded on a progressive basis. These grants have given CARE investigators the freedom to explore their most promising and creative research ideas, which nurture and expand Stanford Medicine's exceptional capacity for innovation. These funds are particularly helpful in promoting collaborations across disciplines and supporting young faculty, many of whom have no other means to investigate promising areas of study and to accumulate enough data in pilot studies to validate ideas and pursue additional funding. This strategy has already, in various cases, launched new projects and allowed researchers to accumulate sufficient \"proof of concept\" data to apply successfully for follow-on funding, both in the form of additional philanthropic investment and from traditional funding sources such as the NIH.Seed Grants 3 Presentations19 Recipients $10M Follow-on funding60% Increase in Seed Grants awarded from 2019-20212018 - 2021 Seed Grant Award Statistics: 7Peer citations 7Publications since 2020EducationEducation254,335 123Live attendees Speakers 4 ConferencesEducation: Investing in the Future Generation of Leaders in Asian Health The center is a nexus for cutting-edge discoveries in all aspects of Asian health, ranging from laboratory research to clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, and development of the best ways to deliver interventions in culturally appropriate ways.

These committed funds are a combination of expendable and endowed gifts; outright expendable gifts totaled an excess of $1.3 million and endowments totaled $1.7 million, to-date. The largest expenditures during this period were for core programs supporting the three strategic pillars defined in CARE's Strategic Plan: research, education, and community programs. In the coming years, we anticipate spending to increase in all areas as we continue to execute CARE's Strategic Plan to amplify impact. We plan to hire more operational team members, expand CARE platform capabilities, and execute more programs in the strategic areas of research, education, and community. We also anticipate that, pending the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, we will move forward with our plans to support international educational exchanges and research initiatives.Financial Highlights CARE was unable to support international educational exchanges due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Given the COVID-19 crisis disrupting lives around the globe, our fiscal years 2020 and 2021 proved challenging for all of us. Yet, thanks to your generosity, during this time our community collectively committed $3 million to CARE\u2014a combination of outright gifts and endowments\u2014 which has enabled CARE to quickly scale, accelerate growth, and begin to establish sustainability. Health research and education specific to Asians is still in its early stages of development, yet discoveries about how to better care for this group will improve the lives of half the world's population. CARE is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge, and has the research expertise, entrepreneurial spirit, and community partnerships to bring precision health to Asians everywhere. Philanthropy is essential to the continuation of this work. Your partnership, at any level, will have a meaningful impact. Unrestricted gifts for CARE will provide the center with the most flexibility in driving forward its top strategic initiatives. Should you prefer to make more directed gifts, they would likely fall into four main categories supporting these efforts over the next three to five years: I. Asian health research II. Education about Asian health issues III. Community engagement IV. Setting up CARE for a sustainable future We invite you to partner with us and join other like- minded philanthropists in this exciting endeavor to make a significant difference in improving the health of Asians here and across the globe.

The board is composed of members from a variety of sectors who share CARE's commitment to ending health disparities for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations and improving the health of Asians everywhere. Board members provide valuable external perspectives, offer guidance on the center's research, education, and community outreach programs, and provide insight and support for the center's strategic direction and overall objectives.
