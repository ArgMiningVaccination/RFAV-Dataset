IAttachment A to PO 2019-0416 SIX-YEAR ENROLLM ENT PROJECTIONS Wlh the assistance of a professional demographer, the Distriot has developed its own methodology for forecasting future enrollmenls. This methodology, a modified cohort suruival method, considers a variety of factors to evaluate the potential student population growth for the years 2019 through 2028. These factors include: projected births; projected growlh in the K-12 population, and a model which consid\u20acr\u20ac growth in population and housing within the District's boundaries. Because the demographer's projections do not exclude students ln grades g-12 who parlicipate sutside of District facillties in Running Start programs, lhe District has adjusted the demogr:aphe/s grade 9-'12 projeetions for the purposes of this Gapital Facilities Plan. Qn average, the Districtrs experience is that betvveen 7% and 19o/o of high school students are participating in Running Start, with these percentages growing in recent years. Caloulations based on the 2018 enrollment dala indicate that grorafir will consistenily increase over the nerct six years. Current enrollment of 8,560 (October 2018) is projected to increase to 9,070 (ffE) in the 2A24-2026 schsol year - an inorease of 5.96 percent. All grade levels will experience enrollment grordh.

Methodology and Variables Used to Calculate School lmpact Fees The Tahoma $ohool District calculates school impact fees pursuant to the formula adopted by King County Ordinance No^ 10162 and under the aulhority of Chapter 21A.43 of the King County Code and the Washington State Growth Management,Act. The formula calculates fees lor single family dwelling unlts and multi-family dwelling units. lmpacl fees are calculated based on the Disirict's cost per dwelling unit for capacity projects that will serve the student from new developrnent (including, as applieable, the purchase ofland for school sites, making site improvernents, oonstructing schools and purchasing/installing portable facilities). As required under GMA, credits have also been applied for State Match Funds to be reimbursed to the District and properly taxes to fund the projects that will be proposed for future bond rneasures. Assessed values for single and multi-family housing in the Tahoma School Distriot were provided by the King County Assessor in February 2019, The King County Ordinance includes a fifty (50) percent \"discount rate,\" which operales to set the finalfee at 50% of the calculated unfunded need- Appendix B includes the District's fee calculation.

This plan is scheduled to be submittcd for considcration to cach of thc jurisdictions locatcd with the Federal Way Public Schools' service area: King County, the City of Kent, City of Federal Way and the City of Auburn and is incorporated in the Comprehensive Plans of each jurisdiction by reference. This plan is requested to be included in the Facilities Plan element of the Comprehensive Plans of each jurisdiction. To date, the City of Des Moines has not adopted a school impact f'ee ordinance. The City of Des Moines collects school impact fees as part of the SEPA process. Discussions with the City of Milton to adopt an ordinance for school impact fees for parcels located within the Federal Way School District's service area is in process. The Growth Management Act requires the County to designate Urban Growth areas within which urban growth can be encouraged. The Growth Management Planning Council adopted and recommended to the King County Council four Urban Growth Area Line Maps with designations for urban centers. A designation was made within the Federal Way planning area. which encompasses Federal Way Public Schools boundaries. King County will encourage and actively support the development of Urban Centers to meet the region's need for housing, jobs, services, culture, and recreation. This Plan's estimated population growth is prepared with this underlying assumption. This CapitalFacilities Plan will be used as documentation for any jurisdiction, which requires its use to meet the needs ot'the Growth Management Act. This plan is not intended to be the sole planning tool for all of the District needs. The District may prepare interim plans consistent with Board policies or management need. During the 2016-17 school year the District formed a 100 member Facilities Planning Committee consisting of parents, community members and staff. The Committee was tasked with developing a recommendation to the Superintendent regarding Phase 2 of the District's plan for school construction, remodelin g, andlor modernization for voter consideration in November 2017. The voters passed this $450M bond authorization with a 62% YES vote reflecting a commitment to invest in the modernization of our infrastructure. Through the committee's work a determination was made to rebuild Thomas Jefferson High School, Illahee Middle School, Totem Middle School, Lake Grove Elementary, Mirror Lake Elementary, Olympic View Elementary, Star Lake Elementary, and Wildwood Elementary. In addition to the school projects, the committee included a plan to modernize Memorial Stadium, which currently supports athletic activities for all schools. The rebuilding of the schools will create additional capacity for students at the elementary and high school levels. 2Attachment B to PO 2019-0416 FEDERAL WAY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN INTRODUCTION\" continued The District continues to monitor factors that may have an impact on enrollment and capacity at our schools. In accordance with the McCleary decision, the State has provided funding to reduce K-3 class size to 17 and 4-12 class size to 25. Beginning in 2019-20 the legislature expects compliance with this funding adding pressure to the need for elementary capacity. In response to this need the district has acquired a commercial building to renovate into classrooms to provide permanent additional capacity. We will also continue to study school boundaries as new housing and fluctuating populations impact specific schools. Some shifts in boundaries may be required in the coming years. At this time with more than 1,000 unhoused elementary students, boundary adjustments cannot resolve the need for additional capacity. The maps included in this Plan reflect the boundaries for the 2018-19 school vear. 3Attachment SCHOOLS2O2O CAP|IAL }.'ACILITIES PLAN SECTION 1 - THE CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN The State Growth Management Act requires that several pieces of information be gathered to determine the facilities available and needed to meet the needs of a growing community.

In addition to these programs, TAF@Saghalie serves studcnts in gradcs 6-12 who reside within the service area and the Employment and Transition Program (ETP) at the Norman Center serves 18-21 year old scholars. The Growth Management Act requires that a jurisdiction evaluate if the public facility ittfi'astructure is in place to handle new housing developments. In the case of most public facilities, new development has its major impact on the facilities immediately adjacent to that developtttetrt. Schoul districts are different. If the district does not have permanent facilities available, interim measllres must be taken until new facilities can be built or until boundaries can be adjusted to match the population changes to the surrounding facilities. It is irnportant to realize that a single housing development does not require the construction of a complete school facility. School districts are required to project growth throughout the district and build or adjust boundaries based on growth throughout the district, not just around a single development. Adjusting boundaries requires careful consideration by the district and is not taken lightly. It is recogtiized tliat there is a potetttial irnpact on students who are required to change schools.

The Superintendent of Public Instruction establishes square footage guidelines for capacity, but these guidelines do not take into consideration the education program needs. In general, the District's current target class size provides that the average class size for a standard classroom for grades K through 3 should be 17 students to comply with current legislation. In grades 4-5 the target is 25 students. For grades 6 to 12 the target class size is 26 students. Classrooms for students with Individualized Education Program (Special Education) needs are calculated at 12 seats per classroom. Historically, the District has used the OSPI square footage calculation as a baseline for capacity calculation and made adjustments for specific program needs. The District will continue to use this calculation for determining capacity at our middle and high schools. However, for elementary schools capacity will be calculated based on the number of classroom spaces and the number of students assigned to each classroom.

I4Attachment B to PO 2019-0416 FEDERAL WAY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES WAY PUtsLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN PORTABLE LOCATIONS The Washington State Constitution requires the State to provide each student a basic education. It is not an efficient use of District resources to build a school with a capacity for 500 students due to lack of space for 25 students when enrollment fluctuates throughout the year and from year to year. Portables are used as interim measures to house students when increasing population impacts a school attendance area. Portables may also be required to house students when new or changing programs require additional capacity. They also provide housing for students until permanent facilities can be financed and constructed. When permanent facilities become available, the portable(s) is either used for other purposes such as storage or child care programs, or moved to another school for an intcrim classroom. Some portables may not be fit to move due to age or physical condition. In these cases, the District may choose to buy new portables and surplus these unfit portables. With the launch of construction of new schools, a number of portables will be relocated, decommissioned, or sold. These numbers are not available at this time. The following page provides a list of the location of the portable facilities, used for educational facilities by Federal Way Public Schools.

Enrollment projections influence many of the financial estimates that go into budget preparation. The majority of staffing requirements are derived directly from the forecasted number of students. Allocations for instructional supplies and materials are also made on the basis of projected enrollment. Other expenditures and cerlain revenue projections are directly related to enrollment projections. Enrollment projections are completed annually in the Business Services Department. Projections must be detailed at various levels, district total, school-building totals, grade level and program level to include vocational and special education students. The basis of projcctions has bccn cohofi survival analysis. Cohort survival is the analysis of a group that has a common statistical value (grade level) as it progresses through time. In a stable population the cohort would be 1.00 for all grades. This analysis uses historical information to develop averages and project the averages forward. This method does not trace individual students; it is concerned with aggregate numbers in each grade level. The district has used this method with varying years of history and weighted factors to study several projections. Because transfers in and out of the school system are common, student migration is factored into the analysis as it increases or decreases survival rates. Entry grades (kindergarten) are a unique problem in cohort analysis. The district collects information on birth rates within the district's census tracts, and treats these statistics as a cohort fbr kindergarten enrollment in the appropriate years. The Federal Way School District is using various statistical methods for projecting student enrollments. The resultant forecasted enrollments are evaluated below. The first method is a statistical cohort analysis that produces ten distinct forecasts. These are forecast of enrollment for one year. The pro.iections vary depending on the number of years of historical information and how they are weighted. A second method is a projection using an enrollment projection software package that allows the user to project independently at school or grade level and to aggregate these pro.jections for the district level. The Enrollment MasterrM software provides statistical methods including trend line, standard grade progression (cohort) and combinations of these methods. This software produces a five-year projection of school enrollment. In February 2018, the District contracted a demographer to develop projections for the Federal Way School District. The report was complete in March 2018. The model used to forecast next year's enrollment uses cohort survival rates to measure grade to grade growth, assumes market share losses to private schools (consistent with county-wide average), assumes growth from new housing or losses due to net losses from migration. This forecast was provided as a range of three projections. The long-range forecast provided with this repoft used a model with cohort survival rates and growth rates based on projected changes in the 5-19 age group for King County. 1BAttachment B to PO 201S-0416 FEDERAL WAY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN STUDENT FORECAST' continued Most of the methods used for long range enrollment reporting assume that enrollment is a constant percent of something else (e.g. population) or that enrollment will mirror some projected trend for the school-age population over time. The report included 5 different calculations to provide a range of possible projections for the District to the year 2026. This model produces a projection that is between 2I,500 and 25,000 when applied to the low, medium and high range modes. This provides a reasonable range for long-range planning and is consistent with estimates from various models. Long-range projections that establish the need for facilities are a modification of the cohort survival method. The cohort method of analysis becomes less reliable the farther out the projections are made. The Federal Way School District long-range projections are studied annually. The study includes information from the jurisdictional demographers as they project future housing and population in the region. The long-range projections used by Federal Way Public Schools reflect a similar age trend in student populations as the projections published by the Office of Financial Management for the State of Washington. Near term projections assume some growth from new housing, which is offset by current local economic conditions. The District tracks new development from five permitting jurisdictions. Long range planning assumes a student yield from proposed new housing consistent with historical growth patterns. Growth Management requires jurisdictions to plan for a minimum of twenty years. The Federal Way School District is a partner in this planning with the various jurisdictions comprising the school district geography. These projections create a vision of the school district community in the future. In school year 2018-19, King County as a whole experienced unusual enrollment patterns. We continue to monitor this closely. 19Attachment B to PO 2019-0416 FEDERAL WAY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN STUDENT PO 2019-0416 FEDERAL WAY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2O2O CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN SECTION 4 - KING COUNTY\" CITY OF F'EDERAL WAY.

To determine an equitable fee throughout unincorporated King County, a formula was established. This formula can be found in King County Code 21A and was substantially adopted by the City of Auburn, Federal Way and Kent. The formula requires the District to establish a \"Student Generation Factor\" which estimates how many students will be added to a school district by each new single or multi-family unit and to gather some standard construction costs, which are unique to that district.

Anticipated construction budgets (based on the Maximum Allowable Construction Cost or MACC) have been updated to reflect the curent construction market, and capacity has been fine-tuned. In addition, a credit for the cost of new construction is incorporated to recognize the K-3 Class Size Reduction Grant obtained by Federal Way Public Schools. It is estimated this $23 million grant will be reimbursed in six equal payments - a portion for each of the six schools serving K-3 students. The following table outlines the facility cost included in the impact fee calculation: Two additional projects are within this horizon, but not yet included - Olympic View K-8 and Mark Twain Elementary.

INTRODUCTION Purpose of the Capital Facilities Plan Presented herein, in conformance with the GroMh Management Act and local county and municipal codes is the Capital Facilities Plan (CFP) of the Riverview School District. This Capital Facilities Plan is intended to provide the City of Carnation, the City of Duvall, King County, other jurisdictions, and our own community with a description of facilities needed to accommodate projected student enrollment at acceptable levels of service over the next six years (2019 - 2025). The Growth Management Act also requires reassessment of the land use element of local comprehensive plans if probable funding falls short of meeting existing needs, and to ensure that the land use element, capital facilities plan element, and financing plan within the capitalfacilities plan element are coordinated and consistent. This Capital Facilities Plan is intended to provide localjurisdictions with information on the school district's ability to accommodate projected population and enrollment demands anticipated through implementation of various comprehensive plan land use alternatives The role of impact fees in funding school construction is addressed in Section B of this report. Overview of the Riverview School District The Riverview School District services three jurisdictions: King County, the City of Carnation, and the City of Duvall. The district is 250 square miles and is located in northeast King County serving the Lower Snoqualmie Valley from the King/Snohomish County line south approximately 16 miles, and from the western ridge of the valley to the cascade foothills. The district currently serves an enrollment headcount of approximately 3,296 students, with three elementary schools, one middle school, one high school, three alternative high school programs, and one alternative elementary school programs, and a K-12 alternative parent partnership program. The grade configuration is kindergarten through fifth grade for elementary school, sixth through eighth for middle school, and ninth through twelfth for high school. Four of the alternative programs are housed at the Riverview Learning Center in Carnation. 3Attachment SECTION 2.. STUDENT ENROLLMENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS P rojected Student E n rol lmen t 201 9-2025 Enrollment projections are most accurate for the initial years of the forecast period. For later years, the review of enrollment patterns, housing trends, and other demographic changes are useful yearly indicators in evaluating and adjusting projections. This year's plan anticipates a 2% growlh in student enrollment which is based on recent enrollment trends. Some of the trends are a result of: 1) transfers from private schools, 2) increases in kindergaden enrollment, 3) significant decreases in students attending school outside the district and 4) local groMh in housing developments. Housing starts have increased in recent years and the district is experiencing slight enrollment growth. The City of Carnation estimates approximately 87 homes to be built in the next 2-3 years in addition to issuing recent permits for further housing developments. Based on preliminary data from the City of Duvall, over 200 housing starts are expected to be permitted within the next two years. ln the event that enrollment growth slows, plans for new facilities can be delayed. lt is much more difficult, however, to initiate new projects or speed projects up in the event that enrollment growth exceeds the projections. The Riverview School District, like most school districts, projects enrollment using a modified \"Cohort Survival\" method combined with other enrollment factors, including local and surrounding housing growth. This method tracks groups of students through the K-12 system, and notes and adjusts the projections to account for year-to-year changes, including local population growth. For example, this year's eight grade student class is adjusted based on an average of prior year's survival trends in order to estimate next year's ninth grade enrollment. Since the yearly figures for each grade are dependent on the previous year's grades, kindergarten projections are treated differently. Riverview projects its kindergarten enrollment based on historical kindergarten enrollment patterns and district enrollment growth patterns.

DISTRICT STANDARD OF SERVICE Schoolfacility and student capacity needs are dictated by the types and amounts of space required to accommodate the district's adopted educational program. The educational program standards which typically drive facility space needs include grade configuration, optimalfacility size, optimal school enrollment size, class size, educational program offerings, classroom utilization and scheduling requirements, and use of portable classroom facilities. ln addition to factors which affect the amount of space required, government mandates, contractual requirements, and community expectations may affect how classroom space is used. For example, the state financed All-Day Kindergarten program and lower class sizes for kindergarten through 3rd grade is creating the need for additional classrooms at the elementary level. Traditional educational programs offered by school districts are often supplemented by nontraditional or special programs such as special education, expanded bilingual education, remediation, migrant education, alcohol and drug education, preschool and daycare programs, home school, computer labs, music programs, movement programs, etc. These specialor nontraditional educational programs can have a significant impact on the available student capacity of school facilities. Special teaching stations and programs offered by the Riverview School District at specific school sites include: Elementary: Computer Labs Classroom Computers Group Activities Rooms Program for Academically Talented (Gifted/PAT) Special Education (The District attempts to integrate special education students and regular education students to as great an extent as possible. Most special education students are served both in a regular education classroom and a special education classroom.)

Alternative (CLIP & CHOICE high school program). Special Education. Learning Assistance Program (LAP). English Language Learners (EL). Career and Technical Education (CTE). School-to-Work bAttachment C to PO 2019-0416 Variations in student capacity between schools are often a result of what special or nontraditional programs are offered at specific schools. These special programs require classroom space which can reduce the permanent capacity of some of the buildings housing these programs. Some students, for example, leave their regular classrooms for a short period of time to receive instruction in these special programs. Schools often require space modifications to accommodate special programs, and in some circumstances, these modifications may reduce the overall classroom capacities of the buildings. The current Standard of Service data for Riverview, in terms of teaching station loading, is identified on Table 3.1 . Class sizes are averages based on actual utilization as influenced by state funding and collective bargaining restrictions. Riverview's Standard of Service also considers the different educational functions when considering student capacity needs. Those functions are as follows: Elementary classrooms -. regular, grades K-5. self-contained learning center (special education). learning support classrooms (special education pullout, LAP, Title l, etc.) Secondary -. regular, grades 6-8. special education, grades 6-8. learning support, grades 6-8. regular, grades 9-12. learning support, grades 9-12 (special education pullout, LAP, Title l, etc.) lnvoluntarily transferring students to a school with excess capacity is done rarely as a last resort and with Board of Directors' authorization. lnvoluntarily transferring of students can result in difficulties in the community, with staffing, and with transportation 7Table 3.1 Riverview School District Standard of Service Grade Level K-5 Weighted 6-B 9-12Attachment C to PO 2019-0416 Average 17 17 17 17 25 25 19.7 24 12 0 27 24 12 0CLASS SIZE Elementary Regular Regular Regular Regular Regular Regular Regular Regular (portables) Self-contained learning classrooms Learning support classrooms Middle School Regular Regular (portables) Self-contained learning classrooms Learning support classrooms High School Regular Regular (portables) Self-contained learning classrooms Learning support classrooms Vocational educationK I 2 3 4 5 27 24 12 0 24 8Attachment C to PO 2019-0416 SECTION 4 -. CAPITAL FACILITIES INVENTORY Under the Growth Management Act, public entities are required to inventory existing capital facilities. Capitalfacilities are defined as any structure, improvement, and piece of equipment or other major asset, including land, which has a useful life of at least ten years. The purpose of the facilities inventory is to establish a baseline for determining what facilities will be required to accommodate student enrollment in the future at established levels of service. This section provides an inventory of capital facilities of the Riverview School District including site-built schools, portable classrooms, developed school sites, undeveloped land and support facilities. School facility capacity figures are based on the inventory of current facilities and the district's adopted educational program standards as presented in the previous section. Schools The Riverview School District currently operates 3 elementary schools (grades K-5), one middle school (grades 6-8), and one high school (grades 9-12). The district also provides the Eagle Rock Multi-age Program, an elementary alternative program, sited adjacent to the Cedarcrest High School campus. ln addition, the district supports the following alternative programs housed in the Riverview Learning Center facility: CLIP alternative high school; CHOICE alternative high school; and PARADE, a parent partnership program. ECEAP, a pre-school program, is housed again in yet another separate facility, lndividual school capacity has been determined using the number of teaching stations within each building and the space requirements of the district's adopted educational program. This capacity calculation is used to establish the district's baseline capacity and determine future capacity needs when considering projected student enrollment. Classroom capacities have been determined for each school according to their usage. For the purpose of this Plan, classroom uses are: regular education, self-contained special-education, and learning support. The school facility inventory is summarized on Table 4.1. The current inventory of facilities indicates a permanent capacity of 2,537 students, with an additional 624 student capacity available in interim facilities. The School Board of the Riverview School District is committed to serving students at small schools. Evidence suggests that this practice a significantly beneficial effect on student learning. Further, there are significant benefits to school culture and climate.

PROJECTED FACILITY NEEDS Near-term Facility Needs This Capital Facilities Plan has been organized to maintain adequate capacity of the District's facilities through the construction and/or expansion of permanent facilities. Table 5.1 is a summary by school level of projected enrollments, current capacities, and projected additional capacities. Based upon current enrollment projections, the district has permanent capacity needs at all grade levels. To meet these capacity needs in the near-term, the District is in the preliminary planning stages of a new K-5 elementary school in the Duvall area where the most substantial district population growth is occurring (Table 6.1). The district also anticipates that the site acquisition and construction of this school will be complete within the first six years of this planning period. New school construction will be contingent on a 2o/o average yearly student enrollment growth rate and voter approved funding. ln addition, the District is planning on the acquisition of portables at all grade levels. 11Table 5.1Attachment C to PO 2019-0416 School Enrollment and Ca Proions 2019-20 throuh 2024-25 capacity 1,037 1,037 1,037 1,037 1 ,587 1,587 Enrollment Capacity in permanent facilities Added capacity new permanent Facilities Capacity in Relocatables Number of Relocatables Capacitywith Relocatables813 0826 606 606 606827 606 0 606 -223 -221 High School (9-12) Projected Enrollment Capacity in permanent facilities Added capacity new permanent Capacity in Relocatables Number of Relocatables Capacity with Relocatables Net Surplus or (De,ficit) in all Facilities Surplus/Deficie ncy Capacity (K-121 Projected Enrollment Capacity in Permanent Facilities Capacity in Perm.

Table 6.2 Planned Pects to Facilities SECTION 7 . CAPITAL FACILITIES FINANCING PLAN Funding of school facilities is typically secured from a number of sources including voter-approved bonds, voter approved levies, state matching funds, impact fees, and mitigation payments. Each of these funding sources is discussed below. General Obligation Bonds Bonds are typically used to fund construction of new schools and other capital improvement projects. A 60% voter approval is required to pass a bond issue. Bonds are sold as necessary to generate revenue. They are retired through collection of property taxes. The district anticipates asking its voters to approve a bond measure to fund a new K-5 elementary, high school addition/remodel and security updates. Subject to Board approval, this proposal is expected to be on the ballot in 2020.Capacitv AddedSource of Funds*Growth related proiects Project Location 20'19-2020 Classroom oortables k-'12 Duvall fees 100% 2020-2021 Classroom portables k-1 2 Capital Projects IeVV lOOo/o 2020-2025 550lmpact Fees, State Match, and local approved bond issue 100% New K-5 school Duvall Capacity Added Source of FundsGrowth related proiect?

A simple majority of voter approval is required to pass a levy. Money comes to the district through the collection of property taxes. The district passed a four- year capital improvement levy in February of 2018 for the upgrade of technology assets including new computers, upgrades to the network infrastructure, and software. ln addition, the levy supports other capital improvements including the acquisition of sites and portables. The district is planning to run another levy in February of 2022. State Financial Assistance State financial assistance comes from the State's Common School Construction Fund. Bonds are sold on behalf of the fund then retired from revenues accruing predominantly from the sale of renewable resources (i.e. timber)from state school lands set aside by the Enablirrg Act of 1889. lf these sources are insufficient to meet needs, the Legislature can appropriate funds or the State Board of Education can establish a moratorium on certain projects. State matching funds can be applied to school construction projects only. Site acquisition and tmprovements are not eligible to receive matching funds from the state. Because availability of state matching funds has not kept pace with the rapid enrollment growth occurring in many of Washington's school districts, matching funds from the State may not be received by a school district untiltwo to three years after a matched project has been completed. ln such cases, the district must \"front fund\" a project. That is, the district must finance the complete project with local funds. lmpact Fees lmpact fees have been adopted by a number of jurisdictions as a means of supplementing traditional funding sources for construction of public facilities needed to accommodate new development, lmpact fees are generally collected on new residential construction by the permitting agency at the time of final plat approval or when building permits are issued. Budget and Financing Plan Table 7.1 is a summary of the budget that supports the elements of this Capital Facilities Plan. Each project budget represents the total project costs which include: acquisition, constructiorr, taxes, planning, architectural and engineering services, permitting, environmental impact mitigation, construction testing and inspection, furnishings and equipment, escalation, and contingencies. ln addition, it includes financing that is separated into three components: estimated state financial assistance, estimated impact fees, and projected local revenues (i.e., interest income and local levies). 14Attachment C to PO 2019-0416 Table 7.1 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Budget $ 3,000,000.00 $ 2.250.000.00 $ High school addition remodel Orthercapibl impro\\r'ements including the acquisition of portables *Ref/ecfs costs of new capacity only 15Attachment C to PO 2019-0416 SECTION 8..IMPACT FEES School lmpact Fees under the washington state Growth Management Act The Growth Management Act (GMA) authorizes jurisdictions to collect impact fees to supplement funding of additional public facilities needed to accommodate new development. lmpact fees cannot be used for the operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, or replacement of existing capital facilities used to meet existing service demands. The calculation contained in this Plan yields impact fees to be collected during calendar year 201g. Methodology and Variables Used to Galculate School lmpact Fees lmpact fees are calculated based on the district's estimated cost per new dwelling unit to purchase land for school sites, make site improvements, construct schools and purchase/install temporary facilities (poftables). Student Factors The student factor (or student generation rate), a significant factor in determining impact fees, is the average number of students generated by each housing type - single-family dwellings and mu ltiple-family dwell ings. The District was unable to obtain sufficient permit data to calculate its own student generation factors; it instead chose to use generation rates representative of unweighted averages based on neighboring schooldistricts. ln accordance with KCC 214.06.1260, the definition for student factor, when such information is not available in the district, is the data from adjacent districts, districts with similar demographics, or countywide averages. Table 8.1 and 8.2 set forth those student factors and the lmpact fee schedule.

APPENDIX A: 2018-19 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL APPENDIX E: SIX-YEAR FINANCE PLAN3 4 5 5 6 8 2Attachment D to PO 2019-0416 This Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan (the \"Plan\") has been prepared by the lssaquah School District (the \"District\") as the District's primary facility planning document, in compliance with the requirements of Washington's GroMh Management Act and King County Council Code Title 21A. This Plan was prepared using data available in April 2019. This Plan is an update of prior long-term Capital Facilities Plans adopted by the lssaquah School District. However, this Plan is not intended to be the sole Plan for all of the District's needs. The District may prepare interim and periodic Long Range Capital Facilities Plans consistent with board policies, taking into account a longer or a shorter time period, other factors and trends in the use of facilities, and other needs of the District as may be required. Any such plan or plans will be consistent with this Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan. ln June 1992, the District first submitted a request to King County to impose and to collect school impact fees on new developments in unincorporated King County. On November 16,1992, the King County Councilfirst adopted the District's Plan and a fee implementing ordinance. This Plan is the annual update of the Six-Year Plan. King County and the cities of lssaquah, Renton, Bellevue, Newcastle and Sammamish collect impact fees on behalf of the District. Most of these jurisdictions provide exemptions from impact fees for senior housing and certain low-income housing. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act, this Plan will be updated on an annual basis, and any charges in the fee schedule(s) adjusted accordingly. 3Attachment D to PO 2019-0416 School facility and student capacity needs are dictated by the types and amounts of space required to accommodate the District's adopted educational program. The educational program standards which typically drive facility space needs include grade configuration, optimal facility size, class size, educational program offerings, as well as classroom utilization and scheduling requirements and use of re-locatable classroom facilities (portables). Different class sizes are used depending on the grade level or programs offered such as special education or the gifted program. With the passage of lnitiative 728 in November 2000, the lssaquah School Board established new class size standards for elementary grades K-5. The Board and District Administration will continue to keep class sizes near the levels provided by l-728; this will be done via local levy funds. There is also legislation that requires the State to fund Full-Day Kindergarten by 2018. The District provided Full- Day Kindergarten beginning in the 201 6-2017 school year. A class size average of 20 for grades K-5 is now being used to calculate building capacities. A class size of 26 is used for grades 6-8 and 28 for grades 9-12. Special Education class size is based on 12 students per class. For the purpose of this analysis, rooms designated for special use, consistent with the provisions of King County Council Code Title 21A, are not considered classrooms. lnvariably, some classrooms will have student loads greater in number than this average level of service and some will be smaller. Program demands, state and federal requirements, collective bargaining agreements, and available funding may also affect this level of service in the years to conre. Due to these variables, a utilization factor of 95% is used to adjust design capacities to what a building may actually accommodate. Portables used as classrooms are used to accommodate enrollment increases for interim purposes until permanent classrooms are available. When permanent facilities become available, the portable(s) is either moved to another school as an interim classroom or removed. The King County decision to no longer allow schools to be built ourtside the Urban Growth Boundary Line (UGBL) means District owned property planned for a new elementary school and middle school cannot be used. The District recently sold this planned site to a third parly. The District has acquired one elementary school site and one middle school site inside the UGBL. A high school site and another elementary school site are still needed. The State does not provide funding for property purchases. Approved Bond funding provides for a new high school, new middle school, two new elementary schools, a rebuildiexpansion of an existing middle school and additions to six existing elementary schools. 4Attachment D to PO 2019-0416 TRIGGER OF CONSTRUCTION The lssaquah School District Capital Facilities Plan proposes construction of a new high school, a new middle school, two new elementary schools, the re-build/expansion of an existing middle school and additions to five existing elementary schools to meet the needs of elementary, middle school and high school capacity needs. The need for new schools and school additions is triggered by comparing our enrollment forecasts with our permanent capacity figures. These forecasts are by grade level and, to the extent possible, by geography. The analysis provides a list of new construction needed by school year. The decision on when to construct a new facility involves factors other than verified need. Funding is the most serious consideration. Factors including the potential tax rate for our citizens, the availability of state funds and impact fees, the ability to acquire land, and the ability to pass bond issues determine when any new facility can be constructed. The planned facilities will be funded by a bond passed on April 26, 2016, school impact fees and reserve funds held by the District. New school facilities are a response to new housing which the county or cities have approved for construction. The District's Six-Year Finance Plan is shown in Appendix E. ln order to increase the accuracy and validity of enrollment projections, a major emphasis has been placed on the collection and tracking data of known new housing developments. This data provides two useful pieces of planning information. First, it is used to determine the actual number of students that are generated from a single family or multi-family residence. lt also provides important information on the impact new housing developments will have on existing facilities andlor the need for additionalfacilities. Developments that have been completed or are still selling houses are used to forecast the number of students who will attend our schools from future developments. Generation rates for elementary school, middle school and high school student per new single-family residence and new multi-family housing is shown on page 10 and page 11. 5OPMENTTRACKNGNEEDFORI M NEAttachment D to PO 2019-0416 The District relies on school impact fee revenue to help fund growth-related capacity needs. However, by law, impact fees can only be used to fund a portion of a capacity project. State funding and impact fees are also not reliable sources of revenue. As a result, the District must also rely on local funding to fund school construction. On April 26,2016 voters approved bond fLrnding for the construction of a new high school, a new middle school and two new elementary schools, the rebuild/expansion of an existing middle school and additions to six existing elementary schools. As demonstrated in Appendix A, (page 1B)the District currently has a permanent capacity (at 100%)to serve B4BB students at the elementary level. Appendix B, (page 19) shows a permanent capacity (at 100%) for 4714 studenLs at the middle school level Appendix C (page 20) shows a permanent capacity (at 100%)of 5580 students at the high school level. Current enrollment is identified on pagc g. I he lJistrict elementary projected oct 2019 FTE is 9251. Adjusting permanent capacity by 95% leaves the District's elementary enrollment over permanent capacity at the elementary level by 1187 students (Appendix A). At the middle school level, the projected oct 2019 headcount is 5035. This is 557 students over permanent capacity (Appendix B). At the high school levelthe district is over permanent capacity by 518 students (Appendix C). Based on the District's student generation rates, the District expects that 0.638 students will be generated from each new single family home and 0.38 students will be generated from each new multi-family dwelling unit. Applying the enrollment projections contained on page 9 to the District's existing permanent capacity (Appendices A, B, and C) and if no capacity inrprovements are rnade by the year 2024-25, and permanent capacity is adjusted to 95%, the District elementary population will be over its permanent capacity by 131 1 students, at the middle school level by 538 students, and will be over its permanent capacity by 1047 at the high school level. The District's enrollment projections are developed using two methods: first, the cohort survival - historical enrollment method is used to forecast errrollnrerrl growl.lr base<J upon the progression of existing students in the District; then, the enrollment projections are modified to include students anticipated from new developments in the District. 6Attachment D to PO 2019-0416 To address existing and future capacity needs, the District's six-year construction plan includes the following capacity projects: Facility ExpansionsProjected lFinal Completion DateAdditional CapacitvLocation New High School New Elementary #17 New Middle School Expand Maple Hills Elementary New Elementary #16 Expand Discovery Elementary Expand Endeavour Elementary Rebuild/Expand Pine Lake Middle Expand Cougar Ridge Elementary Expand Sunset Elementary Creekside Elementary Portable Maple Hills Elementary Portable Challenger Elementary Portable Pine Lake Middle School Portable Sunny Hills Elementary Portables lssaquah Middle School Portables lssaquah School Portable2022 2022 2021 2021 2020 2019 2019 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 20181 600 680 850 120 680 120 120 242 120 120 40 40 40 56 BO 208 56 56lssaquah lssaquah lssaquah County Based upon the District's capacity data and enrollment projections, as well as the student generation data, the District has determined that a majority of its capacity improvements are necessary to serve students generated by new development. The school impact fee formula ensures that new development only pays for the cost of the facilities necessitated by new development. The fee calculations examine the costs of housing the students generated by each new single family dwelling unit or each new multi-family dwelling unit and then reduces that amount by the anticipated state match and future tax payments. The resulting impact fee is then discounted further. Thus, by applying the student generation factor to the school project costs, the fee formula only calculates the costs of providing capacity to serve each new dwelling unit. The formula does not require new development to contribute the costs of providing capacity to address existing needs. The King County Council and the City Councils of the Cities of Bellevue, lssaquah, Newcastle, Renton and Sammamish have created a framework for collecting school impact fees and the District can demonstrate that new developments will have an impact on the District. The impact fees will be used in a manner consistent with RCW 82.02.050 - .110 and the adopted local ordinances. Engrossed Senate Bill 5923, enacted in the 2015 Legislative Session, requires that developers be provided an option to defer payment of impact fees to final inspection, certificate of occupancy, or closing, with no fees deferred longer than 1B months from building permit issuance. The District adopts the positions that: (1 ) no school impact fee should be collected later than the earlier of final inspection or 1B months from the time of building permit issuance; and (2) no developer applicant should be permitted to defer payment of school impact fees for more than 20 dwelling units in a single year. The District's recent and ongoing student growth, coupled with the need for the timely funding and construction of new facilities to serve this growth, requires strict adherence to this position. 7Attachment D to PO 2019-0416 Two basic techniques are used, with the results compared, to establish the most likely range of anticipated student enrollment:1. The student 3-2-1 cohort survival method. Examine lssaquah School District enrollments for the last 5 years and determine the average cohort survival for the consecutive five-year period. Because cohort survival does not consider students generated from new development it is a conservative projection of actual enrollment. For the same reason, these projections are also slow to react to actual growth. 2. Based on information from King County, realtors, developers, etc., seek to establish lhe number of new dwelling units that will be sold each year. The new dwelling units are conveded to new students based on the following: a) The number of actual new students as a percentage of actual new dwellings for the past several years.b) Determine the actual distribution of new students by grade level for the past several years, i.e., 5o/o to kindergarten, 10% to first grade, 2% to'1 '1th grade, etc.c) Based on an examination of the history shown by (a) and (b) above, establish the most likely factor to apply to the projected new dwellings. After determining the expected new students, the current actual student enrollments are moved foruuard from year to year with the arrived at additions. One of the challenges associated with all projection techniques is that they tend to always show growth because the nunrber of houses and the general population always increases. Enrollments, however, can and do decrease even as the population increases. The reason is as the population matures, the number of kindergartners will go down as the number of '1Oth graders is still increasing. To adjust for this factor, the number of school age children per dwelling is examined. When this number exceeds expectations, it is probably because the Disttict is still assurning kindergarten groMh, while the main groMh is actually moving into middle school, When this happens, a reduction factor is added to kindergarten to force it to decrease even though the general population continues to grow. A precise statisticalformula has not been developed to make this adjustment. After all of the projections have been made and examined, the most likely range is selected. An examination of past projections compared with actual enrollment indicates the cohorts tend to be more accurate over a ten-year time span while dwelling units tend to be more accurate over a shorter period. The probable reason is that over a ten-year period, the projections tend to average out even though there are major shifts both up and down within the period.

Shown in Table Four is the District's projected capacity to house students, which reflects the additional facilities as noted. Voters passed a $533 million bond in April 2016 to fund the purchase of land for and construction of a new high school, a new middle school, two new elementary schools, the rebuild/expansion of an existing middle school and additions to six existing elementary schools. The District does anticipate receiving State matching funds that would reduce future bond sale amounts or be applied to new K-12 construction projects included in this Plan. The District also anticipates that it will receive $500,000 in impact fees and mitigation payments that will be applied to capital projects. The District projects 20,105 FTE students for the 2019-2020 school year and 20,684 FTE students in lhe 2024-2025 school year. Growth will be accommodated by the planned facilities. Per the formula in the adopted school impact fee ordinance, half of the unfunded growth-related need is assigned to impact fees and half is the local share.

Executive Summarv Tl-ris Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan (the \"Plan\") has been prepared by the Snoqualmie Valley School District (the \"District\") as the organization's primary facility planning document, in compliance with the requirements of the State of Washington's Growth Management Act and King County Code 214.43. This plan was prepared using data available in the spring of 2019 and is consistent with prior capital facilities plans adopted by the Districg however, this plan is not intended to be the sole plan for all of the organization's needs. In order for impact fees to be collected in the unincorporated areas of King County, the King County Council must adopt this plan, as proposed by the District. The Snoqualmie Valley School District also includes the incorporated cities of Snoqualmie and North Bend, as well as a portion of the city of Sammamish. The cities of Snoqualmie, North Bend, and Sammamish have each adopted a school impact fee policy and ordinance similar to the King County model. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act and the local implementing ordinances, this plan will be updated on an annual basis with any changes in the fee schedule adjusted accordingly. See Appendix A for the current single family residence and multi-family residence calculations. The District's Plan establishes a \"standard of service\" in order to ascertain current and future capacity. This standard of service is reflective of current student/teacher ratios that the District hopes to be able to maintain during the period reflected in this Capital Facilities Plan. The Standard of Service has been updated to incorporate anticipated class size reduction at the K-3 level, but does not incorporate additional class size reductions for all other grades, as outlined in Initiative 1351, which was approved by voters in November 201.4. Future updates to this plan will consider incorporating those class sizes as more details surrounding the implementation of Initiative L351 are known. It should also be noted that although the State Superintendent of Public Instruction establishes square foot guidelines for capacity funding criteria, those guidelines do not account for the local program needs in the District. The Growth Management Act and King County Code 214.43 authorize the District to make adjustments to the standard of service based on the District's specific needs. In general, the District's current standard provides the following (see Section 2 for additional information) : School Level TargetAverage Student/ Teacher Ratio Elementary Middle High20 Students 27 Students 28 Students rnoho(sAttachment E to PO 2019-0416 Sclrool caPacity for the 2019-20 school year is based on the District standard of service and use of existing inventory (including projects coming on line in the 2019-20 school year). Existing inventory includes both permanent and relocatablc classrooms (i.c. portable classroom units). Using reduced class size at the K-3 level, the District's 2019-20 overall permanent capacity is 6,209 students (with an additional 1,851 student capacity available in portable classrooms). October enrollment for the 2018-19 school year was 6,727 full time equivalents (\"FTE\"). FTE enrollment is projected to increase by 8o/\" to 7 ,257 in 2024, based on the mid'range of enrollment projections provided by a third- party demographer. Washington State House Bill2776, which was enacted in2010, required all kindergarten classes in the State to convert to full day kindergarten by 201\"8. The District converted to full day kindergarten in 2016. This transition doubled the number of classrooms needed for kindcrgartcncrs, including those which require additional special educational services. HB 2776 also stipulates K-3 class sizes to be reduced to 17 students per teacher by 2018 (down from the 2L:1, average currently funded). This transition has also required significant increases in the number of classrooms needed to adequately serve our grades 1-3 population. As noted in Section 7, the elementary school portable classrooms in Lhe district house the equivalent of 2 elementary schools, or approximately one-third of all elementary students. Though areas of growth are seen in various areas of the District, the most notable growth continues to be in the Snoqualmie Ridge and North Bend areas. United States Census data released a few years ago indicated the City of Snoqualmie as the fastest growing city in the State over the past decade, with 35% of the population under the age of 18. The cities of Snoqrralmie and North Bend both anticipate future housing growth beyond 2024, while growth in unincorporated King County and the city of Sammamish should experience minimal housing growth in the Disl.r'icL, unless arurexations occur. Such large and sustained growth continues to create needs {or additional classroom inventory. Previously, those needs have been addressed via the construction of Cascade View Elementary in 2005, Twin Falls Middle School in 2008, a 12-classroom portable expansion at Mount Si High School in2009 and the conversion of Snoqualmie Middle school into a Freshman Campus for Mount si High school in 2013, as well as the addition of numerous portable classrooms throughout the District. In the February 2015, a bond proposition was passed to construct a 6th elementary school and expand and modernize the main campus of Mount Si High School. The expanded and modernized Mount Si High School facilitates the relocation of the freshman campus back onto the main high school campus, which in turn creates needed middle school capacity by converfing the current Freshman Campus back to a middle school (Snoqualmie Middle School). The bond proposition did not address the need for expanded field capacity to adequately serve the anticipated larger student body. The District is working on land acquisition andf or alternative field solutions in order to address those known capacity needs. The 2015 voter-approved proposition also included funds to construct a new Elementary School #6. The construction of Timber Ridge Elementary, completed in2016 provided initial capacity at all elementary schools to implement full day kindergarten, reduce K-3 class sizes and provide for enrollment growth, as all District elementary schools underwent a re-boundary process in preparation for the opening of Timber Ridge. Elementary capacity needs calculated in this plan incorporate the lower K-3 class sizes\\o 0)h! OiAttachment E to PO 2019-0416 that should be fully implementedby 2018. Despite the addition of Timber Ridge and recent additions of portable classrooms, the significant reductions in K-3 class sizes have resulted in most elementary schools operating at capacity. Future enrollment growth, when combined with these reduced class sizes, will require additional future elementary school capacity. Portable classrooms may provide some short-term relief, however, many of the District's current elementary schools have reached the capacity to add more portable classrooms due to a number of factors, including: land availability, building code restrictions, and capacity of corresponding common areas such as parking, bathrooms, specialist classrooms and building support services. As suclu the District anticipates the need for a7th Elementary School in2023, in order to provide adequate capacity for future enrollment growth. N 0)bo (E o.Attachment E to PO 2019-0416 Section 2. Current District \"Standard of Service\" (as defined by King County Code 214.06 King County Code 214.06 refers to a \"standard of service\" that each school district rnust establish in order to ascertain its overall capacity. The standard of service identifies the program year, the class size, the number of classrooms, students and programs o{ special need, and other factors (determined by the district), which would best serve the shrdent population. Relocatables (i.e. portable classroom units) may be included in the capacity calculation using the same standards of service as the permanent facilities. The standard of service outlined below reflects only those programs and educational opportunities provided to students that directly affcct thc capacity of the school buildings. The special programs listed below require classroom space; thus, the permanent capacity of some of the buildings housing these programs has been reduced in order to account for those needs.

However, the state currently funds grades 4 and 5 at27 students per classroom. Room Utilization at Secondary Schools It is not possible to achieve 100% uttlization of regular teaching stations because of scheduling conflicts for student programs, the need for specialized rooms for certain programs, and the need for teachers to have a work space during their planning periods Based on actual utilization due to these considerations, the district uses a standard utilization rate of 83% (5 out of 6 periods) for determining middle school capacity. Beginning in the 2018-19 school year, Mount Si High School is convertingto a7 period schedule. Teachers will only teach 5 of those periods, resulting in an expected room utilization of 71% (5 out of 7). As a result of lower room utilization rates, the average target class size for capacity purposes for Mount Si has also been increased from27 to 30. Adjustments to the class size and classroom utilization rates may occur in future revisions to this plan, based on revisions to the new high school schedule as it is implemented. o\\o hD C!o.Attachmeni E to PO 2019-0416 Section 3. Inventory and Evaluation of Current Permanent Facilities The District's ctt rrent overall capacity for the 2019-20 school year , after consideration for smaller class sizes in grades K-3 is expected to be 8,060 students, comprised of permanent classroom capacity of 6,209 students, and temporary classroom capacity of 1,851 students. October enrollment for the 2018-19 school year was 6,727 Full tirne equivalents (\"FTE\"). FTE enrollment is projected to increase by B% to 7,527 in2024, based on the mid-range of enrollment projections provided by a third-party demographer. Calculations of elementary, middle, and high school capacities have been made in accordance with the current standards of service. Due to changes in instructional programs, shrdent needs (including special education) and other current uses, some changes in building level capacity have occurred at some schools. An inventory of the Districtrs schools arranged by level, irame, and current permanent capacity are summarized in the following fahle. Tn additir:rn, a snmmary of overall capacity and enrollment for the next six years is discussed further in Section 7. The physical condition of the District's facilities was evaluated by the 2012 State Study and Survey of School Facilities completed in accordance with WAC 180-25-025.

Relocatable (Portable) Classrooms For a definition of relocatables and permanent facilities, see Section 2 of King County Code 214.06. The District inventory includes 93 portable classrooms that provide standard capacity and special program space as orrtlined in Section 2. The District inventory of portables provides approximately 23% of capacity Dishict-wide. The rebuild of Mount Si High School and the re-opening of Snoqualmie Middle schools has significantly reduced the percentage of secondary students in portable classrooms. At the elementary level,36% of facility capacity is housed in portable classrooms, which is the equivalent of 2 entire elementary schools. Based on projected enrollment growth and timing of anticipated permanent facilities, the district anticipates the need to acquire additional portables at the elementary level drrring the next six-year period. As enrollment fluctuatcs, portables provide flexibility to accomrnodate irnrnediate needs and interim housing. Because of this, new and modernized school sites are all planned to accommodate the potential of adding portables in order to address temporary fluctuations in enrollment. In addition, the use and need for portables will be balanced against program needs. Portables are not a solution for housing students on a permanent basis, and the District would like to continue to reduce the percentage of sfudents that are housed in portable classrooms. Thc cost of portables also varies widely based on the location, jurisdictional permitting requirements and intended usc of thc classrooms. The District has an additional 15 portable classrooms in its inventory that are used for special program purposcs or districtwide support services and are not available for regular classroom needs.

Six Year Enrollment Projections The District contracts with Educational Data Solutions, LLC ('EDS\") to project student enrollment over the next six years. EDS provides the District a low, middle and high- range projections that are based on historic growth trends, future building plans and availability, birth rates, as well as economic and various other factors that contribute to overall population growth. Based on the mid-range projection provided in November 2018by EDS, enrollment is expected to increase by 529 students (8%) over the next six years. The enrollment projections shown below have been adjusted beginning in 2016 to account for the conversion of half-day kindergarten students to full-day kindergarten students, as required by Washington State Flouse Bill2776, which was enacted in 2010. While this change does not increase the number of students (headcount) projected to attend our District over the next six years, it does increase the need for additional classroom capacity as these students will now be attending our buildings for the full day and will require twice the amount of space as their half-day counterparts. This adjustment results in an increase of approximately 260FTE kindergarteners beginning in 201,6.

The expanded and modernizcd Mount Si High School will facilitate the relocation of the freshman campus onto the main high school campus/ which in turn creates needed middle school capacity by converting the current Freshman Campus back to a middle school (Snoqrralmie Middle School). The bond proposition also did not address the need for expanded field capacity to adequately serve the anticipated larger student body. The District is currently working on land acquisition andf or alternative field solutions in order to address those known capacity needs. The 2015 voter-approved proposition also included funds to construct a new Elementary School #6 (Timber Ridge Elementary). The construction and opening of Timber Ridge in 2016 provides initial capacity at all elementary schools to implement full day kindergartery reduce K-3 class sizes and provide for enrollment growth, as all District elementary schools underwent a re-boundary process in preparation for the opening of Timber Ridge. Elementary capacity calculated in this plan incorporates the lower K-3 class sizes that were fully implemented in 2018. Despite the addition of Timber Ridge and recent additions of portable classrooms, the significant reductions in K-3 class sizes have resulted in most elementary schools currently at capacity. Future enrollment growth, when combined with these reduced class sizes, will require additional future elementary school capacity. Portable classrooms may provide some short-term relief, however the district currently houses the equivalent of nearly 2 elementary schools of classrooms in portables, or approximately one-third of all elementary students. Many of the District's current elementary schools have reached the capacity to add more portable classrooms due to a number of factors, including: land availability, building code restrictions, and capacity of corresponding common areas such as parking, bathrooms, specialist classrooms and building support services. As such, the District anticipates the need for a 7m Elementary School in2023, in order to provide adequate capacity for future enrollment growth.=ilriobo C6o.Attachment E to PO 2019-0416 Also of note, the 2015 bond proposition included consideration for the construction of a separate preschool facility that will serve the growing special education needs of our District. This facility would increase the capacity at the elementary school which currently houses the preschool program, and will allow for expansion of our preschool capacity in response to overall population growth. The timing and location of that facility is current under review, based on a number of changes since the planning of the 2015 bond - primarily, the vast geographic area of the District, combined with the expansion of centralized programs requiring transportation to a central facility in the district. One such example is the STREAM program, which has replaced Hi-C programs in each elementary school with a centralized magnet program currently housed at Snoqualmie Elementary. The transportation requirements of this program/ when combined with the transportation needs of the preschool program are significant. When combined with a growing shortage of available bus drivers, the location and timing of the new preschool facility should be carefully considered. The District also needs to identify additional land to adequately serve enrollment growth. The District's current transportation facility is inadequate for meeting the District's needs. The District has no space at the current facility to park additional busses which are needed to meet the growing student population. In planning for the most recent bond measure, the Board considered adding a new transportation facility to the project list. In an attempt to control the overall cost of the bond proposition, this facility was the first capital improvement left off of the prioritized list of needed improvements recommended by administration. However, at a minimum, additional land must be identified in the near future to meet short term needs, even prior to securing funding for a full-scale transportation facility that will support the future enrollment growth of the district. rnr{ 0)bo6o.Attachment E to PO 2019-0416 Section 7. Six-Y Classroom Capacities: Availa Proiections After considering K-3 class size reductions to quantify current capacity, fufure enrollment projections, and added capacity from construction plans discussed in previous sections above, the following table summarizes permanent and portable projected capacity to serve our students during the periods of this Plan. As demonstrated in the table, the District has continuing permanent capacity needs at ALL levels. Some of those needs were partially addressed with the opening of Elementary #6 (Timbcr Ridgc Elementary School). The expansion of Mount Si High School, when complete, results in significant improvements in permancnt capacity at thc high school and middle school levels. However, given the conversion to full day kindergarten and reduced elementary class sizes required by 2018, combined with ctrrrent enrollment growth from new development, even after opening Timber Ridge, the District will face a need to plan for additional capacity at the K-5 level. Some of those additional capacity needs will need to be addlessed in the short-terrn with portable classrooms. The construction of Elementary #7 wlll address the longer-term capacity needs. As summarized in the table, the District is anticipated to have 23% of its districtwide classroom capacity in portable classrooms for the 2019-20 school year. At the elementary level,36% of the anticipated classroom capacity is in portable classrooms. With the addition of portable classrooms and the construcfion of two new facilities over the period of this Plan, the District would have2L% of its overall classroom capacity in portablc classrooms in2023, assuming older portable classrooms are not removed from service. The addition of Elementary #7 in2023 would reduce tl're overall elementary classroom capacity in portables fuorn36% to30%. The District will continue to work towards reducing the percentage of students housed in portable classrooms, while also monitoring the future elementary school needs in the district. \\or-i 0)bo(6 o.PLAN Preschool, ES#7 Permanent Capacity subtotal: Projected Enrollment: Surplus/(Defi cit) of Permanent Gapacity: Portable Capacity Available: Portable Capacity Changes (+/-): Surptus/{Deficit} with PortablesAttachment E to PO 2019-0416 PROJECTED CAPACITY TO HOUSE STUDENTS Elemen School K-5 Middle School 6-8 Hh School 9-12 K-12 TOTAL * PIan Years are calendar years; projected enrollment listed above represents fall enrollment of that year *- Beginning in school year 201 B-19, high school capacity has been adjusted to reflect anticipated daily schedule changes.

Imoact and the Finance Plan The school impact fee formula ensures that new development only pays for a portion of the cost of the facilities necessitated by new development. The following impact fee calculations examine the costs of housing the students generated by each new single family dwelling unit and each new multi-family dwelling unit. These are determined using student generation factors, which indicate the number of sfudents that each dwelling prodrtces hased on recent historical data. The student generation factor is applied to the anticipated school construction costs (construction cost only, not total project cost), which is intended to calculate the construction cost of providing capacity to serve each new dwclling unit during the six year period of this Plan. The formula does not require new development to contribute the costs of providing capacity to address needs created by existing housing units. The construction cost, as described above, is reduced by any State matching dollars anticipated to be awarded to the District, and the present value of future tax payments related to the debt service on school construction bonds. This adjusted conshuction cost quantifies the cost of additional capacity per new residence during the six year period of this Plan. However, in accordance with the regulations of King County and the cities of Sammamish, Snoqualmie and North Bend, the local communi$r must share 50% of each cost per new residence. As such, the final impact fee proposed by the District to its respective municipalities for collection reflects this addifional required reduction to the cost per new residence. The finance plan below demonstrates how the Snoqrralmie Valley School District plans to linance improvements for the years 2019 through2024. The financing components are primarily composed of secured funding (via the recently approved bond proposition). The District currently owns land in Snoqualmie or North Bend for a new elementary school #7. The District must also plan for additional land and facilities to meet identified transportation facility needs. Future updates to this Plan will include updated information regarding these capacity-related projects and their associated construction costs. For the purposes of this Plan's construction costs, the District is using actual and construction bid amounts for the Mount Si High School project and actual costs of recent portable acquisitions and the construction of Timber Ridge. These costs include an adjustment for expected cost escalation through the anticipated bid year of each anticipated project. The District has also updated State match availability estimates from OSPI. A district can be eligible for potential State matching funds for 1) new constructiorg and 2) modernization/new-in-lieu construction. The calculation for matching funds are grouped and calculated as K-B and 9-12 capacity. For purposes of the impact fee calculation, only new construction matching funds are applicable. Timber Ridge Elementary qualified for new construction state matching funds. Mount Si High School expansion and rebuild project is anticipated to qualify for modernization matching funds for most of the existing square footage of the building.@r{ 0)ho CcAttachment E to PO 2019-0416 Based on the most recent OSPI estimates using the 2024 enrollment projections, the District would not qualify for State matching funds for the new construction of Elementary #7. The OSPI calculation is based on K-B capacity. When the current Freshman Campus is converted back to a middle school, that building is added to the overall K-8 capacity and currently would prevent the District from qualifying for K-8 state matching funds for new construction. 2019 FINANCING PLAN Fe cllltv:Estlmated Cost M SH S New/Modemi zatio n, La nd Acq ui si tion and F iel d Im prove me nts Preschool Elementary School #7 Portable Classrooms - ES Land Acq ui si tionDev el o pme nt - Tra funds will be hetd and used to offsot ests of unforeseen conditions, unanticipated cost escalation, and/or project change otders, etc. At the completion of consttuction of alt projects in lhe 201 5 Bond Proposition, any unused State Match funds will be used lo pay down principal outstanding on rcmaining debt.

Telephone: (206) 631-7500Attachment F to PO 2019-0416 SECTION ONE: INTRODUCTION Purpose of the Capital Facitrities Plan This Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan has been prepared by the Highline School Districl (the \"District\") as the District's primary facility planning document, in compliance with the requirements of Washington's Growth Management Act (the \"GMA\") and King County Council Code Title 21A. The Plan was prepared using data available in May 2019. The GMA outlines I 3 broad goals inclucling adequate provision of necessary public facilities and services. Schools are among these necessary facilities and services. School districts have adopted capital facilities plans to satisfy the requirements of RCW 36.70A.070 and to identify additional school facilities necessary to meet the educational needs of the growing student populations anticipated in their districts. The Highline School District (the \"District\") has prepared this Capital Facilities Plan (the \"CFP\") to provide King County (the \"County\") and the cities of Burien, Des Moines, Kent, Normandy Park, SeaTac, and Tukwila with a schedule and financing program for capital improvements over the next six years (2019-2024). The District will update this Plan annually and include any necessary changes to the impact fee schedule. Execulive Summary The District experienced steady enrollment increases between 2010 and 2017. However, 2018 cnrollmcnt dccreased from the previous year and January 2019 enrollrnent projections show a continuing decline through 2026 (withenrollment gradually increasing again in that year to 2018 levels). T'he District intends to monitor actual enrollment figures closely in order to determine if the January 2019 enrollment projections hold true or need to be adjusted to refleot actual enrollment figures and updated development data. The District cumently serves an approximate student population of 18,273 (October 1,2018 enrollment) with 18 elementary schools (grades K-6), four middle level schools (grades 7-8), and five high schools (grades 9-12).In addition, the District has altemative programs: Big Picture (MS and HS) at the Manhattan site; CHOICE Academy (MS and I{S) at the Woodside site; New Start (9-12) at the Salmon Creek Site; and Puget Sound Skills Center (\"PSSC\"). The District will reconfigure grade levels in the fall of 2019 when elementary schools will serve grades K-5 and middle schools will serve grades 6-8, Over the last 14 years, the District has embarked on a major capital improvement effort to enhance its facilities to meet current educational and life-safety standards, Since 2002, the District has passed three major capital bonds: one in 2002 for approximately $189,000,000, one in 2006 for approximately $148,000,000, and one in2016 for approximately $299,850,000. The 2002 and 2006 bonds were used for replacement of existing facilities and not to accommodate increased enrollment, The 2016 bonds are earmarked for a combination of improvements to/replacement of existing facilities and the provision of new capacity. With the approved capital bond funds and reimbursements from the Office of the Superintendent-t-Attachment F to PO 2019-0416 of Public Instruction, the State of Washington, the Port of Seattle, the Federal Aviation Administration and private donations for a new Raisbeck Aviation High School, the District has designed, permitted and construoted 13 new elementary schools, 2 new high schools, renovated 3 schools as interim facilities, and renovated portions of Memorial Field and Camp Waskowitz. All of this work has been done since March 2002. The District's 2016 bond proposal was based on the recommendations of a Capital Facilities Advisory Committee (\"CFAC\"), a citizens' committee representing every part the District. The committee met for a year to study the District's facilities needs, review data, such as enrollment projections and building conditions, and analyze various solutions. CFAC developed a long- term facilities plan, which includes the 2016 bond as the first phase of a four-phase plan to meet students' needs over the next 20 years, The 2016 bond projects include new capacity at the elementary and middle school levels to accommodate enrollment needs and the implementation of recent legislation. Specifically, the District is constructing a new l)es Moines Elementary to replace the existing school and increase its student capacity, adding classrooms at existing elementary schools, and building the new Glacier Middle School, The District does not anticipate the need at this time for additional land to accommodate the new schools; however, land will be necessary in the future to support the District's long-range facilities plan and the Educational Strategic Plan. This CFP identifies the current enrollment, the current capacity of each educational facility as well as programmed improvements, and the projected enrollment over the six-year planning period, This CFP does not recommend a schedule of impact fees for new development. However, as noted above, the District intends to closely monitor enrollment patterns and future updates to this CFP may include an impact fee recommendation where supported by projected enrollment increases and related capacity needs, 2SECTION 2 _ STANDARD OF SERWCEAttachment F to PO 2019-0416 King County Code 21,4.06 refers to a \"standard of Service\" that each school district must establish in order to ascettaiu its ovetall uapacity. Schot-rl lacility and student capacity needs are dictated by the types and amounts of space reqnired to accommodate the District's adopted educational program. The educational program standards which typically drive facility space needs include grade configuration, optimum facility size, class size, educational program offerings, classroom utilization and scheduling requiremcnts, and use of relocatable classrooms (portables). District educational program standards may change in the future as a result of changes in the education program, special programs class sizes, grade span contigurations, and use of new technology, as well as other physical aspects of thc school facilitics. In addition, thc Statc Legislature's implementation of requirements for reduced K-3 class size will also impact school capacity and educational program standards. (The District currently offers full-day kindergarlen,) The school capacity inventory will be reviewed periodically and adjusted for any changes to the educational program standards. These changes will also be reflected in f'uture updates of this CFP. The Standard of Service outlined below reflects only those programs and educational opportunities provided to students that directly affect the capacity of school buildings. The special programs listed below require classroom space, thus the permanent capacity of some buildings housing these programs has been reduced.

School facility capacity was inventoried hascd on the space required to accommodate the Distrist's adoptecl educational program standards. See Section Two: Standard of Service, A map showing locations of District facilities is provided in Appendix A. Schools See Section One for a description of the lJistrict's schools and programs. School capacity was determined based on the number of teaching stations (or general classrooms) within ea<;h building and the space requirements of the District's currently adopted cunent educational program and internal targets as reported to the Information and Condition of Schools (ICOS) system with the Office of the Superintendent of Public lnstruction. It is this capacity calculation that is used to establish the District's baseline capacity, and to determine future capacity needs based on projected student enrollment. The school capacity inventory is summarized in Tables 2,3, and4. As the District implements reduced K-3 class sizc requirements and grade reconfiguration, the inventory will reflect adjustments in the standard of service (see Table 7). RelocMable Class rooms (Portables) Relocatable classtooms (portablcs) are used as interim classroom spaoe to house students until funding can be secured to construct permanent classrooms. The District currently uses 52 relocatable classrooms at various school sites throughout the District to provide additional interim general classroom capacity. A typical relocatable classroom can provide capacity for a full-size class of students. Current use of relocatable classrooms throughout the District is summarized in Table 5.SECTION THREE: CAPITAL FACILITIES INVENTORY -5-Attachment F to PO 2019-0416 Table 2 Elementary School Level Inventory * 'l'eaching Station definition: A space designated as a classroom.

In the event that enrollment growth slows, plans for new facilities can be delayed. It is much more difficult, however, to initiate new projects or expedite projects in the event enrollment growth exceeds the projections, With the assistance of a professional demographer, the District has developed its own methodology for forecasting future enrollments. This methodology, a modified cohort survival method, considers a variety of factors to evaluate the potential student population growth for the years 2019 through 2028. These factors include: projected births, projected growth in the K-12 population, atrd a rnodel that considers growth in population and housing within the District's boundaries, The methodology also considers the potential impacts on enrollment in response to the opening of a charter school within the District's boundaries. Certain assumptions are made regarding the continued enrollment at the charter school. Therefore, the methodology and the resulting projections should be considered conservative. District enrollment has increased in recent years, including a 2.02% increase since 2009, but is projected to decline over the six-year planning period before stabilizing and then increasing again thereafter. Using the modified cohort survival projections, the District expects a total enrollment of 1 8,03 1 students in2024 atrcl a total enrollment of 18,41 8 by 2028. See Appendix B (Enrollment prcrjections from Les Kendrick, Jannary 2019). The District intends to closely monitor actual enrollment figures and, as necessary, make adjustments if any of the underlying assumptions change or actual enrollment varies notably from the projections. Futurc updatcs to this CFP will identify any adiustments or changes. Table 6 Proj ected St ude nt E nro llme FUTARE NEEDSAttachment F to PO 2019-0416 Projected future capacity needs, shown in Table 7, are derived by applying the projected number of students to the projected permanent capacity. It is not the District's policy to include relocatable classrooms when determining future capital facility needs; therefore, interim capacity provided by relocatable classrooms is not included in this analysis. The District will utilize relocatables as necessary to address interim capacity needs. Information on relocatable classrooms by grade level and interim capacity can be found in Table 5. Information on planned construction projects can be found in the Financing Plan, Table 8. Recent state-level policy decisions impact the District's capacity analysis. Engrossed Senate House Bill226l, adopted in2009, requires school districts to implement full-day kindergarten by 2019. SLIB 2776, passed in 2010, requires school districts to reduce K-3 class sizes to 17 students per teacher. Finally, in November 2014, the voters passed Initiative 135 l, which requires reduced class sizes across all grades (K-12). The District has proactively implemented full day kindergarten, which reduced the number of available regular classrooms in elementary schools districtwide, Table 7 assumes that K-3 class size reduction is implemented in 2019 and that grade levels are reconfigured to K-5, 6-8, and 9-12 in2019. Table 7 also includes the capacity related projects the District is planning during the six-year planning period. Future updates to this Plan will incorporate any funded implementation of Initiative 1351. -1 0-2019^ 201 8* Table 7 Projected Student Clpncity * 2019 through 2024 Level -- {)otolrpr of new classrooms at existing elementary schools and New Des Moines Elenrentary School opens at the Zenith site with added capacity Mitlclle School Level * Surplus/DeJiciency **Does not include portable capacity ^Movement of 6'h grade to middle school level 'New Glacier Middle School opens Scltool Level -- *Actual October 2018 **Does not include portable capacity. \"llighline High School re-opens with at current site with same Added Permanent Capacity 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total Permanent SECTION SIX: FINANCING PLAN Planned Improvements The Finance Plan focuses on,gqpacit* related projects needed to accommodate recent and projected growth in the District, Pursuant to the Board's approval of the Capital Facilities Advisory Committee's f'rnal recommendations and the voters' approval of the 2016 bond, the District will: (l) add space to the new Des Moines Elementary School (replacement school at the Zenith site), (2) construct new elementary school classrooms at various sites, and (3) construct a new middlle school. All new schools will be located on land currently owned by the District. These projects accommodate recent growth within the District. The District has identified \"non-capacity\" capital needs at existing schools including the replacement of Highline High School and safety/security improvements at various schools. The District is also planning for the replacement of both Evergreen and Tyee High Schools, as well as replacement of Pacific Middle School, as a part of a future planned bond proposal. Financing for Planned Improvements Funding for planned improvements is typically secured from a number of sources including voter- approved bonds, State match funds, and impact fees. Genernl Obligation Bonds: Bonds are typically used to fund construction of new schools and other capital improvement projects, and require a 60Yo voter approval. The District's voters in November 2076 approved by 66.99% a $299.85 million school construction bond to fund the projects identified in this Plan. State School Conslruction Assistance Program Funds.' State School Construction Assistance funds come from the Common School Construction Fund. The State deposits revenue from the sale of renewable resources from State school lands set aside by the Enabling Act of 1889 into the Common School Account. If these sources are insufficient to meet needs, the Legislature can appropriate General Obligation Bond funds or the Superintendent of Public Instruction can prioritize projects for funding. School districts may qualify for State School Construction Assistance funds for specific capital projects based on a prioritizalion system. The District received funding in the amount of $6.27 million from Senate Bill 6080 to address a portion of the classrooms needed for implementation of reduced K-3 class sizes. -12-Attachment F to PO 2019-0416 Impact I'ees: Impact f'ees are a means of supplementing traditional funding sources for construction of public facilities needed to accommodate new development. See Section 7 School Irnpact Fees, l'he District also receives some funding toward school construction from the Port of Seattle/Federal Aviation Administration. This funding applies to the new Des Moines Elementary project and the Highline High School replacement project, The Six-Year Financing Plau shorvn on Table 8 dernonstrates how the District intends to fund nerv construction capacity and improvements to school facilities for the years 2019-2024.The financing components include curuent and future planned bond funding, SCAP funds, Porl/FAA funds, and impact fees.

To be eligible to collect school impact fees for new capacity projects, a district must demonstrate expected grade level enrollment growth over the six-year planning period and a related need for new capacity. As discussed in Section 4 above, after several years of increasing enrollment the District's current enrollment projections show a decline in elementary and middle school enrollment over the six-year planning period, The District plans to monitor actual enrollment in future years and will include updated information in future updates to this CFP. When the District is eligible for impact fees to fund growth-related capacity needs, impact fees are calculated utilizing the formula in the King County Code, The resulting figures are based on the District's cost per dwelling unit to purchase land for school sites, make site improvements, construct schools, and purchase/install relocatable classrooms (portables). As required under the GMA, credits are applied in the formula to account for State Match Funds to be reimbursed to the District and projected firture property taxes to be paid by the dwelling unit. The District's cost per dwelling unit is derived by multiplying the cost per student by the applicable student generation rate per dwelling unit. The student generation rate is the average number of students generated by each housing type; in this case, single family dwellings and multi-family dwellings. The District has developed its own student generation rate data based on actual permit data from local jurisdictions. See Appendix C, The District applies a50% discount rate required by the King County School Impact Fee Ordinance to the fee calculated using the variables and formula described above. King County and the City of Kent currently have adopted school impact fee ordinances and collect school impact fees on behalf of the District when requested. The District has asked the other cities that it serves to consider adoption of a school impact fee ordinance. These requests are necessary as the Distriot anticipates once again establishing eligibility to request school impact fees in the future.

Executive S This Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan (the plan) has been prepared by the Lake Washington School District (the district). It is the organization's primary facility planning docr:ment in compliance with the reqr-rirements of the State of Washington's Growth Management Act and King County Code 21A.43.It is also used as a basis for requesting the collection of school impact fees. This plan was prepared using data available in the spring of 2019. King County was the first jurisdiction in the State of Washington to adopt a Growth Management Act school impact fee ordinance in 1991(wlthfee collection firsL becoming effective in 1992). The King County Council adopted the ordinance, including the school impact fee formula, following a stakeholder process that included representatives from school districts and the development community. The adopted formula requires that the calculated fee be reduced by fifty percent. This discount factor was negotiated as a part of the stakeholder process. Most cities in King County (and in other areas) adopted the King County school impact fcc formula, including the discount factor, in whole as a part of their school impact fee ordinances. In order for school irnpact fees to be collected in the unincorporated areas of King County, the King County Council must adopt this plan. The cities of Redmond, Kirkland and Sammamish have each adopted a school impact fee policy and ordinance similar to the King County model. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act and the local implementing ordinances, this plan will be updated on an annual basis with any changes in the fee schedule adjusted accordingly. See Appendix B for the ctrrrent single-family calculation and Appendix C for the current multi-family calculation. The district's plan establishes a standard of service in order to ascertain current and future capacity. This plan reflects the current student/teacher standard of service ratio and service model for other special programs. Future state funding decisions could have an additional impact on class sizes and facility needs.

Executive Summary (continued) While the State Superintendent of Public Instruction establishes square foot guidelines for funding, those guidelines do not account for the local program needs in the district. The Growth Management Act and King County Code 21,A.43 authorize the district to determine a standard of service based on the district's specific needs. The districtrs current standard provides the following (see Section III for specific information) : Grade LevelTarget Teacher- Student Ratio K-1 20 Students 2-3 23 Students 4-5 27 Students 6-8 30 Students 9-12 32 Students School capacity is based on the district standard of service and the existing inventory of available classrooms, including both permanent and relocatable (portable) classrooms. As shown in Appendix A1 and A2, the district's overall total capacity is 36,252. The total net available capacity is 31\",543 including net permanent capacity of 27,541, and 4,002 in relocatables. Student headcount enrollment as of October 1,2018 was 29,499. The district experienced actual growth of 417 students in 2018. A six-year enrollment projection, as required for this plan, is shown inTable 1. During the six-year window from 20\\9 to 2024, enrollment is projected to increase by 2,746 students to a total of 32,773. Growth is projected at all levels. The Lake Washington School District is the fastest growing school district in King County and one of the fastest growing school districts in the state The district went from being the sixth largest school district in the state to fourth largest in 2015. In201,6, the District became the third largest school district in the state. Enrollment growth has resulted in overcrowding in many district schools. JuneL0,2019 Page 3Lake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 I. Executive Summary (continued) In December 2014, a Long-Term Facilities Planning Task Force, comprised of representatives from each of the district's schools and community members, was convened to develop recommendations on long-term facilities planning. From December 20'1.4to October 2015, this Task Force and a smaller Working Subcommittee met 20 times to learn about and have detailed discussions on topics ranging from construction costs to classroom space usage to facilities funding. In November 2015, the Board of Directors accepted the recommendations of the Task Force. The recommendations provide a 15-year framework to address growing enrollment, provide needed space to reduce class size and reduce the reliance on relocatables. The recommendations prioritize building new schools and enlarging aging schools to address capacity needs. Subsequent to the work of the Task Force, the district proposed a bond measure for Aprii 201.6. Voters approved that bond measure which includes funding for the following projects:. Timberline Middle School, a new midclle school in Redmond Ridge (Site72) with a permanent capacity for 900 students. The school is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019.. Itebuilcling and expanding Juanita High School from a permanent capacity of 1\",325 to 1,829 students (an increase of 504 students). The final phase of this rebuild is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2020.. Rebuilding and expanding Kirk Elementary School for a permanent capacity of 690 students (an increase of 299). The school is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019.. Rebuilding and expanding Mead Elementary School for a capacity of 690 students (an increase of 230). The school is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019.. Remodeling Old Redmond School House for preschool classrooms. The building is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020.. Clara Barton Elementary School, a new elementary school in North Redmond (Site 28) with a permanent capacity of 690 students. The school is complete and opened in the fall of 2018. Ella Baker Elementary School, a new elementary school in Redmond Ridge East (Site 31) with a permanent capacity of 690 students. This school is complete and opened in the fall of 2018. lune 10, 2019 Page 4Lake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 I. Executive Summary (continued) Rebuilding Explorer Community Elementary School. The school is complete and opened in the fall of 2017.a In addition, within the six-year window of this plan, the framework of the long term plan included a bond measure proposed for 2018. The following projects were presented to District voters in February 2018: . A new elementary school in the Lake Washington Learning Community. An addition at Lake Washington High School . Rebuild and enlarge Alcott Elementary School . Rebuild and enlarge Kamiakin Middle School o A Choice high school in Sammamish . Property for new schools The February 2018 bond measure did not receive a sufficient majority to pass. However, the need for these projects still remains. Therefore, projects are presented in this report as occurring within the six-year window of the Lake Washington School District 2019-2024 Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan on a revised timeline. In April 2019, voters approved a six-year Capital Project Levy measure which incorporated two projects from the 2018 bond as well as additional projects needed to provide for critical capacity needs.Voters approved the Levy measure which included funding for the following projects: e A 20 classroom addition to Lake Washington High School (Site 84) which will increase permanent capacity by 500. The addition is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020. . An eight classroom addition to Franklin Elementary School (Site 16) which will increase permanent capacity by 184. The addition is scheduled to open in the fall of 2021.. . An eight classroom addition to Rose Hill Elementary School (Site 15) which will increase permanent capacity by 184.

June 10, 2019 Page 6Lake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 Six-Year Enrollment Prection and LoTerm Six-Year Enrollment Proi ection The district developed long-term enrollment projections to assess facility capacity needs. Based on these projections the district expects enrollment to increase by over 2,746 students from the20!9 school year through2024. The district experienced actual growth of 417 students in 2018. A six-year enrollment projection, as required for this plan, is shown inTable 1. During the six-year window from 2019 to 2024, enrollment is projected to increase by 2,746 students resulting in a9.2% increase over the current student population. Growth is expected to impact all levels. Student enrollment projections have been developed using two methods: (1) cohort suraiual - which applies historical enrollment trends to the classes of existing students progressing through the system; and (2) deaelopment tracking - which projects students anticipated from new development. The cohort survival method was used to determine base enrollments. Development tracking uses information on known and anticipated housing development. This method allows the district to more accurately project student enrollment resulting of new development by school attendance area. Cohort Survival King County live birth data is used to predict future kindergarten enrollment. Actual King County live births through 2017 are used to project kindergarten enrollment through the2022-2023 school year. After 2023, the number of live births is based on King County projections. Historical data is used to estimate the future number of kindergarten students that will generate from county births. For other grade levels, cohort survival trends compare students in a particular grade in one year to the same group of students in prior years. From this analysis a cohort survival trend is determined. This trend shows if the cohort of students is increasing or decreasing in size. This historical trend can then be applied to predict future enrollment. June 10,2019 PageTLake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 il. Six-Year Enrollment Projection and Long Term Planning (continued) Development Tr In order to ensure the accuracy and validity of enrollment projections, a major emphasis has been placed on the collection and tracking of data of 86 known new housing developments within the district. This information is obtained from the cities and county and provides the foundation for a database of known future developments, as well as city and county housing growth targets. This assures the district's plan is consistent with the comprehensive plans of the local permitting jurisdictions. Contact is made with each deveioper annually to determine the nurnber of homes to be built and the anticipated development schedule. StudentGeneration Rates Developments that are near completion, or have been completed, within the last five years are used to forecast the number of students generated by new development. District wide statistics show that each new single- family home currently generates a0.436 elementary student, 0.182 middle school student, and 0.159 senior high student, for a total of 0.777 school- age child per single family home (see AppendixB). New multi-famity housing units currently generate an average of 0.082 elementary student, 0.032 middle school student, and 0.025 senior high student for a total of 0.139 school age child per multi-family home (see Appendix C). Since 2018 the student generation numbers have increased for single-family developments and for multi-family units. These student generation factors (see Appendix D) are used to forecast the number of students expected from the new developments that are planned over the next six years. Enrollment Proiection Scenarios The district works with a demographer, to review enrollment and projection methodology. The district projections along with a high, medium, and low projection are shown inTable 1. King County Code 2LA.06 refers to a \"standard of service\" that each school district must establiEh in order to ascertain its overall capacity. The standard of service identifies the program year, the class size, the number of classrooms, students and programs of special need, and other factors determined by June 10, 2019 Page 8Lake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 201 9-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019-2024 III. Current District \"Standard of Service\" the district, which would best serve the student population. Relocatables (i.e. portable classroom units) may be included in the capacity calculation using the same standards of service as permanent facilities. The standard of service outlined below reflects oniy those programs and educational opportunities provided to students that directly affect the capacity of the school buildings. The special programs listed below require classroom space and as a result reduce the total permanent capacity of the buildings that house them. Newer buildings have been constructed to accommodate some of these programs. Older buildings require additional reduction of capacity to accommodate these programs. At both the elementary and secondary levels, the district considers the ability of students to attend neighborhood schools to be a component of the standard of service. The district's standard of service, for capital planning purposes, and the projects identified in this plan, include space needed to serve students in All Day Kindergarten. Beginning in the2016-2017 schoolyear, the State funded All Day Kindergarten for all students. Standard of Service forElementarv Students School capacity at elementary schools is calculated on an average class size in grades K-5 of 23;based on the following student/teacher staffing ratios: Grades2-3@23:'J.. 4-5@27:']..

Current District \"Standard of Service\" (continued) need for specialized rooms for certain programs, and the need for teachers to have a work space during their planning periods. The district has determined a standardutilization rate of 70% for non- rebuilt secondary schools. For secondary schools that have been rebuilt, rebuilt and enlarged, or have been remodeled to accommodate teacher planning spaces, the standard utilization rate is 83%. June 10,2019 Page L1Lake Washington School DishictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 IV and Evaluation of Current Facilities As of May,2019, the district has total classrooms of 1,507, including 1,338 permanent classrooms and 1,69 relocatable classrooms (see Appendix A-1), These classrooms represent a theoretical capacity to serve 35,252if all classroorns were only used as general classroom spaces. However, the district's standard of service provides for the use of classrooms for special programs, such as Special Education, English Language Learners and Safety Net programs. These programs serve students at much lower student to teacher ratios than general education classrooms or serve the sanre students for a portion of the day when they are pulled out of the regular classroom. As a result, the net capacity of these schooi buildings is adjusted. A total of 221 classroom spaces are used for special programs as shown in Appendix A-2. The remaining classrooms establish the net available capacity for general education purposes and represent the district's ability to house projected student enrollment based on the Standard of Service defined in Section III, Current District Standard of Service. After providing space for special programs the district has a net available classroom capacity to serve 3I,543 students. This inclu des 27 ,06I in permanent regular education capacity,480 for self-contained program capacity and 4,002in relocatable (portable) capacity. Enrollment in 2018 was 29,987 and is expected to increase to 32,733 in2024 (see Table 1). The physical condition of the district's facilities is documented in the 2017 State Study and Survey of School Facilities completed in accordance with WAC 392-341-025. As schools are modernized or replaced, the State Study and Survey of School Facilities report is updated. That report is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, every district facility (permanent and relocatable) is annually evaluated as to condition in accordance with the State Asset Preservation Program.

Six-Year and Construction Plan Enrollment projections show that enrollment will increase at all grade spans. Based on the enrollment projections contained in Table 5, student enrollment is anticipated to reach 32,733by 2024. The district current inventory of existing net permanent capacity is 27,541.. To address existing and future capacity needs, the district contemplates using the following strategies: e Construction of new schools . Additions for existing schools . Rebuilding and enlarging existing schools . Use of relocatables as needed . Boundary adjustments Construction of new capacity in one area of the district could indirectly create available capacity at existing schools in other areas of the district through area specific boundary adjustments. Future updates to this plan will include specific information regarding adopted strategies. Strategies to address capacity needs employed over the prior six-year planning timeline (2013-2018) included: Phase II School Modernization (2006-2013) was funded by the voters in February 2006. The approved bond measure funded the modernizationf replacement of 11\" schools throughout the district. School modernizationf replacement projects included the addition of new student permanent capacity, as needed. The Phase II School Modernization projects, within the last six years, included: o Bell, Rush, and Community Elementary Schools; Rose Hill Middle School; and International Community School opened in the faIl2013 Two boundary adjustments were completed: (1) Because of overcrowding at Einstein and Rockwell Elementary Schools a temporary boundary adjustment was conducted to move unoccupied new developments from those schools to Mann Elementary; and, (2) District-wide boundary adjustments were identified in2014 for implementation in the fall of 201.5.a June 10,2019 Page 13Lake Washington School DistrictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2024 V.

These were placed at various schools throughout the district o Six at Lake Washing[on High School (Iftkland)o Four at Redmond Elementary School (Redmond)o Three at Alcott Elementary School (King County) o Three at Rush Elementary School (Redmond) o Two at Evergreen Middle School (King County)o One at Audubon Elementary School (Redmond)o One at Franklin Elementary School (Kirkland)o One at Frost Elementary School (Kirkland) o One at Redmond Middle School (Redmond) The district added another eight relocatables to schools in the summer of 20'1,6. o Four at Lake Washington High School (Kirkland) o Two at Evergreen Middle School (King County)o One at Alcott Elementary School (King County) o One at Keller Elementary School (Kirkland) In the summer of 2018, the District added 10 relocatables.o Two at Lakeview Elementary School (Kirkland)o Two at Muir Elementary School (Kirkland) June 10, 2019 Page 16Lake Washington School DishictAttachment G to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 201\"9-2024 VI. Relocatable and Transitional Classrooms (continued) ao Two at Rose Hill Elementary School (Kirkland) o Three at Twain Elementary School (Kirkiand) o One at Rush Elementary School (Redmond) From 2019-2020 the District plans to add 10 relocatables to schools in the Juanita area. The district's long term plan anticipates providing new and expanded permanent facilities to serve student enrollment. When these permanent facilities are funded and completed, the district may be able to reduce the reliance on relocatables. For a definition of relocatables and permanent facilities, see Section 2 of King County Code 214.06. As enrollment fluctuates, relocatables provide flexibility to accommodate immediate needs and interim housing. Because of this, new school and rebuilt/enlarged school sites are planned for the potential of adding up to four relocatables to accommodate the changes in demographics. The use and need for relocatable classrooms will be balanced against program needs.

Current enrollment at each grade level is identified in Appendix A-2. Completed projects, as shown in Table 5, would result in an increased permanent capacity lor 4,113 students in2024. Relocatable facilities will be used to address capacity needs that cannot be immediately served by permanent capacity. Differing growth patterns throughout the district may cause some communities to experience overcrowding. This is especially true in portions of the district where significant housing development has taken place. A strong residential building market, growth, and the number of developments under construction continues to increase. The continued development of north and northwest Redmond, the Sammamish Plateau, the downtown and Totem Lake areas of Kirkland, and in-fill and short plats in multiple municipalities will put additional pressure on schools irr those areas.

The formula multiplies the per student costs of site acquisition and construction costs for new capacity projects by a student generation rate to identify the share per dwelling unit share of the facilities that are needed to serve new growth. (The student generation rate is the average number of students generated by dwelling unit type - new single family and multi-family dwelling units.) The formula then provides a credit against the calculated costs per dwelling unit for any School Construction Assistance Program funding that the District expects to receive for a new capacity project from the State of Washington and for the estimated taxes that a new homeowner will pay toward the debt service on school construction bonds. The calculated fee (see Appendix B and Appendix C) is then discounted, as required by ordinance, by fifty percent. For the purposes of this plan and the impact fee calculations, the actual construction cost data from recently completed projects (Sandburg Elementary School, opened in2012; Rose Hill Middle School, opened in 2013; and Lake Washington High School, opened in 2011) have been used (see Appendix E). The finance plan shown onTable 6 demonstrates how the Lake Washington School District plans to finance improvements for the years 2019 through2024. The financing components include secured and unsecured funding. This plan is based on current and future project approval, securing state construction assistance, and collection of impact fees under the state's Growth Management Act.

This annual Plan update was prepared using data available in the spring of 2Ot9 for the 2O1,9-2O2O school year. This Plan is consistent with prior long-term capital facilities plans adopted by the Kent School District. This Plan is not intended to be the sole planning document for all of the District's needs. The District may prepare interim and periodic Long-Range Capital Facilities Plans consistent with Board Policies, taking into account a longer or shorter time period, other factors and trends in the use of facilities, and other needs of the District as may be required. Prior Capital Facilities Plans of the Kent School District have been adopted by Metropolitan King County Council and Cities of Kent, Covington, Auburn and Renton and included in the Capital Facilities Plan element of the Comprehensive Plans of each jurisdiction. This Plan has also been submitted to cities of Black Diamond, Maple Valley, and SeaTac for their information and inclusion in their Comprehensive Plans. ln o,rder for impact fees to be collected in the unincorporated areas of Kent School District, the Metropolitan King County Council must adopt this Plan and a fee- implementing ordinance for the District. For impact fees to be collected in the incorporated portions of the District, the cities of Kent, Covington, Renton and Auburn must also adopt this Plan and their own school impact fee ordinances. This Capital Facilities Plan establishes a standard of service in order to ascertain current and future capacity. While the State Superintendent of Public lnstruction establishes square footage guidelines for capacity, those guidelines do not account for local program needs in the District. The Growth Management Act, King County and City codes and ordinances authorize the District to make adjustments to the standard of service based on specific needs for students of the District. This Plan includes the standard of service as established by Kent School District. Program capacity is based on an average capacity and updated to reflect changes to special programs served in each building. Portables in the capacity calculation use the same standard of service as the permanent facilities. Kent School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 Page 3 of 17Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 The capacity of each school in the District is calculated based on the District's standard of service and the existing inventory of permanent facilities. The District's program capacity of permanent facilities reflects program changes and the state's mandated reduction of class size to meet the standard of service for Kent School District. Portables provide additional transitiona I capacity. Kent School District is the fifth largest (FTE basis) district in the state. Enrollment is electronically reported monthly to the Office of the Superintendent of Public lnstruction (\"OSPl\") on Form P-223. Although funding apportionment is based on Annual Average Full Time Equivalent (AAFTE), enrollment on October L is a widely recognized \"snapshot in time\" that is used to report the District's enrollment for the year as reported to OSPI. The District received authorization from the Office of Superintendent of Public lnstruction to temporarily re-open the former Kent Elementary School at 317 Fourth Avenue South in Kent. This facility is used to house the kindergarten and early child education classes for both Kent and Neely-O'Brien Elementary Schools to alleviate overcrowding at those schools, This building re-opened in fall 2014 as the Kent Valley Early Learning Center. The District's standard of service, enrollment history and projections, and use of transitional facilities are reviewed in detail in various sections of this Plan. The District plans to continue to satisfy concurrency requirements through the transitional use of portables. A financing plan is includcd in Scction Vlll which demonstrates the District's ability to implement this Plan. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act, this Plan will be updated annually with changes in the impact fee schedules adjusted accordingly. ll - Six - Year Enrollment Projection For capital facilities planning, enrollment growth projections are based on cohort survival and student yield from documented residential construction projected over the next six years. (SeeTable 2, pageT and mop poge 37). The student generation factor is the basis for the growth projections from new developments. (See page 5) King County live births and the District's relational percentage average were used to determine the number of kindergartners entering the system. (See Tobte 1, poge 6) 8.tg% of 25,O32 King County live births in 2O1,4 is projected for 1,965 students expected in Kindergarten for October 1-,2019. This is an increase of 402live births in King County over the previous year. (See Table 2, page 7) Kent School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 Page 4 ol 17Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 Early Childhood Education students (also identified as \"ECE\"), \"Early Childhood Special Education (\"ECSE\") students are forecast and reported to OSPI separately on Form P-223H for Special Education Enrollment. Capacity is reserved to serve students in the ECE programs at elementary schools. The first grade population of Kent School District is traditionally I-3% larger than the kindergarten population due to growth and transfers to the District. Cohort survival method uses historical enrollment data to forecast the number of students projected for the following year. Projections for October 1,201,9-2024 are from OSPI Report 1049 - Determination of Projected Enrollments, Within practical limits, the District has kept abreast of proposed developments. The District will continue to track new development activity to determine impact to schools. lnformation on new residential developments and the completion of these proposed developments in all jurisdictions will be considered in the District's future analysis of growth projections. (see mop page 36) The Kent School District serves eight permitting jurisdictions: unincorporated King County, the cities of Kent, Covington, Renton, and Auburn and smaller portions of the cities of SeaTac, Black Diamond, and Maple Valley. STUDENT GEN ERATION FACTOR \"student Factor\" is defined by King County code as \"the number derived by a school district to describe how many students of each grade span are expected to be generated by a dwelling unit\" based on district records of average actual student generated rates for developments completed within the last ten years. Following these guidelines, the student generation rate for Kent School District is as follows: Single Family Multi-FamilyElementary Middle School Senior High Total Elementary Middle School Senior High Total.398 .096 .185 .679 .II7 .028 .o29 .t74 Kent School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 Page 5 of 17Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 The student generation factor is based on a survey of 2,757 single-family dwelling units and 1,831 multi-family dwelling units with no adjustment for occupancy rates. Please refer to Appendix D on Page 34 of the Capital Facilities Plan for details of the Student Generation Factor survey. ln preparing the 201.8-2019 to 2024-2025 Capital Facilities Plan the District contracted with Davis Demographics and Planning (DDP) of Riverside California, a noted expert in demographic studies for school districts, to analyze and prepare the student generation factor. DDP used a larger sample of single family residences than the district did in previous plans and included both \"garden\" and \"urban style\" apartments in the calculation for multi-family residences. Urban style apartments typically have four stories, a central lobby and entrance, elevator access to all floors and have a central corridor with apartments on each side. These apartments have little or no surface street parking, with parking located beneath the building; retail may or may not be included with the building. lf there is retail it will generally be located on the first floor. These apartments seldom have swimming pools and do not have playgrounds for children. Garden style apartments will have very little studio apartments and will have more three bedrootrt apartntents then Lhe urban style and in theory generate more students enrolled in schr.rr..rl. Tlrese apartments will also have lawns, club houses, swlmmlng pools and places for children to play. The District felt that it is important to include both styles of apartments for the student generation factor. Though it is anticipated that few studcnts will comc from thc urban style, they are now part of the mix in Kent and thus should be included in mix of multi- family housing units. Within the district's borders there are several low-income and multi-family housing projects coming on-line during 2O1,9-2O2O. Once developed with occupancy occurring the District does recognize that the student generation for multi-family housing will likely increase for future Capital Facilities Plan updates. lll - Current Kent School District \"standard of Service\" ln order to determine the capacity of facilities in a school district, King County Code 21.A.06 references a \"standard of service\" that each school district must establish in order to ascertain its overall capacity. The standard of service identifies the program year, the class size, the number of classrooms, students and programs of special need, and other factors determined by the district which would best serve the student population.

The District has identified schools with significant special needs programs as \"impact\" schools and the standard of service targets a lower class size at those facilities. Portables included in the capacity calculation use the same standard of service as the permanent facilities. (See Appendix A, B & C) The standard of service defined herein will continue to evolve in the future. Kent School District is continuing a long-term strategic planning process combined with review of changes to capacity and standard of service. This process will affect various aspects of the District's standard of service and future changes will be reflected in future capital facilities plans. Current Standqrds of Service for Elementdry Students Class size for Kindergarten is planned for an average of 17 or fewer students. Class size for grades 1 - 3 is planned for an average of 23 or fewer students. Class size for grades 4 - 6 is planned for an average of 27 or fewer students. The class size ratio for Kindergarten-3'd grade is 23 students with a class cap of 26, per the negotiated collective bargaining agreement with KEA. Beginning in I9-2O, K-3 class size is calculated for a ratio of t:t7, after considering all allowable FTE per the RCW. Beginning in the 2015-2016, the state has a funded a lower class size in 14 elementary schools that were classified as high poverty. Currently, the state now funds a class size of t7 to t in all schools for grades K - 3. Compliance with this new state class size funding requirement has been delayed to the 2Ot9-20 school year, the district is exploring options to staff grades K - 3 at or near the 17 to L level. Some special programs require specialized classroom space and the program capacity of some of the buildings housing these programs is reduced. Some students, for example, leave their regular classroom for a short period of time to receive instruction in special programs and space must be allocated to serve these programs. Students may also be provided music instruction and physical education in a separate classroom or facility. Some identified students will also be provided educational opportunities in classrooms for special programs such as those designated as follows: English Learners (EL) Education for Disadvantaged Students (Title l)- Federal Program Learning Assisted Programs (LAP) - State Program Highly Capable Students - State Program Kent School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 PageT of 77Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 Reading, math or science Labs Dual Language Programs in three elementary schools lnclusive Education Service for Elementary and Secondary students with disabilities may be provided in a separate or self-contained classroom sometimes with a capacity of L0- L5 depending on the program: .

When programs change, program capacity is updatcd to rcflcct thc changc in program and capacity. Current District Stundords ol Service for Secondory Students The standards of service outlined below reflect only those programs and educational opportunitics providcd to secondary students which directly affect the capacity of the school buildings. The average class size for grades 7-8 is 30 students per class with a cap per teacher of 150 students. The average class size for grades 9-12 is 32 students per class with a cap per teacher of 160 students. Similar to lnclusive Education Programs listed above, many other secondary programs require specialized classroom space which can reduce the program capacity of the permanent school buildings. ldentified secondary students will also be provided other educational opportunities in classrooms for programs designated as follows: o Computer, Multi-Media & Technology Labs & Programs.

Program capacity at elementary schools reflects 100% utilization at the elementary level. lV - lnventory and Capacity of Existing Schools Currently, the District has permanent program capacity to house 27,255 students and transitional (portable) capacity to house 2,085. This capacity is based on the District's Standard of Service as set forth in Section lll. lncluded in this Plan is an inventory of the District's schools by type, address and current capacity. (See Toble j on Poge 1.1). The ratio between permanent capacity and portable capacity is 94.9%-5.I%.

Program capacity has been updated in this Plan to reflect program changes implemented in the Fall of 2018. Calculation of Elementary, Middle School and Senior High School capacities are set forth in Appendices A, B, and C. Maps of existing schools are included on pages I2-I4. For clarification, the following is a brief description of some of the non-traditional programs for students in Kent School District: Kent Mountain View Academy serves Grades 3 - 12 with transition, choice, and home school assistance programs. This school was originally designed as an elementary school and is included in the elementary capacity for this Plan. Kent Phoenix Academy is a non-traditional high school opened in fall 2007. Kent Phoenix Academy has four special programs including the Performance Learning Center, Gateway, Virtual High School, and Kent Success. Both the Kent Mountain View Academy and the Kent Phoenix Academy will be sharing the building that formerly served Sequoia Middle School beginning the schoolyear 2019- 2020. The Kent Mountain View Academy site will be the location of the New Valley Elementary School. iGrad - Kent School District has pioneered the lndividualized Graduation and Degree Program or \"iGrad\". iGrad offers a second chance to students age t6-2t who have dropped out of high school and want to earn a high school diploma. iGrad is not included in this Capital Facilities Plan because it is served in leased space at the Kent Hill Plaza Shopping Center. Over the past three years, enrollment in the iGrad program has averaged over 300 students. V - Six-Year Planning and Construction Plan ln November 2017, the voters of the Kent School District approved a bond measure for SZsZ million. This new bonding authority provides for a replacement for Covington Elementary school, which opened in August of 201,8, a new elementary school in the Kent Valley (site will be the current Kent Mountain View Academy), and the twenty additional classrooms project redirected by the Kent School Board to build a Kent Academy Facility housing multiple academy programs in our district.

This map has been modified by KSDAttachment H to PO 2019-0416 At the time of preparation of this Plan in spring 20L9, the following projects to increase capacity are either in the planning phase or will start in spring 2019. Planning is in progress for an additional elementary school in the Kent Valley in 2020 or beyond, The project will be funded with bond funds and impact fees. Planning is in progress to add an Academy Facility at the Old Panther Lake Elementary Site in Kent in order to free up space at the former Sequoyah Middle School for additional classroom space if needed and/or to bring another middle school online in the near future. Some funding for lease or purchase of additional portables may be provided by impact fees as needed. Sites are based on need for additional capacity.a a a As a critical component of capital facilities planning, county and city planners and decision-makers are encouraged to consider safe walking conditions for all students when reviewing applications and design plans for new roads and developments. This should include sidewalks for pedestrian safetyto and from school and bus stops as well as bus pull-outs and turn-arounds. lncluded in this Plan is an inventory of potential projects and sites identified by the District which are potentially acceptable site alternatives in the futurQ. (seerobtetonpose16&sitemopon Poge 17). Voter approved bond issues have included funding for the purchase of sites for some of these and future schools, and the sites acquired to date are included in this Plan. Some funding is secured for purchase of additional sites but some may be funded with impact fees as needed. Not all undeveloped properties meet current school construction requirements and some property may be traded or sold to meet future facility needs. The Board of Directors has started the process to sell surplus property in the spring of 2015. The Board will continue an annual review of standards of service and those decisions will be reflected in each update of the Capital Facilities Plan. Anticipated zOLg - 2020 plan revisions The 2019 Capital Facilities Plan as submitted represents the final year of a series of one- year technical updates to the original Plan. However, the 2019-2020 school year represents a turning point for capital facilities planning in the district, and an opportunity to establish a fundamentally new four-year plan moving forward. This is necessitated by a few factors. The district will bring another school on-line (at the site of the former Kent Mountainview Academy) as early as the summer of 2020 and will simultaneously initiate the process of exploring a redrawing of its district boundary map. The district will also Kent School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 Page 11 of 17Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 initiate an in-depth study of long-range enrollment projections, and contract for a new analysis of student generation rates. The intent of this process will be to do a new \"level- set\" of the district's Capital Facilities Plan, and to engage our community in anticipating the associated needs for the next 4-6 years moving forward. This process will culminate with an opportunity to rethink our district philosophy on impact fees, which for the last several years have been updated annually for irrflatiorr. Vl - Portable Classrooms The Plan references use of portables as interim or transitional capacity and facilities. Currently, the District utilizes portables to house students in excess of permanent capacity and for program purposes at some school locations. (pleose see Appendices A, B, c) Based on enrollment projections, implementation of full day kindergarten programs, lower state mandated class sizes, program capacity, and the need for additional permanent capacity, the District anticipates the need to purchase or lease additional porl\"ables during the next six-year period. During the time period covered by this Plan, the District does not anticipate that all of the District's portables will be replaced by permanent facilities. During the useful lite of some of the portables, the school-age population may decline in some communities and increase in others, and these portables provide the flexibility to accommodate the immediate needs of the community. Portables may be used as interim or transitional facilities t. To prevent overbuilding or overcrowding of permanent school facilities. 2. To cover the gap between the times of demand for increased capacity and completion of permanent schoolfacilities to meet that demand. 3. To meet unique program requirements. Portables currently in the District's inventory are continually evaluated resulting in some being improved and some replaced. The Plan projects that the District will use portables to accommodate interim housing needs for the next six years and beyond. The use of portables, their impacts on permanent facilities, life cycle and operational costs, and the interrelationship between portables, emerging technologies, and educational restructuring will continue to be examined.

Kent School District continues to be the fifth largest district (both FTE and headcount basis) in the state of Washington. The P-223 Headcount for October 2017 was 26,523 with kindergarten students counted at 1.0 and excluding ECSE and college-only Running Start students. A full headcount of all students enrolled in October 2017 totals 28,192, which included ECSE and college-only Running Start students. ln October 2018, there were 1,LL8 students in LLth and 12th grade participating in the Running Start program at different colleges and receiving credits toward both high school and college graduation. Of these students, 593 attended classes only at the college (\"college-only\") and are excluded from FTE and headcount for capacity and enrollment comparisons. Kent School District has one of the highest Running Start program participation rates in the state.

This does not mean that some schools will not experience overcrowding. There may be a need for additional portables andlor new schools to accommodate growth within the District. New schools may be designed to accommodate placement of future portables. School attendance area changes, limited and costly movement of portables, zoning changes, market conditions, and educational restructuring will all play a major role in addressing overcrowding and underutilization of facilities in different parts of the District. Vlll - Finance Plan Kent School Dlstrict Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan May 2019 Page 13 of 17Attachment H to PO 2019-0416 The finance plan shown on Toble 6 demonstrates how the Kent School District plans to finance improvements for the years 2019-2020 through 2023-2024. The financing components include secured and unsecured funding and impact fees. The plan is based on future bond issues, state school construction assistance, collection of impact fees under the State Growth Management Act and voluntary mitigation fees paid pursuant to State Environmental Policy Act. The plan also includes an additional elementary school in the Kent Valley which has been determined to be located at the current site of the Kent Mountain View Academy on Military Road in SeaTac. l(ent Mountain View Academy will share space at the current Kcnt Phoenix Academy (located at the former Sequoyah Middle School) starting the 2019- 2020 school year. This new school will increase the capacity at the elementary level by 700 students. Some impact fees are scheduled to be part of the overallfinance plan. ln November 2Ot6, the District held a special election to approve the authorization of 5252,000,000 in bonding authority. The projects described above are part of this authorization. The first series of bonds ($gO million) were issued in February 20L7, which will fund the New Valley Elementary School and the New Academy Facility, as well as other infrastructure projects. lmpoct fees will be used ot both projects due to escolation in construction pricing ocross the pacific northwest. The Finance Plan includes new portables to be purchased or leased to provide additional capacity and sorure may be funded from impact fees. Enrollment projections reflect future need for additional capacity at the elementary level and unfunded facility needs will be reviewed in the future and reported in annual updates of the Capital Facilities Plan. No impact fees are requested for secondary schools in this Plan. For the Six-Year Finance Plan, costs of future schools are based on estimates from Kent School District Facilities Department.

The primary changes from the May 2018 Plan are summarized here. Changes to capacity continue to reflect fluctuations in class size as well as program changes. Changes in portables or transitional capacity reflect use, lease or purchase, sale, surplus andlor movement between facilities. The student headcount enrollment forecast is updated annually. All Elementary schools now have Full Day Kindergarten so six-year Kindergarten projections were previously modified to meet the requirements for Full Day Kindergarten programs at all elementary schools. The district expects to receive some State Funding Assistance (formerly called \"state matching funds\") for projects in this Plan and tax credit factors are updated annually. Unfunded site and facility needs will be reviewed in the future. The impact fees for 2019 will increase by the percentage increase of the consumer price index for the Seattle metropolitan area in. For 2018, the increase was 2.9%o. For single- family residences, the fee will increase by Srsz to $5,554. The impact fee for multi- family units will increase by S0A to 52,345.

INTRODUCTION Purpose of the Capital Facilities Plan The Washington State Growth Management Act outlines thirteen broad goals including the adequate provision of necessary public facilities and services. Public schools are among these necessary facilities and services. Public school districts adopt capital facility plans to satisfy the requirements of RCW 36.704.070 and to identify additional school facilities necessary to meet the educational needs of the growing student populations in their districts. The Northshore School District (District) has prepared this six-year Capital Facilities Plan (CFP) in accordance with the Washington State GroMh Management Act, the Codes of King and Snohomish Counties, and the cities of Bothell, Kenmore, and Woodinville. This CFP is intended to provide these jurisdictions with a description of projected student enrollment and school capacities at established levels of service over the six-year period 2019-2025. lt also provides longer-term enrollment projections. The role of impact fees in funding school construction is addressed in Secfion 9 of this report. The District updates its Capital Facilities Plan on an annual basis and the most recent update was adopted by the Board of Directors in June 2018. The annual update is submitted to King County for its annual review and adoption. Snohomish County updates school district CFP's on a biennial basis - the next scheduled review will be the 2020 CFP update Summary Over the past six years, District enrollment has grown by 2,694 students - averaging 449 new students each year - the equivalent of one average-size new elementary school each year for the last six years. ln the last two years alone, the District grew by 1 ,337 students and projects another I ,232 new students over the next six years. Overall enrollment is tracking a bit above last year's projection and the long range projection models of the last few years, at a time when some neighboring districts are, more recently, experiencing flattening or declining enrollment. This last year, kindergarten and first grade enrollment came in above projection. The District's share of the King County kindergarten population is the largest it has been in over two decades. Similar to the 2018 CFP, there are questions about future growth and whether or not it will continue at a rate at or above projections, or if growth will begin to stabilize. Many of the housing projects in the North end are reaching completion and the pipeline of new single family housing is currently shrinking. There are however, multiple townhome and some multi-family projects that could produce enrollment gains. The District does not have a reliable statistical history with townhome development to NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 20193lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 project student generation rates accurately. At the present time, student generation rates from townhome units more closely resemble student generation rates from apartments and condominiums. Since this type of development is new to this area, and new projects tend to have at least 3-bedrooms, the District is very closely monitoring the actual student generation within each service area. There are 2,493 active multi-family units, including townhomes in the pipeline as compared to 1,631 active single family units. As long as these units sell and become occupied in the next few years, we anticipate growth at or above mid-range projections. Very few of the townhomes or multi-family developments are studio or 1-bedroom units and most boast at least 3-bedrooms. The sale of new homes in the District in both 2016 and 2017 were the highest totals experienced since 2007. ln 2017-2018, the District grew at a faster rate than the rest of King County, increasing its share of the K-12 population from 7 .5o/o to 7 1% - for the first time in six years. Continued growth in elementary enrollment has resulted in capacity deficits at most schools in the northern and central service areas of the District. Approval by the community of a 2014 bond measure allowed the District to construct a new high school and implement District-wide grade reconfiguration (K-5, 6-8 and 9-12) to provide some elementary capacity relief. That transition was successfully implemented in time for the beginning of the 2017 school year. Grade reconfiguration, construction and opening of the new North Creek High School, and other associated actions were part of a set of recommendations made by the community based Enrollment Demographics Task Force (EDTF) and unanimously adopted by the School Board at its October 23,2012 board meeting to address capaclty issues and take advantage of instructional program benefits. See secfio n 5 for more information on EDTF. The 2018 capital bond and 2018 CFP included new projects to add elementary capacity at the \"Maltby Road\" site (ES#21) and a 3O-classroom addition at the existing Skyview Middle/Canyon Creek Elementary site to serve both schools. Additionally, the 2018 bond proposal included a new concert hall with added instruction space at lnglemoor High School. The District's voters approved funding for these projects in February 2018. All three of these 'groMh' related projects are currently at varying stages between design development and construction. This 2019 CFP includes the addition of a middle school at the \"Maltby Road\" site (MS #7) lo be funded from a future bond proposal. The EDTF and bond task force both recommend this project as a means to accommodate growth in the north end of the District as the larger elementary class sizes move through the District grade levels. While state projections of birthrate growth are leveling off from a recent high, the birth rates in King County are projected to remain at current or slightly increasing levels. ln addition, the recent and continued new home development in District may continue to necessitate further increases in elementary or middle school capacity. The 2018 CFP projected a sizeable and growing capacity deficit in the high school 4lPage NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 2019Attachment lto PO 2019-0416 grade band. More recent projections and this 20'19 CFP identify a similar capacity deficit as the larger K-5 enrollment works its way through the grade bands. The District has publically discussed and evaluated multiple approaches to address this deficit. Due to opportunity and timing demands, available land-use options/constraints and cost, the District moved fonvard with purchasing a 3-story (66,000 SF) commercial building located in the Canyon Park Business Park (CPBP)and will minimally renovate the structure for use as a Choice-Program High School beginning fall of 2020. The District currently houses an alternative high school (SAS) and our administrative support services building and warehouse within the business park. The central location of facilities will provide additional economies of scale and other advantages to the proposed location. Additionally, the CPBP Association has approved residential development within the park, placing increased capacity demands on the District in years to come. As school attendance area adjustments and transportation options continue to be prohibitive in rehousing students to areas of available capacity, the enrollment groMh challenge becomes even greater. Continued new development and growth in District has largely been accommodated through limiting waivers at most schools, converting special-use portables and non-classroom spaces into classroom space, placement of additional portable classrooms, and bussing of kindergarten students to schools with available space (taking them away from their home school). The 2017 CFP included implementation of full-day Kindergarten. This CFP addresses legislatively required K-3 class size changes. There is no specific funding for added capacity needs of the K-3 class size implementation and the District will likely use a combination of staffing calculations and adjustment of space allocation and utilization in elementary schools to meet this requirement. K-3 reduced class sizes do affect the overall capacity demands and calculations for planning. Overview of the Northshore School District The Northshore School District spans 60 square-miles and primarily serves five jurisdictions: King County, Snohomish County, the City of Bothell, the City of Kenmore, and the City of Woodinville. There are some addresses located in the cities of Brier, Kirkland and Redmond, but they are either in areas not expected to experience any new residential development or in very small areas with previously developed residential areas. For the purposes of the District's CFP and long-term projections, those areas are considered de minimis impacts on the District's grade bands. The King-Snohomish county line divides the District such that roughly two- thirds of District are in King County and onethird in Snohomish County. The District has a population of approximately 140,000 and a 2018 student enrollmenl of 22,622. As of fall2018, the District has the 8th largest enrollment in Washington State. There are presently twenty elementary schools, six middle schools, four comprehensive high schools, one alternative high school program, and one early childhood center, The current grade configuration is K-5, 6-8 and 9-12. The Urban Growth Area boundary (UGA)divides the District, creating capacity NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 20195lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 utilization challenges. As new residential development continues to occur even at more moderate rates, land for potential new school sites continues to be scarce. King County does not allow for school siting outside the Urban Growth Boundary, but Snohomish County does provide for school siting via a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) process. The \"Maltby Road\" site (ES#21) is located outside the UGB and is a very complicated and expensive site to locate a school due to needed extension of utilities, large on-site sewer/septic, complicated easements, and storm water management. SECTION 2 .. STUDENT ENROLLMENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS Background Elementary enrollment has been growing over the past several years, primarily due to larger birth cohorts and a consistent increase in new single-family home development. This wave of elementary enrollment growth is beginning to move into the middle and high school grades and is anticipated to continue over the next 5 to 10 years. For the last six years, growth and enrollment have outpaced mid-range projections. The District grew at a faster rate than the rest of King County, increasing its share of the K- 12 population from 7.5%1o7.7%. Projections, based on data provided by state and localjurisdictions, indicate that this trend of a still, relatively-strong real estate market and continued strong birth cohorts will fuel higher enrollments over the next decade. The birth cohorts since 2006 have been substantially larger than the cohorts between 1996 and 2005. As a result, continued growth is expected in K-12 enrollment between 2018 and 2025. Similar to past years, this year's projections considered regional and local trends in population growth, birth rates, and housing development, analyzing corresponding projections down to the school feeder pattern level. GroMh rates were adjusted based on permit information specific to those respective areas. The resulting trends were used to further refine the projection methodology for enrollment forecasts used in this document. The following section describes in more detail the assumptions used to develop the forecast and compares the result of this projection to other available methodologies. Methodology Numerous methodologies are available for projecting longterm enrollments. The most common method is known as:. Cohort survival which tracks groups of students through the system and adjusts the populations to account for the average year-to- year growth. For example, this year's fourth grade is adjusted based on the average enrollment trend of the past in order to estimate next year's fifth grade enrollment. This calculation method considers the past five years' trends to determine the average adjustment factor for each grade, or cohort. NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 20196lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 The method works well for all grades except kindergarten, where there is no previous year data, For kindergarten, two methodologies are generally used: A linear extrapolation from the previous five years of kindergarten enrollment, assuming that there is a trend; Or, alternatively, a comparison of the kindergarten enrollment to births from five years prior can be used to calculate a \"birth-to-K\" ratio. For example, kindergarten enrollment in 2017 is divided by the total births in King and Snohomish counties in 2012 to produce a \"birth-to-K\" ratio. The average ratio for the last five years can then be applied to births in subsequent years to estimate kindergarten enrollment. The cohort survival method has been used by OSPI to predict enrollment for all school districts in the state for the limited purpose of the School Construction Assistance Program. ln past years, OSPI has used a 6-year cohort average for grades 1-12and a linear extrapolation method at kindergarten. ln 2008, OSPI commissioned a study to evaluate the effectiveness of this method for predicting enrollment. The report recommended the use of the \"birthto-K\" method for predicting kindergarten enrollment and the use of a housing adjustment factor for districts that are likely to be impacted by large numbers of new housing developments, The cohort survival method generally works well for districts that have a consistent trend of gradual increases or declines in enrollment. lt is less reliable in districts where spikes in demographic trends (especially a marked increase or decrease in new housing) can lead to dramatic swings in enrollment from one year to the next. ln addition, the use of the linear extrapolation method at the kindergarten level can result in a distorted trend since it does not consider changes in birth rate trends. Combining cohort survival with other information about births, housing, regional population trends, and even trends in service area and private school enrollment can sometimes provide for a more accurate forecast. Trends/Projections There are currently 1,631 new single family homes in the pipeline in the District and 2,493 multi-family units. While there are still enrollment pressures due to active, recent and continued growth in the north-end of the District (the Fernwood, Kokanee, Crystal Springs and Canyon Creek Elementary service area), the multi-family development is beginning to spread throughout the District, which could eventually place capacity demands on schools that have historically been able to assist in absorbing growth from areas with heavier development or alternative program space. On average, the District saw over 500 new home sales per year (District-wide) over the past five years. Building permit information that the District has received from the jurisdictions show continuing strong new home construction and resulting enrollment gains over the six-year period in this forecast. While many of the larger housing developments in the north end are reaching completion and available land is shrinkinga a NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July 8, 2019TlPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 for new single family homes, the sale of new homes in 2016 and 2017 were the highest in the District since 2007 . The market has softened, and there is a slight reduction in the pipeline for new single family homes (although still strong), yet the District is experiencing a relatively large increase in active townhome construction and planned townhome developments. From a student generation perspective, it could take a few years for enrollment numbers to be impacted, as those townhomes complete construction, sell and become occupied. The District's K-5 enrollment has steadily increased in recent years, with kindergarten and first grade enrollment above projections in the fall of 2018, and continued increases projected over the next three years. The medium range projections then show a slight decline in the later years of the planning period. The District intends to watch K-5 enrollment closely and will update the projections and related planning as necessary based on actual experience. However, given recent trends and knowledge of development within the pipeline, the District expects to see continued growth at the K-5 level throughout the six year planning period and beyond. TASLE 2.I ,FTE Enrollment Table 2-1 above. shows the enrollment forecast that combines cohort survival methodology with information about new housing, the District's predicted share of the King and Snohomish County births, and any predicted gains or losses in the District's market share. Market share refers to the District's share of the K-12 public schoolmedium range), incl. housing permit & 1738191 0 181 811786 Capital Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 2019BlPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 population in the region as well as any expected effect from private schools. For this forecast, the average rollup at existing grades was combined with estimates of growth expected from new housing, and assumptions about market share gains or losses that the District is likely to see at certain grade levels. Estimates of housing groMh for this model were obtained from building permit information provided by the respective jurisdictions. Overall enrollment is predicted to increase between 2019 and 2025. Middle School and High School enrollment are projected to grow more strongly in the forecasted period as the larger elementary classes from recent years roll up through the grades. Middle School (6-8) enrollment is projected to increase from 5,298 in October 2018 to 5,697 by October 2024. High School enrollment (9-12) is projected to increase from 6,507 in October 2018 to 7 ,535 by October 2024. ln total, the projected K-12 increase in enrollment is 1 ,232 over the six-year period. While elementary enrollment is expected to level off some during the next six years, the grade span continues to show overall enrollment growth beyond the six-year planning period. Long Range Projections The methodology described above was extrapolated lo 2028 to produce a longer- range forecast. (Table 2-2) ln general, this model assumes that enrollment in the period between 2024 and 2028 will grow at a rate that is similar to the overall growth in Snohomish County. Similar to the methodology used above, the average cohort survival rollup-rate for each grade was calculated and applied at each grade level to predict the growth in each subsequent year. Kindergarten was projected using the \"birth-to-K\" ratio method described in section 2. Longer-range birth forecasts were arrived at by applying the most recent average of the birth rates in each county (two-year average) to the projected number of women expected to reach their child-bearing years over the next decade (using forecasts from the Office of Financial Management at the State of Washington). The average \"birth- to-K\" ratio for the last 5 years was then applied to the projected births to predict kindergarten enrollment. A growth factor was then applied to each of the grade level projections (K-12) to account for expected K-12 population growth between 2026 and 2035 (Table 2-2.1). This factor was based on a forecast of Snohomish Counly K-12 enrollment that used cohort survival trends, birth forecasts, and projected population groMh for the county (again using the medium range county forecast obtained from oFM). Using this methodology, the District's enrollment shows continued growth from 2024 to 2028. Enrollment in 2024 is projected to be 23,854 and 24,089 in 2028. This longer range model assumes that the State forecasts of births, K-12 growth, and continued population growth for the Puget Sound are reasonably accurate, Future growth trends are uncertain. Changes in population groMh, fertility rates, new housing development slowdown, or a sharp downturn in the economic conditions in the Puget Sound region could have a major impact on long term enrollment, making it significantly lower or higher than the current estimate. Given this uncertainty, the NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 20199lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 current projection should be considered a reasonable estimate based on the best information available, but subject to change as newer information about trends becomes available. TABLEz-2 Projected FTE Enrollment Assumes that percentage per grade span will remain constantthrough 2035 SECTION 3 -. DISTRICT STANDARD OF SERVICE Primary Objective Optimizing student learning is the heart of what the Northshore School District strives for in establishing its service standard for classroom capacity utilization. This requires a constant review and assessment of programs, curriculum and instructional changes, student learning behaviors, learning environments, technological innovations and program development. Equitable access to programs for all students is also a school board driven goal and the District is continually striving for process and methods in which all students have the ability to access the best learning environment. Additional variables include changes in mandatory requirements dictated by the state, such as the implementation of full day kindergarten, Core 24 graduation requirements and the 2019 fall implementation of K-3 class size ratios. These elements as well as demographic projections are weighed when determining service levels.:i4: 2A1g Adopted by NSD School Board July 8,201910 | P a g eAltachment I to PO 2019-0416 Grade Reconfiguration and lnstructional Program Changes ln the fall of 2017, the District implemented a reconfiguration of its instructional model to a four-year (9-12) high school, a (6-8) middle school and a (K-5) elementary school model. The District has been successful in generating high graduation rates and test scores, but the developmental needs and maturity level of students are more effectively met by providing fewer transitions between critical grades and a more effective match of resources with the needs of students. Additionally, grade reconfiguration provided some capacity relief at the elementary grade span. Existing Programs and Standards of Service The District currently provides traditional educational programs and nontraditional programs (See Table 3-1) such as special education, expanded dual language education, intervention programs (social/emotional and academic), alcohol and drug education, preschool and daycare programs, home school, computer labs, music programs, movement programs, etc. These programs are regularly reviewed to determine the optimum instructional methods and learning environments required at each school, with added attention to equitable access across the District. The required space for these programs as well as any supporting space is determined by noise, level of physical activity, teacher to student ratios, privacy and/or the need for physical proximity to other services/facilities. Adequate space must exist for program flexibility, differing learning styles, program changes, project/problem based learning and pre- and post-school activities. For example, service level capacities in rooms utilized for programs such as special education would reflect lower capacities of the defined service levels (See Table 3-2), eighl students per classroom instead of 24 students per classroom. Table 3-2 is representative of 2018 class sizes and will change for 2019 with implementation of K-3 class size ratios. NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July 8,2019ll lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-0416 Special teaching stations and programs offered by the District at specific school sites are included in Table 3-1.

Special programs usually require space modifications and frequently have lower class sizes than other, more traditional programs; this potentially translates into greater space requirements. These requirements affect the utilization of rooms and result in school capacities varying from year to year (as programs move or grow, depending on space needs, capacity can change or decline in a school). Teaching station loading is identified in Table 3-2. Class sizes are averages based on actual utilization as influenced by state funding and instructional program standards. The District's standard of service is based on state and/or contractual requirements. As previously discussed, this 2019 CFP update fully implements K-3 mandated class size ratios in projections beginning fall of 2019, as required by state law. This impact will be discussed in more detail in Section 4 & Section 5.

Table 4-1 summarizes the capacity owned and operated by the District. lnformation is also provided on relocatable classrooms (portables), school sites and other District owned facilities or land, Variations in student capacity between schools are often a result of the number of specialized programs offered at specific schools. These programs require classroom space, which can reduce the permanent capacity of the school. Further, capacities will change from year-to-year based on changes to existing instructional programs, projected future programs and the resulting required space needed to deliver the instructional model at each specific site. To monitor this, and for use in preliminary capacity planning, the District establishes classroom capacities for planning purposes. This is the maximum number of students a school can accommodate based on a standard room capacity. These figures are then compared to the actual room utilization rate on a regular basis. Capacity takes into consideration the specific programs that actually take place in each of the rooms. For example, capacities in rooms utilized for programs such as special education would reflect the defined service levels (see Table 3-2l, ranging from 8 to 24 students per room. Because of the need to provide planning time and space for teacher preparation or other required services, some facilities will only support a capacity utilization of 85%. ln secondary schools, the utilization percentage may be higher. Capacities are updated annually in the CFP to reflect current program needs and classroom utilization. lmplementation of voter & legislatively mandated K-3 class size ratios becomes effective in fall of 2019. While the District expects to address this demand with a combination of class utilization adjustments and staff ratios, it is important to identify the overall impact on classroom capacity for planning purposes. Table 4-3 shows the impacts of class utilization adjustments on regular classroom capacity, Schools The District currently operates twenty elementary schools, six middle schools, and four comprehensive high schools. The District also has one alternative secondary school program, a home school program and an early childhood center. ln September of 2017, the District opened its fourth comprehensive high school, North Creek High School, but it did not house a 12th grade level for the first year of operation as a transition plan. Beginning in fall of 2018, all four comprehensive high schools were fully operable and housed allfour grade levels, 9-12.

Traditionally, the District has aimed to keep its total capacity provided by portables at or below 10% lo a maximum of 15o/o percent of its total capacity. However, growth and resulting enrollment increases have resulted in a current utilization of 21o/o at the elementary grade level being housed in portable or interim classroom space. This percentage fluctuates, impacted by groMh and changes in instructional program needs. The 2017 opening of the new high school and the grade re-configuration created some additional permanent capacity at the elementary level, but recent groMh for 2017 used that space up quickly and caused only a small reduction in portable/interim space use. Portables are utilized to help achieve efficient facility utilization and balance economic costs while encouraging innovation and new approaches, particularly for non-core or pilot programs. As funding for permanent capacity is secured through bond financing, or other changes occur, such as the revision of instructional programs or lower enrollment projections; the need for portables is reassessed. While some portables may be removed from sites or re-assigned to non-classroom space, as new schools come online, the District anticipates a continued need at this time, to utilize portables as a critical component of student capacity. ln addition, as a part of the District's capacity solution, portables may be moved from one grade band to another grade band to address interim capacity needs. These decisions are made on an annual basis as enrollment demands and future updates to the CFP would note such adjustments. A typical portable classroom provides capacity for 24 students at the elementary level or 27 at the secondary level. Portables are used to meet a variety of instructional needs. Of the 154 portable classrooms that the District owns, 124 are currently being used as classrooms for scheduled classes. EDTF has recommended that the District begin to phase out older portables as capacity allows, but with recent groMh trends, the District continues to be reliant on this interim capacity. All portables are inspected regularly and upgraded as needed, or as systems require. Within the financial capabilities of the District, the intent has been to minimize the use of portables for scheduled classes. However, as Table 4-1 indicates, continued groMh in the District has pushed reliance on portables for scheduled classrooms to a higher than desired percentage.

The Enrollment Demographic Task Force ( EDTF) exam ines enrollment projections, capacity considerations, student impacts, cost impacts, program needs, etc., and boundary adjustments based upon the above. The committee recommends potential solutions to the school board. lf approved by the board, these recommended actions are implemented by the District and incorporated into the Capital Facilities Plan. over the past six years, District enrollment has grown by over 13oh or 2,694 new students. Tlre elementary grade span has grown by 1,750 new students in that time; an equivalent of 3-4 new elementary schools. To accommodate that groMh, EDTF identified the following strategies (in order of priority) for the District to employ when addressing existing and future capacity needs.

Maximized available spaces for classrooms (e.9., moved pre-school and before/after care programs out of classrooms/portables, minimized or eliminated computer labs (replaced with mobile labs), etc.) . Revised the District's waiver process to help address enrollment groMh issues by closing 19 elementary and 3 (then junior high) schools to in- and out-of- District waivers, and moving three-year waivers to one-year-only waivers. . Restricted the number of full-day kindergarten classes at several schools (until grade-reconfiguration in 2017 ). Moved kindergarten classes to other elementary schools with space to help manage groMh (since 2013-2014 school year)(undesired approach) r 46 portable classrooms have been placed at elementary schools to accommodate growth in the north/north-central region of the District, the majority of which were placed since 2013 as follows: o 2006-2012; 11 portables placed @ 5 elem. schools & 1 Jr.High o 2013:10 portables placed at 3 elementaryschools o 2014: 10 portables placed at 4 elementary schools o 2015: 7 portables placed at 4 elementaryschools o 2016: 8 portables placed at 5 elementaryschools o 2018: 1-double portable relocated from middle to elementary school o 2019: 4 portables to be placed at 1 elementary school o 2007 adjusted school service area boundaries for 10 elementary schools . 2008-2012 modernization projects completed at 4 secondary schools (Canyon Park Jr High, Kenmore Jr High, Bothell HS, Woodinville HS) o 2009-2011 permanent capacity additions to 3 elementary schools (Canyon Creek, Fernwood, and Lockwood) o 2010 property purchase of 33 acres on Maltby Rd (future school construction sife - elementary & middle)) o 2012 property purchase of 61 acres (now the North Creek High Schoolsite) . 2016 implementations included: o Northshore Primary space for Kindergarten) o 2017 lmplementations included: o Opening of North Creek High District-wide grade reconfiguration (K-5; 6-8; 9-12) o District-wide school service area boundary changes o District-wide adjustments to feeder patterns o District-wide full day Kindergarten implementation o Property purchase of Wellington site NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD SchoolBoard July B,20192llPageAttachment lto PO 2019-XXXX ln May 2016, the school board approved the following EDTF recommendations specific to accommodating growth: \"Provide flexible capacity to accommodate continued growth and program access by constructing facilities at the \"Maltby Road\" site (capable of supporting 500 elementary and 700 middle school students) as well as a 24+ classroam wing at the Skyview/Canyon Creek campus. Fund fhese projects using the 2018 bond for potential opening in fall of 2020; and continue to look for and acquire property fo address future anticipated growth in the north/central portions of the District.' ln the fall of 2016 the Capital Bond Planning Task Force (CBPTF)was selected and convened. The CBPTF met over the course of several months to analyze the Board approved EDTF recommendations, including construction of the projects above, as well as capital infrastructure and modernization needs across all schools and District facilities using data collected through a state required facilityassessment. The CBPTF made recommendations to the school board for projects included in the 2018 bond measure. A long{erm projection of unhoused students and facilities needs is shown in Tabte 5-1 The capacity shown includes North Creek High School; new elementary capacity in 2020 on the District's \"Maltby Road\" site; a classroom addition at Skyview/Canyon creek (Board approved and 2018 bond approval by voters), new middle school capacity on the \"Maltby Road\" site in 2023-2024. new high school capacity at lnglemoor, along wlth the new concert hall (also to be utilized for adclecl irrstructional space), and a newly planned Choice-Program High School for 400-600 students in 202012021. As witlr arry longterm projections, many assumptlons and estimates on housing must be made, increasing the risk associated with the accuracy of the projections. However, the District has trended above mid-range projections in years past and with a relatively continued strong real estate and development market, the District needs to plan for continued growth as projected. The legislatively mandated fall 2019 class-size implementation sets a new capacity baseline for elementary schools. There are projected growth and capacity deficits at all grade bands, even with newly planned construction projects to accommodate continued growth in the District.

GROWTH RELATED PROJECTS Planned lmprovements - construction to Accommodate New Growth The continued increase in enrollment has fully exhausted capacity increases from relocating building programs, portablc additions and boundary changes, While some elementary capacity relief occrrrred from grade reconfiguration in the fall of 2017. GroMh continues to outpace school capacity. Growth has been concentrated in northern and central portions of the District. ln the past 6 years, Fernwood Elementary (FW) and Kokanee Elementary (KO) have received the largest number of new students generated from new home development. Fernwood Elementary, the District's northern-most elementary school, has experienced groMh pushing its total enrollment to nearly 1,000 students; a figure double the size of the permanent capacity the school was built to serve. Currently, the FW campus contains 17 portable classrooms placed to mitigate the rapid growth in the area. Kindergarten classes are currently being bussed to Frank Love, due to capacity constraints. Given the District's northern boundary is less than 1 mile away, constructing a new elementary with proximity to FW and KO, to accommodate the existing student population and continued and projected groMh is essential. ln 2010, the District purchased a 33 acre site along State Route 524, referred to as the \"Maltby Road\" site. The 2018 CFP update reflected:. Construction of new elementary school capacity at the \"Maltby Road\" site. A 3O-classroom addition project at the adjacent sites of Skyview Jr. High/MS and Canyon Creek Elementary. The fall2017 opening of North Creek High School. The added concert hall and instructional space at lnglemoor Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July B, 201924lPageAttachment lto PO 2019-XXXX This 2019 CFP update also includes construction of the middle school at the \"Maltby Road\" site, as phase ll of the project, - which will be included in a future bond. The middle schoolwill add growth related capacity of 700 students. Additionally, this 2019 CFP update includes the purchase and renovation of the 3-story commercial building and 6-acre lot, in the Canyon Park Business Center, as a future choice-program high school. This high school will provide additional growth related capacity of 400-600 students. Longterm projections indicate growth of 1,467 new students in the next ten years. The District will continue to monitor the multitude of factors that shape our capacity needs, i.e.; statewide legislative changes, instructional delivery requirements, the economy, changes in planned land use, changes in mandated program requirements, equitable access to programs, building permit activity, and birth rates, in order to help ensure needed instructional space is available when/where needed and will pursue additional land acquisition should construction of additional sites be necessary to accommodate those needs. Planned lmprovements - Existing Facilities (Building lmprovement Program) ln a number of other sites where the existing facility layout (building envelope) meets instructional needs and building structural integrity is good, individual building systems (such as HVAC, mechanical, flooring, roofing) are identified for replacement or modernization to extend the life of the overall site and ensure optimal learning environment for students. The 2018 Capital Bond Planning Task Force (CBPTF) made recommendations to the school board for potential building improvement projects to include in the capital bond measure. See SectionT. When North Creek High Schoolwas permitted and constructed, there existed a small SE area of the campus - between NCHS and Fernwood Elementary - outside the Urban GroMh Boundary (UGB). Through a docket and review process in Snohomish County, that District-owned area has now been brought within the UGB in 2018. The District is evaluating the potential for a small building addition to support the sport fields further away from the main campus building to provide a restroom, storage and potential for weather protected concessions. The District will continue its evaluation of this area for planned improvements to support the District's growth and overall program needs as appropriate. Jurisdictional and environmental review will be conducted as required. Portable Location Adjustments Where growth results in capacity deficits at a specific grade band, portables may be relocated from one grade band to another to assist with meeting enrollment projections. See Secfion 6 for more detail regarding portables.

CAPITAL FACILITIES FINANCING PLAN Funding ot school tacilities is typically secured from a number of sources including voter-approved bonds, state matching funds, impact fees, and mitigation payments Each of these funding sources is discussed below. General Obligation Bonds Bonds are typically used to fund construction of new schools and other capital improvement projects. A 60% voter approval is required to pass a bond issue. Bonds are sold as necessary to generate revenue. They are then retired through collection of property taxes. Voters approved a bond of $177.5 million in February 2014to construct North Creek High School, complete Phase lll of Woodinville High School and implement the Building lmprovement Projects and other capital infrastructure needs outlined by the Capital Bond Planning Task Force and approved by the school board. The District's Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Capital Bond Planning Task Force, sent a $275 million bond measure to the voters, in February 2018 to provide funding for growth-related projects included in this Capital Facilities Plan as well as other District-wide Building lmprovement or capital infrastructure needs, as identified in Table 8-1. The voters approved the bond measure by 60.78%. State School Construction Assistance State financial assistance comes from the Common School Construction Fund. Bonds are sold on behalf of tlre furrd tlrerr retired llunr reverrues accruing predominantly from the sale of renewable resources (i.e. timber)from state sohool lands set asidc by thc Enabling Act of 1889. lf these sources are insufficient to meet needs, the Legislature can appropriate General Obligation funds or the Superintendent of Public lnstruction can prioritize projects for funding. State financial assistance is available for qualifying school construction projects, however these funds may not be received until two to three years after a matched project has been completed. This requires the District to finance the complete project with local funds. Site acquisition and site improvements are not eligible to receive matching funds. These funds, as with all state funded programs, have been reduced and given the current state budget, could be eliminated or eligibility criteria and funding formulas revised. Also, if no changes to existing capacity are made, District demographics are projected to result in a loss of eligibility for state match at the secondary level. Eligibility for state match is continually reviewed. The school impact fee formula assumes that the District may receive some portion of state funding assistance for the lnglemoor Concert Hall and added instructional space project, but currently no other projects on the planned construction list, that are adding capacity to meet growth demands were eligible for state school construction assistance. Future updates to this plan will include updated information, as it becomes available. NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July 8,201928lPageAttachment I to PO 2019-XXXX K-3 Class Size Reduction Grants ln 2015 the Washington State Legislature provided $234M in funding available for the construction of new elementary classrooms to aid Districts in the need to provide additional space for both full-day Kindergarten and K-3 class size reduction, OSPI administered the grant program and validated the District's need for 64 additional classrooms in order to meet the K-3 class size reduction effort. The District applied for grant funding, but because of prioritization criteria used by OSPI, did not receive any. There is no indication of any future grants being made available. lmpact Fees (See Section 9 for background, detail, and methodology) The Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA) authorizes cities and counties that plan under RCW 36.70A.040 to collect impact fees to supplement funding of additional system improvements (e.9., public facilities such as schools) needed to accommodate growth from new development. The statute is clear that the financing of needed public facilities to serve groMh cannot be funded solely by impact fees but rather must be balanced with other sources of public funds. Budget and Financing Plan Table 8-1 is a summary of the budget that supports the Capital Facilities Plan. Each project budget represents the total project costs which include; construction, taxes, planning, architectural and engineering services, permitting, environmental impact mitigation, construction testing and inspection, furnishings and equipment, escalation, and contingency.

IMPAGT FEES School lmpact Fees under the Washington State Growth Management Act As described in Section 8, the Growth Management Act (GMA) authorizes jurisdictions to collect impact fees to supplement funding of additional public facilities needed to accommodate groMh/new development. lmpact fees cannot be used for the operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, or replacement of existing capital facilities used to meet existing service demands. The basic underlying assumption is that growth pays for growth. Enrollment declines beginning around 2002 kept the District from meeting the required eligibility criteria to collect school impact fees. The District is spread across two counties and also across the urban groMh boundary. While development picked up on the north end of the District, there was still ample capacity in the south east area of the District. Because of the statutes and ordinances governing school District eligibility criteria to be able to collect school impact fees, the District was not able to re-establish eligibility for collection of school impact fees until 2016. King County, Snohomish County and the City of Bothell, have all adopted the District's 2018 CFP and are collecting impact fees identified in that plan. The City of Woodinville and the City of Kenmore only began adopting this last year, with the adoption of the District's 2017 CFP, and are collecting impact fees associated with that plan. We anticipate all the above jurisdictions to consider and adopt this 2019 CFP this fall, with their regular budget cycle, except for Snohomish County which will consider the 2020 CFP, as part of their biennial schedule. Methodology and Variables Used to Calculate School lmpact Fees lmpact fees may be calculated based on the District's cost per dwelling unit to purchase/acquire land for school sites, make site improvements, construct schools and purchase/install temporary facilities (portables). The costs of projects that do not add capacity are not included in the impact fee calculations. The impact fee formula calculates a \"cost per dwelling unit\". New capacity construction costs addressing the District's growth-related needs, are used in the calculation A student factor (or student generation rate) is used to identify the average cost per NEW dwelling unit by measuring the average number of students generated by each NEW (sold and occupied) housing type (single family dwelling and multi-family dwellings of two bedrooms or more - including townhomes). The student generation rate used is an actual generation of students by grade level that came from new development over a period of five (5) years. The student factor analysis for the District is included in Appendix B. The student factors in Appendix B arc based on all newly constructed, sold, and occupied units. The District is continuing to use its 2018 student factor analysis for purposes of this update. The District plans to update the 2018 data for the 2020 CFP update. NSD 2019 Capital Facilities Plan Adopted by NSD School Board July 8,201931 lPageAttachment lto PO 2019-XXXX The District's student-generation rate for multi-family dwelling units is much lower than the student generation rate for single-family homes. This likely reflects, in part, that recent new development in the District has been in single family homes. Yet, as available land for single family development is beginning to be constrained, and multi- family development - most notably townhomes, is increasing, we anticipate continued increases in student generation rates from those units over time. As required under GMA, credits are applied for State School Construction Assistance Funds to be reimbursed to the District, where expected, and projected future property taxes to be paid by the dwelling unit toward a capital bond/levy funding the capacity improvement. Formula driven fees are identified on table 9-1. Snohomish County Code (30.66C) and King County Code (21A.43) establish each jurisdiction's authority to collect school impact fees on behalf of the District. The formula for calculating impact fees is substantively identical in each code. The codes of each of the cities are similar to those of the counties. These codes establish the conditions, restrictions, and criteria for eligibility to collect impact fees. Both counties in District define a school District's \"service area\" to be the total geographic boundaries of the school District. The District updates the Capital Facilities Plan on an annual basis and carefully Ittortitors enrollment projections agalnst capacity needs. lf legally supportable, the District requests its localjurisdictions to collect impact fees on behalf of the District The impact fees requested in this year's Capital Facilities Plan are based on groMh related construction projects, including: the new elementary school capacity (500), at the \"Maltby Road\" site; the added capacity project at Skyview Middle School (200) and Canyon Creek Eletrtentary (200); phase ll at the \"Maltby Road\" site, addlng 700 students at the middle school grade band; the addition of instructional space and capacity (100)at lnglemoor High School; and the newly acquired land and commercial building that will be undergoing improvements to house an additional 400- 600 high school students.

The District's service area includes areas of unincorporated King County, the City of Black Diamond, and the City of Enumclaw, Currently, the District serves a student population of about 3,970 (Oct, 2018 head count) students in kindergarten through grade 12. Enrollment projections presented herein, indicate that enrollment growth will occur over the next six years, Following an extended period of declining enrollment, the District has experienced slight growth over the last five years. However, the District anticipates healthy enrollment gains as a result of new residential development projected within the six-year planning period (and anticipated to continue beyond the six year planning period). The City of Black Diamond approved development of two Master Planned Developments (the \"MPDs\") over the next fifteen-plus years. Together, the MPDs (Ten Trails and Lawson Hills) include 6,050 dwelling units. Construction of residential dwelling units in Phase lA of the Ten Trails MPD began in 2018 with the construction of approximalely 42 single family housing units through April 2019. An additional 114 single family units and 62 multi-family units are planned forconstruction in 2019. Construction in this plat and in others plats in the two MPDs will continue with an estimated minimum 144 single family housing units built in 2019, 189 in 2020, and 225 units each year through 2024. ln addition, 439 multi-family units are anticipated by 2024. Using current student generation rates, this will mean an increase in the District's enrollment by approximately 860 students from these planned units in a six year period. The City of Enumclaw has several approved several construction projects wlthln the clty limlts, Pinnacle Peak includes g1 single family residential lots, Suntop has three phases totaling 260 single family lots. Thcrc arc 11 other developments at various stages of approval within the city limits of Enumclaw totaling 542 preliminary platted lots. We estintate all teferenced single family dwelling units will be bullt withln the six year period of this plan, generating an additional 333 students. Finally, there is ongoing, though limited, developntent in the unincorporated area of King County that is located within the District. To accommodate cumulative projected new development, the District added capacity in 2017 at the new Black Diamond Elementary School and is adding permanent student capacity at Enumclaw High School, Temporary capacity at the elementary and middle school levels will be needed during the six-year planning period, and we must begin to plan for additional capacity within the next ten years. Section lV of this Plan identifies the District's anticipated longterm planning with regard to the development within the City of Black Diamond. As noted above, the District will need substantial capacity additions in the longterm planning period in response to development activity throughout the District and particularly within the City of Black Diamond. Future updates to this Plan will reflect planning needs in response to growth. Euuruclaw Sulrool District 6-Ycar Capital Facilities PlanJune 20 I 9 Page IAttachment J to PO 201 9-04 16 Section l: Six-Year Enrollment Projection This plan update is based on the anticipated number of students expected to be enrolled through 2A24. The six-year projection (2019-2024) will assist in determining shorl term needs and form the basis for assessing the need for impact fees. Enrollment projections are most accurate for the initial years of the forecast period. Moving fudher into the future, more assumptions about economic conditions and demographic trends in ihe area affect the projection. ln the event that enrollment growth slows, plans for new facilities will likely be delayed. lt is much more difficult, however, to initiate new projects or speed projects up in the event enrollment growth exceeds the projections. Regular updates of both the enrollment projections and the Capital Facilities Plan (CFP) are essentialto good lacility planning. The District relies on two population forecasts for purposes of projecting student enrollment. The first is an estimate by the Superintendent of Public lnstruction (OSPI). OSPI estimates future enrollment through 2024 using the cohort survival method. This method estimates how many students in one year will attend the next grade in the following year by relying on previous enrollment trends. Due to the fact that the cohorl survival method does not incorporate in-migration, padicularly from anticipated new development within the District, these projections are considered highly conservative. ln addition, the cohorl survival method continues to erroneously assume a decline in the District's enrollment due to the removal of students attending the Muckleshoot Tribal School from the District's enrollment figures in 2014 (when the Muckleshoot Tribe entered into a state-tribal education compact school agreement pursuant to the authority of E2SHB 1 154), See Appendix A. The second forecast is a modified cohort analysis, which uses the cohotl projections as a base, incorporates King County live birlh data and the District's historic percentage of those births to determine the number of kindergarlners entering the system, and furlher incorporates assumptions based on known new residential development proposals within the District. See Appendix B, Because this analysis incorporates the expected in-migration to the District from new development, the District uses this analysis for purposes of determining capacity needs throughout the six years of this planning period. Using the modified enrollment projections, the District's enrollment is expected to increase over the six years of this Plan. With regard to the expected enrollment from the anticipated 6,050 dwelling units in Black Diamond, building of residential units did commence in summer 2018, with building and occupancy to continue for a period of fifteen years or more thereafter. As such, the enrollment impacts from the staft of these developments begin to show during the early years of this Plan period. Future updates to this Plan will provide additional and updated information regarding these projects and the impacts on District enrollment. Enumclaw School District 6-Year Capital Facilities PlanJune 2019 Page 2Attachment J to PO 201 9-0416 Using the modified cohort survival projections, a total enrollment of 5,281 (HC) is expected by 2024, with significant growth occurring beginning in 2019-2020 when the first significant porlion of homes in the MPD in Black Diamond are expected to be occupied. The District expects the enrollment of 1 ,31 0 additional students between 2019-2024, See Table 1. Table 1: Projected Student Enrollment 2018-2024 Prclectlon 201 8*2019 2018) Enumclaw School District 6-Year Capital Facilities PlanJurre 2019 Page 3Section ll:Attachment J to 2019-0416 Current Enumclaw School District \"Standard of Service\" ln order to determine the capacity of the District's facilities, the King County Code 21A refers to a \"standard of service\" that each school district must establish in order to ascedain its overall capacity. The standard of senrice is based upon the number of classrooms available at each school and the desired average class load district-wide. A favorable class size is used to promote the standard and quality of educational programs the residents of the Enumclaw School District expect and support through the passage of levies and bonds. Rooms designed for special use are not counted as classrooms. Podables used for classrooms are employed on an interim basis only. When additional permanent classrooms are available, portables are removed from service, transferred to other locations, or used for non-classroom purposes. The District's standard of service is based on current standards. The Capital Facilities Plan incorporates funded implementation of K-3 class size reduction. Current Standards of Service for Elementary Students: Average district wide class size for grades K-3 will be reduced to be 20 students per teacher beginning in the 2019-2020 school yearto help the overall ratio reduce to 1 to 17when specialist and intervention teachers are considered. Average district wide class size for grades 4 and 5 should not exceed 26 students. Elementary school permanent capacity should be 450 students. We have reduced permanent capacity in several schools to allow for K-3 class size reduction. Goals with new construction would be to build permanent capacity for 500 students to accommodate for growth while still allowing for special programming listed below, Class size may vary from building to building based upon different influencing factors at each school. Students may be provided music instruction, physical education, and lunch in a separate classroom or facility. Students may have scheduled time in a special computer lab. Special Education for student with disabilities may be provided in a self-contained classroom with a maximum capacity of 1O-12 depending on the program, ldentified students will also be provided other educational opportunities in classrooms and/or special spaces for programs designated as follows: English Language Proficiency (ELP) lntegrated Programs & Resource Rooms (for special remedial assistance) Education for Disadvantage Students (Title 1) Highly Capable Program Other Remediation Programs Learning Assisted Program (LAP) Behavior Programs for severely behavio r-disordered students Hearing lmpaired Mild, Moderate and Severe Developmental Disabilities Developm ental P reschool Early Childhood Education Assistance Programs (ECEAP) Enumclaw School Distlict 6-Year Capital Facilities PlanJune 20 I 9 Page 4Attachment J to PO 2019-04'16 All of the special programs referenced above require specialized classroom space; thus, the full-time student capacity of buildings housing these programs is reduced. Students leave their regular classroom for a period of time to receive instruction in several special programs. When programs change, program capacity fluctuates and the plan is updated annually to reflect the change in program and capacity, Current Standards of Service for Secondary Students: The standards of service outlined below reflect only those programs and educational opportunities providcd to secondary students which directly affect the capacity of the school buildings. Average district wide class size for grades 6-8 should not exceed 28 students. Middle school permanent capacity should not exceed 550 students, Average district wide class size for grades 9-12 should not exceed 28 students. High school permanent capacity should not exceed 1,497 students after completion of the EHS modernization during the 2019-2020 school year. Special Education for students with disabilities may be provided in a classroom with a capacity of 10-15 depending on program ldentified students will also be provided other educational opporlunities in classrooms and/or special spaces for prograrns desigrrated as follows: lnstrumental and Roorrrs (fr:rr speuial rerrredial assistarrce) Advanced Placement Programs Basic Skills Programs Career and Vocational Education Programs Many of these programs require specialized classroom space and can reduce the permanent capacity of the school buildings. Each school's available capacity will vary with the type of programs and space utilization in the building. When a large number of portables are added to site to add capacity, other support facilities, such as gymnasiums, lunch areas, halls, etc, become inadequate. Enumclaw School District 6-Year Capital Facilities PlanJune 2019 Page 5Attachment J to PO 2019-0416 Section lll: lnventory and Projected Six-Year Enrollment Capacity of Schools Currently, the District has permanent program capacity to house 4,668 students based on the District's Standard of Service as set forlh in Section ll. That number will increase to 4,827 upon the completion of Phase ll of the Enumclaw High School modernization projeci in September 2019. Porlable classroom capacity for 152 students brings the total capacity lo 4,979 at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year,1 A summary of the current enrollment and capacity, and the breakdown at each grade span follows: Table 2: Summary of Capacity (2018-19) lncluded in this Plan is an inventory of the District's schools by type, address and current capacity See Table 3, ln the fall of 2005, the District closed J.J. Smith Elementary due to the age and condition of the building. The District perlormed facility upgrades in 2015 at J.J. Smith and it was used to temporarily house Black Diamond Elementary students during construction of the new elementary school. ln the fall of 2017, J,J. Smith began to house the District's Bitlh-to-Five program, special education pre- school and ECEAP programs. Black Diamond Elementary opened in August 2017. The new Black Diamond Elementary has a capacity of 450 students in permanent housing (an increase from the previous permanent capacity of 217), The Enumclaw High School modernization phase 1 opened in October 2018 and phase ll is scheduled to be complete in August 2A19. When fully completed, the updated facility will have a permanent capacity of 1,497 students, an increase from the previous permanent capacity (prior to modernization and demolition of some porlions of the facility) of under 1,300 students. Based on the enrollment forecasts, current inventory, program capacity, current standard of service, and porlable capacity, the District has identified the need for additional student capacity in the shorl term. This reflects new development in the City of Black Diamond and new and potential development in the City of Enumclaw and King County during the six year planning period. ln addition, funded implementation of class size reduction measures will fufther impact available and needed capacity, Future updates to this Capital Facilities Plan will address any such implementation. 1 The District's intent is for all students to be served in permanent classroom facilities. As such, portables are inlended to be a temporary capacity solution. The District currently has four classrooms in podables at Kibler Elementary and classrooms in portables at Enumclaw High School. There are seven portables at Kibler in total and three at Westwood. Portables are also used lor book rooms and administrative purposes.

Capacity needs are expressed in terms of \"surplus/(Deficit) of Permanent Capacity.\" A \"(Deficit)\" in permanent capacity means that there will be unhoused students (who will likely be served in portable classrooms, in classrooms where class size exceeds State standards, Board expectations and/or contractually negotiated agreements within the local school district). The unhousod student levels are shown in Table 5. Note: lor pJrposes ofassessing capacity, the District has included the capacity improvements that are planned over ihe six yearplanning period. As previously discussed in this Plan, the District intends to monitor development and enrollment growth and will continue to assess the noed for any capacity additions in future updates to this Plan. Facility Needs (2019-2024) The voters in the District approved a Bond in April 2015 that included replacement and expansion of Black Diamond Elementary School and renovation/expansion of Enumclaw High School. Creating new capacity atBlack Diamond Elementary helped to ensure that elementary schools in other areas of th; Districi are not overcrowded and that capacity is available in those schools to serve new development, The projects listed in Table 5 are anticipated based upon information available at the present time. Due to anticipated growth within the cities of Black Diamond and Enumclaw, the District will reallocate portables to both Thunder Mountain andEnumclaw Middle School and will need to purchase and/or relocate additional new portables based on the actual impact of growth. Due to the K-3 class size reduction legislation, the District has decreased permanent space available at the elementary level. The District anticipates running one or more bonds before 2024 forthe replacement and modcrnization of l(ibler Elementary School arrd a new Perforrlirrg Arts Center at Enumclaw High School. Each project will add permanent capacity. ln addition, the district must consic1er fietcl space to allow for increase size itr athletic teams. To this end, the district anticipates adding baseball and fastpitch fields at Thunder Mountain Middle School where none presently exists, Facility Needs (Long Term) Based upon present infortiratiotr regarding the development activlty wlthin the City of Black Diamond, the District is planning for long term needs in the Black Diamond area. The District anticipates that, based upon service standards and enrollment projections, the two approved master planned development projects may necessitate the future need for up to four new elementary schools, one new middle school, and one-new highschool. The District is uncertain at this time regarding long term additional capacity needs that may result from additional development in Black Diamond and development within the City of Enumclaw and unincorporated King County. The District will continue to monitor development activity and related capacity needs. ln addition, funded implementation of class size reduction measures will require additional capaciiy. Future updates to this Plan will reflect the planning needs in response to long term growth impacts. General Considerations The decision and ability to actually construct a new school facility involves multiple factors not wholly within the control of the District. The availability of funds is the biggest consideration whether those funds are generated from locally approved bonds, state construction funds, impact fees, or mitigation payments, or a combination of the above.

The financing plan and impact fee calculation formula also differentiate between capacity and noncapacity projects, The District's ability to accomplish its building program is based on the following funding sources:r Passage of general obligation bonds by District voters, which was done in the April 2015 election. Collection of school mitigation and impact fees. State School Construction Assistance Program funds General Obligation Bonds Bonds are typically used to fund construction of new schools and other capital improvement projects. A 60% voter approval is required to pass a bond, Bonds are then retired through collection of property taxes, The District's voters recently approved a $68.5 million bond to fund the replacement and expansion of the existing Black Diamond Elementary School and the partial renovation and expansion of Enumclaw High School. The District is considering proposing a $73 million bond to fund the replacement of Byron Kibler Elementary and the Enumclaw High School Performing Arts Center, Both projects would add student capacity, State School Construction Funding Assistance State School Construction Funding Assistance comes from the Common School Construction Fund. Bonds are sold on behalf of the fund then retired from revenues accruing predominantly from the sale of renewable resources (i.e. timber) from State school lands set aside bythe Enabling Act of 1889. lf these sources are insufficientto meet needs, the Legislature can appropriate funds or the State Superintendent of Public lnstruction can prioritize funding. School districts may qualify for School Construction Funding Assistance for specific capital projects. To qualify, a project must lirst meet a State established criteria of need, This is determined by a formula that specifies the amount of square footage the State will help finance to provide permanent structures for the unhoused enrollment projected for the district. lf a project qualifies, it can become parl of a State prioritization system. This system prioritizes allocation of available funding resources to school districts statewide based on seven prioritization categories. Funds are then disbursed to the districts based on a formula which calculates district assessed valuation per pupil relative to the whole State assessed valuation per pupil to establish the percent of the total project cost to be paid by the State. The State contribution can range from less than half to more lhan 7O\"/\" of the project's cost, Enumclaw School District 6-Year' Facilities PlanJune 2019 Page 12Attachment J to PO 2019-0416 State School Construction Funding Assistance can only be applied to major school construction projects. Site acquisition and minor impiovements are not eligible to receive School Construction Funding Assistance dollars, School Construction Funding Assistance funds are not received by a school district until after a school has been constructed. ln such cases, the District must \"front fund\" a project. That is, the District must finance the complete project with local funds (the future State's share coming from funds allocated to future Distriot projects), When the State share is finally disbursed (without accoLtnting for escalation) the future District project is parlially reimbursed, Because of the method of computing State School Construction Funding Assistance, the official percentage of funds calculated by the State does not typically equal the actual percentage of total facility cost, The State Funding Assistance Percentage for the Enumclaw School District is approximalely 54.87%, Notably, this only applies to costs that the State considers eligible for State Funding, Land costs and other development costs are not considered eligible for State School Construction Funding Assistance. Furthermore, the State only allows g0 square feet per elementary studenl while the District's service standard requires more square feet per student. This additional space must be funded with local dollars. For a typical project that has maximum State funding, less than 50% of the total project costs will covered by School Construction Funding Assistance dollars, Mitigation Payments and School lmpact Fees For developmenl in those jurisdictions that have not adoptecl a school impact fee ordinance, the District relies on mitigation required under the State Environmental Policy Act and related statutes. ln those jurisdictions where a school impact fee ordinance is in place, the District requests that an impact fee be collected by the permitting agency for the construction of any new residential dwelling unit. Fees assessed are based on the new enrollment groMh in the District. By law, new development cannot be assessed impact fees to correct existing deficiencies. lmpact fees have been calculated utilizing the formula in the King County Ordinance11621. The resulting figures are based on the District's cost per dwelling unit to purchase land for school sites, make site improvements, construct schools and purchase, install or relocate temporary facilities (Porlables), Credits have also been applied in the formula to account for State School Construction Funding Assistance expected to be reimbursed to the District and projected future properly taxes to be paid by the owner of a dwelling unit, The District's cost per dwelling unit is derived by multiplying the cost per student by the applicable student generation rate per dwelling unit.

The district currently educates more than 3,700 students of a diverse and growing population. As a proud member of the Schlechty Center's Standard Bearer Network, the employees, teachers, and community work toward the success of each individual student. Due to the growing population, the Fife School district elects to prepare a Six-Year Capital Plan. The Fife School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan is prepared in compliance with the Growth Management Act (RCW 36.704) for the counties of King and Pierce and the municipalities of Edgewood, Fife, and Milton for the purposes of collecting impact fees. The Capital Facilities Plan contains a six-year capital facilities plan, enrollment projections, standard of service, and overall capacity. Additional information is included to support the capital plan for the various comprehensive plans in the Fife School district. As a component of the Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan, the district has incorporated aspects of its long-range capital plan designed to reinforce the strategic mission and vision of the district and enhance the education and safety of all students. As a district that encompasses more than one jurisdiction, many aspects of information reside in multiple places and for the purposes of this plan are integrated into one data set. ln addition, the district has historically seen significant growth due to its standards of service, dedication to its community, and location near to Tacoma and Seattle. As such, the Six-year Capital Facilities Plan, updated and adopted by the School District Board annually, continues to adjust to the changing needs of the community it serves. llPage#*;-Attachment K to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2025 BACKGROUND District lntroduction The Fife School District encompasses parts of Fife, Milton, Edgewood, unincorporated areas of Trout Lake, Jovita, Fife Heights within Pierce and King County, and a portion of the Port of Tacoma. The boundaries of the district do not coincide with any single municipality or government boundary. According to the Office of Financial Management (2018) more than 22,000 people are estimated to reside within the 10 square miles of the district boundaries. The district currently educates more than 3,700 students in a diverse and growing population. As a proud member of the Schlechty Center's Standard Bearer Network, the district works toward the success of each individual student believing that \"all students deserve our attention, the opportunity to be engaged in high quality work, support and encouragement as they progress in our learning system\" (Fife Public Schools Mission). The Fife School district includes six schools under the following grade level configurations: r Pre-kindergarten for special needs through first grade at Discovery Primary School o Second through fifth grades at Endeavour lntermediate School and Alive V. Hedden Elementary School r Sixth through seventh grades at Surprise Lake Middle School . Eighth through ninth grades at Columbia Junior High School r Tenth through twelfth grades at Fife High School 2lPage.,r'o*n*'\"Attachment K to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 201\"9 -2025 Capital Plan lntroduction The Fife School District Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan is prepared in compliance with the Growth Management Act (RCW 36.70A) for the counties of King and Pierce and the municipalities of Edgewood, Fife, and Milton for the purposes of collecting impact fees. The Capital Facilities Plan contains . standard of service,o facilitiesinventory, o enrollmentprojections, . capacity, and r a six-year capital improvement plan. Additional information is included to support the capital plan and for the various comprehensive plans in the Fife School district. The Growth Management Act (GMA) authorizes jurisdictions to collect impact fees to supplement funding of additional public facilities needed to accommodate new development. To collect impact fees, a localjurisdiction must have adopted a GMA school impact fee ordinance, and must approve the district's Capital Facilities Plan as a component of their comprehensive plan. The district will utilize the State Subdivision Act and the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA) to collect mitigation fees in those jurisdictions where there is no GMA impact fee ordinance. 3lPage,.& Fite Prlriic khelsAttachment K to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2025 STANDARD *T 5EHVIi:[ Fife School district is committed to providing \"...an engaging and safe environment where learning is linked to life\" (Fife Public Schools Mission Statement), As a Standard Bearer district, Fife is a leader in school reform and is committed to giving all students the \"...opportunity to be engaged in high quality student work, support and encouragement as they progress in our learning system\" (Fife Public Schools Strategic Plan Adopted 2015). As part of the district's commitment to a high standard of learning, each school building develops a School lmprovement Plan identifying the strategic goals of the building as well as their alignment to the district's strategic plan. Keeping class sizes at an optimal level is a critical component in reaching these goals. Due to incredible community support, and increased basic education funding from the State, the district is able to set this standard at approximately L8-25 students per class, with first priority at the primary grade levels (K - 4). Students are provided traditional basic education programs which include reading, writing, math, socialstudies, science, physicaleducation, health, music and art. Additionally, there are scheduled times in computer labs and a number of special programs such as special education, English Language Learners (ELL), preschool, remediation and other programs designed to serve special populations. Every year, the school district board adopts its annual budget approving the number of teachers to meet the target class sizes. The district budgets to maximize support from Washington State according to the formulas of RCW 284.150.260. Due to growth in the district, some class sizes are larger than the district's target to accommodate incoming students. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS There are three elementary schools in the district serving special needs pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and first grades in Discovery Primary, and second through fifth grades in Hedden Elementary and Endeavour lntermediate. As noted earlier, the district's standard of service aims to keep class sizes for elementary students small ranging from 18-25 students per a class with a prioritization on kindergarten through fourth grades being closer to 18 students per room. ln addition, the special needs pre-kindergarten students require smaller student to teacher ratios. However, due to their unique programmatic needs, these rooms are not included in the projected capacity needs. 4lPagete, Fife l&bllq Ectel*Attachment K to PO 2019-0416 Capital Facilities Plan 2019 -2025 MIDDLE SCHOOL AND JUNIOR HIGH The basic education programs for the middle school and junior high school are similar in many of their components including mathematics, science, language arts, health, and physical education. The district's standard of service for middle and junior high schools tries to keep the class sizes to approximately 25 students. FIFE HIGH SCHOOL Fife High School aims to maintain a standard of service that has twenty-five or less students in each classroom depending on the subject taught. The current grade configuration of the school is tenth through twelfth grades with ninth grade at Columbia Junior High. There is consideration of the district to reconfigure the grades in the future to a comprehensive ninth through twelfth grade high school. Any changes as a result of this will be included in future plans. 5lPagef,\")vs$ Iifr Prhlir g{hwl6Altachment K to (GMA) (RCW 36.704.020) states as a goal to \".,,ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.\" The Capital Facilities lnventory identifies the existing facilities providing services for the Fife School district.

These methods are widely used across the state and nationally and are recognized as providing accurate short- term projections. The method does not incorporate real-time population changes and the Fife School district resides within one of the fastest growing regions nationally. As such, actual student enrollment frequently exceeds the projected enrollment. The Cohort Survival Method computes progressive ratios for each grade level and averages those ratios over the past five years. The average ratio is then multiplied by the actual current year's enrollment using the October headcount for each grade to project the enrollment in the next grade for the next year. For example, the average ratio over the past five years for second grade is multiplied by the current first grade class to project the enrollment when they enter the second grade. This method does not take into account migration of new students moving into the district. To anticipate enrollment impacts from students moving into the district, comprehensive plans and population statistics from the counties and cities in and surrounding the district are compared to the projected student enrollment from the Cohort Survival Method to develop long-range capital plans. Due to the district's unique geography covering parts of three cities and two counties, no single source of current information is available, The Office of Financial Management (OFM) provides a school district Small Area Estimate Program (SAEP), estimated historical population counts by school district, as well as estimated historical population counts by cities and counties. These estimates are approximations and may have an error rate of 5-I5% for every 1,000 in population. However, this information is usefulto indicate trends in growth' According to the schooldistrict SAEP, Fife School district grew 9.74% between 2010 and 2018 at a rate between 3-4Yo annually prior to the recession. Post-recession, this growth slowed significantly to an average of t.2% with the most recent few years showing an average of nearly 2% growth year over year. 8lPage{r} fit4 publi.

Tlre Sl.ate change in population during the same time period grew 10.45% ln addition to a retrospective look at population growth and trends, OFM provides population projections every five years by county, ln2017 these projections were updated and show Pierce County increasing 1.3.43% in ten years and 23.71% in twenty years. This is slightly higher than the state which is projected to increase 12.89% in ten years, and23.63% in twenty years. The Cohort Survival Method's annual average increase in enrollment projections falls within a 1,-2% growth range, however, actual population growth is outpacing these projections. Another factor in considering population growth and therefore continued School District enrollment growth is the availability of buildable lands for housing units. Pierce County, in partnership with each city, updated the buildable land report in 2014. At that time, it was estimated that the communities within the Fife School District have the capacity to accommodate 7,527 housing units including an adjusted developable land capacityfor Edgewood as described in their recently updated comprehensive plan (2015). ln addition, the entering kindergarten class requires a different projection method asthere is no existing cohort. This enrollment is projected usingthe average historical birth rates reported by the Washington State Department of Health for Puyallup and Tacoma, cities adjacent to the Fife School district. The birth rate information for Puyallup, adjacent to the Fife School district to the east and south east, and Tacoma, adjacent to the Fife School district to the northwest and west, 9lPageAttachment K to PO 2019-0416 C.& f iro lAh'li.

The district takes into account several factors when determining their capacity and space needs. o Standard of service by elementary, middle, and high school. o Number of teachers currently and projected to be assigned under the district's standard of service. e Planned capacity of a facility when originally built or after the last major remodel. o Programmatic uses within a facility that may or may not align with the original intended use of the space.o Number of classrooms needed to meet the basic education programmatic needs within each school. Special programs significantly affect school capacity by the need for separate space, scheduling accommodations, mandated program requirements, and population changes. Rooms designed for special use are not counted as classrooms. The projected capacity and space needs utilizes the count of classrooms from the original built floor plans or latest major renovation less any spaces modified to accommodate program changes that remove the classroom from its intended use. For example, Discovery Primary School did not originally plan for three special education classrooms and other core services which removed six rooms from its planned built capacity. Program capacity assumes a standard level of service as adopted by the school district during their annual budget approval process while also trying to maximize state allocations of support. The district aims to keep class sizes at a headcount between 18-25 and as such uses this range when planning for teachers. Actual student headcount varies year to year and may exceed capacity. For reference, the table below illustrates the current Washington State allocation and proposed as voted. The Fife School District budgets to maximize this allocation. The voters of Washington State passed lnitiative 1351 in 2014 reducing class sizes.

For every year there is a delay in proceeding, escalation will need to be added increasing the overall cost of construction. Escalation is estimated to be 3.1% according to OFM. Actual construction costs have varied higher and lower than 3.1% and may impact the projects as they move forward. ln addition, an allowance for site costs, interior improvements, furniture, and other related expenses are included in the projected project costs. The amounts below do not include any additional finance costs that would result in a bond and/or state match different from what is displayed.PROJECTED CAPITAL COSTS L5 lPage{* Capital Facilities Plan 2019 - 2025Attachment K to PO 2019-0416 Fi*o PgMi< *l6ds Table 5 - Estimated Near-term Total Project Costs PHASE lA Relocate Educational Service Center - Site To Be Determined 5 8,598,000 77,500 ONGOING District Wide lnfrastructure lmprovements Project s lPage# Fito -2025 th4PAC| r[$ lmpact fees are calculated on the basis of the facilities needed to house students from new residential development. lncluded in the calculation are Student Generation Rates (SGR). These are the number of students expected to come from each housing unit within these new developments. ln March 2019 the district hired a consultant, to update their Student Generation Rates. Thestudyareaincludedalloftheterritorywithintheboundaryofthedistrict. Theanalysis was based on current student address data and on all residential development projects within the study area during a five year time period from 2Ot4 through 20L8. The analysis involved comparing student street addresses with residential development street addresses to identify cases in which current students were living at new housing units. The data was aggregated to show the number of students per grade grouping for each type of residential development. Student generates were calculated by dividing the number of students living at new housing units by the total number of new housing units for different categories. lt is important to note as a result of this new study, there is a significant decrease in the multifamily student generation rate over the prior period. This results in a decrease in the calculated impact fee for multi family units. The district believes, however, this decrease is temporary. There are over 300 multi family units within the district boundary that are scheduled to become available within a year that will bring thesc rates back up. The individual student generation rates are shown on Table 6 in the Appendix lmpact fees for Fife School District are shown on Table 7 , page L9. Based on current calculations, the single-family rate is calculated at 54,531.

Executive Summary This six-year Capital Facilities Plan (the \"Plan\") has been prepared by the Auburn School District (the \"District\") as the District's principal planning document, in compliance with the requirements of Washington's Growth Management Act and the adopted ordinances of the counties and cities served by the District. This Plan was prepared using data available in the spring o'f 2019. This Plan is consistent with prior longterm capital facilities plans adopted by the District. However, this Plan is not intended to be the sole plan for all of the District's needs, The District may prepare interim and periodic long-range Capital Facilities Plans consistent with Board Policies and actions, taking into account a longer or a shorter time period; other factors and trends in the use of facilities; and other needs of the District as may be required. However, any such plan or plans will be consistent with this six-year Capital Facilities Plan. To enable the collection of impact fees in the unincorporated areas of King County and within the City of Auburn and City of Kent; the King County Council, the City of Auburn and the City of Kent will adopt this Plan by reference as part of each jurisdiction's respective comprehensive plan. To enable the collection of impact fees in the Cities of Algona, Pacific, and Black Diamond, these municipalities must also adopt this Plan and adopt school impact fee ordinances. Pursuant to the requirements of the Growth Management Act and the local ordinances, this Plan will be updated on an annual basis, and any changes in the fee schedule(s) adjusted accordingly. The Plan establishes the District's \"standard of service\" in order to ascertain the District's current and future capacity. While the State Superintendent of Public lnstruction establishes square footage guidelines for capacity, those guidelines do not account for the local program needs of the District. The Growth Management Act and the school impact fee ordinance authorize the District to define its standard of service based on the District's specific needs. ln general, the District's current standard provides that class size for grades K-3 should not exceed 17 students and class size for grades 4-5 should not exceed 25 students. When averaged over the six elementary grades, this computes to 19.67 students per classroom. Class size for grades 6-12 should not exceed 30 students, with some subject areas restricted to lesser numbers. Decisions by current legislative actions may create the need for additional classrooms. (See Section lll for more specific information.) The capacity of the schools in the District is calculated based on this standard of service and the existing inventory of facilities including transitional classrooms. The District's 2018-19 capacity was 14,226. The actual number of individual students was 16,949 as of October 1,2018. (See Section V for more specific information.) 2Attachment L to PO 2019-0416 The Capital Construction Plan shown in Section Vl addresses the additions and proposed modernization to the District's existing facilities. The plan includes the replacement of five elementary schools and one middle school, construction of two new elementary schools, and acquisition of future school sites to accommodate growth. The new facilities are required to meet the projected elementary school class size reductions mandated by the State of Washington and student population increases generated by the large development areas within the Auburn School District. Three areas that have significant impact on the school district are the Lakeland South, Lea Hill, and the Auburn west hill and valley areas of the district. There are other pockets of development that impact the District as well. The District completed a comprehensive review of all district facilities in October 2008. A Steering Committee made recommendations to the Board for capital improvements to existing facilities and replacement of seven schools over the next ten years. These recommendations led to a capital improvements levy and a bond issue that was placed on the ballot in March 2009. Both ballot measures were unsuccessful in March. The Board determined to rerun only the capital improvements levy in November 2009, which the voters approved. ln the fall o'f 2011, the Board determined to move forurard with the Auburn High School Modernization and Reconstruction Project and placed the project before the voters in February of 2012. The bond issue was supported by the community at nearly 57oh approval rate, but was short of the super majority requirement of 60%. ln March of 2012, the Board determined to rerun the bond in November of 2012. ln November 2Q12, the bond passed al62%. The project was completed during the summer of 2016. ln the spring of 2016, the Board determined to move fon,uard with the replacement of six sultools and the construction of two new elementary schools. The project was placccl before the voters in November 2016 and the bond passe d al62.83%. The first of the projects, the replacement of Olympic Middle School, started construction in May 2018 and will open in Fall 2019. Construction of new Elementary School #15 started in May 2019 and construction for the replacement of Dick Scobee Elementary School will start in June 2019. The School lmpact Fee Ordinances adopted by King County, the City of Auburn and the City of Kent provide for the assessment of impact fees to assist in meeting some of the fiscal impacts incurred by a district experiencing growth and development. Section Vll sets forth the proposed school impaci fees for single family and multi-family dwelling units. The student generation factors have been developed using the students who actually attend school in the Auburn School District from single family and multi-family developments constructed in the last five years. There have been dramatic changes in the student generation factors for single and multi-family in the past five years. The District plans to carefully monitor the numbers over the next several years to determine if this is a trend or an anomaly. The method of collecting the data is with the use of GIS mapping software, data from King County and Pierce County GlS, data from Davis Demographics and integration of the mapping with student data from the District's student data system. This method gives the District actual student generation numbers for each grade span for identified developments. This data is contained in Appendix A.3. 3Attachment L to PO 2019-0416 Auburn School District No. 408 CAPITAL FAClLITIES PLAN 2019 through 2025 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Listed below is a summary level outline of the changes from the 2018 Capital Facilities Plan that are a part of the 2019 Plan.

The Superintendent of Pubtic lnstruction esfab/ishes square footage \"capacity\" guidelines for computing state funding support. The fundamental purpose of the SPt guidetines is to provide a vehicle to equitably distribute state matching funds for school construction projects. By defautt these guidellnes have bccn used to benchmark the district's capacity to house its student population. The SPt guidelines do not make adequate provision for lc.tcal district program needs, facitity configurations, emerging educational reform, or the dynamics of each sfudenf's educational program. The Auburn Schoot District Standard of Service addresses those local considerations that require space in excess of the SPI guidetines. The effect on the space requirements for both permanent and relocatable facitities is shown betow for each grade articulation pattern. Conditions that may result in potentialspace needs are provided for information purposes without acco nt p any i n g co m p u t ali o n s. OVERVIEW The Auburn School District operates fourteen elementary schools housing 7,872 students in grades K through 5. The four middle schools house 3,719 students in grades 6 through 8. The District operates three comprehensive senior high schools and one alternative high school, housing 5,358 students in grades 9 through 12. ct,Ass srzE The number of pupils per classroom determines the number of classrooms required to house the student population. Specialists create additional space needs. Class sizes are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Changes to class size agreements can have significant impact on available space. Thc currcnt pupiliteacher limit across all elenrentary pl'ogralrs is arr average nf 19.87 stuclerrts per teacher. Consistent with this staffing limit, room capacities are set at 19.67 students per roorl at grades K - 5. At grades 6 - 12 the limit is sct at 30 students per room.

Table lV.2 shows the number and location of each portable unit by school. The district uses relocatable facilities to:1. provide interim housing in school attendance areas uniquely impacted by increasing school populations that would otherwise require continual redistricting,2. make space available for changing program requirements and offerings determined by unique student needs, and3. provide housing to cover district needs until permanent facilities can be financed and constructed. Relocatable facilities are deemed to be interim, stop gap measures that often place undesirable stress on existing physical plants. Core facilities (i.e. gymnasiums, restrooms, kitchens, labs, lockers, libraries, etc.) are not of sufficient size or quantity to handle the increased school population served by adding relocatable classrooms.

The result of this committee's work was published in the document titled 'Guidelines for Developmenf.' ln 1985 the Board formed a second Ad Hoc citizens committee to further the work of the first and address the needs of the District for subsequent years. The work of this committee was published in the document litled'Directions for the Nineties.' ln '1995 the tsoard commissioned a third Ad Hoc citizens committee to make recommendations for improvements to the District's programs and physical facilities. The committee recommendations are published in the document titled Education lnto The Twenty-First Century - - A Community lnvolved.' The 1995 Ad Hoc committee recommended the District develop plans for the implementation, funding, and deployment of technology tlrrouglrout the District's programs. The 1996 Bond proposition provided funding to enhance the capacity of each facility to accommodate technological applications. The 1998 Capital Levy pruvided furrdirrg to further deploy technology at a level sufficient to support program requirements in every classroom and department. ln 2005 and 2014, replacement technology levies were approved to continue to support technology across allfacets of the District's teaching, learning and operations. ln addition to the technology needs of the District, the Ad Hoc committee recognized the District must prepare for continued student enrollment growth. As stated in their report, \"the District must pursue an appropriate high school site as soon as possible.\" The Ad Hoc recommendation included commentary that the financing should be timed to maintain consistent rates of tax assessments. A proposition was approved by the voters on April 28, 1998 that provided $8,000,000 over six years to address some of the technology needs of the District; and $5,000,000 to provide funds to acqrrire school sites. During the 1997-98 schoolyear, a Joint District Citizen's Ad Hoc Conrnrittee lrow best tr.r uerve the school population from an area that includes a large development known as Lakeland South. Lakeland South at that time was immediately adjacent to the southern boundary of the Auburn School District. On June 16, 1998, the Ad Hoc Committee presented its recommendation at a joint meeting of the Auburn and Dieringer Boards of Directors. On June 22, 1998, the Auburn School Board adopted Resolution No. 933 authorizing the process to initiate the adjustment of the boundaries of the District in accordance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation. On June 23, 1998, the Dieringer School Board adopted a companion Resolution No. 24-97-98 authorizing the process to initiate the adjustment of the boundaries in accordance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation. These actions resulted in the transfer of an area from Dieringer to Auburn containing most of the Lakeland South development and certain other undeveloped properties. Property for the third comprehensive high school was acquired in 1999. The Board placed the proposition to construction a new high school on the ballot four times. Each election was extremely close to passing. After the fourth failure a community meeting was held and from that meeting the Board determined need for further community study. ln April of 2002, the Board formed a fifth citizen's Ad Hoc committee to address the following two items and make recommendations to the Board in the Fall of 2002:a. A review of the conclusion and recommendations of 1985 and 1995 Ad Hoc Committees related to accommodating high school enrollment groMh. This included the review of possible financing plans for new facilities.b. Develop recommendations for accommodating high school enrollment growth for the next 10 years if a new senior high school is not built. 24Attachment L to PO 201 9-0416 Auburn School District No. 408 CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN 2019 through 2025 CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PLAN This committee recommended the Board place the high school on the ballot for the fifth time in February 2003. The February election approved the new high school at 68.71% yes votes. The school opened in the fall of 2005. ln the fall of 2003, the Board directed the administration to begin the planning and design for Elementary #13 and Elementary #14. ln the fall of 2004, the Board passed Resolution No. '1054 to place two elementary schools on the ballot in February 2005. The voters approved the ballot measure in February of 2005 a|64.72%. Lakeland Hills Elementary (Elementary #13) opened in the fall of 2006. Arthur Jacobsen Elementary (Elementary #14) is located in the Lea Hill area and opened in the fall o'f 2007. These two elementary schools were built to accommodate the housing growth in Lakeland Hills and Lea Hill areas of the school district. ln the 2004-05 school year, the Board convened a sixth Citizen's Ad Hoc committee to again study and make recommendations about the future impacts in the District. One of the areas of study was the need for New Facilities and Modernization. The committee made a number of recommendations including school size, the need for a new middle school, and to begin a capital improvements program to modernize or replace facilities based upon criterion. During the 2005-06 school year, a Joint District Citizen's Ad Hoc Committee was appointed by the Auburn and Kent School Boards to make recommendations on how best to serve the school population that will come from an area that includes a number of projected developments in the north Auburn valley. On May 17,2006, the Ad Hoc Committee presented its recommendation at a joint meeting of the Auburn and Kent Boards of Directors. On June 14,2006, the Kent School Board adopted Resolution No. 1225 authorizing the process to initiate the adjustment of the boundaries of the District in accordance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation. On June 26, 2006, the Auburn School Board adopted a companion Resolution No. 1073 authorizing the process to initiate the adjustment of the boundaries in accordance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation. These actions resulted in the transfer of an area from the Kent School District to the Auburn School District effective September 29, 2006. ln October of 2008, after two years of review and study, a Steering Committee made recommendations to the Board regarding the capital improvements program to modernize or replace facilities as recommended by the 2004-05 Citizen's Ad Hoc Committee. These recommendations, based on specific criteria, led to the Board placing a school improvement bond and capital improvements levy on the ballot in March 2009. Voters did not approve either measure that would have updated 24 facilities and replaced three aging schools. The Board decided to place only a six- year Capital Levy on the ballot in November of 2009, which passed at 55.'17%. The levy funded $46.4 million of needed improvement projects at 24 sites over the following seven school years. Planning for the replacement of aging schools was started with educational specifications and schematic design process for the replacement of Auburn High School. The District acquired a site for a future high school in 2008 and a second site for a future middle school in 2009. The District also continued efforts to acquire property around Auburn High School. The Special Education Transition Facility opened in February of 2010. This facility is designed for students with disabilities that are 1B to 21 years old. ln the November 2012 election, the community supported the $110 million bond issue for the Auburn High School Modernization and Reconstruction Project al62%. Construction began in February 2013. The entire new building was occupied by Auburn High School students and staff in the fall of 2015, with site improvements being completed during the 2015-16 school year. 25It !Attachment L to PO 2019-04'16 Auburn School District No. 408 CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN 2019 through 2025 CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PLAN ln January 2015, a citizen's ad hoc committee was convened by direction of the Board to address growth and facilities. The major recommendations were to construct two new elementary schools in the next four years and to acquire 3 new elementary school sites as soon as possible. ln the November 2016 election, the community supported the $456 million bond issue for the replacement of six schools and the construction of two new elementary schools al62.B3a/o. Construction for the replacement of Olympic Middle School began in May 20'lB and will be completed in Fall 2019. Construction for New Elementary School#15 began in May 2019. Within the six-year period, the District is projecting 2,104 additional students. This increase in student population along with anticipated class-size reductions, will require the construction of two new elementary schools and acquiring one new elementary school site during the six-year window. The table below illustrates the current capital construr:tion plarr fur [1re rrexl six years. Tlre exact timelines are wholly dependent on the rate of growth in the school age population. 1/ These funds may be secured through a combination of the 2016 Bond lssue, sale of real property, im pact fees, and state matching funds.

These assumptions are 'Judgnental\" by definition. Forecasting can be defined as the extrapolation or logical extension from history to the future, or frorn the known to the unknown. The attached tabular data reviews the history of student enrollment, sets out sorne quantitative assumptions, and provides projections based on these numerical factors. The projection logic does not attempt to weigh the individual sociological, psychological, economic, and political factors that are present in any demographic analysis and projection. The logic embraces the assumptions that whatever these individual factors have been in the past are present today, and will be in the future. It further moderates the impact of singular factors by averaging data over thirteen years and six years respectively. The results provide a trend, which reflects a long ( 1 3-year) and a short (6-year) base from which to extrapolate. Two methods of estimating the number of kindergarten students have been used. The first uses the average increase or decrease over the past 13 and 6-year time frame and adds it to each succeeding year. The second derives what the average percentage Auburn kindergartners have been of live births in King County for the past 5 years and uses this to project the subsequent four years. The degree to which the actuals deviate from the projections can only be measured after the fact. This deviation provides a point ofdeparture to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe assumptions and logic being used to calculate future projections. Monitoring deviation is critical to the viability and credibility ofthe projections derived by these techniques. Tables Table I - Thirteen Year Histo?) o-f October I Enrollments - page 3 The data shown in this table is the baseline information used to project future enrolhnent. This data shows the past record of enrollment in the district on October 1 of each year. Table 2 * Historical Factors Used in Proiections - page 4 This table shows the three basic factors derived from the data in Table l. These factors have been used in the subsequent projections. The three factors are: r Factor 1 - Average Pupil Change Between Grade Levels This factor is sometimes referred to as the \"holding power\" or \"cohort survival.\" It is a measure of the number of pupils gained or lost as they move from one grade level to the next.o Factor 2- Average Pupil Change by Grade Level This factor is the average change at each grade level over the 1 3 or 6-year period, o Factor 3 - Auburn School District Kindergarten Enrollment as a Function of King County Live Births. This factor calculates what percent each kindergarten class was of the King County live births in the five previous years. From this information has been extrapolated the kindergarten pupils expected for the next four years.Attachment L to PO 2019-0416 Table 3 - Projection Models -pages 5-13 This set oftables utilizes the above mentioned variables and generates several projections. The models are explained briefly below. tr Table 3. 1 3 (pg 5) - shows a projection based on the 1 3-year average gain in kindergarten (Factor 2) and the 13-year average change between grade levels (Factor 1).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Six-Year Capital Facilities Plan (the \"Plan\") was prepared by Renton School District (the \"District\") in compliance with the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA, the Act), King County Code Title21A.43, and applicable ordinances of the cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Renton. It is the District's intent that the Plan be adopted by King County and the cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Renton as a sub-element of their respective Capital Facilities Plans, and that that those jurisdictions assess and collect school impact fees on behalf of the District, as empowered by the GMA. This Plan, however, is not intended to be the sole planning instrument developed by the District to determine its capital facility needs. The GMA was adopted by the State legislature in 1990 in response to rapidly increasing development; most notably in King County and the surrounding central Puget Sound area. The Act requires state and local governments to manage Washington's growth by developing and implementing comprehensive land-use and transportation plans, by designating Urban Growth Areas, and by protecting natural resources and environmentally critical areas. The Capital Facilities Plan is one element of a County or City's Comprehensive Plan that addresses existing public facility capacities, forecasts future public facility needs, presents a plan for expanding existing facilities or constructing new facilities to meet those needs, and indicates how those public facility improvements are to be financed. The GMA empowers jurisdictions to assess and collect impact fees as one means of financing new public facilities necessitated by private development. This Capital Facilities Plan addresses the impact of growth on public school facilities by examining: 1. anticipated growth of the District's student population over the next six years; 2. the ability of existing and proposed classroom facilities to adequately house those students based on the District's current Standard of Service; 3. the need for additional enrollment driven capital facilities; 4. the method of financing those capital improvements; and 5. calculation of school impact fees based on, among other variables, the number of students generated by recent residential development (student generation factors). This plan is updated annually and submitted to local goveraments for inclusion as a sub- element in their Capital Facilities Plans. Past Plans have been adopted by King County and the Cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Renton. The District is currently engaged in dialogue with the cities of Tukwila and SeaTac regarding implementation of impact fees within their jurisdictions. Enrollment Projections : Enrollment projections provided by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPD, as adjusted by Renton School District, indicate a moderate overall increase in K-12 -1-Attachment M to PO 2019-XXXX enrollment over the next six years of just under two percent (2%). This overall increase is driven by a healthy I4%o projected increase at the high school grade levels , and amoderate 3.86% at the middle school grade levels. Countering these growths is a projected decrease at the elementary grade levels of 5.670/o, or 434 students. Current Capacity: Studcnt capacity of existing, pennanent K-12 facilitics, exclutling special education facilities and facilities housing alternative leaming environments, is 14,788. Based on current enrollment (October 1,2078 headcount), the District is showing a permanent facility deficit of 755 at the elementary level, drastically reduced fiom last year's deficit of 1,244, due to the opening of the new Sartori Elementary School. Middle school capacity continues to exceed current shldcnt cnrollment, but only by a margin of 44, while current high school enrollment results in a surplus capacity of 245. Elementary school capacity still remains the District's greatest challenge. Relying heavily on the use of relocatable classrooms (portables) to accommodate the ever-increasing and fluctuating student population, portables at elementary schools now accounting for over 15% of the District's total K - 5 facility capacity. Portables are, however, not considered permanent structures, and are therefore not included in the inventory of permanent facilities. They are viewed as a short-term solution for managing enrollment fluctuation, and housing students on a temporary basis until permanent tacrlities c{tn be constructcd. They are not a long-term solution. Enrollment Projections and Future Capacity: Based on OSPI's conservative projections, K-12 eruollrnent will continue to grow at arate of I%o - 2o/o per year, as it has done in the past. But as middle and high school enrollments increase over the next six years by 131 and 593 students, respectively, we can expect a decrease at the elementary grade levels of 434 students over that same period of time. Even with the opening of the new Sartori Elementary School this past fall, and factoring in the projected decrease in elementary school enrollment over the next six years, current capacity indicates that the District will still be facing a deficit capacity of 321by the start of the 2024 - 25 school year. The construction of a new elementary school will eliminate that deficit. Over the next six years, the current high school surplus capacity of 245 will constantly decrease, with a projected deficit of 264 by the school year 2024-25. Similarly, the current surplus capacity of 44 at the middle school level will become a deficit as early as next year, fluctuating between 87 and 269 over the next six years. Options on addressing mitigation of secondary facility deficits will need to be considered, but are not addressed in this Plan. Capital Construction Plan: For the next six-year period, the District's highest priorities will be addressing existing and projected facility capacity deficits, both enrollment and program related. This includes: -2-2019 Caoital Facilities PlanAttachment M to PO 2019-XXXX Renton School District No.403 o Construction of a new elementary school within the Hazen High School service area, where the majority of growth has and continues to occur. o High school additions andlor upgrades to create additional science classroom/laboratory space to address changes in State graduation requirements, and . Acquisition of land for future development. Other high priority capital improvements will fall into one or more of the following major categories; Safety and Security, Energy Conservation, Site Improvements, and Building Upgrades. Improvements will occur district-wide, affecting nearly all District facilities, achieving and maintaining the level of service necessary to provide safe, healthy, and nurluring learning environments for all students. These improvements are not necessarily enrollment related. The District will also be exploring options for future expansion of its high school facilities, As an alternative to constructing a fourth high school, the feasibility of expanding existing facilities at the Lindbergh High School and Renton High School sites will be considered. Finance Plan: The primary funding sources for capital facilities projects over the next six years include remaining funds from the 2016 capital levy; school impact fees currently being collected by King County and the cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Renton; and, future bond initiatives. Expenditures for enrollment driven projects over the next six years are estimated at $72,020,000, of which approximately 5% are secured by previously collected impact fees The remaining, unsecured,95o/o would be funded primarily by a proposed 2019 bond initiative and future impact fees. Impact Fees: Impact fees were calculated in conformance with King County Council Ordinance 11627, Attachment A, resulting in a decrease in single-family fees of $ l5 per unit, and an increase in multi-family fees of $ 1,185 per unit. The primary variables contributing to these changes were student generation factors (SGFs) and construction costs. While higher construction costs and SGFs combined to increase multi-family fees, higher construction costs and lower SGFs combined to neutralize any significant change. A comparison of current and last year's fees is shown below. IMPACT FEES 2018 2019 CHANGE SINGLE-FAMILY $6,877 $6,862 ($15) MULTI-FAMILY 2019-0416 I Facil Re -4-Attachment M to PO 2019-0416 il. CAPACITY METHODOLOGY STANDARD OF SERVICE The Renton School District Standard of Service is the standard adopted by the District that identifies the program year, school organizational structure, student/teacher ratios by grade level (taking into account the requirements of students with special needs), daily class schedule, types of facilities and other factors identified by the District to be benef,rcial in supporting its educational programs and objectives. The Standard of Service is the major determining factor, together with the number of classrooms (teaching stations) in calculating facility capacity. The District has adopted a traditional elementary/middle/high school organizational structure that houses kindergarten through Grade 5 in elementary schools, Grades 6 through 8 in middle schools, and Grades 9 through 12 in high schools. The school-year calendar adopted by the District is also traditional; typically beginning in late August and ending in mid-June. Similarly, the District maintains a fairly common daily schedule, with classes beginning between 7:20 and 9:30 a.m. and ending befween 2:03 and 3:10 p.m., depending on grade level. The District, and the Renton Education Association, recognize that reasonable class size rs necessary for optimum learning, and have established the following student/teacher ratios: The 29:1 ratio at the secondary level applies to all Language Arts, Social Studies, Science, Math, World Languages, World Language Exploratory and Health classes. Other ratios apply as follows:Grade Levels K-1 Grade Level2 Grade Level3 Grade Levels 4-12 Band/Orchestra Choir purposes of this report, the student lteacher ratio for special education classes held in self-contained classrooms within comprehensive elementary and secondary facilities is assumed to be 12:1. Educational facilities dedicated solely to special education or other specialized programs are excluded from capacity calculations, as are associated student headcounts. -5-Attachment N/ to PO 2019-0416 201 9 Caoital Facilities Plan RentonSchool District No.403 In response to new State and District graduation requirements, begiruring with the 2018- 2019 school year, all District high schools have changed from a semester system to a trimester system, resulting in the following: o Three l2-week terms instead of two 1 8-week terms,. Five 72-minute periods per day instead of six 57-minute periods, andr Reduction of classroom efficiency from 83o/o to 80%, reducing facility capacity. Student/teacher ratios, referenced earlier, are applicable to both permanent and relocatable classrooms. However, inasmuch as relocatable facilities do not generally allow for the full range of educational activities promoted by the District, they are generally viewed as temporary or interim housing, necessary to accommodate enrollment fluctuations and developnrettl tlriven effollmeut incleases, but only until such Lime as pennanent facilities can be financed and constructed. For those reasons, relocatoble clossrooms oapaoities are calculated, but not used in the analysis of future facility needs. PRACTICAL CAPACITY MODEL The Practical Capacity Model calculates building capacity based on limitations that existing facilities place on enrollment as a result of current educational program needs, operating policy and contractual restrictions. Thc calculation is made hy reviewing the use of each classroom/teachirrg station in each fauility. Ft-rr every room housing students, a calculation is made, assigning a maximurrr numbel of students per room. Sometimes the capacity of corc facilitics, such as the cafctcria or gym, or the quantity of restroom fixtures, may linrit lacility capacit.y to a level below that calculated by collective classroom capacity levels. Capacity at the secondary school level is fuither limited by class scheduling restrictions and student distribution among elective classes. Based on a typical middle school six-period day, where one period is designated for teacher planning, capacity is reduced by one-sixth, or 17 percent, of theoretical capacity. Similarly, at high schools, with the newly established five-period day, capacity is reduced by one-fifth, or 20 percent. Elective classes, many of which require specialized classrooms, also figure into the equation for determining a school's capacity, which together with required classes, require a well thought out Master Schedule if the facility's capacity is to be maximized. Although not reflected in this year's update, fufure building capacity will be affected by the reduced student/teacher ratios for grades K-3 as prescribed by the McCleary Act. A 2015 survey conducted as part of the K-3 Classroom Reduction Grant Program, authorized by SSB 6080, and validated under the auspices of OSPI, indicated that Renton School District will require an additional42 classrooms to meet the required K-3 studentlteacher ratio of 1 7 : 1 . This is the equivalent of two new schools. While State prescribed student lteacher ratio changes will affect future facility capacity, it is not addressed in this Plan, as the changes are not directly driven by growth. -6-Attachment M to PO 2019-0416 2019 Caoital Facilities Plan Renton School District No. 403 ilI. INVENTORY AND CAPACITY OF FACILITIES Renton School District's capital facilities include both permanent structures and relocatable (porlable) classrooms. Permanent facilities are further categoized as either K-12 (traditional elementary, middle and high school configurations), Special Instructional Use, or Non-instructional Support Facilities. The District maintains atotal of 32 permanent and 55 relocatable facilities serving a total student population of 15,393 (October 2018 headcount). The District's permanent K-12 facilities include 15 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, and 4 high schools. Two Special Instructional Use facilities house the District's early childhood, special education and alteffrative leaming programs. Support facilities include the Kohlwes Education Center (admin.), Transportation Center, Facilities Operations and Maintenance Center, Nutrition Services/Warehouse, Renton Memorial Stadium and the Lindbergh Swimming Pool. Total permanent facilities encompass 2,595,263 square feet, with2,417,847 square feet (93%) devoted to K-l2 and instructional special use. See Appendix A for District Maps. The District's relocatableK-12 facilities are used primarily to address enrollment fluctuations and to house students on a temporary basis until permanent facilities can be constructed. For those reasons they are not considered a long-term solution for housing students, and are not acknowledged in the calculation of the capacity of K-12 facilities. Of the 55 relocatable facilities in the District's inventory, 44 are \"double portables\" containing two classrooms, and 1 1 are singles. Combined, they provide the District with a total of 99 relocatable classrooms, encompassing88,704 square feet of additional space available for instruction. Table 2 below summarizes existing K-12 facility capacity. A complete inventory of District facilities, including undeveloped property, follows.

ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS Renton School District six-year enrollment projections through the 2024-25 school year are based on data published by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). OSPI utilizes the cohort survival method to forecast student enrollment projections for a six- year period based on actual student headcounts documented for the previous six years. Enrollment repofts prepared by the District are submitted to OSPI on a monthly basis. The District's October 1,2018 Ernollment Report, and OSPI Report No. 1049, are included in Appendix C. Renton School District six-year enrollment projections, found on the following page, reflect adjustments to OSPI's report based on the following: 1. Report structure has been modified to reflect middle school versus junior high school grade level configuration. 2. Headcount includes only K-12 students attending comprehensive instructional facilities and excludes students attending special education facilities or facilities dedicated to alternative leaming experiences. As shown in Table 6 below, current projections indicate a modest overall increase in student enrollment of 19% over the next six years. This includes a substantial 14.08% (593 students) increase in enrollment at the high school level, offset by a projected decrease in at the elementary school level of 5.68% (434 students). Middle school grade levels 6 -8 are expected to experience a moderate increase of 4.5% (131 sfudents) over the same period of time.

ENROLLMENT DRIVEN FACILITY NEEDS Table 8 compares the current permanent capacity of Renton School District facilities to current and projected ernollment for the next six years. With the opening of the new Sartori Elementary School in October, 2018, last year's elementary deficit capacity of 7,244 has been dramatically reduced by nearly 40o/o, to 7 55, However, even with projected K-5 enrollment decreases projected through the 2024 -25 school year) a new elementary school will be necessary, especially considering that current and future capacity calculations have not taken into consideration additional facilities required to implement reduced K-3 teacher/student ratios as prescribed by the McCleary Act. A current bond initiative is addressing this need for a new elementary school. At the middle school level, fluctuating enrollment projections over the next six years will most likely be accommodated by relocation of, or purchase of additional, portables. While projected enrollment increases over the next three years result in a deficit capacity of 269, the following three years indicate a decline in student enrollment, resulting in a manageable deficit of only 87. At the high school level, the District shows a decreasing surplus capacity tntlI2022,when enrollment finally overtakes capacity, resulting in a deficit of 43. This deficit continues to increase through 2024, when it reaches 264. Although the need for additional facilities based on enrolment growth is not a priority at this time, recent changes in graduation requirements have created an urgent need for additional science classrooms and laboratories This is currently being addressed in the current 2019 Bond initiative. In addition to these current and future projected permanent facility deficits at all grade levels, it should be noted that the District is also reaching its maximum limit in providing portable classrooms at its existing sites, as a result of current land use and building code requirements.

At the elementary level, even ignoring the impending reduction of K-3 class sizes, a new elementary school seems eminent. Taking reduced class size into account, additional facilities will most likely be required. Last year, Renton School District established its Citizen Facilities Advisory Committee whose responsibility it was to develop recommendations for a long-term capital facilities plan. lntegral to this plan was the prioritization of facility needs to be presented to the Board of Directors for inclusion in a 2019 Bond measure. Among the topics to be addressed by the Committee were enrollment driven needs as supported by previous Capital Facilities Plans and other data presented by the District and its consultants. On November 28, 2018, the Renfon School District Board of Directors adopted Resolution 06-18/19, providing for the submission to the voters of a Bond proposition including the prioritized needs established by the Committee.Attachment M to PO 2019-XXXX Renton School District No 4O3 -L4-Attachment M to PO 2019-XXXX 2019 Caoital Facilities Plan Renton School District No.4Q3 VI.

The District may also be eligible for funding through the OSPI School Construction Assistance Program (SCAP). The District's intent in structuring its capital improvement programs is to maintain a constant level of construction throughout the program period in order to optimize the utilization of its management capabilities. The District utilizes a combination of in-house project management (Capital Projects Office) and outside management consultants.

IMPACT FEES The GMA empowers jurisdictions to assess and collect impact fees as a means of supplementing the funding of additional public facilities necessitated by new development In the case of public schools, impact fees are assessed only on residential development. To determine an equitable school impact fee throughout unincorporated King County, King County Code 21A was adopted, establishing an impact fee formula that has in turn been adopted by the cities of Bellevue, Newcastle and Renton, in their respective enabling ordinances. The formula requires that school districts establish \"Student Generation Factors\" that estimates the number of students generated by each new single or multi- family residential unit constructed, and to establish district-specific construction costs that are unique to that district. Refer to Appendix G for substantiating documentation on Student Generation Factors. Other factors influencing impact fees include: Site Acquisition Costs - the estimated cost per acre to purchase property Building Acquisition Cost - the estimated cost to construct facilities unique to the district. New Facility Cost Models are provided in Appendix G. Temporary Facility Cost - the estimated cost per classroom to purchase and install a relocatable classroom, including site work and utilities. State Funding Assistance Credit - the amount of funding provided by the State, subject to District eligibility, based on a construction cost allocation and funding assistance percentage established by the State. Beginning in2013, the District introduced a Voluntary District Fee Adjustment component into the prescribed impact fee formula in response to the declining, and then slowly recovering, economy. This was discontinuedin2016 given improved economic conditions, especially within the construction industry.

Of those eleven districts, seven districts conduct their own surveys to develop their unique student generation factors based on district records and actual development data. The remaining four districts, including Renton, rely on averages of student factors developed by other districts. In accordance with King County Ordinance 11621, Attachment A, the District has chosen to use a county-wide average based on all districts that have performed their own student generation factor surveys as well as those that have similarly relied on county-wide data. The Student Generation Factors in the table below represent an average of the student rates calculated by the other ten school districts.
