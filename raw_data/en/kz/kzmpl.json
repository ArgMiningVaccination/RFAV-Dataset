COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai James J. Peters VA Medical Center Rutgers University University of North Texas ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This symposium is the result of work supported by Grant Number P50 AT008661-01 entitled \"Dietary Botanicals in the Preservation of Cognitive and Psychological R esilience\" of the Centers for Advancing Research on Botanicals and Other Natural Products (CA RBON) Program from the National Center for Complementa ry and Integrative Health (NCCIH ) and the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). 5 OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH PROJECTS AND CORES A. SIGNIFICANCE The Center for Molecular Integr ative Neuroresilience at the Ica hn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), in response to the funding opportu nity RFA -OD-14-001 from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative M edicine (NCCAM) and the Office o f Dietary Supplements (ODS), is a joint effort by investigat ors from: the Departments of Neu rology, Neuroscience, Medicine, and Immunology at ISMMS; the Departm ent of Biological Sciences at t he University of North Texas (UNT); the Agriculture and Plant B iology Department at Rutgers, State University of New Jersey (Rutgers); USDA Agricultural Re search Services at Beltsville; t he Department of Food Biology, Purdue University; the Nutrition and Food Science Department at Texas A&M University; and the Botanical Technology Developmen t Center at the University of Il linois Chicago (UIC). We define a vision for an integrated, multidi sciplinary program of preclini cal research project s all linked by a unifying scientific theme related to characterizing the Role of Dietary Botanicals in the Preservation of Cognitive and Psychological Resilience. Resilience to psychological and physiological stress: Over the past decade, there has been increasing attention paid to the phenomenon of resilience: the ability to maintain normal psyc hological and physical functioni ng and avoid serious mental illness when exposed to stre ss and trauma, even at extraordinary levels . Although resilience has been identified across the spectrum o f psychiatric disorders, we foc us here on resilience as it relates to post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and major and acute/chronic sl eep deprivation ( Project 2 ). In this context, resilience refers to the capacity of an individual to cope with negative p sychological and biological c onsequences of extreme stress that would otherwise compromise their psychological or physical well being. Recent reports indicate that resilience in humans is an acti ve, adaptive process and not sim ply the absence of pathological responses that occur in more susc eptible individuals. Anxiety a nd stress-related disorders are widespread psychological conditi ons with broad health implicati ons, including negative impacts on cardiovascular and metabolic func tions as well as on mental hea lth, including depression and memory dysfunction. The concept o f resilience is difficult to o perationalize, as it encapsulates many divergent behavioral phenotypes . Indeed, the study of human res ilience is still a mostly phenomenological assessment of biol ogical factors in resilient individuals that are associated with more successful coping responses. Mechanisms underlying resilience to social def eat and sleep deprivation-mediated cognitive decline: Social defeat in humans, as in c hronic social subordination in mice, leads to a spectrum of depression-like behaviors (1). Social defeat may lead to a soci al avoidance state, also known as \"anhedonia,\" in a subset of mice t ermed \"susceptible,\" whereas another subset of \"resilient mice\" resists the development of suc h behaviors (2). We have strong e vidence suggesting that increased peripheral proinflammatory cytok ine production is an important factor in the development of depression or anxiety (3-6). In a mouse model of repeated soci al defeat stress (RSDS), we found that by reducing peripheral inf lammation, such as reducing the content of the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) released from leukocytes, we can promote psychological r esilience and brain he alth (3-5). Little is known about the mechanisms a ssociated with cognitive resilie nce in models of sleep deprivation (SD) and no remedies have been di scovered to promote resilience and to maintain learning and memory functions (7). Acute/Chr onic SD or sleep loss contribute s to stress and impaired psychological vigilance (8), and is a widespread problem in our society (9). According to the Center 6 for Disease Control and Preventio n, 50-70 million individuals i n the US alone report inadequate sleep (10), and the negative impacts of SD on physical and cognitive health strain our healthcare system (11). Mice with experimental SD exhibit memory impairment, as assessed by classical Morris water maze and fear condition testing (12), which is associated with perturbation of molecular signaling underlying learning an d memory functions (13). We and others fo und that SD down-regulates the cAMP response element-binding prot ein (CREB) (14), a transcript ion factor downstream of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway; dec reases transcription of plastici ty-related genes (15) and inhibits the induction of LTP (16). Therefore, targeting molecular mechanism s associated with the negative consequences of social defeat or sleep deprivation may present novel strategy for promoting resiliencies. Dietary botanical supplements in stress: implications in the promotion of resilience: Extensive evidence documents tha t physiological stress has a de trimental impact on psychological health, cognitive functions, and ulti mately wellbeing. While st ressful events are an important cause of psychopathology, most individuals exposed to adversity maint ain normal psychological functioning. The mechanisms underly ing resilience are poorly un derstood, and there is no successful approach to maintain or promote resilience under str essful events. Natural dietary supplements have been used to trea t stress and insomnia since H ippocrates, and often have only mild side effects that are easily managed (6;17). Naturally oc curring polyphenols have been shown to promote health through a broad range of mechanisms; most exc itingly and relevant to the studies, we note that grape derived flavan -3-ols have extensive pharmaco logical action, including anti- inflammatory properties, and exer t antidepressant-like activiti es in animal models (18;19). Most excitingly, in our feasibility studies supporting the Center, w e found: (1) dietary supplementation with a combination of grape seed pol yphenol Concord grape juice (CGJ) and resveratrol (RSV) (herein referred to as t he botanical supplement mixture) promotes psychological resilience in the mouse model of RSDS, in par t, through modulation of periphe ral inflammation within leukocytes (e.g. reduce IL-6 production) and prevention of maladaptive syn aptic plasticity in the brain ( Project 1) (2) Oral administration with botanical supplement mixture att enuates SD-mediated memory impairments assessed by context ual fear conditioning assay and the improvement of memory consolidation process coincides with the induction of the cAMP- response element binding (CREB) transcription factor activity and increased gene expression of proteins involved in the consolidation of short into long term memory in the brain of the treated grou p, relative to the untreated controls following acute SD ( Project 2 ). Role of microbiome in polyphenol bioavailabili ty and cognitive and psychological resilience: The polyphenols in botanical supp lement mixture are extensively metabolized and absorbed following oral consumption. Due to the diverse susceptibility o f phenolic compounds to metabolism by gut enzymes and GI microbiot a, their bioavailability can var y from very low to very high (20). Our pilot feasibility evidence rev ealed an approximately 10-folds r eduction in the content of 3,4- dihydroxydrocinnamic acid and a pproximately 50% reduction in co ntent of 3-(3\u00b4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and homovanillic a cid in plasma of germ-free gno tobiotic mice compared to conventionalized gnotobiotic mic e (with normal microbiota harve sted from a wild-type mice) following oral administration of the botanical supplement mixtu re (Project 3 ). Our evidence highlights contributio ns the GI microbiota in modulating biocon version and bioavailabi lity of bioactive phenolic acids from the botanical mi xture relevant for preserva tion of psychological resilience. Based on these data, we hypothesi ze that a select panel of biol ogically available phenolic metabolites, upon reaching the ci rculatory system and the brain , may modulate cellular and 7 Dietary Supplementation With Select Polyphenol-Rich Botanicals (grape polyphenol metabolites, phenolic acids) to target tissues (e.g., blood cells, brain tis sues) Bioactivities of biologically available phenolic metabolites In modulating cellular / molecular mechanisms Pro-inflammatory mechanisms Preservation of Psychological and Cognitive Resiliency Under Stress ConditionsNeuroplasticity dysfunction Improving memory consolidationReducing depression/anxiety- like behaviorModulation of botanical polyphenol bioavailability by the human gastrointestinal microbiotamolecular mechanisms to reduce inflammatory activities in the p eriphery and to promote neuroplasticity following exposure to stress such as social def eat or SD (Figure 1). Therefore, the overall goals of the studies in the Center are: (i) To mechanis tically investigate t he beneficial effect of the above botanical supplements in promoting resilience agai nst psychological and physiological stress (ii) To identif y microbiota that are critical for the ge neration of bioactive phenolic metabolites related to resilience and to develop next-generat ion probiotics capable of promoting bioavailability of the bioactive phenolic metabolit es to enhance the efficacy of t hese botanical supplements in preserving psychological and cognitive resilience.

Overall working hypothesis for the efficacy of dietary supplementation with botanicals in preser ving cognitive and psychological resilience and to generate next-generation probiot ics to promote the utilization of botani cal supplements. B. INNOVATION The studies are innovative with regard to concept, scope, and technological development . The studies are conceptually innovative because, for the first time, we are conducting a comparative in vitro and in vivo assessment of the role of dietary bioavailable botanica l supplements in modulating psychological and cognitive resilience in lieu of acute and chronic stress. While there has been significant effort within the pharmaceutical and medical industries to develop treatments for mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, currently available tr eatments often have extreme s ide effects, adverse drug reactions, as well as inconvenient drug-dr ug and food-drug interactions. M oreover, thirty percent of patients fail to respond to currently availabl e therapies and 70% never achie ve complete remission (21). Thus, our mechanistic studies, by cha llenging the prevailing and fail ing approach of the pharmaceutical industry and demonstrating the ro le of a novel botanical supple ment, are conceptually innovative and in line with the current dogma for much needed advances in psychological health (22). As designed, our study will provide , for the first time, mechanist ic information supporting the potential application of certain botanica l supplements to promote cogniti ve and psychological resilience. Our study is also innovative in terms of scope, since it will fill the f undamental gaps for future translational studies by provid ing novel strategies to syntheti cally generate the bi oavailable phenolic metabolites for mechanistic and bioactivity studies. Moreover, the studies to characterize subset(s) of GI microbiota strain(s) ( Project 3 generation of spec ific bioactive phenolic metabo lites that contribute to cognitive wel lness and psychological resilie nce is highly innovative and will provide insight into broader issues relat ed to the translational goal o f the study. Lastly, we note that the studies in the Research Proje cts were designed as a unique multiscale technological innovative approach , made possible by our interdisci plinary research team with out standing expertise in 8 psychiatry, neurology, neuroscien ce, pharmacology, microbiology , food science, (phytochemistry and anal ytical chemistry). For exampl e, Project 3 is assisting Project 1 in the re-derivation of transgeni c mice expressing GFP under the D 1 or D2 promoter as germ-free, which is extremely innovative, r eflects the novel technology of application, and the synergistic nature of the studies' design. Consisten t with the NIH BRAIN Initiativ e, in the Center, we are employing newly developed technologies, i ncluding epigenetics, optogeneti cs and gnotobiotics, for our investigation to allow for revo lutionary and dynamic insight in to brain wellness and mechanisms promoting cognitive and p sychological resilience. C. APPROACH C.1. Working hypothesis Based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that select phen olic metabolites derived from botanical supplements may modula te mechanisms underlying resili ent vs. susceptible phenotype in the models of chronic social s tress and sleep deprivation, ther efore, the overall goal of our Center is to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which b otanical supplements may beneficially modulate to promote psychological (Project 1) and cognitive (Project 2) resilience in the context of chronic social stre ss and sleep deprivation. We are also testing whether supplementation of next-generation probiotics c an improve the bioactivity of th e botanical supplem ents (Project 3). The working hypothesis for each pr oject is illustrated in Fig. 2 (please refer to i ndividual projects for details). Fig. 2. Working hypothesis for Projects 1, 2 and 3. Project 1: Phenolic metabolites derived from dietary botanical supp lements inflammat ion (ii) directly attenuate synaptic plasticity change, which will l ead to resilience to psychologic al dysfunction; Project 2: Phenolic metabolites (i) promote cAM P response element-binding protein (CREB) signal ing (ii) modulate the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) that are absolutely necessary for memory consolidation will lead to resilience to sleep deprivation-m ediated cognitive dysfunction; Project 3: There are significant quantitative differenc es between gut microbiota of rodents and humans. We hypothesize these differences will modulate generation of of the bota nical mixture in promoting psychological and/or cognitive resilience in r esponse to stress challenges. W e also hypothesize that next- generation probiotics designed to promote bioconversion of thes e select bioactive phenolic acids will enhance the efficacy of the bot anical supplement mixture. 9 There is an unprecedent ed consumer demand fo r foods or food con stituents that help prevent or manage health conditions, includi ng conditions associated with psychological stress such as poor concentration, depression, and anxiety (21;22). These botanical supplements present an invaluable potential solution as they are rel atively inexpensive, have few perceived side effects, and are non- invasive compared to other neur ological and psychiatric treatme nts. Moreover, and relevant to the overall goal of NCCAM and the ODS, the studie s are allowing a m echanistic understanding of the effects of select bioactive pheno lic metabolites in the promoti on of psychological and cognitive resilience. C.2. Characterization of botan ical supplement mixture and pheno lic metabolites Select anical supplement mixture, spec ifically, GSPE, CGJ and RSV, exhibit a wide range ctivities. Primary phenolic cons tituents of grape proanthocyanidins (PACs), their flavan-3-ol pr ecursors, and anthocyanidins(AC) (23), as well as flavonols, phenolic acids, and the stilbene re sveratrol (Fig. 3.). Previous phytochemical and bio-guided frac tionation studies from our res earch team revealed that GSPE is rich in catechin (C), epicatech in (EC), PAC olig omers, and gall ic acid, and CGJ ( and wine) is rich in ACs, PACs, and flavonols along with some phenolic acids (24-26) (see list of publications following the References list in this section). Fig. 3. Representative st ructures of polyphenols from grape and grape-derived products. A) General structure of grape PACs: the main units of the PACs are C, EC, and epi catechin gallate (ECG). These are linked to each ot her by either C4-C8 or C4- C6 bonds, and gallate is general ly substituted for H on the hydroxyl at position 3. B) General structure of AC: R=H/OH/OMe; the glycosides are termed ACs. 3 and/or 5 glycosides are comm only available in grape. C) General structure o f grape flavonols: R=H/OH/OMe; 3, 5, 7 and/ or 4' glycosides are commonly available; D) Gallic acid. E) RSV. Previous studies by our re search group demonstrated that oral administration of the botanical supplement mixture are effective in protecting against neuropathology and cognitive imp airment in neurodegenerative di sorders such Alzheimer's disease and tau-mediated neur odegenerative disorder. These stud ies, supported by a National Institute of Health-National Cente r for Complementary and Alter native Medicine (NCCAM)-Funded Center on dietary polyphenols i n AD treatment as potential nove l agents in AD prevention/treatment (funded period 2007 - 2014), were ex tremely successful, as refl ected by 39 publications from the funded period 2007-2014 (Appendix 1). Among significant finding s from our NCCAM-funded studies are the identificati on of 18 biologically phenolic me tabolites, including 16 polyphenol metabolites (27;28)(Pasinetti, unpublished observation) and 2 p henolic acids (Wang and Pasinetti, unpublished observation) that are found accumulated in the brai n (Table I), with the potential to protect against AD pathogenic mec hanisms in the brain. Moreover , in ongoing studies, we have demonstrated some of these brai n-accumulating polyphenol metabo lites, in particular, as well as 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3- (3\u00b4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (see Research Project 3 for d etails) are capable of contributing to 10 phenolic compounds biologically available urine plasma brain commercial for deliverying acidthe efficacy of these botanical su pplements to interfere with t he mechanisms associated with cognitive and psychology resilience. Of particular interest to our Cent er, we recently observed that dietary supplementation with the botanical supplement mixture signi ficantly improved preservatio n of psychological and cognitive resilience under challenge by str ess conditions in experimental mouse models (please see Research Projects 1 and 2 for details). In addition to the above-mention ed 16 polyphenol metabolites and 2 phenolic acids that are able to ta rget the brain, studies from our group and from ot hers also identified 8 more biologically available phenolic acids from either the GS PE (Wang and Pasinetti, unpublished); Ho and Faith, unpublished) or the GCJ (29-33) component of the botanical mixture that are found accumulated in blood (Table I) . The collective panel of 26 biol ogically available phenolic (16 polyphenol a cids) from the bota nical mixture is listed in Table I. Based on this, our Center is des igned to clarify the mechanisms by individual biologically available phenolic metabolites from this panel contribute to the benefits of the botanical mixture in preserving psychological and cognitive resilience by modulating specific cellular/molecular processes. Table 1: Biologically available phenolic metabolites and corresponding phenolic compounds for in vivo delivery to be investigated in our Center. Listed are 26 phenolic metabolites (16 polyphenol metabolites and 10 phenolic acids) from the botanical supplement mixture that are biologically available in the periphery and in the brain following oral administration of GSPE, CGJ or resveratrol. These biologically available phenolic metabolites are the focus of our Center. Provided are information on detection in urine, plasma and brain. We also noted that som e of these phenolic metabolites are commercially available. Those tha t are not commercially availab le are being generated biosynthetically (by Scientific C ore B) for in vitro bioactivit y and mechanistic studies. We also provide 11 a listed of commercially ava ilable phenolic compounds for the d elivery of biologically phenolic metabolites to the periphery and/or the brai n in our in vivo mechanistic studies, as we describe in more detail below. Upper case letters refer to s ources of the information regarding urine, blood and brain a, Pasinetti Wang, Ho and Faith, unpublished data; f, ( 30); g,(32) ; h,(33) ; i,(31) ; j, (29). Research Projects 1 and 2 are s pecifically designed to characte rize the cellular/molecular mechanism by individual phenolic metabolites in Table I contribute to the efficacy of the bot anical mixture to modulate, respectively, psychology and cognitive resilience. As we discussed in more details in Project 1, our studies are suppor ted by our feasibility evidenc e that specific biologically available phenolic acid in Table I, can cont ribute to the benefits of the botanical supplement mixture in preserving psychological resilien ce by modulating, inflammatory processes (e.g. 3,4 dihdroxyphenylacetic acid) and expression of synaptic genes (e. g., by 3-(3\u00b4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and 3,4-dihydroxydrocinnami c acid) in the nucleus accumben s of the brain. Similarly, as we discussed in more details in Proj ect 2, our studies are also su pported by evidence that select phenolic metabolites from Table I can cont ribute to the efficacy of the botanical mixture to promote cognitive resilience by modulating neuronal synaptic plasticity (e.g., by the polyphenol qu ercetin-glucuronide) as well as c-Fos, Arc, Erg cellular signaling pathways (e.g., by the phenolic aci d, homovanillic acid and 3,4 dihdroxyphenylacetic acid). Published evidence (34- 37) has demonstrated t hat gut microbial community (i.e., gut microbiota) plays a critical rol e in modulating bioconversion and bioavailability of b ioactive phenolic metabolites, particularly phenol ic acids, from orally consumed polyphenol-rich botanical supplements. Moreover, as discussed in more det ails in Research Project 3, W e observed an approximately 10- folds reduction in the content o f 3,4-dihydroxydrocinnamic acid and approximately 50 % reduction in content of 3-(3\u00b4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and homovanillic acid in plasma of gnotobiotic mice compared to conventionalized gnot obiotic mice following oral ad ministration of the botanical mixture (see Research Project 3 for more details). Our evidence highlig hts contributions the GI microbiota in modulating bioconversion and bioa vailability of bioactive pheno lic acids from the botanical mixture relevant for preservation of p sychological resilience. Thus, th e studies in Research Project 3 are designed to use \"humanized\" gnot obiotic mice, i.e., germ-free m ice that are re-colonized with the microbiota of adult human donors, a s a model system to identify human gut bacterial strain(s) that are critical for the generation of b ioactive phenolic acids and for developing next-gen eration probiotics capable of promoting bioavailabili ty of the bioactive botanical supplements to enhance the efficacy of these botanical supplements in p reserving psychological and cog nitive resilience. Validating specific probiotic strategies bioactive experimental modulation of botani cal bioavailabi lity in animal models of psychological stress by Projects 1 and 2. Potential capacity of biologica lly available phenolic metabolites to target cellular processes . Most phenolic compounds are too hydrophi lic to penetrate cellular li pid bilayers by passive diffusion, and member carriers are required to transport biologically availabl e phenolic metabolit es across the bl ood-brain barrier (BBB), and cell ular plasma membrane. While studies exploring transport of phenolic m etabolites are outside of the scope of our Center, there is already information on membrane carriers that could be involved in abso rption/transport of phenolic compounds, particularly across the BBB and cellular membrane. I ndeed, recent studies have demonstrated involvement of certa in transporters, such as the s odium-dependent glucose transporter and the organic anion transporter 3 , in transporting select phe nolic compounds across BBB endothelial (38). The capabi certain phenolic meta bolites to penetrate the BBB and 12 subsequently the cellular plasma membrane of brain cells is con sistent with observations from us and others (26;27;39) that select phenolic compounds are capable of accumulating in brain tissues and some brain-bioavailable phenol ic compounds are capable of modul ating cellular processes, such as CREB signaling, as we describe in more detail in Research Proje cts 2. We note that some of the phenolic metabolites in Table I are gl ucuronide derivatives. The addition of a glucuronide moiety to a xenobiotic such as a phen olic compound increases its hydrophilicity, which typically is thought to promote transport of the phenolic compound out of the cells for eventual excretion fr om the body. Nonetheless, our fi ndings of specific steady-state accumulation of select phenolic g lucuronide compounds in brain tissues suggest the potential for these compounds to exert bioactivi ties in the brain. Thus, our Center is investigating the potential value of all 26 phenolic metabolit es from Table I for preservat ion of psychological and cognitive resilience as we proposed in Projects 1 and 2. Sources of phenolic metabolit es for in vitro studies Research Projects 1 and 2 ar e using in vitro model systems and assess the 26 biologic ally bioavailable phenolic me tabolites listed in Table for bioactivities targeted by the Res earch Project, followed by mec hanistic studies and in vivo efficacy testing. Majority of the phenolic metabolites listed in Table 1 can be obtained commercially. However, a number of polyphenol metabolites in Table I are not commercia lly available and these are being generated by our innovative poly phenol biosynthesis approach de veloped by Core B as schematically depicted in Fig. 4, which is capabl e of producing microgram qua ntity of individual phenolic metabolites for in vitro studies. Thus, Research Projects 1 and 2 are affording for the first time access to unique biologically available , bioactive phenolic metabolite s for extensive bioactivity and mechanistic studies. Core B has already successfully bio-synthe sized brain-bioavailable catechin glucuronides, one epicatechin g lucuronide and one methyl-catech in glucuronide (not shown), which we identified in the brain follow ing oral administration of pol yphenol precursor, and we have shown that yeast microsomes expressing human UGT1A9ar e an optimal mea ns to synthesize glucuronation of epicatechin and nols) for the exec ution of Proj ects 1 and 2. (This provides a facile route to synthesize several o f the polyphenol metabolites highl ighted in Table 1 for in vitro bioactivity and mechanistic studies. Fig. 4. Biosynthetic approaches to generate biologically available, bioactive phenolic metabolites combination of chemical derivations of commercially available precursors. Abbreviations: UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Novel strategy using commercially available polyphenol compounds as a means to deliver select bioactive phenolic metabolites to peripheral and brain tissues in experimental rodent models . Many polyphenols from botanicals are extensively met abolized during intestinal absorption and post-absorpt ive xenobiotic metabolism (24;40). This raises the issue o f how best to deliver bioactive polyphenol metabol ites from Table I to peripheral and/or brain target ti ssues in mouse models. While t here is limited understanding of polyphenol metabolism in mammals , we have previously demonstrat ed that oral administration of certain brain-bioava n-3-glucoside, as well as re sveratrol, listed in Table I, result in 13 their intact delivery to the brai n (41). However, there is no i nformation on specific phenolic compounds that can be used to deliver targeted phenolic glucuro nides, listed in Table I, to the brain. Since mammalian cells express gl ucuronosyltransferases that cat alyze glucuronation of polyphenols and other small molecules, we c onducted a feasibility study to test whether the use of phenolic aglycones (phenolic compounds in t he absence of the attachment of sugar groups) could generate and deliver specific phenolic glucu ronide metabolites, listed i n Table I, to the brain. We treated Sprague-Dawley rats with a mixtur e of commercially available ph enolic aglycones in Table I for ten days, to simulate chronic treat ment, and assessed the content o f phenolic metabolites in the perfused brain. We found that orally adm inistered select phenolic compou nds leads to the accumulation of the corresponding phenolic metabolites at \u00b5M and sub-\u00b5M in the brai n (Fig. 5). Based on this, Research Projects 1 and 2 are conducting a series of dose-finding studie s to identify the most appropriate efficacious dose-range of using select phenolic compounds to de liver corresponding bioactive polyphenol metabolites for engagi ng with peripheral and/or cent ral pathways relevant to psychological and/or cognitive resilience in spe cific experimental models. Pr evious evidence suggests that oral doses in humans, equivalent to a mouse dose up to 240 mg/kg/BW/ day for individual polyphenol precursor listed in Table I, are s afe and tolerable for long-te rm treatment (42-44) . We started with doses surrounding 240 mg/kg/BW/day for bioavailability dose fin ding studies. Fig. 5. Identification of brain- available phenol glucuronide metabolites in perfused rat brains following sub-acute treatment with th e mixture of phenolic aglycone compounds. Rats were treated by gavage with the mixture of phenolic aglycone compounds at a dose equivalent to a mouse dose of 300 mg/Kg-BW/day for 10 days and perfused with PBS. The contents of polyphenol metabolites in perfused brain specimens were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Left panel, phenolic glucuronide compounds detected in brain specimens, n=3 per group; right panel, Representative LC-MS/M S spectra of individual brai n-bioavailable pheno lic glucuronide compounds. There is limited information on how best to deliver phenolic ac ids to target tissues. Since bioconversion of botanical poly phenol components to phenolic ac ids occur in the colon followed by absorption by colonocyte. Base on this, we are delivering indiv idual phenolic acids from Table I by orally administrating animals with the same phenolic acid, as d epicted in Table I. While orally administered phenolic acid may under go structural modification or degradation in the GI, we anticipate some of phenolic acid will reach the colon for absor ption. Consistent with this approach, Lafay et al. 2006 orally adminis tered rats with the phenolic ac id, chlorogenic acid and observed accumulation of intact chlorogeni c acid (as well as caffeic aci d, a hydrolytic metabolite of chlorogenic acid) in plasma(45).

Thus, for our in vivo studies, we are using phe nolic doses surrounding 62 mg/ Kg- BW /day. We note that Alam et a l. 2013 treated hypertensive rat s with ferulic acid at 50 mg/ Kg- BW/day (equivalent to a mouse do se of 98 mg/ Kg-BW /day) and re ported improved cardiovascular and kidney structure/function in the absence of adverse effect( 47). Therefore, we are considering testing doses higher than 63 mg/K g-BW/day for specific phenolic acids from Table I for in vivo studies, when necessary. C.2. Overall Center structure and research design Our studies are designed to inv estigate the cellular and molecu lar mechanisms by which dietary supplementation with s pecific botanical supp lement mixture, nam ely GSPE, CGJ, and RSV, may help preserve psychological and cognitive resilience under cond itions of psychological and physiological stress induced by social defeat and sleep depriva tion. To accomplish this goal, we have designed three Research Projects ( Research Projects 1- 3 ) and three supportive Research Cores ( Core A, B, C ), as we schematically depic t in Fig. 6 below. Research Projects 1 and 2 are designed to investigate the mech anisms by which select biologic ally GSPE, CGJ and RSV may modul ate specific mechanisms leading to the preservation of psychological ( Project 1 ) and cognitive ( Project 2 ) resilience under stress conditions. Research Project 3 is investigating \"combinatoria l microbe communities in humaniz ed gnotobiotic mice\" to better define specific bacterial strains common in healthy huma ns that are critical for the bioavailability of the specific phenolic metabolites. Investiga tions by all Research Projects are supported by the three Research Cores. Fig. 6. Structural organization of the studies This scheme illustrates the studies by Research Projects 1, 2 and 3 and identifies key points of interactions among the Research Projects, Research Cor es A, B and C that are critical for the successful execution of the studies. Research Projects 1 and 2 are operating as follows, and as sche matically illustrated in Fig. 6: First conduct a comprehensive battery of in vitro bioactivity and mechanistic studies to assess each phenolic metabolit e, from our establis hed panel (Table 1), for their bioactivities in modulating key physiological me chanisms contributing to psychol ogical or cognitive resilience. 15 Projects 1 and 2 each rank order s and selects the top two metab olites with the most robust in vitro bioactivities for in vivo testing Following the in vitro surve y, conduct in vivo efficacy and me chanistic studies, based on dietary supplementation with specific p henolic compound (Table 1) to de liver specific phenolic metabolites to target tissues, to assess their effectiveness an d mechanisms identified from in vitro studies. Conduct in vivo botanical optimiz ation studies to explore the feasibility of dev eloping a next- generation probiotic to promote the efficacy of GSPE, CGJ, and RSV in preserving psychological and cognitive resilience under c onditions of social defeat and sleep deprivation As discussed above, human GI microbi ota play a key role in dict ating the bioavailability of dietary botanical supplements as a functi on of age, inflammatory condit ions, certain dietary regimens, and certain disease conditions (48; 49). In initial studies, Researc h Project 3 is conducting a series of in vivo studies with humanized gnot obiotic mice to explore deliver y and accumulation of botanical phenolic metabolites in the cont ext of human microbiota, and su bsequently conduct combinatorial bacterial consortia studies wit h gnotobiotic mice to identify b acterial strains criti cal for generation of individual (or Project 3, in close c onjunction with Pr ojects 1 and 2, operates as follows, and as schematically depicted in Fig. 6: Conduct studies using botanicals without specific polyphenol c omponents in gnotobiotic mice to identify individual (or subs ets of) phenolic components in the botanical that are critical for the generation of specific biologica lly available, bioactive phenol ic metabolites. Based on information gathered from the identification of speci fic bacterial strains contributing to the generation of physi ologically relevan t phenolic metabolites , continue to gnotobiotic mouse model to explore the devel opment of a next-generation pro biotic that can be used to modulate bioavailability of indivi dual or microbiota to identify pote ntial effects of polyphenol-rich diets, SD, and social defeat in modulating GI bacterial strains critical for generation of bioavailable bioactive phenolic metabolites from GSPE, CGJ, and RSV that would affect the impacts of these botanicals in t he preservation of psychologica l and/or cognitive resilience. The support from the three Resear ch Cores is critical for the s uccessful execution of individual Research Projects. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the Administrative/Statistical Core A provides oversight/coordination, in additi on to Biostatistical and Educa tional/Training support, for the Center activities. The Biosynthetic Component of Core B generates phenolic met abolites to support all in vitro bioactivity and mechanistic studies by Research Projects 1 and 2 . Moreover, the Bioanalytical Component of Core B monitors the bioavailability o f phenolic metabolites in gnotob , and RSV for Research Projec t 3 studies. Moreover, the Bioanalytical Component of Core B provides critical support for Research Projects 1 and 2 by monitoring the bioavailability of specific bioactive phenolic m etabolites following treatments with phenolic compound in the in vivo mechanistic studies, as well as following treatm ents with GSPE , CGJ, and RSV in the vivo botanical optimization studies . The Behavioral and Electrophysiology Core C operates by providing behavio ral phenotyping support for all t he studies in Research Projects 1-2, and measures mini excitato ry postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) studies in Project 1 and LTP studies in Project 2. 16 C.3. Interactions and synergy am ong Research Projects and Cores This Center is specifically designed to maximize collaboration and scientific synergy among all Research Projects and Cores. These interactions are schematically depicted in Fig. 7. Projects 1 and 2 conduct in vitro studies to assess each phenolic metabolite, from our established panel of bioavailable phenolic metabolites (Table 1), for their bioactivities in modulating key mechanisms contributing to cognitive or psychological resilience, respectively. They then select the metabolites with the most robust bioactivities for in vivo , preclinical studies to validate that delivery of the these metabolites to target tissues (e.g., inflammatory blood cells and brain tissues) lead to preservation of cognitive resilience under conditions of SD or preservation of psycholog ical resilience under conditions of social defeat. These in vitro bioactivity and mechanistic studies are supported by the Core B Biosynthetic Component , which is responsible for generating the phe nolic metabolites. Moreover, in collaboration with the Core B Bioanalytical Component , Projects 1 and 2 conduct in vivo studies using polyphenol found in the botanicals to deliver specific bioactive phenolic metabolite(s) to target tissues (e.g., blood cells and brain tissue) to validate the ph ysiological relevance of these metabolites in modulating mechanisms identified in in vitro studies. Moreover, in collaboration with Research Project 3 , Projects 1 and 2 are testing the efficacy of nex t-generation probiotics, designe d to promote bioavailability of specific bioactive phenolic metabolites , to enhance the benefits of thes e botanicals in preserving psychological and cognitive resilience. These botanical efficac y studies are supported by Core C Behavioral Phenotyping and Electrophysiology Components , to assess the impact of botanical treatment, in the presence or abs ence of probiotics, on reducin g psychological beha vioral responses and/or improving cognitive, behav ioral, and brain neuroplastici ty responses underlying memory consolidation. Interactions with Projects 1 and 2 help Project 3 prioritize its invest igation to identify bacterial strains(s) capable ge nerating individual (or panels o f) phenolic metabolites that are effective in modulating mechanisms underly ing preservation of psychologic al and/or cognitive resilience, and all of the Project 3 studies are conducted in clo se collaboration with the Core B Bioanalytical Component , to determine bioavailability o f GSPE/CGJ/RSV phenolic metabol ites in gnotobiotic mice, in the absence or presence of hum an microbiota or subsets of ba cterial strains. As further discussed in the independent research proposal s, there is explicit synerg y between Projects 1 and 2 due to evidence suggesting certain mec hanisms, including regulation of synaptic plasticit y gene expression, Core A Administrative / Biostatistics Administrative / Fostering New Research / Statistics Research Core C Behavioral and Brain Electrophysiology - Cognitive and psychological behavioral testing - Ex vivo assessments of brain electrophysiolog responsesResearch Core B Biosynthesis and Bioanalytical - Botanical profiling / archiving / quality - metabolites biosynthesis - Tissue phenolic metabolites assessmentsProject 1 Botanicals and Psychological Resilience - In vitro bioactivity studies - In vitro mechanistic studies- In vivo mechanistic studies - In vivo studies with probiotics Project 2 Botanicals and Cognitive Resilience - In vitro bioactivity studies - In vitro mechanistic studies- In vivo mechanistic studies - In vivo studies with probiotics Project 3 Human GI Microbiota and Botanical Bioavailability - phenolic metabolite bioavailability - consortia studies - Develop next-generation probiotics- Adaptive microbiota changes Fig. 7 Interactions between Research Projects and Cores within the Botanical Center. 17 are common in response to social stress and SD. The Research Pr ojects also synergistically interact through the built-in collaboration between Research Project 3 and Projects 1 and 2 , to prioritize bacteria strain(s) critical for the generation of phenolic meta bolites effective in promoting the preservation of psychological and/or cognitive resilience. This interaction allows Projects 1 and 2 to identify the most appropriate next-generation probiotic that mi ght be effective in enhancing the efficacy of GSPE, CGJ, and RSV in preserving psychological and cognitive resilience. To maximize efficiency and streamline the daily operations of this Center, Core A is specifically structured in committee and working groups desi gned to monitor efficiency, st reamline interactions, resolve disputes, etc. between the Center's investigators.

Jeremiah James Faith, PhD Project 3 Leader Dr. Faith is an Assistant Profe ssor of Clinical Immunology and of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. His research focus es on data driven computational modeling of the microbi ome with predictions t hat are followed-u p experimentally wit h new or existing technologies. He has pursued aspe cts of this paradigm for the p ast 13 years, first as a scientific programmer studying evolutionar y genomics, then as a graduate s tudent developing network inference algorithms for large- scale bacterial microarray datas ets, and as a postdoctoral fellow and instructor in Dr. Jeffrey Gordon' s lab at Washington University in St. Louis where he applied statistical modeling and systems biology tools to the field of gut microbio me research. He has over 6 years of experience working in the microbi ome field, developing improvem ents in the scale and quality of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and opt imized rRNA depletion protocol s and data processing pipelines for RNA-Seq metatranscriptomics of both the hum an and the mouse microbiota. Of particular relevance for this Center are t he anaerobic robot ics pipeline h e developed to isolate a large proportion of the gut microbes from human stool or intestinal c ontents combined with expertise in systems biology and gnotobiotics to enable the systematic ident ification of gut microbial strains that modulate aspects of host physiol ogy. The nutritional content of our diets is dependent not only on the chemical composition of the diet ary ingredients consumed but al so on unique set of microbes each individual harbors in their inte stine. In the last five years, he has developed tools to understand the interactions among diet, the gut microbiota, and host physiolog y. This Center seamlessly follows Dr. Faith's prior research and curr ent interests as it combines his interest in identifying microbial strains that modulate host physiology with his interest in the interrel ationship among host diet, gut microbes, and health. The technologies dev eloped and provided by the core components of this program project provide well-established methods t o track these polyphenols thr oughout the body. The uniqueness of these polyphenols combined with our ability to provide polyphen ol-free diets to animal models 25 provides a unique opportunity to study the dynam ics of these bi oactive compounds throughout the body in the context of different gut microbial communities.

Specific Aims The Specific Aims of the Over all Proposal have not changed from those originally proposed. Research Project 1: Preservation of psychological re silience under chronic stress Research Project 2: Promotion of resilience against c ognitive decline induced by sl eep deprivation Research Project 3: Role of the microbiome in promo tion of cognitive and psychologi cal resilience Research Cores: T h e e x e c u t i o n o f R e s e a r c h P r o j e cts 1-3 will be supported by th ree Research Cores: The Administrative-Biostatisti cs/Data Management Core A will provide administrative oversight to all components (Proje cts and Cores) of the overall BDSRC, as well as guidance on all issues related to study desig n and data entry, storage, analysi s, and interpretation. The Biosynthesis/Bioanalytical Core B will support Research Projects 1- 3 by centralizing the procurement, synthesis, and quality assurance of dietary polyph enol botanical supplements, and by profiling the polyphenol compounds in target tissues. The Behavioral Phenotyping and Electrophysiology Core C will provide behavioral phenotyp ing services for all the studi es proposed in Research Projects 1-3.

B. Studies and Results The overall goal of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) Botanical Dietary Supplement Research Center (BDSR C) is to provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of grape derived dietary botanical supplements in the preservation and promotion of cognitive and psychological resilience under certain stress conditions. Investigations by the ISMMS B DSRC have been conducted following the guidelines and timeline of th e originally proposed studies, and significant progress has been made in the 9.5 month interval be tween initiation of funding on September 01, 2015 and the current submission of the Year 1 Pro gress Report. For the upcoming Year 2, the overall goal and S pecific Aims of the ISMMS BDSRC a s well as the timeline of the investigatory studies remain unc hanged from those originally pr oposed. Below, we summarized in brief t he overall structure of the ISMM S BDSRC and overall goals of the individual BDSRC Research Proje cts and Scientific Cores. This w ill be followed by Progress Reports from individual Research Projects and Research Cores, which wil l provide more detail of progress made in Year 1 and projected Year 2 investigations by individua l ISMMS BDSRC components. Our BDSRC has been conceptualized and constructed based on rece nt evidence from our research team, which demonstrated that d ietary supplementation with a sp ecific grape-based juice (CGJ), and resveratrol (RSV), is highly effective i n promoting resilience against the induction of cognitive impairment and/or depression by certain environmental stresses in experimental animal models. Bas ed on extensive additional suppo rtive feasibility evidence, we hypothesized that these cognitive and psychological health bene fits are mediated by the action(s) of select polyphenol BDPP polyphenol components that, followed by oral BDPP administration, are biologically available in blood and/or target tissues and are b iologically active in modulating specific pathogenic processes underlying the development of cognitive im pairment and/or depression. Thus, our BDSRC is specifically desi gned to identify and structurally characterize specific biologically available, bioactive BDPP pol yphenol components that may contri bute to the efficacy of BDPP to 29 promote resilience to environmen tally-induced cognitive dysfunc tion and/or depression, and to clarify the mechanisms underlying the c ognitive and/or psychological he alth benefits of these bioactive polyphenol components. The ISSMS BDSRC is comprised of three Re search Projects. Each of the Research Projects has specifically defined goals and objectives and investigations by individual Research Projects are facilitated by built-in interactions amon g the Research Projects with support of three Scientific Cores. Specific goals of individual Research P rojects and Scientific Cores, interactions among Research Projects/Research Cores, progress m ade in Year 1 and projected investigations for Year 2 are as follows: Research Project 1: Preservation of psychological resilience un der chronic stress The overall objective of Project 1 is to investigate the molecu lar and cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of dieta ry supplementation with BDPP in promoting psychological resiliency against chronic stress, in parti cular repeated social defeat st ress (RSDS). Specifically, Project 1 will explore the role of individual BDPP-derived pheno lic metabolite s in modulating inflammatory responses in the periphery and their effect on stress-induced s ynaptic restructuring and plasticity in the central nervous system. Mor eover, in collaboration with Pro ject 3, Project 1 will use gnotobiotic mice to explore whether probiotic intervention with specific ba cterial strains can enhance the efficacy of botanical supplements to rend er greater resilience in the co ntext of RSDS. Year 1 investigations by Project 1 have validated two RS DS-mediated pathologic phenotype s - induction of IL-6 expression in the periphery and inhibition of Rac1 in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc) in the brain - as key targets for intervention. Project 1 has scr een a number of BDPP-derived phe nolic metabolites and identified a number of phenolic compounds that are biologically available in circulating blood and/or the brain and are effective in protecting agai nst molecular pathologic pathwa ys underlying IL-6 induction and Rac1 inhibition. Moreover, 1 has shown that simultaneously t argeting both IL-6 and Rac1 using a combination of two of these bi oactive phenolic compounds - malv idin-glucoside and 3,4- dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) - significantly promoted resilience to RSDS-mediated psychological dysfunction. Outcomes from Project 1 studies during Year 1 prov ide the first experimental evidence that select botanical components c an promote resilience to stre ss-mediated psychological disorders in part, by modulating multiple k ey pathologic mechanisms which are not addressed by classical antidepressants. This provides a proof of concept and experimen tal evidence that botanical supplements can be used to target novel mechanisms to preserve and to promote psychological resilience under stressful conditions. Research Project 2: Promotion of resilience against cognitive d ecline induced by sleep deprivation The overall objective of Projec t 2 is to explore the potential role of BDPP-derived brain bioavailable phenolic metabolites in mechanism s associated with synaptic pla sticity and memory consolidation in the context of sleep deprivation (SD). In particular, Project 2 will investigate the effect of individual metabolites in protecting agains t SD-mediated disruptions in CR EB and mTOR signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP) and immediat e early gene (IEG) expression. F urthermore, in collaboration with Project 3, Project 2 will test the potential role of \"next gene ration\" probiotics in maximizing the effect of dietary polyphenol botanical supplements on promoting cognit ive resilience. Year 1 investigations by Project 2 have screened a number of BDPP-derived phenolic me tabolites and Quercetin-glucuron ide (Quer-Glur) and Malvidin-glucoside (Mal-Gluc), which are effective in protecting against SD-mediat ed disruptions in CREB and mTOR signaling, in vitro . Project 2 also clarified the mo lecular mechanisms of actions of these bioactive phenolic metabolites. Moreover, Pr oject 2 has confirmed that or al administration of Quer-Glur 30 precursor quercetin and Mal-Gluc significantly promoted resilie nce to cognitive function in a SD mouse model. Outcomes from these preclinical studies have provi ded a basis for potential translational applications of se lect botanicals in promoting re silience to SD-mediated cognitive dysfunction by simultaneously tar geting multiple SD-mediated pa thological processes. Research Project 3: Role of the microbiome in promotion of cogn itive and psychological resilience The overall objective of Project 3 is to identify select bacter ial strain(s) from human GI microbiota that are critical for the generation of BDPP-derived, biologically a vailable, bioactive metabolites that are important for Projects 1 and 2 fo r the promotion of psychologi cal and cognitive resilience. Using \"humanized\" gnotobiotic mice, Pro ject 3 aims to develop novel \" next-generation\" probiotics for promoting the bioavailability of select bioactive phenolic meta bolites, thereby enhancing the efficacy of BDPP (and other polyphenol-rich botanicals) in preserving ps ychological and cognitive resilience. Interactions with Projects 1-2 will help Project 3 prioritize i ts investigations to identify bacterial strains(s) capable of promoting the generation of individual (o r panels) of phenolic metabolites that are effective in modulating me chanisms underlying preservation of psychological and/or cognitive resilience. During Year 1, Proj ect 3 demonstrated that interper sonal differences in gut microbiota composition among defined bacteri al collections from different healthy donors are coincidental with differences in conversions of GSPE, one of the BDPP components, to select biologically available phenolic acid metabolites. Of particular interest is the capabi lity of bacteria from one of the donors to rapidly convert GSPE to DHCA, a BDPP-derived biologically avail able phenolic compound that Project 1 has found efficacious in promoting resilience to RSDS -mediated cognitive impairment. Outcomes from these initial studies support continued dissectio n of bacterial strains from Donor 1 to identify specific (or a subset of) bacteria that would facilita te conversion of GSPE to DHCA in gnotobiotic mouse models. Research Cores: The execution of Research Projects 1-3 is supported by three R esearch Cores. The Administrative-Biostatistics/Data Management Core A provides administrative oversight to all components (Projects and Cores) of the BDSRC, as well as guidan ce on all issues related to study design and data entry, storage, analysis, and interpretation. T he Biosynthesis/Bioanalytical Core B supports Research Projects 1- 3 b y centralizing the procurement , synthesis, and quality assurance of dietary polyphenol botanical suppl ements, and by profiling the polyphenol compounds in target tissues. The Behavioral Phenotyping and Electrophysiology Core C provides behavioral phenotyping services for all the studies proposed in Research P rojects 1-3. Moreover, it will assist and execute excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibi tory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) studies in Project 1 and long te rm potentiation (LTP) studies i n Project 2. Year 1 progress made by Cor es A, B and C are as follows : Core A: Core A has accomplished its primary goal to assess research pro gress and determine whether research goals are being met, while promoting transpare nt communication across Research Projects and Cores. In addition, C ore A has facilitated the cro ss-project intellectual fertilization and synchronous collaborations while fostering new research among i nvestigators of the ISMMS BDSRC, as well as among investigators from the two CANPITs and the two other BDSRCs. Core B: The Biosynthesis Component of Core B provided standards and ex periment samples to other components of the ISMMS BDSRC to support a wide variety o f studies. In addition, the 31 Biosynthesis Component develo ped two approaches for the generat ion of glucuronidated dietary flavonoids: enzymatic biosynthesis and chemical synthesis. The Bioanalytical Component of Core B provided critical information on BDPP-derived phenols, their st ability, and their bioavailability/metabolism in in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, the Bi oanalytical Components has refined LC/UV/MS methods for improved quantitative analysis of BDPP polyphenols, including proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acids. Using these protocols, the Bioanalytical Component helped Project 3 analyzed in vitro conversions of GSPE by defined bacterial collections from different health y donors to select biologicall y available phenolic a cid metabolites and helped demonstrate interpersona l differences in the gut microbi ota composition which significantly impacts conversion of GSPE to tiple biologically available B DPP-derived phenolic metabolites. C: Core C has performed behavioral studies and electrophysiologi cal analyses in support of Projects 1 and 2. These studies provided important functional a ssessments allowing Projects 1 and 2 to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which b ioactive botanicals may beneficially promote psychological resilience in the context of social defea t (Project 1) and preserve cognitive function in the context of sleep deprivation (Project 2). Core C also provided toxicological assessments for select botanical compounds tested by Projects 1 and 2, which allow the potential benefits and safety of phenolic co mpounds to be determined for further preclinical and clinical translational applications. C. Significance The overall goals of the studies in this BDSRC are: (i) to mech anistically investigate the beneficial effect of the above botanical supplements in promoting resilien ce against psychological and physiological stress, (ii) to ident ify microbiota that are crit ical for the generation of bioactive phenolic metabolites related to resilience, and (iii) to develop next-ge neration probiotics ca phenolic metabolites to enhanc e the efficacy of these botanical supplements in preserving psych ological and cognitive resilienc e. D. Future Plans I n Y e a r 2 , Project 1 will continue with in vitro screening of additional B DPP-derived phenolic metabolites to identify individua l (or a combination of) phenol ic metabolites that are most efficacious and safe for simultaneous multi -targeting of inflammation and R ac 1 that ultimately will be tested in vivo in the RSDS mouse model in colla boration with Core C. Similarl y, Project 2 will continue with in vitro screening of additional BDPP-der ived phenolic metabolites to i dentify individual (or a combination of) phenolic metabolit es that are most efficacious and safe for simultaneous multi- targeting of CREB/mTOR s ignaling, LTP and/or IEG in vitro , and which will ultimately be tested in vivo in the SD mouse model in collaboration with Core C. Both Projects 1 and 2 will continue to work with Project 3 to provide bioactive phenolic compounds as potential targets f or the development of next- generation probiotics for enhancing the efficacy of BDPP (and o ther polyphenol-rich botanicals) in preserving psychological an d cognitive resilience. Project 3 will use an in-house combinatorial screen technology to screen for and identify individual (or combinatio ns of) human gastrointestinal microbial strains that are effective in m or RSV ) into bioactive phenolic metabolites of interest to Projects 1 and 2 for, respectively, the preserva tion of psychological and/or cognitive resilience. In addition, Project 3 plans to expand our in vitro metabolic potential screening experiments described above to additional healthy donor microbi otas to identifying a broader range of gut microbes capable of processing BDPP polyphenols into bioact ive compounds. Moreover, Project 3 plans to initiate in vivo studies, in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2 and Core C, to test whether 32 inoculation of gnotobiotic mice with key microbial strains, ide ntified vitro to metabolize BDPP into bioactive, bioavailable compounds , will promote a) conversion o f orally consumed BDPP to biologically relevant phenolic acids such as DHCA and b) accumu lation of these phenolic acids in target tissues (e.g., blood and br ain) following oral administr ation of BDPP. Core A: In Year 2, Core A will continue organizing and keeping minutes of the regularly scheduled meetings among the ISMMS BDSRC Ad ministrative Study Group, Inte rnal Steering Committee the external advisory committees and the Study Coordination Work Gr oups. In addition, Core A will advertise and fund a new pilot research program based on merit of the science and relevance to the parent BDSRC goal. Core A will al so teach MD/PhD students about the characterization of bioactive dietary polyphenols, with the ultimate goal of using this as a model for the evidence-based clinical development of naturally occurring products. Moreover, Core A w ill continue outreach by sharing findings through press releases for the public and by updating the Center website. Finally, the Core A Bioinformatics/Data Management c omponent will implement more bi oinformatic investigations to comprehensively cover three aspects: (1) to continue to employ the database and API for active data collection and management; (2) c onducted metabolites selection based on in vitro readout (methods specified in grant application); (3) construct forest network ( RFN) on multi-dimensional variables to determine causal mechanism of met abolite (R) intermediate pheno type (R) outcome. Core B: The Core B Biosynthesis Component will continue to develop synt hetic schemes for the full range of compounds needed, utilizi ng enzymatic and/or non-enzym atic approaches. The Core B Component will cont inue providing support for ind ividual Project needs with chemical profiling, quantificatio n of metabolites bi oavailability studie s generated, quality c ontrol, and archiving of submitted active compounds/frac tions. Using the GC/MS method developed in Year 1, the Bioanalytical compon ent will continue to support each of the Re search Projects in analyzing the profile and contents of a wide range of BDPP-derived phenolic m etabolites among banked biological specimens, including bacterial broth and animal tissue specimen s. Core C: In Year 2, Core C will continue to provide state-of-the-art be havioral and electrophysiological assessments based on the goals of i ndividual Projects with the overall objective of providing support to each Project that will allow the biological effects of bioac tive botanicals on brain activity and function to be determined. Core C will continue to conduct toxi cological assessments for all the individual botanical compounds us ed by each Project which will provide important information on the safety of individual botanicals to be readily translated to fut ure preclinical and c linical applications.

Aim 1: To investigate the effect s of bioavailable phenolic meta bolites derived from dietary polyphenol- rich botanical supplements on inflammatory signaling in vitro using circulating leukocytes and in vivo using a mouse model of RSDS. Aim 2: To explore the central me chanisms through which bioavail able phenolic metabolites may beneficially influence RSDS indu ced synaptic restructuring and plasticity in the NAc. Aim 3: To assess the impact of g ut microbiome on the bioavailab ility of bioactive phenolic metabolites in promoting resilience in RSDS. B. Studies and Results For Aim 1 (year 1), we have screened 19 bioavai lable phenolic m etabolites derived from dietary polyphenol-rich botanical supplem ents on modulating inflammator y signaling using mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with the LPS-induced IL-6 e xpression in PBMCs. Using the mouse model of RSDS for in vivo testing, we completed testing the role of DHCA in promoting resilience against chronic stre ss-induced depression in the mou se model of RSDS. For Aim 2 (year 1), we have scr eened nine brain bioavailable ph enolic metabolites for medium neuron (MSN)-enr etabolite, (mal- gluc), that significantly increased of a calcul ated half maximal effective con centration (EC50) of 3.52 nM. Rac1 expression in the NAc has been s hown to be necessary and suffic ient to promote social avoidance and anhedonia. We also tested the ro le of mal-gluc in promoting resilience against chronic stress- induced depression in the mouse model of RSDS. For Aim 3 (year 1), DHCA has be en selected as one of the target molecules whose bioavailability can be promoted through microbiome m anipulation. In collaboration w ith Project 3, the identification of microbes important for the generat ion of DHCA is currently unde r active investigation. C. Significance In year 1, we have established the beneficial effect of oral su pplementation with the bioactive dietary polyphenol preparation (BDPP) c omposed grape seed grape juice and resveratrol in promoting resili ence in mouse model of stress di sorder. We have identified select bioavailable and bioa ctive phenolic metabolit es that can peripheral inflammation and synaptic plasticity in vitro . We demonstrated that in vivo treatment with mal-gluc/DHCA can prophylactically promote resilience to RSDS-induced depression, and the benefits coincide with reduced peripheral IL-6 and normaliz ation of synaptic plasticit y, both structurally and functionally, in the NAc, a brain structure that plays a c entral role in the development of depression. Moreover, mal- gluc/DHCA is effective in treat ing depression phenotypes in RSD S-induced depression and in depression rendered by the transpl antation of hematopoietic pro genitor cells from stress-susceptible mice . Currently available antidepress ant treatment is mainly based on the tricyclic antidepressants that target the serotonergic and/ or noradrenergic system. Our s tudies provide the first experimental evidence that select botanical components such as mal-gluc and DHCA can promote resilience to stress-mediated psychological d isorders in part, through target ing multiple key pathologic 36 mechanisms which are not address ed by classical antidepressants ; therefore, our study provides a proof of concept and experimental evidence that botanical suppl ements can be used to target novel mechanisms to preserve and to pro mote psychological resilience under stressful conditions. D. Future Plans For the upcoming year 2, we will continue to screen the newly s ynthesized phenolic metabolites by Core B for anti-inflammatory act for modulating syna ptic plasticity in vitro . We will continue the in vivo efficacy of positive phenolic met abolites identified using a m ouse model of RSDS in collaboration with Co re C for behavioral and electrophysiology assessments. We will continue to work with Project 3 to provide pos itive phenolic compounds that are potential targets for microbiome activity.

Wang J (2016) 37 PROMOTION OF RESILIENCE AGAINST COGNITIVE DECLINE INDUCED BY SL EEP DEPRIVATION - PRO JECT 2, YEAR 1 A. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of Projec t 2 have not changed from those orig inally proposed. Aim 1: To continue to explore the mechanistic role of brain-bio available phenolic metabolites on promotion of cogni tive resilience in a mouse model of SD. Aim 2: To explore mechanistically the role of brain-bioavailabl e phenolic metabolites in promoting cognitive resilience through modulation of IEG expression in vitro and in vivo using novel optogenetics technology. Aim 3: To explore the role of no vel next-generation probiotics designed to promot e conversion of select bioactive phenolic metab olites from botanical supplement mixture to enhance bioavailability and bioactivity and promote cogni tive resilience in response to SD. B. Studies and Results For Aim 1 (Year 1), we have scr eened six brain-bioavailable phe nolic metabolites derived from dietary polyphenol-rich botanical supplements in promoting CREB signaling pathway s using primary cortico-hippocampal neurons. We have identified two phenolic me tabolites, Quercetin-glucuronide and Malvidin-glucosi de activation of CamKII and mTOR si gnaling pathways. We tested the in vivo efficacy of Quer-Glur and Mal-Gluc in promoting cognitive function in a mouse model of ac ute SD. For Aim 2 (Year 1), we have screened 11 bioavailable phenolic m etabolites for modulating immediate early gene (IEG) expression usi ng primary cortico-hippocampal n eurons following brain derived can promo te the expression of C-fos and Arc which will be tested in vivo to investigate memory engrams following SD using optogenetic technology. We have also established the c-fos-tTA transgenic m ice colony which will be injected with TRE-ChR2-mCherry virus in the hi ppocampal formation to test the effect of SD on cognitive impairments and the beneficial ro le of select phenolic metaboli tes capable of promoting IEGs in promoting resilience to sleep-depr ivation mediated cognitive dy sfunction. For Aim 3 (Year 1), HVA can be one of the target molecules whos e bioavailability can be promoted through microbiome mani pulation. In collaboration with Project 3, the identification of microbes important for the generation of H VA will be actively investigat ed. C. Significance In Year 1, we have identified se lect bioavailable and bioactive phenolic metabolites that can promote resilience to cognitive impairments under the context of SD str ess. We demonstrated that in vivo treatment with Quer-Glur precur sor quercetin and Mal-Gluc can p romote cognitive function following acute SD in part through the ac tivation of two independent yet interrelated pathways: CREB signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway. Our studies provide the exp erimental evidence that quercetin and Mal-Gluc can selectively modul ate signaling pathways that a re interrupted by SD. Given the safety and tolerability of thes e two botanical compounds, our p reclinical study has provided a basis for potential translational application of select botanicals in promoting resilience to the SD-induced cognitive deficits targeting t he CREB signaling and mTOR signal ing pathways. 38 D. Future Plans For the upcoming Year 2, we wi ll continue to screen the newly s ynthesized phenolic metabolites by Core B for promoting CREB signaling and IEGs in vitro . We will continue to test the in vivo efficacy of positive phenolic metabol ites identified usi ng a mouse model of SD in collaboration with Core C for behavioral and electrophysiology assessments. We will test the role of select bioavailable and bioactive phenolic metabolites in promoting cognition using opt ogenetic technology. We will continue to work with Project 3 to provide positive phenolic compounds f or the identification of microbial strains that are capable of generating t hese phenolic compounds. All th e proposed studies are in line with the proposal and there is no change in the program. E. Publications Peer-refereed papers: 1.

Project-Generated Resources N/A 39 ROLE OF THE MICROBIOME IN PROMO TION OF COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOLOGI CAL RESILIENCE - PROJECT 3, YEAR 1 A. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of Projec t 3 have not changed from those orig inally proposed. Aim 1: To explore the deliver y and accumulation of phenolic met abolites from the polyphenol-rich bioactive mixture of dietary bot anical supplement s in the conte xt of human microbiota. Aim 2: To identify bacterial strains from human microbiota that are neces sary and sufficient fo r the processing and bioavailability of phenolic a cids from the botanical mixtur e. Aim 3: To explore the use of a next-generation probiotic cockta il to increase the bioavailability of phenolic acids from the botanical mixture. B. Studies and Results Although originally p lanned for years 2-3 (Aim 2), we have made substantial progress generating arrayed culture collections of gut bacteria from diverse humans . These arrayed culture collections consist of banked 96-well glycerol stocks of bacteria, where ea ch well in the plate contains a unique bacterial strain isolated from a single human, providing the op portunity to identify the functional capacities of individual microbes and collections of microbes a cross individuals. Our original methods for generating these culture lib raries required identifying eac h bacterial species using next-generation sequencing methods. By switching this identification to a MALDI -TOF mass spec based approach, we can now identify micr obial species in real -time. This advance h as enabled us to move from isolating human microbiota culture collect ions from a human microbiota ov er the course of 1-3 months down to 1-2 weeks. As such, we now hav e ~1000 unique strains of bacteri a isolated from different humans. The availability of these unique resources a year in advance al lowed us to accelerate our experimental plans. We had origi nally planned to screen human d onor feces from diffe rent individuals to determine the variability i n polyphenol bioprocessing by the microbiome across individuals. However, our ultimate goal is the identification of culturable gut micro bes that could form a next-generation probiotic cockt ail to produce bioactive polyphe nols and phenolic acids in vivo. These culture collections allow us to skip the initial experi ments in feces and proceed directly towards our goal of iden tifying this next-generation p robiotic of culturable organisms. The earlier we can identify such organisms the more time Projec ts 1-3 will have to explore the functional capacity of such mi crobes to enable the potential of grape based dietary botanical preparations to provide beneficia l effects to the host. To capi talize on these unique resources, we have begun some exciting in vitro experiments to identify the meta bolic potential of culturable microbial communities isolated from different humans to produce bioactive polyphenols and phenolic acids through the metabolism of BDPP components - grape seed po lyphenol culturable human microbiota collections Overall Study Design: Defined culture collections of ~ 20 bacteria strain isolates fr om three different human donors (~60 total bacterial strains) are being assayed in vitro for their capacity to metabolize GSPE, GGJ, and RSV to biologica lly available phenolic acid comp ounds. The current ongoing experiments inoculate culture m edia with a rich bacterial cultu re collection from individual donors, in the presence / absence of a tot al polyphenol extract from GSPE, CGJ, or RSV. Conditioned broth are 40 recovered at 24 h and at 72 h an d are then sent to Dr. James Si mon, Rutgers University (Core B Analytical Component) for analysis. C. Significance We have completed an in vitro study investigating interpersonal differences in gut microbiot a composition in converting GSPE to biologically available phenol ic acids. We have previously demonstrated that polyphenol components from GSPE can pass inta ct through the upper gastrointestinal track and are available in the colon for gut m icrobial metabolism ( 1). Thus, we compared defined bacterial collect ions from different healthy d onors for their capability of converting GSPE to phenolic acids, in vitro . Bacteria broth (5-ml) was inoculated with defined bacterial collections from three healthy donors. GSPE (600 mg/L) was then added. Contents of GSPE polyphenols and GSPE-derived phenolic acid metabolites in the b acterial broth were assessed at 24 or 72 h. Results from our in vitro study confirming interpersonal d ifferences in bacterial strain s from the three donors are coincidental with differences in conversio ns of GSPE to select biologically available phenolic acid metabolit es. Of particular interest is the capability of bacteria from Donor 1 to rapidly convert GSPE to dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA). Recent evid ence from Project 1 has implicated the potential contribution of DHCA in promoting psychological r esilience in a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress. Out comes from these initial stu dies support continued dissection of bacterial strains from Donor 1 to identify specific (or a subse t of) bacteria that would facilitate conversion of GSPE to DHCA in gnotobiotic mouse models. D. Future Plans Combinatorial screen to identify microbial strains that metabol ize GSPE into bioactive compounds. By the end of Year 2, we aim to identify the particular microbial strains or groups of strains in Donor 1 that are capable of metabolizing, in vitro , GSPE to DHCA (as well GSPE bioactive, biologica lly available metabolites of int erest for Projects 1 and 2). We will use in vitro combinatorial bacteria l and statistical modeling to dissect th e interrelationship between the gut microbiota and conversion of bio logically relevant phenolic aci d GSPE. In addition, we aim to initiate studies to identify if the met abolic conversion of GSPE to DHCA is replicated in preclinical gnotobiotic mouse studies using animals wit h and without the identified str ains capable of this conversion. By the end of Year 2, we also aim to identify human microbial strains that are capable of converting CGJ and RSV to phenolic metabolites of i nterest for Projects 1 and 2. Based on our previous work ident ifying key effector microbes fr om culture collections of gut bacteria (2), we anticipate our high throughput screening studies will fin d bacteria in the culture community that individually or in combinat ion can generate key metabolite s in a screen of roughly 100 culture combinations per donor library . To do so, we will use our anaer obic liquid handling robot to randomly fractionate the bacteria in the community into subsets of varyi ng sizes (e.g., 2 strains, 3 strains, etc.). For example, to identify bacteri a strains from Donor 1 that are capable of converting GSPE to DHCA, Donor 1 bacterial community will be provided the same culture m edia spiked with GSPE as in our complete human microbiota cultur e experiments detailed above. A s described in the P50 grant proposal, we will then use comput ational models t o identify the organisms whose presence or absence in the culture best explains the existence of the metab olites of interest. Finally, we will take the key microbes, re-culture them, and validate them individual ly or with the appropriate community members cultured with the GSPE. The identified microbial effect or strains or groups of strains capable of metabolizing GSPE to DHCA in vitro will serve as the initial microbial therapeutic test community provided to gnotobio tic animals to validate in vivo the essential role of specific microbial taxa on the generation of bioactive GSPE derived metabolites. 41 Expanding BDPP bioprospecting to additional human microbiotas. We also plan to lay the ground work to expand our in vitro metabolic potential screening expe riments described above to fo ur additional healthy donor microbi otas to identifying a broader r ange of gut micr obes capable of processing BDPP poly phenols into bioactive compounds. Towards t his, we are currently generating new culture collections from four additional healthy individual s whose microbes were previously used in fecal microbiota transpl ant therapies in humans. Optimizing dosing and met abolic assays in vivo. Our larger goal is to test whether inoculation of gnotobiotic mice with key microbial strains, identified in vitro to metabolize BDPP into bioactive, bioavailable compounds, will promot e a) of orally co nsumed BDPP to biologically relevant phenolic acids such as DHCA and b) accumulation of these phenol ic acids in target tissues (e.g., blood and brain) following oral administration of BDPP. In prep aration of these gnotobiotic mice studies, we will be treating wild -type mice with BDPP (200 mg/k g 300 mg/kg bw/day RSV), a s we have done in the past ( 3, 4). Mice will be treated for 10 days to simulate chronic administr ation. Biological specimens (e.g., feces, urine, colon, blood, brain) will be collected at the end of the study. These specimens will be forward to Dr. James Simon (Rutgers University, Core B Analytic al component), for Core B to optimize its tissue extraction and analytical protocol for quan titative analysis of phenolic acids from BDPP. Outcomes from these studies will allow for the optimal de sign of the in vivo studies involving gnotobiotic mice. To optimize the use of BDPP in gnotobiotic an d germ-free conditions, we will determine the baseline absorption of BDPP in germ-free mice dev oid of secondary metabolism by the gut microbiota. These experiments will be performed using the s ame design as the conventional mouse experiment, except the animals will be germ-free and hous ed in a flexible film gnotobiotic isolator. Collectively, outcomes from our Year 2 studies will provide th e basis for developing next- generation probiotic cocktails to increase the bioavailability of bioactive phenolic metabolites from BDPP. In Year 3 in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2, we will then test whether introduction of these probiotic cocktails in mice will boost the beneficial effects o f BDPP in promoting cognitive and/or psychological resilience.

Specific Aims The Specific Aims of the Administrative - Biostatisti cs/Data Management Core A have not changed from those originally proposed. Aim 1: By continually monitori ng and evaluating the scientific progress of the BD SRC and enhancing collaboration among it s Research Projects and Cores. Aim 2: By providing oversigh t through academic leadership and c oordination in the administration of fiscal and personnel issues of the BDSRC among the participatin g institutions and t heir investigators. Aim 3: By fostering new resear ch, developing young investigator s, and bringing new vision to the challenges in the development of botanical supplements for brai n wellness and mental health Aim 4: By providing biostati stical support, data storage, and s cientific communication B. Studies and Results In Year 1, no changes to the aims or budget were made in this C ore A awarding component. Aim 1: In Year 1, Core A organized and kep t minutes of the monthly Adm inistrative Study Group meetings, whose main goal is to a ssess the Research Projects' p rogress and determine whether research goals are being met. In addition, the Administrative W ork Group ensures appropriate budgetary spending and monitors ot her fiscal matters related to the research operations by Research Projects and Cores, ultimately ensuring compliance with the pro posed spending plan, including subcontracts. Internal Steering Committee Core A organized and kept minut es of the monthly Internal Steer ing Committee meetings whose main goal is to promote integration among the Research Projects and Cores and to resolve any obstacles to the fulfillment of the projec ted goals. The meetings were he ld either in person, through teleconferences, or through video conference. External Advisory Board (EAC) Core A established the EAC to moni tor the progress of the proje cts, to advise the Internal Steering Committee, and to participate in th e strategy planning of the I SMMS BRC. The EAC is chaired by Dr. Ming Hu, Professor of Pharmaceut ics at the University of Housto n, and also includes Dr. Tracy Bale, Associate Professor of Neuro science at the Perelman School of M edicine, Dr. Ronald Duman, Professor of Psychiatry and Yale School of Medicine, Dr. David Dinges, Chief of Sleep and Chronobiology a the Perelman School of Medicine, and Dr. Federi co Re, and Assistant Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. These in dividuals adequat ely cover the diverse applications of this BRC from the bioavailability of dr ugs to characterization of the molecular actions of stress to the neurophysi ology of circadian and sleep biology to the role of microbial communities. The EAC had its firs t teleconference to discuss th e Projects and intr oduce the overall goal of the ISMMS BRC activities m et as per RFA recommendations within the three months of the start of the budget period. The EA C members will attend a sympo sium organized at ISMMS on June 15th with the primary goal to revie w the scientific activities acco mplished in Year 1 by the ISMMS BRC, during which al l the investigators of the ISMMS BRC will p resent their scientific activities of Year 1. The goal of this symposium is to have the EAC review an d provide guidance on Center activities. We expect the EAC to comment and eventually to repo rt on Center operations in Year 1 in particular in relation to the appropriate allocation of resourc es devoted to the most scientifically 44 worthy and significant projects, and to ensure that maximal syn ergy was achieved. The EAC will provide minutes to NIH staff within 30 days of the symposium on the performance of the ISMMS BRC Year 1 activities. Aim 2: In Year 1, Core A organized the meetings and took minutes of th e Study Coordination Work Group meetings, whose main goal is to allow the ISMMS BRC inves tigators to fully and rapidly share ideas, to address questions relat ed to experimental work, and t o synchronize efforts . This work group meets monthly to discuss recent findings and also to facilitate the ongoing exchange of information regarding mechanisms and bioactivi ties related to the phenolic botanical supplements being investigated in the early phas es of the studies. There is repre sentative leadership from all the Research Projects and Co res at each meeting. Aim 3: Pilot Research Program. In Year 1, Core A largely advertised t he pilot program funding opportunity throughout Mount Sinai, c ollaborating institutions, as well as other institutions in the CARBON. Core A received eight appl ications and after a first ad ministrative review only seven met compliance for further review. T he seven applications were revi ewed by leaders and co-leaders of the ISMMS BRC, who were instructed t hat the primary co nsideration f or evaluation was based on merit of the science and relevance to t he parent BRC goal. Based on thes e review criteria, four applications were streamlined and the three app lications with the highest im pact score were shared with the external advisory committee, whi ch re-reviewed the applications and provided further recommendations. The three applicat ions were then reviewed by t he CARBON Director who agreed that Dr. Stephen Salton's applicat ion entitled \"Antidepressant and hippocampal BDNF/TrkB signaling\" should receive pilot program funding for one year. Course on Molecular Integrative Neuroresilience. Dr. Pasinetti (PD/PI) and Dr. Ho (P roject 3 Leader) co-directed a course for eigh t MD/PhD students at the Icahn Sch ool of Medicine at Mount Sinai entitled \"Current Topics in Molec ular integrativ e Neuroresilien ce.\" The course focused on understanding the mechanisms by w hich specific dietary polyphen ols may protect against psychological stress, while also clarifying interactions betwee n gastrointestinal microbiome and dietary polyphenols in the promot ion of neuroresilience. Collec tively, this course explored and discussed the characterization o f bioactive dietary polyphenols , with the ultimate goal of using this as a model for the evidence-based cl inical development of naturall y occurring products. The course involved guest lectures from IS MMS Center Cor e and Project lead ers including Dr. Russo (Project 1 Leader), Dr. Faith (Project 3 Lead er), and Dr. Dixon (Core B Le ader). Supplement to promote diversity in health-related research. Dr. Pasinetti submitted a supplement to the NCCIH to train Mr. Justin Br athwaite, a graduate of Columbi a University, to intellectually contribute to the investigation of molecular mechanisms that ma y underlie the promot ion of resilience to sleep deprivation (SD)-mediat ed cognitive impairment through treatment with certain polyphenol botanicals. Mr. Brathwaite will co ntribute in the investigation of brain bioavailable bioactive polyphenol metabolites which will be disco vered during the screening proce ss of the botanical supplement mixture. Ultimately, Mr. Bra thwaite will be trained in optogene tics technology which will allow the visualization of pot ential novel molecular mechanisms consisten t with the theme of Project 2 of the BRC, without duplicating the cu rrent proposal, but rather exten ding the research on how polyphenol botanicals may promote resilience to SD-mediated cognitive impa irment. Collectively, Mr. Brathwaite, through this training, will reach the necessary mass of technic al information as well as intellectual 45 involvement that will enable hi m to continue independently in t he understanding of novel identified phenolic metabolites. Outreach Work Group. Core A est ablished the ISMMS BRC website t o provide supportive outreach to both the scientific community a s well as the public in order to increase awareness of the BRC's research efforts and the implic ations of our findings in the fi eld of botanical supplements and the promotion of cognitive and psyc hological resiliency. Core A has also published two press releases summarizing recent evidence from t he ISMMS BRC using lay langua ge to disseminate the research findings to the interested public . In addition, Dr. Pasinetti h as submitted two symposiums, one to the International Society for Neuroc hemistry meeting and one to the International College of Geriatric Psychoneuropharmacology meeting, on Current Topics in Molecular integrative Neuroresilience. These symposiums are designed to discuss strategies to safely p romote resilience against stress- induced cognitive and psychologic al impairment at the mechanist ic level. Aim 4: In Year 1, Core A developed databas es (MySQL) and database tabl es to host data generated by Projects and Cores. The databas es are able to host multiple data types (quantitative, categorical, etc), and allow efficient search a nd downstream analysis. API (ap plication programming interface) was also developed for authoriz ed users to upl oad and query dat a. Further, Core A conducted extensive validation on the integrity of t he tables and API. Collaboration with UIC CAN PIT (PI: Guido Pauli): The principal objective of the collaboration between the UIC CANPIT and the ISMMS BRC is the production of d esigner knock-out (KO) extracts for Concord Grape Juice (CGJ) to be depleted of malvidin glucos ide. The second set of objectives for the collaboration is associated with comparative NMR fingerprin ting of botanicals, including eventually metabolomics analysis, quantificat ion, and purity determination of major bioactive compounds. In Year 1, purity determination th rough qHNMR analysis together wi th 1H NMR fingerprinting has been performed for a synthetic resve ratrol sample and a grape seed e xtract, respectively. This work is still in progress for optimization. Other Collaborations: Core A established co llaborations with the other CANPITs and Bo tanical Centers. The four active collaborations include: 1. Pennington/Rutgers BRC (PI: Will Cefalu) - The principal objective o f the collaboration between the Pennington/Rutgers BRC and t he ISMMS BRC is to measure para meters in brains in response to certain dietary botanical treatme nts related to glycemic contro l and to explore the molecular pathways in stress response and cognitive function. 2. UIC BRC (PI: Richard Van Breemen) - The principal objective of the collaboration between the UIC BRC and the ISMMS BRC is to take isolated bacteria and spik e mixture with diet ary products to see if we can generate active ingredients. 3. University of Texas Southwestern CANPIT (PI: MacMillan) - The primary objective of the collaboration between t he UTSW CANPIT and the ISMMS BRCS is to predict the bioactivities and mechanisms of actions of individu al polyphenol metabolites usin g cytological prof iling analysis of Ontology . In Year 1, UTSW CANPIT has re ceived a series of compounds from the ISMMS BRC and screened t hem in cytological profiling. 46 C. Significance In Year 1, Core A has accomplis hed its primary goal to assess r esearch progress and determine whether research goals are being met, while prom oting transpare nt communication across Research Projects and Cores. In addition, C ore A has facilitated the cro ss-project intellect ual fertilization and synchronous collaborations while fostering new research among i nvestigators of the ISMMS BRC, as well as among investigators from the two CANPITs and the two ot her BRCs. D. Future Plans In Year 2 with respect to Aim 1 , Core A will continue organizin g and keeping minutes of the monthly 1) Administrative Study Group m eetings to assess the Research P rojects' progress and determine whether research goals are being met, 2) Internal Steering Comm ittee meetings to promote integration among the Research P rojects and Cores and to resolv e any obstacles to the fulfillment of the projected goals, and 3) EAC meetings to monitor the progres s of the projects, to advise the Internal Steering Committee, and to participate in the strategy planning of the ISMMS BRC. With respect to Aim 2, Core A will continue organizing and keep ing minutes of the Study Coordination Work Group meetings to ensure IS MMS BRC investigators to fully and rapidly share ideas, to address questions related to exper imental work, and to synchron ize efforts. With respect to Aim 3, Core A will advertise and fund a new pil ot research program based on merit of the science and relevance to t he parent BRC goal with input fro m ISMMS BRC investigators, the EAC, and the Program Director. Cor e A will also teach MD/PhD st udents about the characterization of bioactive dietary polyphenols , with the ultimate goal of usi ng this as a model for the evidence- based clinical development of naturally occurring products. Fin ally, Core A will continue outreach by sharing findings through press releases for the public and by u pdating the Center website. With respect to Aim 4, Core A B ioinformatics/Data Management wi ll implement more bioinformatic investigations. To achieve th is goal, we added a new personnel to Core A specialized in bioinformatics who will use the random forest network (RFN) as the framework to determine the inter- relationship among the multi-dim ensional variables planned to b e assessed by Projects and Cores, including the identified bioac tive metabolites, amount, concent ration, purity of the metabolites, molecular phenotype (e.g. high-throughput expression profiles), and endpoints. Random forests is a notion of the general technique o f random decision forests that are an ensemble learning method for classification, regressi on and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees. The edges identified by RNF also will allow us to identi fy direction of regulat ion therefore allow causal inference. Therefore, in Year 2 Core A will focus on thr ee aspects (1) to continue to employ the database and API for active data collection and management; (2) conducted metabolites selection based on in vitro readout (methods specified in grant applicati on); (3) construct RFN on multi- dimensional variables to dete rmine causal mechanism of metaboli te (R) intermediate phenotype (R) outcome.

Project-Generated Resources N/A 48 BIOSYNTHESIS/BIOANALYTICAL CORE - CORE B, YEAR 1 A. Specific Aims The Specific Aims of Core B hav e not changed from those origina lly proposed. Project 1: Preservation of psyc hological resilience under chron ic stress Project 2: Promotion of resilience against cognitive decline in duced by sleep deprivation Project 3: Role of the microbiom e in promotion of cognitive and psychological resilience B. Studies and Results B.1 Biosynthesis Component: Compounds to be synthesized fall into phenolic compounds: flavanol, flavonol, anthocyanin and stilbene. Those glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of these compounds found in plasma and brain of ani mals fed GSPE not commercially available will be synthesized by Core B. In Y1, the compound 50 0 mg of dihydrocoumaric acid, from microbial degradation of dietary anthocyanins, was synthesized by catalytic reduction. We have developed two approaches for the generation of glucuronidated d ietary flavonoids: enzymatic biosynthesis and chemical synth esis. For enzymatic synthesis, w e have previously shown the utility of recombinant human glucuronosyl transferase UGT1A9 for the synth esis catechin, epicatechin and their 3- O-methyl derivatives. We obtained and tested 9 recombinant human UGTs against epicatechin and quercetin; UGT1A9 remains th e most efficient enzyme for production of epicatechin glucuronides, whereas UGT1A1 is also active with quercetin. Studies to evaluate the remaining enzymes a re in progress. We are also dev eloping approaches for optimizing the yields of the enzymatic reactions. B.2 Bioanalytical Component: GSPE, RSV, contain a complex mixture of oanthocyanidins, anthocyanins an d other polyphenols including flavonols, resveratrol, and acids. LC/UV/MS methods de were original and concentrate C GJs and the grape juice placebo for projects 1, 2 and 3. Total polyphenols of the all grape-der ived samples were assayed using UV- Vis spectrometry. Results allo wed for the refinement of target compounds for further investigation of bioavailability and bioactivity. Available reference compounds (19), as well as the synthetic dihydrocoumaric acid were analyz ed for purity using HPLC/UV/MS or 1H- and 13C-NMR (for extremely high polar compounds of Mandelic Aci d and L-(+)-tartaric acid). The single compounds were all highly pure and acceptable for use by the research projects. Stability of the indivi dual compounds and quercetin were evaluated. Results indicated th at no significant degradation wa s observed over a 5-day period (6 technical reports delivered). Determination of the Metabolism of Grape Derived Polypheno ls by Intestinal Microbiota: Samples from fermentation studies at Mt. Sinai using GSPE and CGJ and 3 bacterial donors were evaluated using a GC/MS method developed at Rutgers to quantitate content of bacterial metabolites. For the GSPE treated samples, the bacterial broth samples showed consis tent results between same-donor repetitions, and results demonstrated a time-based effect on me tabolite profile. There were clear differences between the metabolic activities of the three bacte rial donor groups. Broths from donors 1 and 2 showed near complete consum ption of gallic acid even afte r 24h; whereas broth from donor 3 did not consume a significant quantity of gallic acid, even aft er 72h. Spiked recovery experiments demonstrated the reproducibility and accuracy of this method. F or CGJ treated samples, bacterial broth samples also showed consis tent results between same-donor repetitions. Results demonstrated a time-based effect on metabolite profile. There were clear dif ferences between the metabolic activity 49 of the three bacterial donor gr oups. Broths from donor 3 showed increasing content of caffeic acid over 72h, whereas broth from donor 1 and 2 showed a consumption of a significant quantity of caffeic acid, after 72h (2 technical reports delivered). C. Significance C.1 Biosynthesis Component: Phase II metabolites of dietary polyphenols by the Biosynthesis Component will provide standards and exper imental samples with applicati on in a wide variety of studies. C.2 Bioanalytical Component: Data from Bioanalytical Component provided critical information derived phenols, their stabi lity, and their bioavailabili ty/metabolism in in vitro and in vivo studies. D. Future Plans D.1 Biosynthesis Component: We developed synthetic schemes f or the full range of compounds needed. Most are multi-step, in wh ich the base flavonoid struct ure is assembled de novo, and involve addition and removal of protect ing groups. The advantage of the synthetic schemes over the enzymatic approach is that it is p ossible to synthesize non-bio logical isomers. D.2 Bioanalytical Component : We will continue providing su pport for individual projects ne eds with chemical profiling, quantificat ion of metabolites bioavailabili ty studies generated, QC, and archiving of submitted active compounds/fractions. Using the GC/MS method de veloped in Y1, we will support for Project 3 in quantifying the cont ent of bacterial metabolites a chieved by different bacterial donors and different grape derived materials including GSPE, CGJ and resve ratrol. Samples will be also examined as needed for their stability over time to predict qua litative changes stored under different conditions. Core B is current ly conducting method development f or bioanalysis of phase II metabolites such as glucuronide conjugates of (3'-Me-) catechin and be utilized to dete rmine the metabolites in the pla sma and brain samples obtained from animals treated with epicatechin -enriched extract for Project 2 . In further support of Projects 1 and 2, methods to assess bioavailabilit y and metabolism of other biolo gical samples treated with GJ and resveratrol will be conducted. C ombined with GC/MS bioanalysis on the Phase I metabolites, these approaches will expand our knowledge on qualitative and quantit ative grape polyphenol profiles in plasma and tissue distribution. Additionally, Bioanalytical component will distribute an initial LIMS system to the Center for testing. as an online tracking system. E. Publications Peer-refereed papers: 1. T.S. Villani, E.

Specific Aims The Specific Aims of Core C have not changed from those origina lly proposed. Aim 1: Support individual proje cts by providing behavioral phen otyping for each project based on its objectives. Aim 2: Support individual project s by providing electrophysiolo gy analysis for each project based on its objectives. Aim 3: Provide toxicological assessment of polyphenol-enriched botanical preparations in mice. B. Studies and Results For Aim 1 (Year 1), in collaboration with Project 1, to test th e effect of select botanical treatments in the promotion of psychological resilience, we have conducted a battery of behavioral testing, including a chronic social defea t stress test, a social avoidan ce test to evaluate social avoidance behavior, a sucrose preference test to evaluate anhedonia and a splash test to evaluate self-neglect behavior. In collaboration with Project 2, to test the effect o f select botanical treatments in the promotion of cognitive resilienc e to sleep deprivation stress, we conducted a battery of tests including the novel object recognition test, the Morris water maze test a nd the contextual fea ring conditioning test. Moreover, Core C has established the flower pot method as a model for sleep deprivation that induces restricted REM sleep depr ivation. We also introduced an automated sleep deprivation system from Pinnacle Inc. that is capab le of inducing total sleep depr ivation as well as REM sleep disruption without direct human intervention. This automated apparatus, co mpared to the manual \"gentle handling,\" can avoid direct inter action with the experimenter a nd can be fully standardized to avoid lab to lab variation. For Aim 2 (Year 1), in collaborat ion with Project 1, to test th e effect of treatment in the promotion of psychological resilience, we have conducted excitatory postsyna ptic current (EPSC) recordings in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons in control mice an d mice treated with select botanicals following chronic soci al defeat stress. In collabora tion with Project 2, we measured ex vivo long term potentiation (LTP) and basal synaptic transmission (B ST) in hippocampal slices following select botanical treatment. For Aim 3 (Year 1), in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2, we have conducted the toxicological assessment for the mice treated with select botanicals. Specifi cally, we assessed the serum metabolic panel and liver functi on panel from mice treated with different doses of botanicals. We also performed gross mouse necropsy and complete necropsy in mouse t issues isolated from in vivo studies conducted by Projects 1 and 2. C. Significance In Year 1, we have supported the efforts of Projects 1 and 2 by performing behavioral studies and electrophysiological analyses that provide functional assessmen ts of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which bioactive botanicals may beneficially promo te psychological resilience in the context of social defeat (Project 1) and preserve cognitive fun ction in the context of sleep deprivation (Project 2). Core C also provided toxicological assessments for select botanical compounds tested by Projects 1 and 2, which allow the potential benefits and safety of phenolic compounds to be determined for further preclinic al and clinical translational a pplications. 52 D. Future Plans In Year 2, Core C will continue to provide state-of-the-art beh avioral and electrophysiological assessments based on the goals of i ndividual projects with the overall objective of providing support to each project that will allow the biological effects of bioac tive botanicals on brain activity and function to be determined. Core C will continue to conduct toxi cological assessments for all the individual botanical compounds used by each project which will provide important information on the safety of individual botanicals to be readily translated to fut ure preclinical and clini cal applications. All of the proposed studies are in line with the proposal and there is no change in the program. E. Publications Peer-refereed publications: 1.

Project-Generated Resources N/A 53 SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS FROM THE P OSTER SESSION AT THE SYMPOSIUM 1. Characterization of bacterial metabolites of grape derived c ompounds by human gut microbiota Thomas Villani, Eileen Carry, Daniel Giurleo, Harna Patel, Giul io Maria Pasinetti, Lap Ho, Jeremiah Faith, Qingli Wu, and James Simon Rutgers University and Icahn Sc hool of Medicine at Mount Sinai In recent years, the human microbi ome as a topic of study has e licited great interest among researchers studying the comple x mechanisms through which food and pharmaceuticals modulate human health. Due to the complexities of microbiologic al metabolism, significant discussion about the impact of bacte ria on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of active- compound delivery in therapeutic c ontexts can be found in the r ecent literature. In this work, we sought to identify impacts on the pharmacokinetics of grape derived products due to bacterial metabolism within the gut. Three cultures of human mi croflora were obtained and cultured with grape seed extract for a period of 72 hours; aliq uots were taken after 24 hours. A solvent extraction method follow ed by derivatization for gas ch romatographic analysis was developed and validated for quantif ication of metabolic byprodu cts of the polyphenolic in bacterially-fe rmented grape seed extract. Si gnificant changes in the chemical profile were detected due to bacterial fermentation, s upporting the idea that human gut microbiota can have signifi cant impacts on absorption and m etabolism of grape derived products. 2. The Effects of Diet and the Microbiota in Determining Host H ealth Sean R. Llewellyn, Br itton, Eduardo Contijoch, Arthur Mortha, Miriam Merad, and Jeremiah J. Faith Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai We have coevolved relationships with the microorganisms that co lonize our body surfaces. As hosts, we provide our gut micr obiota with meals that change the abundance of bacterial species and their metabolic produ cts, which in turn can influen ce our physiology. In order to examine the role of dietary co mponents on the gut microbiota, h ost health, and disease, we fed diets with systematically v aried amounts and sources of pro tein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber to mice in several diseas e models, including dextran sodi um sulfate (DSS) colitis model and T-cell transfer colitis mode l, in addition to wild-type unc hallenged mice. Protein and fermentable fiber had the greatest influence on health. Mice gi ven a high protein diet had increased microbial loads and intestinal permeability, more sev ere disease (i.e. weight loss, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and decreased survival) in DSS coli tis, as compared to a low protein diet. Fermentable fiber decreased intestinal permeabili ty, increased the number of regulatory T cells within the la mina propria, and led to a sign ificant decrease in disease severity for both the DSS and T-cell transfer colitis models. F urthermore, both protein and fermentable fiber act in concert to modulate health, as increas es in fermentable fiber could offset the increased disease severity of a high protein diet, d emonstrating that the combined influence of our dietary ingredients have a profound influence on health. The results shown demonstrate a role of macronutrients in host health and disease with the potential to test botanicals and micronutri ents in our models. 54 3. Optogenetic analysis of pol yphenol-induced resilience agains t sleep deprivation- associated cognitive deficits Chad Smith, Tal Frolinger, Robert Louis, Jun Wang, Rick Dixon, Jim Simon, and Giulio Maria Pasinetti Icahn School of Medicine at Mount S inai, University of North Te xas, and Rutgers University Sleep deprivation (SD) is a comm on problem in our society and i s linked to a number of physiological and cognitive co-morbidities, including memory im pairments. SD disrupts the consolidation period of memory formation through downregulation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway, mTOR, and dec reased expression of plasticity -related genes including immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-fos. We have found that treatment with certain bioavailable bioactive phenolic metabolites (BBPMs) provides ph ctivates the CAMKII and CREB si gnaling pathways, and induces IEG expression. To determine the mechanism through whi ch BBPMs provide resilience to SD in neurons activated by training, we will use c-fos-tTA transgenic mice to label memory-bearing neurons (tet-labeling) with opsin proteins expre ssed through a Tetracycline Response Element (TRE), a novel technology that has been used t o investigate memory engrams in specific brain region s. Recently, tet-labeling has been used to generate false memories and suppress hippocampal memory engrams in the context ual fear conditioning (CFC) memory test. Ongoing experiments in our labs are testing the feasibility of this approach by injecting mice with a pan-neuronal AAV expressing e NpHR3.0 to silence hippocampal neurons bearing fear and spatial memories. In the future, c-fos-tTA mice will be injected with TRE-ChR2, treat ed with BBPMs and SD, and undergo footshock in context A, followed by optogenetic activat ion of tet-labeled neurons in an unrelated context B. Activating or silencing memory-bearing neurons will cause expression or su ppression of memories, respectively, allowing for quantif ication of resilience to SD. Through histological analysis, we will examine the overlap of cells expressing ChR2 and c-fos, as well as CREB and other pathways to determine whether IEG -inducing BBPMs modulate these signaling pathways in memory-bearing neurons. Through histology, we will also examin e the effects on signaling pathways and synaptic plasticity of optogenetically activating these populations of neurons. Through tet-labeling of specific populations of neurons, we can examine individual neuronal responses to therapy, and the responses of brain regions to opt ogenetic modulation. 4. Gender associated molecular responses in cognitive impairmen t mediated by chronic sleep deprivation Tal Frolinger, Chad Smith, Jun Wang, and Giulio Maria Pasinetti Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Sleep deprivation (SD) is a comm on problem in our society. Chro nic SD is co-morbid with a number of physiological and cognit ive problems, including menta l illness and memory deficits. SD is hypothesized to disrupt t he consolidation period of memor y formation through down regulation of cAMP/PKA/ CREB, mTOR signaling pathway, immediate early genes (IEGs) and other plasticity-related genes expression. We found that certa in brain bioavailable bioactive phenolic compounds (primarily flavan- 3'-ols) provide resilience to acute-SD-mediated cognitive decline in male mice through activ ation of the CREB, CAMKIIa si gnaling pathways and induction of IEG expression. Mos t interestingly, using the nov el object recognition paradigm 55 we found a relationship between the estrous cycle phases of low estrogen (metestrus, diestrus, estrus) and; I. Reduced cognitive performance in cont rol females, II. Stress response in sleep deprived females, when compared to male mice in the SD model. This evidence is consistent with the fact that the estrous cycle is accompanied by hippocampal changes that affect memory consolidation, s uggesting superiority in learning task performances of proestrus females compared to males. We are currently exploring gender di fferences in memory performance and gene expression in response to chronic SD, usin g the c-fos-tTA/TRE optogenetics system to visualize t he regional distribution of s ignaling pathways. The study will provide an amenable system to fu rther investigate the potential beneficial role of currently available phenolic metabolites to investigate the molecular rel ationship between cognitive function and changes in brain ge ne expression in a gender relat ed fashion. In view of the fact that SD affects more than 70 mil lion Americans, the social impl ication of this study on cognitive performance is of the foremost importance. 5. Dissecting the mechanisms by which dietary polyphenols may m odulate lower back pain Simoni Tiano, Lap Ho, Jeremiah Fa ith, and Giulio Maria Pasinett i Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Lower back pain (LBP) is a common and debilitating musculoskele tal disorder, but unfortunately, chronic LBP is oft en resistant to treatments. Th e most common cause of LBP is degeneration of intervertebral di sks (IVDs) that serve to separ ate the vertebrae and allow for spinal motion. Key contributor y pathogenic characteristics und erlying discogenic LBP are IVD inflammation and structural destabilization, as well as in-grow th of sensory nerve that leads to hypernociception. Based on evidenc e suggesting benefits of diet ary polyphenols in modulating diverse medical conditions, we e xplored the potential of develo pment dietary polyphenols for treating discogenic LBP. Excitedly , we observed that dietary su pplementation with a select Bioactive Polyphenol-rich Dietary Preparation (BDPP) significan tly reduced hypernociceptive responses in a rat model of painf ul disc degeneration. The majo rities of orally consumed gastrointestinal absorption and/or post- absorptive xenobiotic metabolism and are typically accumulated in target tissues as phenolic metabolite forms. We identified 30 phenolic metabolites that ar e biologically ava ilable following oral BDPP administration. To gather a better understanding of h ow BDPP may mechanistically modulate pain associated with di sc degeneration, we investigate d individual phenolic metabolites for their efficacy to modulate discogenic pathogeni c mechanisms using primary cell cultures generated from either nucleus pulposus (NP) or an nulus fibrosus (AF), which are the two major IVD structural-f unctional units. In initial studi es, we tested effects of phenolic metabolites in modulating TNF-m ediated induction of key genes known to associate with IVD inflammation, extrac ellular matrix degradation and neuron ingro wth. We identified multiple biologically available phenolic m etabolites that protected agai nst the induction of many targeted genes. Moreover, we found two biologically available p henolic metabolites that significantly interfere with me chanisms associated with IVD des tabilization, IVD inflammation and IVD abnormal sensory nerve in- growth. Ongoing investigation s are exploring bioactivities of individual biologically ava ilable phenolic metabolites in pr imary AF cell cultures. Outcomes from our investigation support fu rther preclinical (and eventua lly clinical) development of polyphenols, in either dietary o r pharmacologic applications, t o simultaneously target multiple 56 pathologic mechanisms underlying IVD degeneration and pain, whi ch would improve the likelihood of therapeutic efficacy for treating discogenic LBP. 6. Dietary Botanicals in the Preservation of Cognitive and Psyc hological Resilience - Core B: Biosynthesis Component Ronaldo J. Cavazos Jr., Jack W. Blount, Taylor D. Greer, and Ri chard A. Dixon University of North Texas The goals of the Core B Biosynt hesis Component are to combine b oth synthetic and biosynthetic approaches to genera te brain-targeted metabolites of grape-derived polyphenols. The metabolites we seek to synthesize are not commercially avai lable. Therefore, by combining both enzymatic biosynt hesis and chemical synthesis we aim to synthesize the components on large scales. Once completed, these metabolites w ill be used in Projects 1 & 2 with in vitro studies which explore the potent ial bioactivities and mechanis ms in promoting psychological resilience (Proje ct 1) and/or cognitive wellness (Project 2). The components will also serve aa standards in the analysis of products from metabo lism of "}
