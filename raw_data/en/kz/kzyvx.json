Starting on April 3, 2022, testing and vaccination clinics at the Arena at the Alliant Energy Center will close, but you will still have plenty of options to get your COVID vaccines and tests in Dane County. \"Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have dropped dramatically since the Omicron surge in January as has demand for testing and vaccination. As we have done throughout the COVID pandemic, we are simply adjusting our response to meet the current needs of our community,\" said Janel Heinrich, Director of Public Health Madison & Dane County. Since May 2020, more than 450,000 tests and more than 111,000 vaccines have been given at the Alliant Energy Center. An effort made possible thanks to the support of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Wisconsin National Guard, FEMA, Alliant Energy Center staff, various city and county departments, Accelerated Clinical Laboratories, and AMI Expeditionary Healthcare. \"It has been an honor to see this incredible team effort unfold and I want to thank each one of our partners at the county, state, and federal level. Their efforts over the past two years helped provide life-saving services to our community,\" said Heinrich. Public Health will continue to provide [testing](https://www.publichealthmdc.com/coronavirus/testing) services at the South Madison clinic at 2230 S. Park Street and [vaccination](https://publichealthmdc.com/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine) services at the East Washington clinic at 2705 E. Washington Avenue as well as the South Madison clinic. \"We have built a testing network throughout Dane County by training pharmacy partners to administer tests at their locations. We now have a team of 39 trusted [testing partners](https://publichealthmdc.com/coronavirus/testing#testing) in addition to national testing partners. We encourage folks to use one of those options if they need a test,\" said Ken Van Horn, testing director, Public Health Madison & Dane County. Residential households in the U.S. can order two sets of four free at-home tests from [USPS.com](https://special.usps.com/testkits).
