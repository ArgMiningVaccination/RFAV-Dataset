The vaccine will not protect against infection caused by h epatitis A and non -A non -B hepatitis virus es. As hepati tisD (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection or carrier state, it can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by vaccination with ENGERIX -B. The vaccine can be administered at any age f rombirth onwa rds. It may be used to start a primary course of vaccination or as a booster dose. It may also be used to complete a primary course of vaccination started with plasma -derived or yeast -derived vaccin es or as a booster dose in subjects who ha ve previ ously received a primary course of vaccination with plasma -derived or yeast -derived vaccines. The hepatitis B virus induces a severe form of viral hepatitis. Transmission of the virus occurs through percut aneous contact with contaminated blood, se rumor plasma. Infection may also occur by the exposure of mucous surfaces, or intact or damaged skin to other body fluids such as saliva, mucosal secretions and semen. There is no specific treatment for hepatiti sB. Vaccination against hepatitis B is ex pected in the longterm to reduce the overall incidence of both hepatitis B and the chronic complications such as developing chronic liver disease which may lead to cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma . The National Advisory Committee of Immuniza tion (NA CI) pr ovides additional guidance on the use of hepatitis B vaccines in Canada , including a list of recommended individuals for vaccination against hepatitis B . Please refer t othe Canadian Immunization Guid e. 1.1Pediatrics Pediatrics (0 -19 years of age): Based o n the data submitted and reviewed by Health Canada, the safety and efficacy of ENGERIX -Bin pediatric patients has been established; therefore, Health Canada has authorized an indication for pediatric use(see Clinical Trials , Special -B(hepatitis vaccine (recombinant)) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or having shown signs of hypersensit ivity after previous ENGERIX -Badministrat ion. For a com plete listing of vaccine components , see Dosage Forms, Strengths, Composition and Packaging. Page 5of 27ENGERIX -B should not be administered to subjects with severe febrile infections as for any vaccine. Howev er, the presence of a minor infection does not con traind icate vaccination. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not considered as a contraindication for hepatitis B vaccination (see W arnings and Precautions). GE AND not be given intravenously or intradermally ENGERIX -B may be given to pediatric patients , patients with renal insufficiency and toimmunocompromised pa tients as per the dosing recommendations b elow 3.2Recommend ed Dose and Dosage A djustment Table 1 Dosage and A dministration Vaccination ScheduleAge Dose/Volume (mcg/mL)Dosing Schedule (months) 0 1 2 6 12 Standard (3 dose)20 years of age20/1.0 x x x Standard 0 -19 years of age10/0.5 x x x Accelerated 20 years of age 20/1.0 x x x x 0 -19 years of age10/0.5 x x x x Rapid 20 years of age20/1.0 0,7d, 21d xxx d=daysx Alternati ve 11 x Page 6of 27For optima l prot ection the recommended Standard schedule for ENGERIX -B (hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)) is three doses administered at 0, 1 and 6 months. For more Accelerated protection a three dose schedule (0, 1, 2 with a booster dose at month 12) res ultsin the dev elopment of protective anti -HBs titres by 3 months. The booster dose (at 12 months) is required to maintain prolonged protective anti -HBs titres. In circumstances in adults, where a very Rapid induc tion of protection is required, e.g. persons trave lling to areas of high endemicity and who commence a course of vaccination against hepatitis B within one month prior to departure, a schedule of three intramuscular injections given at 0, 7 and 21 days may be used. When this schedule is applied, a booste r dose should be administered 12 months after the first dose for longer term protection (see Action and Clinical Pharmacology for seroconversion rates). Primary Immunization Adults 20 years and over: A dose of 20 mcg of antigen protein in 1.0 mLsuspensi on is recommended for adults (see Table 1). Neonates, infants, children and adolescents up to 19 years inclusive: A dose of 10 mcg of antigen protein in 0.5 mL s uspension is recommended for neonates, in fants, ch ildren andadolescents up to 19 years of age inclusive (see Table 1). When the pediatric presentation is not available, other presentations may be used for withdra wing the appropriate dose. Alternative D osing (Ad olesce nts11-15 years) A dose of 20 mcg of antigen protein in 1.0 mL suspension may be administered in subjects from 11 years up to and including 15 years of age according to a 0, 6 months schedule if low c ompliance is anticipated (see Table 1) (see Action and Clinical Pharmacology). Patients with renal insufficiency including patients undergoing hemodialysis 16 years of age and above: The primary immunization sched ule for patients with renal insufficiency includin g patientsundergoing hemodialysis is four double doses (2 x 20 mcg) at elected date, 1month, 2 months and 6 months fr om the date of the first dose. The immunization schedule should be adapted in order to ensure that the anti -HBs antibody titre r emains above th e accepted protective level of 10 IU/L. Patients with renal insufficiency including patients undergoing hemodialysis up to and including 15 years of age: Patients with renal insufficiency including patients undergoing hemodialysis have a reduced im mune r esponse to hepatitis B vaccine. Consideration should be given to serological testing following a complete course of ENGERIX -B. Additional doses of vaccine may need to be considered to ensure a protect ive anti -HBs level -B is recommended (see Action and Clinical Pharmacology). ENGERIX -B can effectively boost anti -HBs responses initially elicited by either pl asma - derived or yeast -derived vaccines. For individuals inwhom a primary vaccination schedule has been initiated with a plasma -derived vaccine, dosing may be continued with ENGERIX -B. Booster Doses Routine booster vaccinations in immunocompetent persons are not recommended since protection has been sho wn to lastfor at least 15 years. Studies of long term protective efficacy, however, will determine whether booster doses of vaccine are ever needed. It is important to recognize that absence of detectable anti-HBs does not mean lack of protectio n, becaus e immu ne memory persists. Booster doses in this situation are not indicated. Immunocompromised persons often respond suboptimally to the vaccine. Subsequent hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposures in these indi viduals can result in disease or the carr ier state . Therefore, booster doses may be necessary in this population. The optimal timing of booster doses for immunocompromised individuals who are at continued risk of HBV exposure is not known and should be bas ed on the severity of the compromised sta te and an nual m onitoring for the presence of anti -HBs. 3.3Administration Check the expiry date of the vaccine carefully. Do not use vaccine beyond its expiry date. The vaccine should be inspected visually for any f oreign particulate matter and/or colorati on prior to adm inistration. Before use of ENGERIX -B, the vaccine should be well shaken to resuspend the sediment of fine white particles of adjuvant (aluminium hydroxide) which settles during storage and to obtain a slightly opaque, white suspension. Dis cardif the con tentappears otherwise. As with other vaccines, a dose of vaccine should be withdrawn under strict aseptic conditions and precautions taken to avoid contamination of the contents. Vial Instructions When using vial, use different needles to pierce the rub berstopper and to inject the vaccine. Clean the skin at the site of injection with a suitable antiseptic and dry with a piece of dry sterile cotton. Disinfect the rubber stopper with antiseptic; wi pe it dry with a dry, sterile cotton swab ;then us ing a sterile needle, withdraw the vaccine from the vial into a sterile syringe. Page 8of 27 Syringe Instructions To attach the needle to the syringe, refer to the drawing below 1. Holding the syringe barrel in on e hand (avoid holding the syringe plunger ), unscre w the syringe cap by twisting it anticlockwise. 2. To attach the needle to the syringe, twist the needle clockwise into the syringe until you feel it lock (see drawing). 3. Remove the needle protector, which on occasion c an be a little stiff. 4. Administer the vaccine. Note: The syringe provided with ENGERIX -B might be slightly different (without screw thread) than the syringe in the above drawing. In that case, the needle should be attached following the below in struction s. Do not remove the white back -stop from the syringe. Prior to administration, ensure that the plunger rod is firmly attached to the rubber stopper by turning the plunger clockwise until slight resistan ce is felt. Do not over tighten. Remove syringe LUER T ip- cap and needle cap. Attach needle by pressing and twisting in a clockwise rotation until secured -B should be injected intramuscularly. In adults the injection should b e given in the deltoid region. In neonat es and in fants ,itmay be preferable to inject ENGERIX -B in the anterolateral thigh because of the small size of their deltoid muscle. In special circumstances ,the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in pat ients with severe bleeding tendencies (e. g., hemop hiliac s). ENGERIX -B intradermally . ENGERIX -B may be administered simultaneously with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG); however ,it must be administered at a separate inj ection site. 4OVERDOSA GE Cases of overdos ehave be en rep orted during post -marketing surveillance. Adverse events reported following overdosage were similar to those reported with normal vaccine administration.

ENGER IX-B (hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)) should no t be a dministered in the gluteal region or intradermally since these routes of administration may result in a lower immune response. Intradermal administration may also result in severe local reactions. The vaccine must never be administered i ntravenou sly. A new sterile syringe and a new sterile needle should always be used to prevent the transmission from one subject to another of infectious agents, such as the hepatitis B virus, non -A, non -B hepatitis virus or the human immunodeficiency viru s(HIV). Hepat ic/Biliary /Pancreatic Patients with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C carriers should not be precluded from vaccination against hepatitis B. The vaccine could be advised since hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be severe in these patie nts. TheHBV v accination should be considered on a case by case basis by the physician. Immune Because hepatitis B has a long incubation period it is possible that there may be latent infection at the time of vacc ination. ENGERIX -B may not prevent hepat Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity after an injection should not receive further injections of ENGERIX -B (see Contraindications). The immune response to hepatitis B vaccine is related to a number of factors ,including older age, male gender, obesity, smoking habits and route of administration. In subjects who may respond less well to the administration of the hepatitis B vaccine (e.g. more than 40 years of age, indiv iduals with type 2 diabetes, etc.), addit ional dos es may be considered. Patients with HIV infection should not be precluded from vaccination against hepatitis B. The vaccine could be advised since hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be severe in these p atients. The HBV vaccination should be co nsidered on a c aseby case basis by the physician. Page 12of 27In HIV infected patients and persons with an impaired immune system, adequate anti - HBs antibody titers may not be obtained after the primary immunization course an d such patients may therefore require adm inistration of additional doses of vaccine (see Dosage and Administration). Neurologic Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. Renal In hemodialysis patients, adequate anti -HBs antibody titers may not be obtained after the primary immunization course and such patients may therefore require administration of additional doses of vaccine (see Dosage and Administration ). 7.1Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women The effect of the antigen (HBsAg) on fetal development is unknown as adequate studies with ENGERIX -B have not been conducted during pregnancy and adequate animal reproduction studies are not available. However, vacci nation of a pregnant woman may be considered in order to prevent hepatitis B in high -risk situations. There is no experience on the extent of exposure during clinical trials. 7.1.2 Breast -feeding Adequate human data on use during lactation and ad equate an imal r eproduction studies are not available. It is not known whether ENGERIX -B is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, precaution should be exercised. 7.1.3 Pediatrics The pote ntial risk of apnoea and the need for res piratory monito ringfor 48 -72 hours should be considered when administering the primary imm unization series to very premature infants (born 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or de layed. 8ADVERSE REA CTIONS 8.1Clinical Trial A dverse Reactions Because clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions ,the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be com pared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug. Adverse reaction information from clinical trials is useful for identifying drug -related adverse events and for approximating rates.

In a comparative trial in subjects from 11 years up to and including 15 years of age, the incidence of local and ge neral solicited symptoms reported after a two dose regimen of ENGERIX -B 20 mcg was similar overall to that reported after the standard three -dose regimen vaccine (recombinant)) 10 mcg/0.5mL dose may be administered concomitantly with the Human Papillomavirus vaccine (CERVARIX). Administration of the 10 mcg/0.5mL dose of ENGERIX -B at the same time as CERVARIX has shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to the HPV16/18 antigens in CERVARIX. Anti -hepatitis B geometric mean antibody titers were lower on co -administration of the vaccines but the percentage of subjects reaching anti - HB 10mIU/ml (seroprotection) was 97.8% for concomitant vaccination with ENGERIX - B, and 100% for ENGERIX -B given alone. The clinical relevance of the reduced antibody titre and the risk of a substantially reduced immune response to hepatitis B if doses of hepatitis B vaccine are missed are not known. 9.2Drug -Drug Interactions Interactions with other drugs have not been established.

It is generally accepted that an anti -HBs titre grea ter than 10 IU/L correlates with protection against hepatitis B virus infection. More than 90% of healthy adults, children and neonates developed protective anti -HBs titres one month after completing a primary vaccination schedule of hepatitis B vaccine ( recombinant). 10.2 Duration of Protection Routine booster vaccinations in immunocompetent persons are not recommended since protection has been shown to last for at least 15 years (see Dosage and Administration, Booster Doses) . 11STORA GE, STABILITY AND DISPOSA L ENGERIX -B (hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)) should be shipped under refrigeration and stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C .

Page 16of Drug Substance Proper name: hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) Product Characteristics The active ingredient is the hepatitis B s urface anti gen (HBs Ag) produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) by recombinant DNA technology. It is adsorbed on alumin ium hydroxide, hydrated. The HBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physicochemical steps. The HBsAg assembles spontaneou sly, in the absence of chemica l treatment, into spherical particles of 20 nm in average diameter containing non-glycosylated HBsAg polypeptides and a lipid matrix consisting mainly of phospholipids. Extensive tests have demonstrated that these p articles di splay th e characteristic prope rtiesof natural HBsAg. The HBV is formulated in phosphate buffered saline.

As well, anti -HBs titres are higher in females than in males after 3 doses of yeast -derived or plasma -derived vaccine. However, protective anti -HBs titres develop in the same proportion in both sexes. In a compara tive stu dy (HBV -280) p erformed in adolescents 11 to 15 years of age, onset of seroprotection (SP) was slower with the 2 -dose schedule of ENGERIX -B 20 mcg (11.3% at month 2, 26.4% at month 6) compared to the 3-dose schedule of ENGERIX -B 10 mc g (55.8% at mon th 2, 87 .6% at month 6 ). However, high seroprotection rates were reached one month after primary vaccination course with both schedules (96.7% with the 2 -dose vs 98.2% with the 3 -dose schedule). Geometric -HBs seroprotection rates observed in long -term follow -up phase of the study are presented in Table 5below.

Immunogenicity in Neo nates Instudies, the anti-HBs response of neonates of both carrier and non -carrier mothers to ENGERIX -B has been shown to be similar to that obtained in adults and children with regard to seroconversion rate and anti -HBs titres attained . Preliminary e hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) to the neonate at birth does not appear to affect the immune response to ENGERIX -B. Geriatrics: Immunogenicity in Older Subjects Anti-HBs titres tend to be slightly lowe r in older subjects than in younger subje cts. This influence of age is found for both yeast -derived and plasma -derived vaccines. Hepatic Insufficiency : Immunogenicity in Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis C After the completion of the vaccination course, all subjects were s eroprote cted with respect to hepatitis B (anti -HBs levels 10mIU/mL), and GMTs were 1000 mIU/mL. The immune response of chronic liver disease (CLD) patients was similar to that of ENGERIX -B in healthy subjects. Renal Insufficiency : Hemodialysis Patie nts The anti-HBs respo nse of patients on chronic hemodialysis is known to be impaired. However, experience from clinical studies shows that two months after 4 double doses, i.e., 40 mcg (at months 0, 1, 2 and 6), 67% of vaccinees develo ped protective anti body titres. Anti -HBs titresremained relatively low compared to anti -HBs titres in healthy subjects. In a subsequent study conducted in 83 uremic patients, a seroprotection rate of Page 21of 2787% was achieved one month after four double doses of ENGERIX -B, and 79% six mont hs after last vaccinedose. Immunogenicity in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The table below summarizes seroprotection rates from study HBV -323(i.e. percentages of subjects with anti -HBs antibody concentrations 10 mI U/mL) in subjects w ith type 2 diabetes me llitus and control subjects without type 2 diabetes.

Other Clinical Studies: In one study, four of 244 (1.6%) adults (homosexual men) at high risk of contracting hepatitis B virus became infected during the period prior to completion of three doses of ENGERIX -B (20 mcg at 0, 1, 6 months). No ad ditional patients b ecame in fected during the 18-month follow -up period after completion of the immunization course. The anti -HBs response to the recombinant yeast -derived vaccine is at least as high as that obtained by plasma -derived vaccines in patients affected by thalass emia maj or. The anti -HBs response to ENGERIX -B in residents of institutions for the developmentally challenged is similar to that observed in the general population. The anti -HBs response in drug addicts does not differ from the respon se in the general populatio n. Formulation Study HBV -269 enrolled 652 healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years with a 20 mcg HBsAg/dose, compared the responses elicited one month after the completion of the primary vaccination course (three dose s given at 0, 1 and 6 mont hs) by ENGERIX -B vaccine formulated to contain 50 mcg/mL of thiomersal as preservative (referred to as Page traces of thime rosal fr om the product ion process) thimerosal -free ENGERIX -B -free process). In Study HBV -277, 587 infants were vaccinated with a 10 mcg HBsAg/dos e andthe responses elicite d one month af ter the completion of the primary vaccination course (three doses given at 0, 1 and 6 months) by TF -ENGERIX -Bwere compared with that elicited by PF -ENGERIX -Bin infants when the first dose was administered during the first two week s of lif e. The immune respons e to the HBsAg antigen manufactured using the thiomersal -free process was not rendered inferior by the change in process. Seroprotection rates are presented in the table below.

Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condit ion and treatment and ask if there is any new information about ENGERIX -B. What is ENGERIX -B used for ? ENGERIX -B is a vaccine used to prevent hepatitis B disease. It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immun ization with ENGERIX -Bas hepa titis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. Vaccination is the best way to protect against this disease. The vaccine does not contain live virus and cannot c ause hepatitis B in fection. How does ENG ERIX -B work? The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. What are the ingredients in ENGERIX -B?
