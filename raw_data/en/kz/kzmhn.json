When I came in, I was in quite a bit of constant pain with what I thought was due to severe osteoporosis, which left me unable to do much exercise, I could no longer ride my horses, and all movement was severely limited. Come to find out I had a very large tear in my left hip labrum. No wonder it hurt so bad! We proceeded with the treatment and within a week I was back in the gym carefully exercising. Within 2 weeks, I was back on my horse and I was no longer limping! I still need to be somewhat cautious while the tear heals, but I feel fantastic. I was looking at a 6 month painful recovery with surgery. This has literally changed my path! I cannot say enough about the knowledge that Dr. Ed and his wife, Dr. Pam, has. I am very cautious about doctors and I do my research. It says a whole lot when a doctor really wants to know each individual because each case is different and one treatment may not be right for another person. There is so much of the \"one-size-fits-all\" treatments out there, especially in the stem cell world, just to make a quick buck. That is NOT the case here. It's much more important to do the RIGHT treatment. I am very happy with the treatment I have received. For me to drive all the way from Queen Creek for a doctor says a lot! I highly recommend Dr. Ed and highly recommend taking a look at stem cells for treatment if that is an option!read less Daniel H. I had chronic low back pain for 5 years.
