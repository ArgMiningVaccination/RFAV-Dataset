Frequently Asked COVID-19 Questions Are people with asthma at greater risk for catching COVID-19? People with asthma are not believed to be at higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19 \u2014 but if you do get infected you may be at higher risk of getting very sick. COVID-19 can: - affect your respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs) - cause an asthma attack - possibly lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease. Are people with asthma at high risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19? CDC says adults of any age with moderate to severe asthma may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. However, many studies examining the relationship between asthma and COVID-19 have found no increased risk of severe illness or complications, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI). A few studies have revealed nonallergic asthma may be linked to more severe illness from COVID-19, AAAAI says. These studies are not conclusive, however, as it's not clear if the patients had COPD, a known risk for severe cases of COVID-19. What's the takeaway for people with asthma? Keep your asthma under the best possible control at all times, take your daily controller medications as prescribed and follow your Asthma Action Plan. That way your lungs will be healthy and well prepared to fend off any virus or infection. How do I find out when I can get a COVID-19 vaccine? Vaccines are now widely available in all U.S. states. They are available for all adults and children ages 12-18. Here is how find a vaccination site near you: - Visit [Vaccine.gov](http://to https://www.vaccines.gov/)to find a location near you. - Check your local pharmacy's website to see if vaccination appointments are available. - Call your state or county health department to find vaccination sites in your area. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool in stopping the pandemic. What are recommendations for people with asthma? More than 24 million people in the United States have asthma and 10 people die from asthma in the United States daily. It is important to practice COVID-19 prevention strategies if you have asthma due to the increased risk of severe complications. If you have asthma, be sure to continue to follow your [Asthma Action Plan](https://members.allergyasthmanetwork.org/store/ViewProduct.aspx?id=12668973) or treatment plan. Additional things you can do: - Get the COVID-19 vaccine to protect yourself and others. Visit [Vaccine.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/)to find a location near you. - Know how to use your inhaler correctly. - Avoid your asthma triggers. - Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets and sinks daily to protect yourself against COVID-19. - Avoid disinfectants and scented hand sanitizers that may cause an asthma attack. - Take your asthma medication exactly as prescribed. - Talk to your healthcare provider, insurer and/or pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications such as asthma inhalers. There is no need to hoard medications. - Make sure that you have 30 days of nonprescription medications and supplies on hand in case you need to stay home for a long time. Who is at the greatest risk for severe COVID-19 complications? Some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. These groups include: - Older adults, with risk increasing by age. - People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility. - Pregnant women. - People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19: - Chronic kidney disease - COPD - Weakened immune system from solid organ transplant - Obesity (body mass index of 30 or higher) - Heart conditions including coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies - Sickle cell disease - Type 2 diabetes People with the following conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19: - Asthma (moderate to severe) - Pulmonary fibrosis (damaged or scarred lung tissue) - Weakened immune system from immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications and blood or bone marrow transplant - Smoking - Cystic fibrosis - Hypertension or high blood pressure - Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to brain) - Neurologic conditions such as dementia - Liver disease - Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder) - Type 1 diabetes Research is ongoing involving whether asthma is a risk factor for more severe complications from COVID-19. While CDC says it MAY be a risk for more severe COVID-19, other studies suggest it is NOT a risk factor. Several studies indicate people who have nonallergic asthma - symptoms caused by something other than allergies, such as exercise, air pollution, weather conditions or stress - may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 compared to those with allergic asthma. Should I wear a face mask? As of Dec. 4, 2020, CDC recommends \"universal mask use\" when outside of your home. This includes both indoor and outdoor settings outside of your home. The reason is that the United States has entered \"a phase of high-level transmission of COVID-19.\" CDC says consistent use of face masks is critical to stop the virus. The cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials. They are recommended to help slow the spread of the virus and keep people who may have the virus but not know it from transmitting it to others. The recommended cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Medical face masks are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders. There is no evidence that wearing a face mask can worsen your asthma, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. However, some people with moderate or severe asthma may feel it is more difficult to breathe while wearing a face mask. If you don't feel you can wear a mask due to your asthma, it may be best for you to stay home or avoid public places as much as possible. Ask family and friends to run errands for you. If you must go out, avoid large crowds and practice social distancing. Being in public without a face mask may increase your chances of getting COVID-19 or passing it on to others. CDC recommends against using valved masks or vented N95 masks. These types of masks have openings through which air is exhaled. They are designed to filter out particles, but they may be counterproductive, causing the user to release respiratory droplets into the air. CDC says they do not prevent the person wearing the mask from transmitting COVID-19 to others. For the latest information on mask recommendations, please see [Why Face Masks are Critical for People with Asthma During the COVID-19 Pandemic](/news/why-face-masks-are-critical-for-people-with-asthma-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/). How is COVID-19 transmitted? COVID-19 can be spread from person to person. Similar to other colds and viruses, it spreads primarily by close contact with someone who is infected. Research reveals that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Transmission can happen when respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks and the virus is released into the air. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Droplets generally don't travel more than a few feet before they fall to the ground, but there are cases - especially indoors and in places with poor ventilation - where they may travel further or linger in the air. CDC defines \"close contact\" as spending a total of 15 minutes or more within 6 feet of someone who is infectious with COVID-19. The 15 minutes does not have to consecutive; it can occur in a series of brief encounters. It's believed people need to be exposed to a certain level of the virus in order to get infected; the more exposure, the higher the level of the virus and the more likely people are to get COVID-19. The risk of COVID-19 transmission indoors is highly variable - it can depend on the size of the respiratory droplets and the airflow in the room. The risk of transmission outdoors is safer than indoors, but there are cases of transmission in crowded outdoor locations. The [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://coronavirus.gov&sa=D&ust=1589584846484000&usg=AFQjCNH7hF4w1D6DPvejYTdz0E3s7jR4bA) social distancing, in which we stay at least 6 feet apart from other people, and that we wear face masks when around other people. COVID-19 can also be spread by touching a contaminated surface or object. (A cell phone or computer keyboard and mouse, for example, are items that can be contaminated with COVID-19.) The virus can be transmitted if you then touch your mouth, eyes or nose. Is COVID-19 airborne? COVID-19 most commonly spreads through close contact with an infected person, however according to CDC there is evidence that in certain conditions, it may spread via respiratory droplets to people further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected. The virus may also linger in the air after the infected person has left, potentially infecting those still in the space. This is called airborne transmission. CDC updated its COVID-19 guidance on Oct. 5 to reflect this assessment. Transmissions that infect people who are further than 6 feet away have occurred in indoor spaces that have poor ventilation. It could be the infected person was speaking loudly, singing or breathing heavy after exercise. To avoid exposure and minimize the risk of airborne transmission when indoors, CDC recommends staying at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces and to cover your mouth and nose with a face mask when around others. Why is there so much concern about COVID-19? Cases of COVID-19 and instances of community spread are reported in all states. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed to the virus. People in places where there is ongoing community spread of COVID-19 are at higher risk of exposure, with the risk level dependent on your location, [according to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html). This is a health situation that continues to evolve. CDC also notes the following: - Healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure. - Close contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure. - Travelers returning from affected international locations where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure, with increase in risk dependent on location. In addition, certain people are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19, according to CDC: - People 65 years and older - People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility - People of all ages with serious underlying medical conditions Is there a COVID-19 treatment available? There are promising treatments for those who get sick with COVID-19. One is [monoclonal antibody infusion therapy](https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/infusion-therapy-covid-19/). Monoclonal antibodies are given intravenously as infusion therapy before patients need hospitalization. This therapy uses COVID-19 antibodies to help a person's body fight off the infection. Research suggests these antibodies lower the amount of virus \u2014 the \"viral load\" \u2014 in a person's body. This can help prevent hospitalization and death. FDA has granted emergency use authorization to sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment that prevents the COVID-19 virus from entering the body's cells. Sotrovimab is proving effective against many of the COVID-19 variants. There are also treatments available for people who are hospitalized with COVID-19. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir for use in hospitalized adults and children 12 years of age or older who weigh at least 88 pounds. Remdesivir, a broad spectrum anti-viral medication, is only administered in a hospital setting or a healthcare facility able to provide acute patient care. Another COVID-19 treatment is dexamethasone, a type of corticosteroid. It's used in hospitalized patients who are using ventilators to support breathing or require supplemental oxyten. It is recommended by the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel. What is the impact of COVID-19 on people of color? Racial inequities are central to the national conversation about COVID-19. CDC data reveals the rate of Black Americans, Native Americans and Hispanic/Latino communities who are hospitalized or die from COVID-19 is significantly higher than other races. Inequalities in healthcare that existed before the pandemic have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities with majority Black and Hispanic populations face limited access to medical care and treatment. There are often fewer COVID-19 testing sites in these communities as well. Some live in substandard or overcrowded housing and are employed in front-line occupations, putting them at higher risk of COVID-19 exposure. The presence of underlying conditions, including asthma, obesity, heart disease and diabetes, may worsen COVID-19 symptoms. Allergy & Asthma Network is working with partners to provide community-based health screenings and education so we can better address health disparities impacting underserved communities.

Some people continue to experience COVID-19 symptoms after the infection has passed and testing is negative. Sometimes these long-haul symptoms last for months. They often affect daily lives and the ability to work. The National Institutes of Health reports between 10-30% of people infected with COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms. Long-haul symptoms may include: - Coughing - Fatigue - Body aches and joint pain - Shortness of breath - Loss of taste or smell - Sleep problems - Nausea - Inability to concentrate - Confusion - Memory problems - Some long-term issues become serious. Long haulers are reporting kidney problems, onset of diabetes, lung damage including scarring, and clotting issues that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Long-haul symptoms can occur in people who developed severe COVID-19 illness or had no symptoms at all. Learn more in our [COVID-19 Long Haul](https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/covid-long-haul/) post. Types of questions I should ask my doctor during each visit - Ask what your vital signs are (blood pressure, weight, temperature), and if they are in the normal range. - If your doctor orders tests, ask why they are being ordered and how you should prepare for them. - Ask about the benefits and potential side effects of prescribed medicines and how to take and store them. - If your doctor recommends a treatment, ask why and if it is the only treatment option available. - If there are two or more treatment options, ask about the pros and cons of each and which is right for you. - Ask for a visit summary and patient education materials (pamphlets, videos) to learn more about a diagnosis. - Ask when you should schedule a follow-up visit. Make an appointment prior to leaving the doctor's office. Tips for better doctor visits How do I avoid getting COVID-19?
