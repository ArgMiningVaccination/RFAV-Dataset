Outside London, the risk of large measles outbreaks is low but we could see smaller outbreaks in specific populations, including teenagers, young people and under vaccinated communities. Those who have never received a measles vaccine are at risk. MMR is part of the NHS [routine childhood immunisation programme](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/). Parents whose infants missed out, or anyone of any age unvaccinated, are urged to come forward. Susceptibility is particularly high among those aged 19 to 25 years, affected by unfounded stories in the early 2000s ('Wakefield cohorts') and some may still not be fully vaccinated. As part of continued efforts to protect people against getting measles, the NHS is today launching a campaign encouraging people to check their vaccination status, with targeted outreach to groups in London. Data published by UKHSA shows there has been a [steady rise in measles cases this year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-17-2023/hpr-volume-17-issue-7-news-14-july-2023). A new risk assessment also reveals the [potential for a measles resurgence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-risk-assessment-for-resurgence-in-the-uk), particularly in London. Between 1 January and 30 June this year, there have been 128 cases of measles, compared to 54 cases in the whole of 2022, with 66% of the cases detected in London although cases have been seen in all regions. The UKHSA assessment finds the risk of a measles epidemic across the UK is considered low. However, with lower current levels of coverage in London, a measles outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,000 cases could occur in the capital. The assessment also concludes that there is a high risk of cases linked to overseas travel leading to outbreaks in specific population groups such as young people and under-vaccinated communities. The risk in London is primarily due to low vaccination rates over several years, further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in some areas and groups where coverage of the first MMR dose at 2 years of age is as low as 69.5%. Parents should check their children are fully vaccinated with 2 MMR doses, which gives 99% life-long protection, by checking their [red book](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/babys-development/height-weight-and-reviews/baby-reviews/) or with their GP practice, which younger and older adults can also do. Anyone not up-to-date should make an appointment as soon as possible. Achieving high vaccination coverage across the population, 'herd immunity', is important as it indirectly helps protect very young infants (under one year of age) and other vulnerable groups. It's vital all children and adults catch up on any missed vaccinations and this is especially important if travelling overseas this summer. Dr Vanessa Saliba, UKHSA Consultant Epidemiologist said: Measles can be a serious infection that can lead to complications especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems. Due to longstanding sub-optimal vaccine uptake there is now a very real risk of seeing big outbreaks in London. Measles spreads very easily but is preventable. To help protect ourselves, our families and those around us it is vital we all ensure we are vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, free on the NHS whatever your age. Parents can check their children's red book to see if they are up to date or if you're not sure anyone can call their GP practice. It's important everyone is fully vaccinated before travelling overseas this summer. Nobody wants to see their child or loved ones sick with measles, or put others who are more vulnerable, like babies, at risk. I urge those who have missed their MMR vaccines to catch-up now. NHS England has launched a targeted national campaign to encourage uptake of the MMR vaccine, including targeted outreach work in London for those identified as at high risk and communities with the lowest uptake of vaccination. This follows a [polio and MMR catch-up campaign](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/polio-vaccine-catch-up-campaign-for-london-as-sewage-surveillance-findings-suggest-reduced-transmission) already targeting un-or-partially-vaccinated children aged one to 11 years in London, rolled out at the end of March through GP practices, primary schools and community vaccination clinics. All children at primary school who have missed one or both doses of the MMR vaccine are being offered the opportunity to get up to date at school. Parents of those children will be contacted by the NHS school immunisation service. Parents of younger children or those who are home-schooled can make an appointment with their GP practice or visit a community clinic. Jane Clegg, Regional Chief Nurse for the NHS in London has said: Measles can easily spread between unvaccinated people and can be serious, but it is preventable, which is why we continue to encourage Londoners to take up the vaccine - with GPs calling over 10,000 parents of unvaccinated children, and hundreds booking appointments to get vaccinated as a result. Cases of measles in the capital remain low but it's really important that people check that they, and their children, are up to date with their jabs and protected against MMR - and if you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with your GP practice or local pharmacist for advice. Now's the time to act to protect yourself and loved ones from measles. Current MMR vaccine coverage in the NHS routine childhood programme is the lowest it has been in a decade. The World Health Organization (WHO) 95% vaccine coverage target is set to prevent outbreaks among populations. In England coverage of 2 MMR doses at age 5 years is around 85%, with about 10% of children in the country left unprotected from measles by the time they are ready to start school, with the rate in London at about 20%. Childhood immunisation begins recovery after COVID-19 backslide - WHO New WHO and UNICEF data show promising signs of immunisation services rebounding in some countries, but, particularly in low-income countries, coverage still falls short of pre-pandemic levels putting children at grave risk from disease outbreaks. Global immunisation services reached 4 million more children in 2022 compared to the previous year, as countries stepped up efforts to address the historic backsliding in immunisation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data published by WHO and UNICEF, in 2022, 20.5 million children missed out on 1 or more vaccines delivered through routine immunisation services, compared to 24.4 million children in 2021. In spite of this improvement, the number remains higher than the 18.4 million children who missed out in 2019 before pandemic-related disruptions, underscoring the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system strengthening efforts. The vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) is used as the global marker for immunisation coverage. Of the 20.5 million children who missed out on one or more doses of their DTP vaccines in 2022, 14.3 million did not receive a single dose, so-called zero-dose children. The figure represents an improvement from the 18.1 million zero-dose children in 2021 but remains higher than the 12.9 million children in 2019. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General commented: These data are encouraging, and a tribute to those who have worked so hard to restore life-saving immunization services after 2 years of sustained decline in immunization coverage, but global and regional averages don't tell the whole story and mask severe and persistent inequities. When countries and regions lag, children pay the price. The early stages of recovery in global immunisation have not occurred equally, with the improvement concentrated in a few countries. Progress in well-resourced countries with large infant populations, such as India and Indonesia, masks slower recovery or even continued declines in most low-income countries, especially for measles vaccination. Of the 73 countries that recorded [substantial declines](#declines) in coverage during the pandemic, 15 recovered to pre-pandemic levels, 24 are on route to recovery and, most concerningly, 34 have stagnated or continued declining. These concerning trends echo patterns seen in other health metrics. Countries must ensure they are accelerating catch-up, recovery, and strengthening efforts, to reach every child with the vaccines they need and - because routine immunisation is a fundamental pillar of primary healthcare - take the opportunity to make progress in other, related health sectors. Vaccination against measles - one of the most infectious pathogens - has not recovered as well as other vaccines, putting an additional 35.2 million children at risk of measles infection. First dose measles coverage increased to 83% in 2022 from 81% in 2021 but remained lower than the 86% achieved in 2019. As a result, last year, 21.9 million children missed the routine measles vaccination in their first year of life - 2.7 million more than in 2019 - while an additional 13.3 million did not receive their second dose, placing children in under-vaccinated communities at risk of outbreaks. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell warns that: Beneath the positive trend lies a grave warning, until more countries mend the gaps in routine immunization coverage, children everywhere will remain at risk of contracting and dying from diseases we can prevent. Viruses like measles do not recognize borders. Efforts must urgently be strengthened to catch up children who missed their vaccination, while restoring and further improving immunization services from pre-pandemic levels. Many stakeholders are working to expedite recovery in all regions and across all vaccine platforms. Earlier in 2023, WHO and UNICEF, along with Gavi, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other IA2030 partners, launched [The Big Catch-Up](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-immunization-week/2023). The Big Catch-Up is a global communications and advocacy push, calling on governments to catch up the children who missed vaccinations during the pandemic, restore immunisation services to pre-pandemic levels, and strengthen them going forward. The aim is for governments to do this by: - doubling-down on their commitment to increase financing for immunisation and to work with stakeholders to unlock available resources, including COVID-19 funds, to urgently restore disrupted and overstretched services and implement catch-up efforts - developing new policies that enable immunisers to reach children who were born just before or during the pandemic and who are moving past the age when they would be vaccinated by routine immunisation services - strengthening immunisation and primary health care services -including community health systems - and addressing systemic immunisation challenges to correct longer-term stagnation in vaccination and reach the most marginalised children - building and sustaining vaccine confidence and acceptance through engagement with communities and health providers UNICEF: more information UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children.

Notes on the data A substantial decline is considered a decline of 5 percentage points or more in 2020 and/or 2021 compared to 2019. Smaller fluctuations in coverage were not unusual before the pandemic. |2019||2020||2021||2022| |DTP3 coverage||86%||83%||81%||84%| |Number of under coverage||90%||88%||86%||89%| |Number of 'zero-dose' | children (million) |12.9||16.1||18.1||14.3| The data indicates how many children in the target age group for routine immunisation services were reached in 2022. It is not structured to capture catch-up of those who were missed during the pandemic, as many of these children will have 'aged out' of local immunisation services. However, some catch-up may have been recorded as \"routine\" services and reflected in the data. Based on country-reported data, the WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC) provide the world's largest and most comprehensive data-set on immunisation trends for vaccinations against 13 diseases given through regular health systems - normally at clinics, community centres, outreach services, or health worker visits. For 2022, data were provided from 183 countries. WHO and UNICEF are working with [Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance](https://www.gavi.org/) and other partners to deliver the global [Immunization Agenda 2030](https://www.immunizationagenda2030.org/) (IA2030), a strategy for all countries and relevant global partners to achieve set goals on preventing diseases through immunisation and delivering vaccines to everyone, everywhere, at every age.

Every year, more than a million lives are lost globally to viral hepatitis and the UK has signed up to the WHO target of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. While there are 5 main hepatitis viruses (A-E), elimination efforts focus on hepatitis B, C, and D, because, these viruses can cause chronic hepatitis which can last for decades and if left untreated, can cause life-threatening liver disease, including cancer. Further information on [UKHSA's hepatitis reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-c-in-the-uk) is available on GOV.UK. Hepatitis B is vaccine preventable, and the foundation of hepatitis B elimination is ensuring vaccination for babies and infants, because they are at greatest risk of developing chronic infection if infected. The UK has achieved WHO EURO elimination of mother to child transmission of hepatitis B through universal antenatal screening and selective birth dose vaccination programme for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B, both of which have achieved over 99% coverage. Since 2017, hep B vaccination has been part of the universal infant vaccination schedule where recent vaccine coverage is 92%. However, more work needs to be done to improve the implementation and monitoring of targeted vaccination in high risk groups, and to ensure that individuals at higher risk of chronic hepatitis B infection are tested, diagnosed, engaged and retained in a treatment and care pathway. UKHSA estimates there are 206,000 people living with chronic hepatitis B in England, equivalent to a prevalence estimate of 0.45%, most (>95%) of whom are people who were born in a country where hepatitis B is endemic and acquired their infection in infancy. Treatment for both hepatitis B and C has improved dramatically over recent years, but many people remain undiagnosed, often because they have no symptoms or are unaware that they have ever been at risk. Ramping up of case-finding initiatives, such as the NHSE funded emergency department (ED) opt out blood borne virus testing programme currently taking place in ED across London, Manchester, Brighton, Blackpool and Salford, is a welcomed initiate to ensure people access diagnostic testing and treatment. Hepatitis C cases in England have fallen by 45% since 2015, thanks to improved access to antivirals that cure the infection. The latest data published by UKHSA show that there were an estimated 70,649 people living in England with hepatitis C in 2022, with almost 80,000 people treated by NHS E since 2015. While there has been huge progress over recent years in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C with effective and curative treatments, challenges remain. The latest data from UKHSA show that a small but not insignificant number of successfully treated individuals become re-infected. UKHSA is working with partners to prevent, detect and treat the infection. Call for participants - Hepatitis B In primary care research study: GP survey There are more than 300 million individuals globally living with chronic hepatitis B, an infection with severe consequences including cirrhosis and liver cancer and accounting for almost a million deaths a year. [[footnote 1]](#fn:1) This is despite the existence of antiviral treatment and surveillance recommendations which effectively reduce morbidity and mortality. [[footnote 2]](#fn:2) In the UK, marginalised groups including migrant populations, are disproportionately affected by hepatitis B due in part to prevalence in their country of origin. [[footnote 3]](#fn:3) Many will be unaware of their diagnosis or be lost to care following diagnosis, this is compounded by the multiple known barriers this population face in accessing NHS care including primary care. [[footnote 4]](#fn:4) The WHO has called for the elimination of hepatitis B as a public health threat by 2030 (defined as a 90% reduction in new chronic infections and a 65% reduction in mortality, compared with the 2015 baseline). [[footnote 2]](#fn:2) However even with these high-profile international goals harnessing momentum in this field in the UK more work is required if we are to meet these ambitious targets. Despite being ideally placed to support delivery of these elimination targets primary care is poorly utilised in the identification and management of hepatitis B in the migrant population. [[footnote 4]](#fn:4) A survey will specifically explore how primary care are currently contributing towards hepatitis B elimination within at-risk migrant groups, what barriers exist to screening and management of hepatitis B within primary care and views on potential solutions to strengthen the delivery of primary care-based hepatitis B screening and management. Data from this survey will be used to identify effective primary care-based strategies to engage migrant patients, make recommendations to relevant primary care providers and commissioners and contribute towards the hepatitis B elimination goals.

UKHSA does not supply any flu vaccines for patients aged 18 years and over. Please refer to guidance from your respective health departments for arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Vaccines and availability The 2 vaccines available, indicative ordering dates and the groups these vaccines should be ordered for are shown in the table below. At present these timings remain subject to change. The latest and most accurate information on availability of centrally supplied vaccines for the children's flu programme is available on the [ImmForm news page](https://portal.immform.phe.gov.uk/VaccineSupply/VaccineSupply/Home/Vaccine-Supply-Home.aspx) at all times. It is strongly advised that all parties involved in the provision of influenza vaccines to children ensure they remain up to date with this. |Vaccine||Manufacturer||Available to order for||Anticipated order opening for all providers| |Fluenz\u00ae Tetra (LAIV)||AstraZeneca||All children from 2 years of age to school year 11; and Children in clinical risk groups aged 2 to <18 years |[[footnote 6]](#fn:6)children aged 2 to <18 years for whom LAIV is unsuitable Editing Fluenz\u00ae Tetra (LAIV) orders Due to the anticipated large volume of orders for Fluenz\u00ae Tetra in the first few weeks of ordering, orders for this product will be assembled as soon as they are placed and will not be editable. If you need to make an adjustment to your order after it has been placed, you will need to contact [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk) for assistance. LAIV ordering information for General Practice Ordering controls will be in place for general practices, to enable UKHSA to balance supply with demand. These controls work by allocating an amount of LAIV based on the number of registered eligible patients and are tailored to each practice. UKHSA expects to be able to accommodate the following, however at this time, this information remains subject to change: - each GP practice will initially be allocated sufficient LAIV to vaccinate at least 50% of their eligible patients (all children aged 2 and 3 years, plus children in clinical risk groups from age 4 to <18 years) when ordering commences - increases to these allocations may be made in response to demand and vaccine availability - requests for extra vaccine will be considered on a case-by-case basis throughout the ordering period. Requests for additional vaccine should be sent to the helpdesk ( [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk)) and should be sent in good time before your order cut-off; out of schedule deliveries will be by exception only Multi-branch practices and LAIV allocations Please note that GP practices or groups that operate over multiple sites but are part of the same organisation will have a joint allocation (as in previous years), even where each site has a unique ImmForm account. This means that it is possible for one site to potentially order all of the available vaccine for the group, unless there is local agreement on how the allocated volume is shared. UKHSA recommend that this agreement is in place before ordering opens to reduce the risk of supply interruption. The information above allows practices to estimate the amount of vaccine they will be initially allocated, and how it should be split between all sites. LAIV ordering information for school-age providers A default weekly ordering cap of 450 packs (4,500 doses) per week will be in place for school provider accounts. Where this cap is insufficient and a provider needs a larger weekly volume of vaccine to deliver the programme (for example where a provider covers a large area using a single account), a higher weekly cap should be requested via the UKHSA Flu Vaccine Operations team by emailing [childfluvaccine@ukhsa.gov.uk](mailto:childfluvaccine@ukhsa.gov.uk). Requests should be made by Friday 25 August to ensure that accounts are set up correctly before vaccine ordering commences. For one-off larger orders during the ordering period, requests should be made via [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk). Inactivated flu vaccine ordering The Cell Based Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (Surface Antigen, Inactivated) (QIVc) will be available to order, in a single dose pack, for: - children in clinical risk groups aged from six months to less than 2 years old; - children aged from 2 to <18 years old in clinical risk groups for whom LAIV is clinically contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable; and - healthy children from 2 years old to those in school year 11, for whom LAIV is unsuitable (for example, due to objection to LAIV on the grounds of its porcine gelatine content) Order controls will also be in place for this vaccine as follows: - for GPs, there will be an initial cap of 10 doses/packs per week - for school-age providers, there will be a cap of 450 doses/packs per week For one-off larger orders of inactivated vaccines, requests should be made via [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk) in good time before your order cut-off.

Eligible individuals who are known to be immunosuppressed at the time of vaccination and those who are living with HIV, including those on antiretroviral therapy, should continue to be offered a three dose schedule as per the 'HPV' and 'Immunisation of individuals with underlying medical conditions' Green Book chapters. HPV vaccine will continue to be available to order through ImmForm in the usual way. However, please consider the schedule change when placing orders for HPV vaccine, and do not order more than 2 weeks' worth of stock to minimise wastage due holding excess stock, or fridge failures. Registering for a new or updating your existing ImmForm vaccine ordering account When you register for or update an existing ImmForm account, UKHSA as a wholesaler of vaccines needs to verify the requesting customer. Please ensure you have your professional regulatory body registration number or Wholesaler Dealer Licence and an organisation code which can be verified when requesting updates or requesting a new vaccine ordering account. For more information please see the [ImmForm Helpsheet - How to register](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-immform-helpsheet-8?subject). The EU Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) and Delegated Regulation as applicable to UKHSA-supplied vaccines for the national immunisation programme The [EU Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) and Delegated Regulation](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/falsified-medicines_en) impose legal obligations on the EU medicines supply chain to prevent entry of falsified medicinal products into the supply chain. The Delegated Regulation was implemented in all EU member states on 9 February 2019. Following the UK's departure from the EU, the Delegated Regulation ceased to apply in Great Britain from 31 December 2020, but continues to apply in Northern Ireland. Information for customers in Northern Ireland FMD-barcoded packs of routine immunisation programme vaccines that are centrally supplied by UKHSA continue to be supplied with active FMD serialisation, and should be decommissioned by end users in Northern Ireland. Customers in Northern Ireland who access centrally supplied vaccines are encouraged to review local guidance on implementation of the EU Falsified Medicines Directive. MMR vaccine ordering To rebalance central supplies of both MMR vaccines please consider ordering M-M-RvaxPRO\u00ae as your first choice, which is available without restriction. Customers in England and Wales who require Priorix\u00ae, for example because you serve communities that do not accept vaccines containing porcine gelatine, may order up to 20 packs of Priorix\u00ae per ImmForm account per week. For assistance please contact the ImmForm Helpdesk at [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk). Customers in Scotland should refer to their local ordering restrictions. Shingrix\u00ae vaccine ordering information From 1 September 2023, the shingles programme is changing. Please refer to the [UKHSA and NHS bipartite letter](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-vaccination-programme-changes-from-september-2023-letter) for full details. New programme All newly eligible individuals will be offered two doses of the non-live shingles vaccine Shingrix\u00ae instead of one dose of Zostavax\u00ae. In addition to this, the eligibility for the immunocompromised and immunocompetent cohorts will change to allow individuals to be protected at an earlier age. The eligible cohort for immunocompromised individuals will expand to those aged 50 years and over (with no upper age limit). The eligible age for immunocompetent individuals will change from 70 to 60 years of age for the routine cohort, in a phased implementation over a 10 year period. Immunocompetent individuals will remain eligible until their 80th birthday. During stage 1, from 1 September 2023 to 31 August 2028, Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 70 and 65 years on or after 1 September 2023. During stage 2 (1 September 2028 to 31 August 2033), Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 65 and 60 years of age, after which it will be offered routinely at 60. Current programme Those previously eligible for Zostavax\u00ae, i.e. immunocompetent persons age 70 or over prior to 1 Sept 2023, will continue to be offered Zostavax\u00ae until those stocks deplete, after which they will be offered Shingrix\u00ae (until 80th birthday). Ordering via ImmForm Shingrix\u00ae continues to be available via ImmForm for those eligible for shingles vaccination under the current programme, but contraindicated to Zostavax\u00ae. Shingrix\u00ae for the new programme is available to order via ImmForm ahead of the 1st September implementation date. There will not be restrictive ordering controls in place, however please do not create local stockpiles; there is sufficient stock to support year round programme implementation of the programme. Please add Shingrix\u00ae to your routine ImmForm order where possible, rather than creating additional orders. To minimise wastage due to fridge failures, please order no more than 2 weeks' worth of stock. Contact the [helpdesk@immform.org.uk](mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk) for ordering queries.
