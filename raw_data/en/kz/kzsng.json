A screening test is done to find possible disorders or diseases in people who don't have any symptoms. The goal is to find a disease early so lifestyle changes can be made and you can be watched more closely to reduce the risk of disease, or to detect it early enough to treat it most effectively. Screening tests are not considered diagnostic, but are used to determine if more testing is needed. Although you and your healthcare provider may decide that a different schedule is best for you, this plan can guide your discussion. | | Screening | | Who needs it | | How often | | Alcohol misuse | | All adults | | At routine exams | | Blood pressure | | All adults | | Yearly checkup if your blood pressure is normal* Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg* If your blood pressure reading is higher than normal, follow the advice of your healthcare provider | | Depression | | All men in this age group | | At routine exams | | Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes | | All men beginning at age 45 and men without symptoms at any age who are overweight or obese and have 1 or more additional risk factors for diabetes | | At least every 3 years (annually if blood sugar is already rising) | | Type 2 diabetes | | All men with prediabetes | | Every year | | Hepatitis C | | Anyone at increased risk | | At routine exams | | HIV | | All men | | At routine exams | | High cholesterol and triglycerides | | All men ages 35 and older, and younger men at high risk for coronary artery disease | | At least every 5 years | | Obesity | | All adults | | At routine exams | | Prostate cancer | | Starting at age 45, talk to healthcare provider about risks and benefits of digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening*** | | At routine exams | | Colorectal cancer | | Men of average risk ages 45 and older | | Several tests are available and used at different times.
