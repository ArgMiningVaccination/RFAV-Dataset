Immersion in these resonant frequencies can induce a state of deep tranquillity, with the continuous vibrations from instruments like gongs, Tibetan bowls, or singing bowls capable of eliciting a Theta brainwave state, akin to REM sleep.

Sound healing in Hong Kong: Practitioners that create a harmonious oasis for your mind and soul 1. Crystal Van Healing Vanessa, a Sound Healing Practitioner and Meditation Guide from Crystal Van Healing, is a sought-after visiting practitioner at luxury resorts like the Four Seasons Bangkok and Pimalai Resort & Spa. She uniquely blends her crystal healing expertise with sound therapy, using crystal singing bowls made from high-vibration quartz. These bowls emit pure tones intended to harmonise the body's chakras, promoting deep relaxation and alleviating stress. Vanessa's dedication to spiritual healing and energy consciousness emerged from personal loss. This led her to explore alternative healing modalities, ranging from plant medicine and ancient Chinese medicine to reiki and hypnotherapy. From her journey, Vanessa has cultivated a deep understanding of the holistic nature of wellbeing, encompassing mental, emotional, spiritual, and physiological aspects.

Head over to Red Doors Studio, where you'll find Asia's largest gong collection. The sound of a meditation gong can induce a spontaneous meditative and relaxed state, facilitating the flow of chi (positive life force) in the body. On a physical level, the vibrations eliminate tension, stimulate circulation and glands, and regenerate the parasympathetic nervous system. Listeners feel a sense of connectedness and peace as they are lulled from an awake beta state into a lucid theta state, allowing the body to heal and rejuvenate.

Cheryl Rodriguez Cheryl Rodriguez is a leading figure in the realm of sound healing in Hong Kong. As the resident healer at [Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong](https://www.fourseasons.com/hongkong/spa/)'s luxurious spa, she brings a wealth of learning and experience to every session. Cheryl's training encompasses Singing Bowl Therapy and Wellness Integrative Healing with Dr Buathon Thiennarom; Tibetan Sound Healing with the Dynamic Energy Institute; and Gong Training with Martha Collard. Her journey into the world of sound healing began unexpectedly during a trip to London. After participating in a gong meditation following a yoga class, Cheryl felt an immediate connection and began attending regular gong bath meditations to balance the pressures of her corporate life. An unforeseen surgery further deepened her bond with sound therapy as she experienced its profound healing effects during her recovery. This transformation led her to study sound healing more formally and share this powerful modality with others.
