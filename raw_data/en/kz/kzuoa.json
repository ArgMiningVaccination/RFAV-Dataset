In Amerindian tradition, it was primarily a communal spiritual ritual, celebrating or commemorating life transitions such as migrations. Religious dance rituals also expressed prayer, victory, thanks, mythology, and healing. Dance was also essential for celebrations, rites for the success of hunting or harvesting, and even for amusement. It involved the participation of specific individuals or groups of Native American dancers, and absorbed some foreign influences. There are hundreds of Native American dance styles and variations in the American continent. Traditionally, the style of the dancing was influenced by the symbolic or spiritual meaning being expressed. Here are some common dances: The spiritual purpose of [Native American traditional dance](https://study.com/learn/lesson/different-cultural-dances-forms-styles-around-world.html) varied by region. Mortuary rites were most common in the northland and deserts; war and hunt dances predominated amongst hunters in the American Great Plains; animal dances varied according to the wildlife in the area; and agricultural rites were most often seen in the American Southeast and Southwest. Participation was influenced by patterns of social organization. Men and women participated based on whether they danced simultaneously, separately, or some other combination. Women's movements were generally more restricted than men's. In dances with religious connotations, dancers typically remained separate from spectators, but in secular dances anyone could join or leave the dance at will. Spectators and participants were not always defined, as roles sometimes changed during ceremonies. In some dances, women were expected to join in holding their babies. The Eagle Dance was meant to honor the eagle, a sacred animal believed to have supernatural powers; it was meant to inspire divine intervention by honoring messengers to the spirts. It carried prayers to the heavens, and was believed to control weather such as rain. Dances were also performed to seek healing, victory in battles, and other petitions. For centuries, many Amerindian tribes such as the [Hopi](https://study.com/learn/lesson/hopi-native-american-tribe.html) and [Pueblo](https://study.com/learn/lesson/pueblo-people-culture-lifestyle-history.html) honored the eagle and worshipped it the way a \"god\" would be worshipped. The Eagle Dance represents the flying and hunting motion of an eagle and its life cycle from birth to death. The costumes used in the dance had the coloring and feathers of an eagle. Songs and dances were performed; dancers were surrounded by a circle of other dancers who sang and played drums. There was no specific sequence of movements to this dance \u2014 it was performed differently by various tribes. In modern times, the dance is mainly performed as a commemoration and to preserve the heritage of the tribe. The Grass Dance is mostly related to the largely nomadic lifestyle of Amerindian societies in the Great Plains. It originated with the Omaha-Ponca and the Dakota Sioux. It is one of the oldest tribal dances. The purpose was to physically and spiritually prepare a new site for habitation. It secured bonds amongst the community and honored ancestral traditions. The grass was intentionally flattened in preparation for the ceremony. According to one legend, this dance was inspired by a handicapped boy with a desire to dance. He followed the guidance of a traditional healer to seek inspiration on the prairie. There, he saw a vision of himself dancing in a swaying motion, like grass. He shared his vision with his kin; he was healed, able to dance, and became the first to perform the grass dance. The traditional costumes used for this dance feature headdresses, fringes and ribbons designed to emphasize the motion of the grass. The name of the dance comes from braids of sweetgrass tied to the dancer's belt, which swayed. This is a dance full of fluid bending motions, with multicolored swaying yarn blowing in the wind, representing grass. Modern versions are inter-tribal, and both dancers and observers are bestowed with special blessings. According to Plains Indian folklore, the Hoop dance began when the Creator gave a dying man from the Northern Plains hoops to be remembered by. The dance most was most likely originally used for healing, dating back several centuries; it was used to heal and restore balance and harmony in the eternal circle of life. The dancer begins with a single hoop symbolizing the circle of life, then more hoops are added representing different aspects of life, including humans, wind, water, the seasons, and animals. The original intent of using animals was to teach others about the ways of the animals, and it became a widely popular story-telling dance. The animals include butterflies, turtles, eagles, and snakes. For this dance, one to forty hoops made of wood and reeds are used, and they represent symbolic, dynamic shapes and movements of various creatures and aspects of life. In the modern version of this dance, a solo dancer performs it. The movements in the dance are wide and rapid; hoops interlock and extend symbolizing wings and tails. Foreign influences have made the dance a competitive event performed by various tribes in New Mexico and Arizona. The Paiute prophet, Wovoka, inspired this dance in the 1880s when Native Americans were resisting harsh conditions on reservations, and resisted pressure to assimilate into white American culture. It was a way to try and restore cosmological balance as Amerindian communities faced massive pressures to assimilate.

This dance was created by the Ponca tribe in the 1920s and 1930s to preserve their culture and traditions. It emerged during a time when native culture was outlawed by the U.S. and Canadian governments, which is likely why it was influenced by the War Dance. The War Dance was traditionally practiced in various forms by many tribes as a religious rite the evening before an attack, to ensure success. It motivated warriors, preparing them for battle. It involved singing, praying, and rituals that involved incense, face-painting, masks representing various gods, sacred objects, and dancing. The Fancy Dance is a high-energy, fast-paced dance, which two Ponca boys developed. The Ponca Tribe further adopted it, and the dance became widely popular amongst diverse audiences. Other tribes followed suit, incorporating their styles into the Fancy Dance. Dance contests attracting crowds were held at inter-tribal Pow-Wows. The dance is high energy and colorful, with rapid athletic movements, including tricks. Costumes feature brightly colored feathers, headdresses, beads, leggings, shawls, and moccasins. Clothing is bright with embroidery and variegated designs. Colorful jewelry from earrings to eagle plumes are worn.

This dance is widely performed by [Eastern Woodland tribes](https://study.com/academy/lesson/eastern-woodlands-tribes-culture.html) such as the Cherokee, Choctaw, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Seminole. It is known as Opvnkv Haco or \"drunken\" or \"crazy\" by the Amerindians, referring to the effects of medicine on the dancers. The term ''stomp'' comes from the movements, which are shuffling and stomping. It is performed at nighttime during the summer months for health and well-being. Many people may participate in this dance, which may be performed over thirty times, and the accompanying song is sung by various leaders. The Amerindians of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain areas perform the Sun Dance every year at the summer solstice. The eagle is the main symbol of the dance, expressing harmony of body and spirit; the buffalo is also an important symbol of food, clothing, and shelter. Traditionally, preparations for the dance began a year in advance, and various tribes performed it according to their tradition. The ceremony entailed dances and songs, and traditional drums and pipes were used for music. Offerings were made, and there was fasting, as well as ritual piercing of skin, as a form of sacrifice for the family and community. The Sun Dance was perceived as a threat by the U.S. Government in the 1800s, and they attempted to suppress it. The dance survived for a while in the form of the Ghost Dance. When the 1934 Indian Religious Freedom and Indian Culture circular was issued, the Sun Dance re-surfaced and has continued to be held periodically. Native American dance has profound religious symbolism. It was a communal spiritual ritual expressed in diverse dance styles. Specific individuals, such as prophets or healers, as well as various social groups such as warriors, participated as Native American dancers. There were also some foreign influences.
