Health care providers can treat medical problems and sometimes cure them. But how is a \"treatment\" different from a \"cure\"? A treatment is something that health care providers do for their patients to control a health problem, lessen its symptoms, or clear it up. Treatments can include medicine, therapy, surgery, or other approaches. A cure is when a treatment makes a health problem go away and it's not expected to come back. Some health problems have a cure. For example, to treat [athlete's foot](/en/teens/athletes-foot.html), health care providers use special creams, powders, or sprays that kill the fungus that causes the infection. Other health problems have no cure \u2014 this means a person will always have it. When there's no cure, sometimes a treatment can help to manage the problem. For example, [type 1 diabetes](/en/teens/type1.html) is a lifelong condition. Health care providers [treat it](/en/teens/treating-type1.html) by prescribing insulin. This treatment helps keep a person's blood sugar levels in a healthy range, but it won't cure the disease. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day for life. Scientists are constantly making new medical discoveries. It's possible that a health problem without a cure today will have a cure in the future. "}
