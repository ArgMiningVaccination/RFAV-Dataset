Background Clinical Practice Guidelines DRUGDEX Strength of Recommendation [6] Class Recommendation Description Class I Recommended The given test or treatment has been proven useful, and should be performed or administered. Class IIa Recommended, In Most Cases The given test or treatment is generally considered to be useful, and is indicated in most cases. Class IIb Recommended, in Some Cases The given test or treatment may be useful, and is indicated in some, but not most, cases. Class III Not Recommended The given test or treatment is not useful, and should be avoided Class Indeterminate Evidence Inconclusive NCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus [A] Category Level of Consensus UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Arizona - Clinical Pharmacy Guidelines Page 369 1 Based upon high -level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. 2A Based upon lower -level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. 2B Based upon lower -level evidence, there is NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. 3 Based upon any level of evidence, there is major NCCN disagreement that the intervention is appropriate. Lexi-Drugs: Strength of Recommendation for Inclusion in Lexi -Drugs for Oncology Off - Label Use and Level of Evidence Scale for Oncology Off -Label Use [5] Strength of Recommendation for Inclusion Strong (for proposed off-label use) The evidence persuasively supports the off-label use (ie, Level of Evidence A). Equivocal (for proposed off -label use) The evidence to support the off-label use is of uncertain clinical significance (ie, Level of Evidence B, C). Additional studies may be necessary to further define the role of this medication for the off - label use. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Arizona - Clinical Pharmacy Guidelines Page 370 Against proposed off - label use The evidence either advocates against the off-label use or suggests a lack of support for the off -label use (independent of Level of Evidence). Additional studies are necessary to define the role of this medication for the off - label use. Level of Evid ence Scale for Oncology Off -Label Use A Consistent evidence from well -performed randomized, controlled trials or overwhelming evidence of some other form (eg, results of the introduction of penicillin treatment) to support off -label use. Further resear ch is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of benefit. B Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (eg, inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect, imprecise); or very strong evidence of some other research design. Further research (if performed) is likely to have an impact on confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk and may change the estimate. C Evidence from observational studies (eg, retrospective case series/reports providing significant impact on patient care); unsystematic clinical experience; or potentially flawed randomized, controlled trials (eg, when limited options exist for condition). Any estimate of effect is uncertain. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Arizona - Clinical Pharmacy Guidelines Page 371 G Use has been substantiated by inclusion in at least one evidence - based or consensus -based clinical practice guideline. 3 . Endnotes A. NCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus. Category 1: The recommendation is based on high -level evidence (i.e., high -powered randomized clinical trials or meta - analyses), and the NCCN Guideline Panel has reached uniform consensus that the recommendation i s indicated. In this context, uniform means near unanimous positive support with some possible neutral positions. Category 2A: The recommendation is based on lower level evidence, but despite the absence of higher level studies, there is uniform consensus that the recommendation is appropriate. Lower level evidence is interpreted broadly, and runs the gamut from phase II to large cohort studies to case series to individual practitioner experience. Importantly, in many instances, the retrospective studies ar e derived from clinical experience of treating large numbers of patients at a member institution, so NCCN Guideline Panel Members have first -hand knowledge of the data. Inevitably, some recommendations must address clinical situations for which limited or no data exist. In these instances the congruence of experience -based judgments provides an informed if not confirmed direction for optimizing patient care. These recommendations carry the implicit recognition that they may be superseded as higher level evi dence becomes available or as outcomes -based information becomes more prevalent. Category 2B: The recommendation is based on lower level evidence, and there is nonuniform consensus that the recommendation should be made. In these instances, because the evi dence is not conclusive, institutions take different approaches to the management of a particular clinical scenario. This nonuniform consensus does not represent a major disagreement, rather it recognizes that given imperfect information, institutions may adopt different approaches. A Category 2B designation should signal to the user that more than one approach can be inferred from the existing data. Category 3: Including the recommendation has engendered a major disagreement among the NCCN Guideline Panel Members. The level of evidence is not pertinent in this category, because experts can disagree about the significance of high level trials. Several circumstances can cause major disagreements. For example, if substantial data exist about two interventions but they have never been directly compared in a randomized trial, adherents to one set of data may not accept the interpretation of the other side's results. Another situation resulting in a Category 3 designation is when experts disagree about how trial d ata can be generalized. An example of this is the recommendation for internal mammary node radiation in postmastectomy radiation therapy. One side believed that because the randomized studies included this modality, it must be included in the recommendatio n. The other side believed, based on the documented additional morbidity and the role of internal mammary radiation therapy in other studies, that this was not necessary. A Category 3 UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Arizona - Clinical Pharmacy Guidelines Page 372 designation alerts users to a major interpretation issue in the data and directs them to the manuscript for an explanation of the controversy. [3] B. Abstracts (including meeting abstracts) are excluded from consideration. When evaluating peer -reviewed medical literature, the following (among other things) should be considered: 1) Whether the clinical characteristics of the beneficiary and the cancer are adequately represented in the published evidence 2) Whether the administered chemotherapy regimen is adequately represented in the published evidence. 3) Whether the reported stu dy outcomes represent clinically meaningful outcomes experienced by patients. 4) Whether the study is appropriate to address the clinical question. The following should be considered: a) Whether the experimental design, in light of the drugs and conditions under investigation, is appropriate to address the investigative question. (For example, in some clinical studies, it may be unnecessary or not feasible to use randomization, double blind trials, placebos, or crossover.); b) That non -randomized clinical t rials with a significant number of subjects may be a basis for supportive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs; and c) That case reports are generally considered uncontrolled and anecdotal information and do not provide adequate support ive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs.

Background Benefit/Coverage/Program Information Additional Information In most of North America, peak RSV activity typically occurs between November and March, usually beginning in November or December, peaking in January or February, and ending by the end of March or sometime in April. Communities in the southern United Stat es, particularly some communities in the state of Florida, tend to experience the earliest onset of RSV. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified variations in the onset and offset of the RSV \"season\" in the state of F lorida that could affect the timing of Synagis administration. 10 Despite varied onsets, the RSV \"season\" is of the same duration (5 months) in the different regions of Florida. On the basis of the epidemiology of RSV in Alaska, particularly in remote reg ions where the burden of RSV disease is significantly greater than the general US population, the selection of Alaska Native infants eligible for prophylaxis may differ from the remainder of the United States. Clinicians may wish to use RSV surveillance data generated by the state of Alaska to assist in determining onset and end of the RSV season for qualifying infants. Limited information is available concerning the burden of RSV disease among Native American populations. However, special consideration may be prudent for Navajo and White Mountain Apache infants in the first year of life. For analysis of National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) reports in the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, season onse t is defined as the first of 2 consecutive weeks during which the mean percentage of specimens testing positive for RSV antigen is 10% and RSV \"season\" offset is defined as the last of 2 consecutive weeks during which the mean percentage of positive spec imens is 10%. Use of specimens UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Arizona - Clinical Pharmacy Guidelines Page 1350 to determine the start of the RSV \"season\" requires that the number of specimens tested be statistically significant. 3 .
