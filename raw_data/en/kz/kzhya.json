This document was last updated on December 18, 2020. WHY is the COVID-19 vaccination so important? We have the opportunity to diminish a virus that has taken millions of lives. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of contracting the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system to prepare it to kill the virus if you are exposed. Getting vaccinated not only protects yourself it also helps protect the people around you; particularly the elderly and those at greater risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Is the vaccine safe? The vaccine is safe. Its safety has been a top priority, and has been proven through validated research, which has been reviewed and approved by the Center for Disease Control, The Food and Drug Administration, and the Indiana Department of Health. More information about its safety can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/ vaccine-benefits.html https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/vaccine/index.htm What do the experts say? Recently, an Advisory Panel for the FDA reviewed studies related to the Moderna vaccine, and every one of the panel's members that voted (one abstained) recommended the FDA issue an emergency use authorization, approving the vaccine for immediate use for persons over the age of 18. The FDA has approved the vaccine, which is now being produced in large quantities, and readied for distribution. Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? No way. The vaccine introduces a kind of code which your immune system can use to help recognize and quickly fight off the virus in the future. It is not live and cannot cause the disease. Does the vaccine have any side effects? Likely, the IDOC will be administering the vaccine offered by Moderna, proven to be very effective against COVID-19. Though most experience zero side effects with the vaccine, after being vaccinated, a small percentage of people do experience some, relatively minor, side effects. This is a normal sign that your body is building its protective PROVIDED BY THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION Page 1 of 2COVID-19 VACCINES FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS capabilities. Reported side effects include soreness at the injection site, headache (in about 2% of cases) , fatigue (in about 4% of cases) , and in some cases flu-like symptoms, but these usually go away within a few days. A very small number of participants did show signs of more moderate or severe symptoms similar to an allergic reaction or palsy; however, these were found among both people that took the vaccine and people that did not take the vaccine (but took a placebo.) The question as to whether these side effects were caused by the vaccine or not is still being studied. Is the vaccine safe for women who are pregnant? The CDC has recommended that pregnant women, or women planning to get pregnant may be offered the vaccine, so long as they are in one of the priority groups, and have consulted with their health care provider. How are side effects being tracked? The CDC runs the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), a national system to detect any possible symptoms or side effects that occur after someone has gotten a vaccine. Anyone who has had the vaccine can report concerns to VAERS. When you get your vaccine, you will get a link to the \"V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker\" application for your phone. Through V-safe, you can quickly tell the CDC if you have any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. V-safe will also remind you to get the second vaccine does when needed. Incarcerated or detained persons that experience any side effects should advise facility health care staff. Can people with a history of allergic reactions get the vaccine? Most people who have food or environmental allergies can still get the vaccine. Talk to your health care provider if you have had any severe reactions to medications or vaccines in the past. Can I get other vaccines at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine? CDC recommends that no other vaccine be given 14 days before or after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Is the vaccine effective? For each type of vaccine, studies conducted with over 30,000 adults from various age groups and diverse backgrounds show the vaccine is overall 94.5% effective at immunizing against the COVID-19 virus. It is 100% effective at preventing severe illness due to COVID-19. Participant Diversity Approximately 42% of overall and 30% of U.S. study participants have diverse backgrounds. PARTICIPANTS OVERALL STUDY U.S. ONLY Asian 4.5% 5.5% to 85 40.9% 45.4% What should I expect when I get vaccinated? Is there a cost to the vaccine? No fees will be charged to get vaccinated. The cost of the vaccine is covered by the federal government. Some providers may charge a nominal fee for administering the vaccine, but these costs should be reimbursed through your insurance provider, or for those not covered by insurance, by the Health Researches and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund. Incarcerated or detained persons who get vaccinated will not be charged a co-pay. Will more than one dose of COVID-19 vaccine be required? Yes. The current vaccines require two shots to be effective. It is very important that you get both doses within the required timeframe to insure the best protection from COVID-19. Staff will be apprised of the locations and timeframes in which they can get the vaccine. The timing of the second shot depends on which vaccine is administered. For the Pfizer vaccine, the second shot should be received no sooner than 21 days after the first. The IDOC will be utilizing the Moderna vaccine for incarcerated persons. For this vaccine it is recommended that the second dose be administered no sooner than 28 days following the first dose. IDOC medical staff, and health care vendor Wexford will track the administering of the vaccines and will schedule the follow up shots. To ensure the best protection from COVID-19 it is very important that you not skip the second dose, and that it is from the same manufacturer as the first dose. For that reason, IDOC will be using only the Moderna vaccine for incarcerated persons. Should people who have contracted COVID-19 get vaccinated? Yes. People who have had COVID-19 can and should get the vaccine. CDC recommends getting it after you have fully recovered. You should check with your health care provider if you have questions. There is not enough information currently available to tell if, or for how long, a person's natural immunity from having contracted COVID-19 lasts. Early evidence suggests that naturally developed immunity may not last very long, but more study is needed to better understand this. So, yes, you should still get the vaccine even if you have already had COVID-19.Do I need to continue wearing a mask after I get the vaccine? Yes. Until the health crisis has subsided, all Hoosiers should continue to wear masks, social distance, wash hands, and observe the other precautionary protocols even after taking the vaccine. How will the vaccine be distributed and prioritized? When will the vaccine be available? Distribution timetables for the vaccine are still being worked out. A strategic approach is being used so that the first manufactured vaccines are currently being given to health care workers and Indiana first responders. As more vaccine is made, it will be given to those in long-term care and assisted living environments, and more vulnerable people at high risk of contracting and suffering severe illness or death due to COVID-19. Subsequent prioritization will include staff who work inside correctional facilities and the people who reside within them. The timing of this is still being worked out and depends largely on the production and distribution timetable from the manufacturer. Based upon the information available to date, this will likely take place during the first months of 2021. Is IDOC prepared to handle distribution, storage, and administration of the vaccine? The IDOC has been planning for the vaccine. Because the vaccine must be stored at subfreezing temperatures, the IDOC recently purchased special storage containers for each facility and has begun manufacturing dry ice to preserve the vaccine once it is received. IDOC has also developed plans for picking up the vaccine from the designated source and distributing the required doses to each facility. Protocols are in place to ensure the safety and security of the vaccine from the time it is received through the time it is administered. Staff will be given information on where they can get the vaccine, and what ID and documentation to bring with them in order to participate in early administration of the vaccine. Will my privacy be protected? What information will be collected about me when I receive the vaccine? When vaccines are administered, your name, address, and type of vaccine given will be reported to the Indiana State Department of Health. What information will be shared? ISDH will share information about Indiana's entire vaccination process with the CDC but in an aggregate form that does not identify the recipients (i.e., does not contain individual identifying information such as name, date of birth or address.) Where can I get more information?
