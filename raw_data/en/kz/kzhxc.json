INTRODUCTION Complaint Counsel hereby moves to exclude the expert report and testimony of James Duke, Ph.D. (\"Duke\") from the tral scheduled for this case regarding the alleged deceptive advertising engaged in by Respondent Daniel Chapter One (\"DCa\") and its principal, Respondent James Feijo (\"Respondents\") in their sale of Bio*Shark, 7 Herb Formula, GDD, and BioMixx (\"DCa Products), which they claim prevent, treat, or cure cancer and tumors because this testimony fails to meet the criteria for admssibilty of expert testimony established in Daubert. Respondents have tendered Duke as an expert witness to \"review and offer opinion (sic) supported by evidence and experience on the ingredients of the challenged products; to review the science of herbal efficacy; to clarfy the complex nature of herbal science versus the relatively simple science of pharaceuticals\" Expert Witness James A. Duke, dated(Report of \" ' Februar 4,2009, p.1) (\"Duke Rpt\"), attached as Exhibit A. Duke is an \"economic botanist\" who has catalogued numerous herbs that allegedly show promise in \"fighting disease\" (Deposition Transcript of James A. Duke, dated Februar (\" Duke Menus\" (\"MAs\"), provides a \"listing of the chemicals in an herb that have been shown or assumed to help with cancer\" (Duke Tr. 92: 1.5-11). Each entry on the MAs also has a notation for the source of the information that an herb helps with cancer. The sources that Duke notes may be \"folklore\" ,\"animal\" or \"in vitro evidence\", among other sources (Duke Tr. 59: 1. 7-21). Duke has also written books on medicinal plants and herbs that are found in the Bible, e.g. \"Medicinal Plants of the Bible,\" (1983) (Duke Rpt. p.1). In Duke's opinion there is a \"reasonable basis\" for Respondents' claims: 1. (T)hat the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula fight tumor formation, and fight pathogenic bacteria. 2. T)hat the ingredients of GDD contains (sic) natural proteolytic enzymes (from the pineapple source bromelain) to help digest protein - even that of unwanted tumors and cysts...helps (sic) to relieve pain and heal inflamation. . GDD is also used for ... and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDD possesses a wide range of actions including anti\u00ad inflamatory and antispasmodic activity...\" 3. (T)hat the ingredients of BioMixx \"boosts (sic) the immune system... to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatment. (Duke Rpt. p.3). Duke does not give an opinion on Bio*Shark because it is an animal based product and he does not deal with animal products. (Duke Tr. 63: 1.19-25). Moreover, Duke is \"not convinced of the efficacy of shark carilage in the studies\" that he has read (Duke Tr. lComplaint Counsel refers the Court to the two copies of the deposition transcript of \u00ad proposed expert James Duke which was previously fied with the Court 1) as an exhibit to the Motion for Summar Decision and 2) as a proposed trial exhibit. In consideration of not burdening the Court with additional copies and in order to preserve natural resources, Complaint Counsel has not attached the pages referenced in this memorandum. 2 64: 1. 13-15). As set forth below, the Court should exclude Duke's report and testimony from the trial in this action because he lacks the knowledge, skill, experience, training or education required to testify as an expert on Respondents' claims that their products prevent, treat or cure cancer or tumors. Further, Duke's opinions are irrelevant to the issues ofthis case and/or are unreliable as they are not grounded in sufficient facts and data. As a result, the Court should exclude his report and testimony. II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR ADMISSIBILITY OF EXPERT TESTIMONY Commssion Rule of Practice 3.43(b) requires that evidence must be relevant, material and reliable in order to be admtted. Rule of Practice 3.43(b). With respect to expert witness testimony, a witness \"qualified as an expert, by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education\" Fed. Rule of Evid. 702, may testify if: \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" fd.; see also, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Phannaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1993) and Kumho Tire Co. Ltd. v. Cannichael, 526 u.s. 137,153-54 (1996). Respondents, as the proponents of the expert testimony have the burden of proving its admissibilty. Grat v. Baja Marine Corp., et al., 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 1986 at *21 (11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2009), citing U.S. v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2004). Moreover, this Court has the authority to exclude expert testimony of any nature, whether it is based on \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge,\" if it lacks appropriate indicia of helpfulness to the fact finder. Kumho Tire, 526 u.s. at 141. In exercising 3 what has been characterized as \"general 'gatekeeping' authority,\" id., the court may reject expert testimony that wil not \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determne a fact in issue.\" Daubert, 509 u.s. at 591. Indeed, the law is well-established that \"(e)xpert testimony that does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpfu1.\"fd. Respondents cannot meet their burden under the Commssion's Rules of Practice, FR 702 and the principles set forth in Daubert of demonstrating that Duke's expert report and testimony are admssible. Consequently, the Court should exclude his report and testimony from any trial in this case. III. DUK'S TESTIMONY IN THIS MATTER SHOULD BE EXCLUDED A. Duke is not Oualified to Testifv as an Expert in this Case. Duke does not have the knowledge, skill, experience, training or education to testify about the serious claims that Respondents make that the DCa Products prevent, treat or cure cancer or tumors. Duke has never been qualified as an expert witness before (Duke Tr. 26: 1.18\u00ad 21). Duke is neither a medical doctor nor board certified oncologist (Duke Tr. 56: 1.3-10). He has never consulted with any holistic practitioner or with any homeopath on herbal cancer treatments for a patient. (Duke Tr. 19: 1. 10- 1 7). Thus, he lacks experience in treating cancer in any respect. Further, Duke has never managed or paricipated in any studies to measure the effcacy of an herb that he asserts can be used to treat cancer (Duke Tr. 29: 1.15-22). Neither has Duke ever consulted on any study done to measure an herb's anti-cancer effects (Duke Tr. 29: 1.23 \u00ad 30: 1.2), or ever measured the efficacy of herbs as a treatment for cancer ina controlled patient population (Duke Tr. 55: 1.21-24). Thus Duke has no practical scientific experience with these herbs' use as a cancer treatement which might make him qualified to serve as an expert in this 4 case. Respondents seem to have tendered Duke as an expert merely because he has produced a catalog of herbs and plants. However, this is not sufficient to qualify him to render an opinion on whether there is competent and reliable evidence to support Respondents' cancer claims. Duke then is not qualified to testify about the cancer claims at issue in this case and his testimony Acres of Land, 970 F.2d 651,657 (9th Cir., should be excluded. See e.g, U.S. v. 99.66 1992)(expert testimony concerning residential appraisals properly excluded where witness had no appraisal experience and \"personal unfamliarty\" with underlying data). B. Duke's Testimony Should be Excluded as Irrelevant. Duke's testimony is irrelevant to this action for several reasons. First, his testimony relates merely to the cataloging of information about the components of just three of the DCa Products and \"the science of herbal efficacy... and ... to clarfy the complex nature of herbal science versus the relatively simple science of pharaceuticals\" (Duke Rpt. p. 1). He provides no credible understanding of how these herbs might be tested or how they might assist in treating cancer patients. Moreover, Duke's views about whether herbs are more beneficial to use than pharaceuticals (Duke Rpt. p. 6), which is a substantial par of his report, are irrelevant. Despite Respondents' efforts to confuse the issue, this case is not about evaluating the \"science of herbal efficacy\" or comparng \"herbal science\" to \"pharaceuticals\" (Duke Rpt. p. 1). Instead, this case is about Respondents' claims that the DCa products prevent, treat, or cure . canc~r or tumors andwhetherR~spondents had competent and reliable scientific eviclence Jo support those serious health claims. Nothing in Duke's testimony wil assist the Court in resolving this question. Expert testimony is irrelevant and, therefore, may be excluded if it lacks 5 appropriate indicia of helpfulness to the fact finder. Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 141 (1999). Accordingly, Duke's testimony should be excluded. c. Duke's Opinion Lacks Suffcient Facts and Data and Should be Excluded as Unreliable. Finally, the Court should exclude Duke's opinions because they are not based on sufficient facts and data to make them reliable under FR 702 and the Daubert principles. At deposition, Duke testified that he had never heard of DCa before he was involved in this case and did not know what the DCa Products were (Duke Tr. 39: 1.9-10). Duke even erroneously believed that DCa was using herbs that were \"Biblical\" and only after a few days of working on the case, did he lear this was not the case (Duke Tr. 138: 1.4-10). Duke has never even seen the advertising challenged by the complaint (Duke Tr. 36: 1.23 - 37: 1.2), and never received the products themselves so that he might have reviewed the labels and investigate the quantities of the herbs within the products (Duke Tr. 37: 1.3-5). This information would have been important to help him evaluate whether the herbs were present in a sufficient quantity to possibly be effective. Duke never reviewed the medical records of any patient who claims to have taken the DCa Products to treat or cure their cancer (Duke Tr. 39: 1.1-4). Thus, he had no facts or data about the products on which to base his opinions that the claims Respondents made about the DCa Products are substantiated. Further, Duke did not know of any studies of any kind penormed on the DCa Products to determne their effectiveness (Duke Tr. 109: 1.22-25 - 191: 1.1-4). He did not evaluate whether the combination of the ingredients in each of the DCa Products has any \"synergistic -.. \u00ad effect,\"(Duke Tr. 190: 1.0-21) which would be significant and necessar information for evaluating the efficacy of the DCa Products. Duke himself did no studies to determne the effectiveness of the products. Duke reviewed the literature and information regarding the DCa 6 Products and found no evidence that those products or their ingredients had been shown in clinical trials to be effective in the treatment of cancer (Duke Tr. 148: of essential information about the DCa products, Duke stil concluded that there was a \"reasonable basis\" for Respondents to make their claims about the three products, 7 Herb Formula, GDU and BioMixx. That conclusion represents pure speculation and therefore should be excluded as unreliable. iv. CONCLUSION Because Duke is not qualified to testify in this case and his opinions are irrelevant and unreliable, Complaint Counsel respectfully requests that the Court enter the proposed order annexed hereto, excluding Duke from testifying at triaL.

There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula \" . . ., fights tumor formation, and fights pathogenic bacteria.\" 2. There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients ofODU \"contains natural proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source bromelain) to help digest protein-\u00ad unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also helps to relieve pain and heal inflammation. . ODU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. ODU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic even that of activity. . .\" 3. There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of BioMixx \"boosts the immune system, ... to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" V. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS I base my conclusions, from my experience and knowledge, on three analytical points: First, herbal based and nutritional food information can be drawn from the Bible. Second, herbs, including those from the Bible provide help to the health of people that can be as good as or superior to help provided by pharmaceuticals. Third, significant science, as set out below, supports herbal use, and a system- which I call a third arm to a standard pharmaceutical study-could establish the value of herbs to the scientific gold standard urged by conventional science.. Without an approach like the third ar approach, it wil never be possible to find suffcient resources to run classical pharmaceutical studies on whole herbs, let alone to evaluate the hundreds of single chemical entities in each herb. 3 In the meantime the public should not be denied access to the information available that certain herbs have credible evidence that they contribute to healing, even resources for massive studies we have to rely on the less expensive science set out below. for conditions such as cancer. In the absence of 1. The Science of Herbs: I begin with the third point first. Here are three ways I use to establish the efficacy of an herb: one is the Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM's), the second is Indications Evaluations (IE's), and the third is 60 abstracts in PubMed. I am only presenting ways one and two here. A. The MAM is a listing, recognized worldwide, which I have created and maintained for over 20 years on the United States Department of Agrculture (USDA) website. Information is put into the website about the relationship between an herb and a condition.-in this case cancer. Then the information is drawn out for a review of the curent scientific status of the herb in question. The following are Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM's) for 16 DCO herbs and their relation to cancer as recorded in the USDA website. . These can be done online at my USDA website. DANIEL CHAPTER ONE HERBS MAM's: MAM: Actaea Claw) for Cancer (79/31 =2.55) The number on the right hand side of the \"/\" is the number of cancer affecting aspects of the herb being evaluated. the MAM's for DCO herbs, such as See Appendix II for detailed presentation of the following one for Turmeric, presented as an example. (Turmeric, one of the 16 DCO herbs, would certainly be in my meals were I subject to cancer, and I am genetically targeted for colon cancer. Turmeric's curcumin is probably better than Celebrex, which like other synthetic COX-2-I's was once touted off-label for the prevention of colon cancer. There are 66 indications of Turmeric affecting cancer in this MAM. Some are bolded.) Curcuma longa (Turmeric) the top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my satisfaction) (One Evaluations (IE's) Summary: Review ofIndications of 16 DCO herb indications to pharmaceutical Herbs. (See Appendix III for comparison of indications) Actaea (Cimicifuga) racemosa (Black Cohosh). Widely sold and respected for menopausal difficulties. * Allum satiVU (Garlic): My most important herbal medicine, useful at preventing all the major kilers and sepses. Ananas comosus China as an anticancer immunomodulator. Camellia sinensis (Green Tea): Food farmacy item widely and scientifically promoted for many indications. the top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my satisfaction. Eleutherococcus senticosus (Eleuthero) Sold widely as an alternative to ginseng, adaptogenic tonic. Glycine max (Soybean): Studied by the late Judah Folkman and widely sold as a food farmacy item, in par for its mix of antiangiogenic crucifers (members of the Brassicaceae), this nutritious edible species is properly touted as a cancer preventive. Rheum palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb); Sold as laxative and in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Rumex acetosella (Sheep sorrel) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Smilax aristolochiifolia (Sarsaparila) Widely sold, e.g., for Lyme Disease; contains compounds which can be converted to hormones. Tanacetum parthenium (Feverfew) I think itsabout as good for migraine pharmaceutical sumatriptan. Ulmus rubra (Slippery Elm) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Uncaria tomentosa (Cat's Claw) Famed immUlomodulator from Latin America; proofs possibly more promotional than scientific. 8 Half of the new pharaceuticals wil be relabeled (with stronger warnings) or parially or completely recalled within a decade. Meanwhile, more expensive pharmaceuticals will continue to cause many more deaths than are caused by the safe herbs we are led to believe are dangerous. They are not! Check the Bextra, Celebrex, and Vioxx, and, let me predict, soon-to-be-heard statin, stories (three close friends of mine, too old to be worried about cholesterol, have been hospitalized from statins) and head counts of iatrogenic fatalities. The Null Numbers: The total number of annual iatrogenic deaths in America is 783,936. (Null et aI, 2003). Remember, pharmaceuticals have been with us less than 150 years. If our ancestors left Africa via the Holy Land 2000 years ago (for faith-based literalists), or maybe a million years ago (for the less literal), then our genes, tracing back to our AfricanHoly Land ancestors, have had at least 10 times more temporal experience with Biblical herbs (e.g., cinnamon, coriander, garlic, grape, mint, milk thistle, myrrh, olive, onion, saffon, turmeric, and the like). Pharmaceuticals and synthetic food additives are years of evolutionar experience with the thousands of phytochemicals in these species. Our bodies may even require many of them. In many cases, by my educated guess, the body has evolved homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining homeostatic balances for these phytochemicals. Our bodies can sequester them from our dietary milleux if we need them, excreting them if we do not. We can prove this for simple elemental chemicals like selenium and zinc. I believe it is the case that homeostatic balancing activities exist for hundreds of many long-familiar dietary components. We just, as Congress, signed an RDA for choline in the last decade. The farther we get from our Paleolithic diet, and relatively new to our genes. Our bodies have had thousands, perhaps milions, of 9 (more importantly) the more synthetic pharaceuticals and food additives we ingest, the more liable we are to suffer imbalances. It's not only food additives that hur us; it is the subtractives as welL. The subtractive phytochemicals are those important nutrients reduced or lost in food processing: \"Ofthe 12 micronutrients which were plentiful in the natural grain, including vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, folic acid, E and the minerals iron, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium, less than 30%, and in some cases less than 10%, have been retained in the wheat products we eat. (Levin, 1996) JJ Restoring chemical balance may require getting back to basics, those primitive Paleolithic foods rich in phytonutrients. At the same time, we should reduce over- processed nutrient-poor junk foods, avoiding additives and even pharmaceuticals where possible and plausible. I'm not saying there is no place for pharmaceuticals. But I will say that in many cases there are balanced Biblical foods that are pharacologically competitive with unbalancing pharmaceuticals, and these food faraceuticals should be drugs of first resort, and the pharaceuticals last resort. And if you believe in me and my Biblical food farmaceutical shotgun more than you believe in your allopath and her/his expensive pharmaceutical silver bullets, there's a better chance that my natural approach will help you. Believing is half the cure. Can you believe in a company whose $2-bilion-a-year drug was shown in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) back in 2002 to be no better than placebo for major depression? Can you believe that now, three years later, that company still has the premier lead-off ad page for the JAMA, touting the $2-bilion-a-year drug as so trusted, so reliable, so efficacious? I suspect you'd be better off with Biblical walnut oil and 10 Biblical saffron, nourishing AND medicating your body, attenuating the depression with few or no consequential side effects. If you count all the possible side effects reported in the fine print of that ad for the $2-billon-a-year pharmaceutical, there are more than a hundred. When that study was printed back in 2002 showing the pharmaceutical no better than placebo, almost nobody heard that the drug failed too. The news was instead blaring out \"St. Johnswort no better than placebo.\" True, St. Johnswort (SJW) fared no better than placebo in this clinical comparson of SJW, Zoloft, and placebo. But that's the half of the story that Joan Q. Public heard a thousand times, while maybe once or twice hearing that the pharmaceutical failed too. Do I think there is a pharaceuticall PhDA/press conspiracy? I wil say that they are all singing the same song, and the song is wrong, and is hurting Americans. Their monotonous song drives American consumers from the safer food, herb and spice farmaceuticals to the more expensive, more dangerous synthetic pharmaceuticals. All this at the expense of our health and the health of our planet. Even our rivers and lakes, and consequently our water supply, are now cocktails of pharmaceutical residues. 2. Some Biblical Herbs and Spices: Potential Alternatives to Pharmaceuticals list (for more examples see Appendix IV) of long- known plants that by some definitions might be considered spices or culinary herbs. I also list here a disease or malady in which they have shown some promise, and a competitive pharaceutical for that disease. I am campaigning for a third arm mandate, empowering a comparison of a third, herbal, arm with the pharmaceutical in any new clinical trials. Until such clinical trials, we don't really know that the pharmaceutical is The following is a parial 11 best. . The herb is almost always safer and cheaper.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Reviewing the MAM's and the IE's for the constituents of the DCO products in herbs for several the maner that I have reviewed thousands of uses for hundreds of the following uses exists: There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of 7 Herb Formula, decades, it is clear that significant evidence in support of \" . . ., fights tumor formation, and fights pathogenic bacteria.\" There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients ofGDU, \"contains natural proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source brome1ain) to help digest protein-\u00ad even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also contains ingredients known to help relieve pain and heal inflammation. GDU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity. . .\" There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of BioMixx, \"boosts the immune system, ... to allow for natural healing.
