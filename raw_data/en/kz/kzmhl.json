Characteristic of the Southwestern United States, Albuquerque is also a very family-focused area. While many families prefer to care for their aging loved ones in their home, this is not a viable option for every family. Albuquerque memory care communities strive to be as family-forward as possible. Explore the unique aspects of Albuquerque memory care below. Residential setting A Place for Mom partners with nine residential care homes in Albuquerque. Unlike larger senior care facilities, residential care homes are typically single-family homes that have been modified to accommodate a limited number of senior residents. Residential care homes are micro-communities, and generally offer a higher staff-to-resident ratio in a home-like environment. Smaller communities like these can be ideal for memory care, as residents may have less to overwhelm them and fewer new faces to get used to. Albuquerque residential communities typically offer both assisted living and memory care. Residential communities' neighborhood settings give them a cozy, often quiet atmosphere, and their small size can give residents a sense of normalcy. Albuquerque residential care homes are subject to the same regulation standards as other assisted living facilities. Residents are offered quality meals, care services, laundry and housekeeping, and enrichment activities, but may also receive more one-on-one attention due to the size of the community. Multiple levels of care Many Albuquerque memory care facilities are integrated with senior living communities that offer multiple types of care, such as combinations of assisted living, independent living, and skilled nursing. A Place for Mom partners with seven multi-leveled communities that include memory care. These communities make it easier for residents to transition to a support level that fits them if their needs change in the future. This enables residents to age in place without the stress of having to switch communities. As there are not always enough memory care openings to meet demands in the area, these multi-level care communities also enable seniors in mild stages of dementia to begin in assisted living even when memory care is full. Multiple care types together also offer more variety among residents, often giving more opportunity for friendships and community engagement, regardless of an individual's specific level of need. Amenities Many of Albuquerque's assisted living communities offer amenities like movie theaters, barber shop/beauty salons, fitness centers, and restaurant-style dining, so that residents can keep up their usual routines and pleasures without the hassle of a commute. Memory care communities often have secure areas where residents can safely take walks and maintain their autonomy, while also ensuring their safety. These communities also offer activities designed to support cognitive function to improve seniors' quality of life. "}
