My boyfriend and I have been going to her for a short time now and can't believe we didn't find her sooner! She gets to the root cause! We have had Dr's misdiagnose us or give certain kinds of medication as \"band aids.\" She is the complete opposite! Dr. Samuelson finds the root cause and provides natural solutions with her extensive knowledge on the human body and natural remedies! So so grateful to have found her! I love that she makes you a part of the process and listens to any concerns or questions you may have. She collaborates with other amazing specialists in her practice like nutritionists and acupuncturist. Having our whole family start to see her!At 42 years old, I've never been to ANY doctor before takes their time like this to listen to all you've got going on with your health & actually CARES. I wish that naturopathic doctors were taken MORE serious than P.C.'s. Holistic has helped me the most. Thank you Doctor Kane for treating me like a human being that matters. I'm confident that you will be on my team towards getting me back to my optimal health!Dr.Kane is the best naturopath,I saw him for many years,he taught me so much about healing my body through healthy ways and so wonderful to talk to about anything,I have moved out of state but I will always hold him in the highest regard...and thank him for being so kindMy family has been seeing Dr. Kane and Dr. Samuelson for the past 20 years. I became a patient at the CT Center for Health when I was a college student, since then they have assisted us (my husband and kids) through pregnancy, illness, surgery, mental health challenges, vitamin deficiencies, allergies and overall wellness. They are knowledgeable, communicative, understanding and unfailingly kind.It's rare to receive such undivided attention in our current healthcare system. When you step into the CT Center for Health you are treated as a whole person, not simply a series of symptoms. Whether you're facing a significant health challenge or simply looking to achieve more optimal health, Dr. Kane and Dr. Sam will do their best to get the full picture so they can provide you with the best care possible.Beyond their expertise, Dr. Kane and Dr. Sam are exceedingly exceptional human beings. In their office you're free to laugh, cry, joke and hope. They'll meet you wherever you are in your journey with honesty, intelligence, presence and a sense of humor. I can't recommend their practice enough!Dr. Kane has always been extremely knowledgeable and tremendously helpful to me. His passion, commitment and dedication to helping and serving his customers is outstanding. He cares about and supports your health and well being the right way. He is a phenomenal naturopath resource for anyone interested in learning and improving their health and awareness!My family has been taken care of for more than 20 years by these exceptional doctors, Keli Samuelson and Michael Kane. We have benefitted greatly from their knowledge of natural, harmless treatments for a wide variety of issues, and their approach is always kind and caring. We highly recommend this wonderful medical center.Very helpful staff that has been great to consult throughout the years with a variety of my health concerns. I have been going here for years and have been assisted with a variety of health concerns. I would highly recommend their services.Dr. Kane and his staff are incredibly caring and highly knowledgeable. Im living my best life thanks to Dr. Kane.I have been going to Dr.Michael Kane for more than 10 years. He is incredible. He is such a caring person, he takes time to listen and understand. Recently he has helped me regain strength and mobility through dietary changes and supplements when I was diagnosed with an Autoimmune disease. Dr Kane also provides healthcare to my son and his family, and to my sister. They are also very fond of the quality of services received at the Ct Center for Natural HealthMy family has found this practice to be supportive and caring. They take into account what's going on in your whole body and mind, not just one body part! We have been seeing Dr. Kane for decades.The office is warm and welcoming. The time and education that Dr Kane takes is greatly appreciated. I never feel rushed or confused about what I need to do for my health choices and they are treated just that way....my choices. He sits with me to explain everything and walk me through any protocols that are needed. I wish all Dr's would take the time to get to know their patients the way Dr Kane has gotten to know me and my family! Thank you Dr Kane for truly investing in us. We are a healthier family for it.Dr. Kane is phenomenal. I started working with him several years ago. He helped me to boost my immune system. Now, I rarely get sick. His intervention was life changing for me.I'm very happy to have found Dr. Kane at CT Center for Natural Health! He has helped a lot with identifying foods that trigger my ibs symptoms. I've taken the detox program twice which I found helpful both times. I take far less medication and feel better overall. Way less general anxiety and my ibs is now what I would consider manageable. My favorite thing about this practice is that it fits into my life. I don't feel pressured to take a lot of supplements or to change in a way that doesn't work for me. Dr. Mike provides resources and education, has given me many tips that I've been easily able to fit into my routines, but doesn't criticize when I make not so healthy choices.I first started going to the CT Center for Natural Health when I was in my 30ths and referred by my therapist and psychiatrist. Now I am retired, and my natural path reviews my blood work, supplements, and diet. I have moved on from receiving services from my therapist or psychiatrist, thank you CT Center For Natural Health for your ongoing care.Since 2007, Dr. Kane and the CT Center for Natural Health has been a valuable part of my health care team. He is a great resource for for discussion of nutrition, exercise, fasting, and a detailed evaluation of blood test results. We have been using safe Vital Nutrients supplements to help with some conditions which otherwise might be treated by prescription medicines with unwelcome side effects. Thank you for being there!I have been seeing Dr Kane for over ten years now and he is absolutely amazing!! He has helped me through an autonomic nervous system issue that is not easily diagnosed along with a multitude of stomach issues!! He helped my husband with gi issues as well and saw my young son. He spends time with you and does not rush you through any appointment. Besides being informative and knowledgeable he is also compassionate and caring. He has so many tips and information that help with all around health!!! Highly recommend!!!I have been seeing Dr. Samuelson for about 20 years. She is excellent, thorough, patient and very insightful about my health issues and treatments. I highly recommend her and the Center. They are always kind and professional.Our whole family doctors here. They have solved a number of problems that traditional Western medicine could not.I've been going to Dr. Kane for over 10 years now. He was able to troubleshoot and diagnose issues that my primary care physician could not. He figures out what is causing symptoms rather then just treating them. I highly recommend Dr. Kane and this practice.We love Dr Kane and CT center for health. He always explains everything in detail, does not rush during an appointment and definitely listens to every concern and symptom. Very knowledgeable in latest medical studies and is easily reached and anwers my emails in a timely manner.We are so glad we found Dr. Kane! My husband suffered with stomach problems his entire life and has finally found relief. Our entire family including my parents have seen him as well. Very happy with our care and with our results.Dr.Michael Kane is the man to see. I have psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, if it weren't for him, I'd be in a wheelchair. Going to Connecticut center for health was one of the best decisions of my life. I highly recommend making an appointment with Dr.Kane.Great place, they diagnosed my issue the first time I went, where regular drs took 2 years to diagnose me, and kept giving me on $2000 in medication a month, now thanks to these guys I'm off, and they are more knowledgeable and honest with you "}
