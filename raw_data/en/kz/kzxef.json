Should I be taking turmeric supplements? BHF dietitian Victoria Taylor says: Turmeric is a key ingredient in curry powder and also has a long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine. The active ingredient is curcumin, which has been found to reduce inflammation and increase antioxidants. There has been some research into whether these properties could protect against heart disease or improve outcomes for people with coronary heart disease. However, although studies have had some positive results, these have not been consistent, and in some cases have been small, short in duration or based on animals (not humans), which makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. The issue is complicated by the fact that the curcumin in turmeric is not easily absorbed by the body, so you may get little or no benefit. We therefore don't recommend turmeric supplements. Turmeric supplements are safe for most people. But if you're taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as People with liver or bile duct problems should not take turmeric supplements, as they can increase bile production. Cooking with turmeric shouldn't cause problems. But don't assume that foods and drinks, such as turmeric lattes, which use turmeric as a selling point, are healthy. They often come with added ingredients that are high in saturated fat or sugar.

High doses of turmeric could have a blood-thinning effect; if taken on top of prescribed anticoagulants, this could increase the risk of dangerous bleeding.
