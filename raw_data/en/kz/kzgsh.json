To the editor: I wouldn't go to a chiropractor for treatment for an infectious disease, nor would I go to an infectious disease physician to get my back adjusted. (\" [Anti-vaccine chiropractors rising force of misinformation](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-10-09/anti-vaccine-chiropractors-rising-force-of-misinformation),\" Oct. 9) Additionally, as a retired pharmaceutical representative, I have far more knowledge and training hours in infectious disease than any chiropractor around. Why, oh why would anyone listen to a chiropractor (they are not physicians) on vaccines anyway? I continue to be awed by the stupidity around me. Cindy Baker, Simi Valley .. To the editor: Chiropractors shouldn't all be painted with the same brush. I've been to many \u2014 some good, some fair. But no chiropractor has ever tried to sell me supplements or discuss vaccinations with me. I am sure there are medical professionals who behave that way, but certainly not the majority. My chiropractor for the last 20 years is my go-to person for most ailments. He knows the human body extremely well and treats my problems with a variety of techniques. He has also suggested that I see my internist when he suspects a possible medical problem. He's been right every time. Integrity in all professions is a good barometer. There are good doctors and chiropractors, just as there are poor ones. Marlene Bronson, Los Angeles "}
