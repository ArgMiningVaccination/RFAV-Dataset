Out of the many injuries you may sustain over your lifetime, spinal injuries can... Chiropractic care can be a very effective and non-invasive approach to relieving and preventing headaches. Treatments can help regardless of the type of headache. We can help tension or migraine headaches, and assist if the cause of the headache is due to stress or posture. The central nervous system, which is comprised of our brain and spinal cord, is the only system that is directly protected by our bones. These bones make up our spine. When certain bones in your neck get out of position and cannot move correctly, it can put stress on your nervous system and the surrounding muscles which then results in headaches. It is imperative to get the proper chiropractic examination to determine the best diagnosis to reduce the frequency of your headaches and ultimately be free of migraine and headache pain. Many times during the collision of an auto accident, your neck is involuntarily whipped back and forth and side to side beyond its normal range of motion. This can result in whiplash injuries that can affect the muscles and tissues in your neck and back. Back pain, neck pain or stiffness can occur immediately or within days, weeks or even months. It is important to treat whiplash right away even if you are not yet feeling major neck or back pain. Migraines and headaches are common symptoms that can happen from whiplash injuries or any type of vehicle injury. Headaches may occur when particular vertebrae in your neck are constrained and out of position due to the impact from the accident. These strained neck muscles can cause throbbing to emit to your head. Any trauma to your head can trigger headaches and migraines. If you are experiencing headaches after an auto accident, then you should seek treatment as soon as possible so this headache pain does not become permanent. Chiropractic care & medical treatment has been proven to be effective in relieving acute neck pain and chronic neck pain. Acute neck pain is the feeling of a sharp pain in the neck and you may not be able to turn your head. Chronic neck pain occurs from poor posture and sedentary work like sitting at a desk all day working on a computer. A characteristic of this pain is a dull achy discomfort which is often followed with stiffness. In both cases, certain vertebrae in the neck and upper back may be problematic developing in neck pain. Supporting our spine are muscles, ligaments, and tendons; all of which can form scar tissue, which can complicate the healing process. Adjustments are aimed to keep the joints working correctly, lessen stiffness, reduce pain, minimize muscle tension and increase motion. Most people don't want to diminish their pain with just medicine, but many times that is what doctors suggest. At Integrated Health Solutions, our advanced medical team treats neck pain with advanced methods that center on fixing function to your nervous and musculoskeletal system. We believe this is the best solution to minimize your pain and regain regular function. Please fill out all fields marked with * and submit the following form to request your consultation. "}
