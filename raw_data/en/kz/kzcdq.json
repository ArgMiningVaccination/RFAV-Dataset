Ac Evidenced-Based Nutrition Meets Traditional Chinese Medicine Nutrition from the standpoint of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a great complement to typical Nutrition or Naturopathic programs. Whereas modern nutritional practices focus on labs and bloodwork to understand the patient's body and constitution, Traditional Chinese Medicine nutrition utilizes observation and questioning, ancient patterns and principles, and the ideas of Yin/Yang/Qi/Blood balance to guide its framework. Once you establish your nutritional needs and goals based on scientific modern approaches, you can refine and tailor your plan to your specific constitution with the help of the ancient practice of TCM nutrition. Dr. Kristin Barnes is both a Naturopathic Physician and Licensed Acupuncturist who has a deep passion for both modern and ancient nutritional principles.
