COVID -19 vaccination can help keep you from getting COVID -19. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for se vere illness from COVID -19. Vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID -19 pandemic. How do these new vaccines work? The vaccines from Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna use a genetic molecule known as mRNA to prime the immune system against COVID -19. While the mRNA is destroyed by our cells within days, the immune protection from the vaccine may last for months or even years. What are the side effects? The injection into your arm won't feel different than any other vaccine. The side effects, which can resemble the symptoms of COVID -19, last about a day and appear more likely after the second dose. Early reports from vaccine trials suggest some people might need to take a day off from work because they feel lousy after receiving the second dose. In the Pfizer vaccine study, about half developed fatigue. Other side effects occurred in at least 25 to 33 percent of Next Downeast Public Council Friday, March 19, 2021 9:00 - 11:00 AM Virtual Meeting For Full Council Meeting information, please contact Al May or Maura Goss . The Immune System \u2014The Body's Defense Against Infection To understand how COVID -19 vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID -19, invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red cells, which carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells, which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells fight infection in different ways: Macrophages are white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs and dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens. The body identifies antigens as dangerous a nd stimulates antibodies to attack them. B-lymphocytes are defensive white blood cells. They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the virus left behind by the macrophages. T-lymphocytes are another type of defensive white blood cell. They attack cells in the body that have already been infected. The fi rst time a person is infected with the virus that causes COVID -19, it can take several days or weeks for their body to make and use all the germ -fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the person's immune system patients, sometimes more, including headaches, chills and muscle pain. Can the vaccine give me COVID -19? No, it cannot. The vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. do not include any version of the coronavirus that causes COVID -19. How do I know the vaccine is safe? Each vaccine application to the federal Food and Drug Administration included two months of follow -up safety data from clinical trials conducted by universities and other independent bodies, during which tens of thousands of volunteers got a vaccine and waited to see if they became infected, compared with others who received a placebo.

Facts about COVID -19 mRNA Vaccines They cannot give someone COVID -19. mRNA vaccines do not use the li ve virus that causes COVID -19. They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. COVID -19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic Wearing masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene are important prevention strategies to follow. They help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC's recommendations to protect remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease. The body keeps a few T -lymphocytes, called memory cells, that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. When the familiar antigens are detected, B -lymphocytes produce antibodies to attack them. Experts are still learning how long these memory cells protect a person against the virus that causes COVID -19. How COVID -19 Vaccines Work COVID -19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID -19 wi thout us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of \"memory\" T -lymphocytes as well as B -lymphocytes that will remember how to fight th at virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T - lymphocytes and B -lymphocytes after vaccination. Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID -19 just before or just after vaccin ation and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity.

Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available. The CDC will continue to update the recommendations to protect communities using the latest science. Understanding mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines Messenger RNA vaccines \u2014also called mRNA vaccines \u2014 are some of the first COVID -19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States. New Approach to Vaccines mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vacc ines. Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein \u2014or even just a piece of a protein \u2014that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus ent ers our bodies. A Closer Look at How COVID -19 mRNA Vaccines Work. COVID -19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the \"spike protein.\" The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVI D-19. COVID -19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the immune cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of t hem. Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID -19. At the e nd of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this While there is no certain way to prevent cancer, there are certain risk factors that increase the likelihood of the disease. You can TAKE ACTION to lower those risks through healthy lifestyle choices, getting recommended cancer screenings and vaccinating a gainst certain viruses. Factors that are known to increase the risk of cancer: Cigarette smoking and tobacco use Infections Radiation Immunosuppressive medicines Factors that may affect the risk of cancer: Diet Alcohol Physical activity Obesity Environment al risk factors For more information click here. Six Tips for Reducing your Risk for Cancer 1. Maintain a Healthy Weight and Active Lifestyle Limit processed meats and alcohol. Include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine. 2. Avoid smoking and tobacco products All forms of tobacco products have many chemicals that damage DNA and cause cancer. No forms are safe including cigarettes, e -cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco/snuff, and hookas/waterpipes. Environmental exposures like secondhand smoke also increase the risk. Whether you're thi nking about quitting or ready to quit tobacco, we have the tools to support you. 3. Sun protection protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID -19. mRNA Vaccines Are New, But Not Unknown Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. Interest has grown in these vaccines because they can be developed in a laboratory using readily available materials. This means the process can be standardized and scaled up, makin g vaccine development faster than traditional methods of making vaccines. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for influenzas, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID - 19 was availabl e, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Future mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection for multiple diseases, thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine -preventable diseases.

Check with your primary care p rovider for screening for melanoma. 4. Get Immunized The Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can significantly decrease the risk of several cancers including cervical, throat, tongue, anal, and other genital cancers. It is typically given to youth 12 - 18 years old. The Hepatitis B vaccine decreases the risk for liver cancer. 5. Get Screened Regular screenings help detect cancers early and maximize your chance for successful treatment. 6. Know your family history 5-10% of all cancers are inherited. Unders tanding your family history can help guide your discussion with your physician of when you need to start cancer screening and whether to consider genetic counseling.
