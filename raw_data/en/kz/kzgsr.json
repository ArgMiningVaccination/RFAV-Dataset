Canada Conform\u00e9ment a la loi canadienne sur la protection de la Care: A Critical Analysis of the Integration of Complementary/Alternative Medicine and Biomedicine in Clinical Settings Doctor of Philosophy, 2006 Daniel Benjamin Hollenberg Department of Public Health Sciences University of Toronto Abstract The development of 'integrative health care' (IHC) combining various aspects of conventional biomedicine and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is a relatively recent phenomenon among the biomedical and CAM professions. While IHC is recognized internationally and occurs in many different health contexts, patterns of interaction between biomedical and CAM practitioners, and the nature of IHC settings, - are largely unknown. Further, the health system context in which IHC occurs, and its various effects on IHC settings, has not been systematically analyzed. Finally, there is virtually no critical literature on the THC phenomenon. This research attempts to fill these gaps. This thesis examines three IHC settings in Canada, by examining how biomedical and CAM practitioners are integrating or not integrating with each other at the level of professional interaction in IHC settings. The thesis also examines one aspect of health systems \u2014 the unfunded nature of CAM health services located in the private health sector, and its various effects on the integration of biomedicine and CAM in Canada. A ii critical examination of IHC from an anti-colonial perspective, one that is largely overlooked in analysis of the CAM and biomedical professions, is offered here. Fifty in-depth interviews were conducted between 2002 and 2003, with biomedical and CAM practitioners, patients and stakeholders, drawing on a critical ethnographic methodology. Detailed field observations of the sites were also made. Comparative analysis of the sites revealed that biomedical practitioners enact patterns of exclusionary and demarcationary closure, in addition to using 'esoteric knowledge'. CAM practitioners, in turn, perform usurpationary closure strategies. Patients could not consistently afford certain biomedical and CAM treatments, resulting in the premature termination of an integrative care plan. CAM practitioners working in the private sector could not uniformly attend group rounds as they were not publicly funded. Certain biomedical institutions viewed CAM as a commodity from which to generate revenue and lower budgetary deficits. An anti-colonial analysis illustrates how interprofessional conflict between biomedicine and CAM 'glosses over' fundamental paradigm clashes and biomedical processes of appropriation, assimilation and knowledge devaluation, ultimately traced to colonial exploits of other subjugated knowledges and sciences. The findings in this thesis suggest that when attempts are made to integrate biomedicine and CAM, dominant biomedical patterns of professional interaction continue to exist. Furthermore, the private nature of CAM services in Canada is one aspect of health systems, among others, that negatively affects attempts to integrate biomedicine and CAM. Fundamental challenges such as biomedical 'evidence', knowledge devaluation, and appropriation and assimilation of CAM modalities remain challenges to establishing 'more equitable' forms of IHC. It is likely that biomedically-controlled and iil other types of IHC will continue to co-exist in health care systems. Future analysis of IHC needs to take into account the complexity of a health system context that continues to shape THC. iv Acknowledgements A commonly heard saying when writing a thesis is that the process is similar to a mouse giving birth to an elephant. What is often left out of this serene depiction are the many people who facilitated this 'birth'. First and foremost, I would like to deeply thank and acknowledge my supervisor, Dr. Linda Muzzin, for her steadfast guidance, encouragement and confidence in my ability to navigate the sometimes tricky waters of completing a Ph.D. Words cannot entirely capture my respect for her as mentor and friend. My committee members, Dr. David Coburn, Dr. David Zakus and Dr. Cathryn Chalin, provided unwaivering enthusiasm for my topic and a forum for constructively critical comments and debates. I would like to thank my External Examiner, Dr. Leah Gilbert, for her openness and interest in my research. My parents, Morley and Joan Hollenberg, Frank Markel, and my sister, Elisa Hollenberg, always provided a loving and welcome (and sometimes financial) ear\u2014and on occasion a scotch or two\u2014as I pondered the endless Ph.D. currents. Literally, I could not have completed the thesis without the help of Barbara Payne, technical assistant and computer genius extraordinaire\u2014and now, through this process, a fellow 'synchronistic' friend. I would like to thank my grandfather, Dr. Jacob Hollenberg, for encouraging me to pursue a Ph.D., although I will always wonder if he really knew what I would be studying! Last, but certainly not least, my loving wife Seema has always supported me in numerous ways, both materially and spiritually. In addition to voluntarily reading a draft of my thesis while waiting for our daughter to arrive (more than any husband could ask!), she has, without a doubt, been my 'rock' behind my Ph.D. studies. She can also now proudly say that she has survived a Ph.T.\u2014or 'putting hubby through'. And of course, I dedicate this thesis to the real meaning of life, my one-year-old daughter Mira, who joined the thesis as a second birth and whose beauty and wisdom will always be my shining light.

In contrast, up to 80 per cent of the populations of so-called 'developing'' countries have for generations used 'traditional' health care practices (labeled 'alternative' from a biomedical perspective). In industrialized countries, it is now estimated that at least half of all citizens are currently using some form of CAM (Bodeker & Chaudhury, 2001). Complementary/ alternative medicine, although it has varying definitions, refers to those medical treatments, therapies or modalities that are not included as mainstream biomedical therapy, and the practice of which is not formally taught in biomedical schools (Eisenberg, Kessler, & Foster, 1993). Although some CAM therapies emerged historically in 'Western' countries (e.g., chiropractic), others draw from traditions in non- Western countries (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM). In this thesis, any therapy outside of the dominant system of biomedicine will be referred to as 'CAM'. Further, the category of 'CAM? is defined as encompassing a broad range of health-related therapies, practices and lifestyles ranging from herbs, massage and acupuncture to magnets, crystals and diet-fads. I am referring to CAM asa historically situated designation of particular types of non-biomedical health therapies and practices that arose both in Europe and outside of Europe, and that both preceded and competed with the rise of biomedicine. These historical movements will be discussed further in Chapter Two. ' Single quotes are used throughout this thesis to indicate added emphasis and/or the inherently problematic nature of a term or concept. Recent developments in biomedical and CAM communities have shifted attention away from 'complementary' and 'alternative' medicine, to a focus on what has been termed one type of 'integrative' health care (IHC). As Collyer observes: The incorporation of CAM into orthodox medical practice through the multi- skilling of doctors and other health workers, the development of integrated clinics and hospitals, the introduction of CAM into the mainstream training and research institutions, and the addition of CAM products into orthodox manufacturing and distribution systems, have all become features of the healthcare sector during the last decade (in Tovey, Easthope, & Adams, 2004, p. 92). The widespread public use of CAM has led biomedical and CAM researchers, policy- planners and practitioners alike to ask whether or not aspects of CAM and biomedicine could 'merge' to create a new form of health care, and ultimately, a new health system. Whereas 'alternative' and 'complementary' are used to refer to therapies outside or alongside conventional biomedicine, this type of 'integrative health care' now refers to the combination of CAM and biomedicine in a unified, non-hierarchical treatment system (Schroeder & Likkel, 1999). The potential integration of CAM and biomedicine has been recognized in Canada and internationally, as indicated by medical conferences around the world focussing on the topic of integration (Faass, 2001). Of further significance, Health Canada has released a document outlining specific strategies to establish an integrated Canadian medical system, combining aspects of CAM and biomedicine (Advisory Group on Complementary and Alternative Health Care, 2001). Most significantly, new integrative clinical environments combining both biomedical and CAM therapies have emerged around the world (Faass, 2001). For example, there are an estimated 100 IHC settings in the United States (Mark Hoch, personal communication, May 16, 2002). 1.1 The Problem There has been little research historically on the phenomenon of integrative health care combining CAM and biomedicine, particularly in the clinical settings where IHC is occurring. This lack of research continues, despite 'integration' in biomedical and CAM communities described above, in addition to the widespread public use of CAM, and the emergence of new integrative clinical environments. As a result, there are three major gaps in current integration research, leading to pertinent and as yet unanswered questions. First, there have been no sociological studies conducting observation-based research on eluerging integrative environments, with the exception of research on solo CAM practitioners in some hospitals (see Shuval, 2002). What is the nature of these new settings? How do biomedical and CAM practitioners work together in integrative environments? What are patients' experiences in these settings? Second, the phenomenon of IHC has not been critically theorized, leaving current developments and assumptions about integration unproblematized. What developments have led integrative health care to become a new focus in biomedical and CAM communities? Does this new focus mean that CAM and biomedicine will finally co-exist alongside each other in mutually respectful, cooperative, understanding, egalitarian and nurturing environments? Or, will the development of integrative health care lead to a repeat of scenarios in the twentieth century where non-biomedical therapies all but disappeared? Third, while current academic health-systems theory has recently emerged to address the integration of biomedical services, much of this new literature has failed to include or address CAM as a significant part of these services. Further, in the few models that have included CAM as part of a new theoretically-integrated health care system (e.g., Leatt, Pink, & Guerriere, 2001), CAM services have only been marginally acknowledged, and the inherent challenges (and there are many) of including CAM ina mainstream health paradigm have not been addressed. In addition, models of integration have recently been proposed by CAM scholars drawing from biomedical models of IHC. From both biomedical and CAM groups, these models speak of integrating care across a 'continuum' of clinical and professional guidelines. Yet, how will this continuum be established when CAM and biomedical practices often function from radically different paradigms of health and illness? How is it possible to achieve collaborative planning and policy development, when there may be no common ground? How is it possible to achieve trust and respect between biomedicine and CAM, when biomedicine has historically persecuted many CAM practitioners and modalities? Finally, how is it possible to construct a fair and equitable method of payment and compensation for health services, when the majority of CAM therapies are not yet covered by Canadian public health insurance, and are paid for directly from the patients' own financial resources? These and many other questions have not been addressed in research on IHC settings. 1.2 Locating IHC This research study examines the development of three newly-developed IHC settings/initiatives in Canada. As will be discussed in later sections of this thesis, IHC can take many forms and as yet, has no agreed-upon definition or structure. As a result, I chose the three settings in this study as case examples of one type of newly-developed concept in IHC. This concept primarily refers to the combination of biomedically-trained physicians, specialists and/or paramedical health care providers, with non-biomedical health care practitioners (CAM or holistic), in a formal health care setting. While other concepts such as 'collaboration' have also been applied to this type of IHC, my main goal was to examine health care settings that were combining biomedical and non-biomedical practitioners in some capacity. To this end, I found three new IHC initiatives in Canada that corresponded to this concept. Although there are many 'visions' or models of how this type of IHC could or should occur, I was primarily concerned with the promise, as touted by authors of certain IHC models, that these new settings represent the 'future' of health care by combining biomedical and non-biomedical health care practitioners into a new form of health care'. My main research goal guided my first research question which was to examine the nature of these settings from an ethnographic viewpoint, maintaining a critical stance towards the 'promise' of IHC. What also soon began to intrigue me was the attempt in this version of IHC to combine health care practices from diverse and sometimes opposing health paradigms. 1.3. Purpose of the Research and Research Questions This research began, then, with the intent to explore the extent to which CAM and biomedicine were integrating with each other at the level of clinical interaction, by critically examining three clinical settings in which CAM and biomedical practitioners * This type of IHC is related, but clearly in contrast to other types, such as integrative biomedical health care settings including palliative care units and Community Health Centres (CHCs), or other holistic IHC settings that have multiple non-biomedical (CAM) practitioners without a biomedical physician or paramedical practitioner. were interacting, using critical ethnographic methods. In contrast with the majority of studies of IHC, which are outcome-based and cost-benefit analyses, I chose to focus instead on how adjoining professions and their practices supported or undermined integration, rather than beginning with asking whether or not CAM 'could' or 'should' be integrated with biomedicine. This orientation is consistent with other critical scholars who research CAM and biomedicine, who focus on the dynamics of interaction and the power relations that shape these interactions (Cant & Sharma, 1999, p. 160). As the research commenced, it became clear that an analysis of interaction only at the clinical level or on the 'clinic floor' (i.e., purely between CAM and biomedical health care professionals) would not be broad enough to 'capture' the nature of these settings as representing a new and emerging form of health care. Thus, I eventually considered the impact of state policies and divergent health paradigms on integration. The central question posed by the research was first: how are CAM and biomedicine integrating or not integrating with each other at the level of clinical interaction? As the research progressed, related sub-questions from this first initial question were developed to guide examination of the nature of these settings from various critical angles. The sub-questions were: A) What are the characteristics of new integrative settings (e.g., types and number of practitioners; types of therapies offered; number of patients and types of illnesses treated; established clinical/ administrative guidelines)? B) How do biomedical and CAM practitioners work together in these settings? C) What are patients' views and experiences in these settings? D) What developments have led integrative medicine to become a new focus in biomedical and CAM communities? E) Do biomedical techniques remain dominant in these settings? F) To what extent are social closure practices as employed by biomedicine involved in professional relations with CAM? G) To what extent is biomedical knowledge valued over alternative medical knowledge in these settings? As the research further progressed, a previous review of literature on [HC revealed that not only were case studies on new IHC settings few and far between, but I also found that models of IHC from CAM and biomedical literature presented concepts of integration that did not match everyday experiences in these social health settings. Moreover, close analysis of these settings hinted at deep and fundamental dichotomies between biomedicine and non-biomedical or CAM modalities, stemming from their underlying philosophies and/or paradigms. Rather than trying to debate which type of evidence should be normatively valued to 'accept' IHC, I observed which professional practices were dominant or marginalized, and why. This led to an extended consideration of the philosophical and epistemological challenges in the attempt to combine health care modalities from diverse paradigms and socio-political histories. 1.4 Locating Myself I have been involved with the research of CAM practices for the past 10 years. Nearing the end of my undergraduate degree in cultural anthropology from the University of Calgary in 1995, I enrolled in a graduate Nursing course presenting an overview of CAM therapies and practices. This course provided me with a solid introduction to the diversity of CAM, and 'opened my eyes' to the possibility of other forms of healing in Western countries aside from conventional biomedicine. Pursuing further my interest in CAM, I enrolled in a master's degree program in cultural medical anthropology at the University of Manitoba. For my master's thesis research, I examined the use of CAM by individuals with chronic illness, using the 'jlIness narrative' approach (e.g., see Kleinman, 1988; Frank, 1995) of examining the 'stories' of patients, framed within a neo-Marxist understanding of the history of medicine and medical dominance. It was here that I became aware that theoretically, biomedicine as we know and experience it today was shaped by significant historical power struggles between dominant and dominated groups\u2014namely, the allopathic (biomedical) and non-allopathic (CAM) healing professions of the time. Having completed my master's degree, and unsure as to my future course, I enrolled and completed an eight-month certificate course in Chinese acupressure ('acupuncture without needles') in 1998, which further enhanced my theoretical and research knowledge by providing a practical 'hands-on' experience with a CAM therapy. Not being entirely satisfied with the practical experience (though it was intensely rewarding), I felt compelled to continue researching CAM practices. In the Fall of 1999, I entered the Ph.D. program in Social Science and Health, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, and in the summer of 2000 accepted a short-term research position at the Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, investigating the use of CAM by patients with advanced cancer. It was here that I found myself at the interface of CAM and biomedicine, immersed in the experiences of cancer patients combining aspects of both modalities. These patients were at times highly critical of biomedicine and reported their negative experiences with particular doctors. It was a short step from these experiences to my researching the recent development of 'integrative health care'. 1.5 Theoretical/Conceptual Framework and Assumptions My research is located broadly within a critical social science perspective or CSSP (Eakin, Robertson, Poland, Coburn, & Edwards, 1996), drawing on aspects of critical sociology and critical theory. I am using a CSSP to mean a multi-paradigmatic theoretical perspective that recognizes and problematizes power relations between groups in all societies. As such, I am recognizing that a CSSP is broadly Marxist-inspired, but today must inevitably go beyond a Marxist framework to acknowledge that power and domination can occur on levels and in ways beyond a purely class-based economic structure (Giddens, in Cassell, 1993, p. 325; Harvey, 1990). Drawing on critical theory, I am further identifying a CSSP as encompassing a form of Marx's 'historical sociology' (however not excluding the present), and drawing on a 'sociological imagination' that recognizes the profound transformations within human history. Many critical theoretical approaches (e.g., critical feminism; critical ethnography; action anthropology; participatory action research) focus on the practical empowerment of oppressed peoples. I see the purpose of my research as the stimulation of critical awareness that might lead to the desire for change, and that 'things could be otherwise' (Bullock & Trembly, 1988, p. 185; Eakin et al., 1996, p. 158; Harvey, 1990). A CSSP focuses on two key elements: ideology and power. Ideology has been defined as those ideas and images through which the class that rules the society orders, organizes, and sanctions the social relations that sustain its domination (Smith, 1987, p. 54). Following neo-Marxist thought, in all classed societies, the dominant class develops or takes over ideological forms which legitimize its domination (Giddens, 2000, p. 41). An existing dominant ideology is viewed as a 'distortion'. The concept of ideology assumes that ideas will not come into prominence unless they articulate with interests held by the dominant class (Giddens, 2000, p. 42). One essential objective of a CSSP is to render explicit aspects of dominant ideological discourses and their assumptions, so_ that they can be contested (Eakin et al., 1996, p. 158). Discourses are often implicit or 'invisible', however, because they are perceived as 'self-evident truths' rather than as socially derived conventions. In addition to the above elements, there are three others that are integral to the development of a CSSP. The first is reflexivity, or taking a reflexive stance towards research problems and the research process. Reflexivity refers to the capacity to locate oneself as a researcher in the same social world as the phenomenon being studied, and not occupying a privileged position outside the world of study (Eakin et al., 1996, p. 158). Research is not only a neutral procedure for discovering an objective external reality that exists independent of human perception and interpretation. Reflexivity also involves making explicit the world-views that the researcher and others bring to the research. Second, a CSSP acknowledges contradiction and lack of consensus in research, and that multiple views of a research problem are entirely possible and in fact desirable, and can generate insight into the research process. Third, a CSSP acknowledges the dialectic relationship between structures and individual perspectives in society. Just as economic, political, cultural and organizational forces in any society shape the everyday lives of individuals and groups, so too the everyday practices of individuals and groups produce, reproduce and transform those same structural forces. Each informs, produces and reproduces the other. 10 In the context of the above theoretical framework, this research further makes three main assumptions associated with the substantive area of CAM and biomedicine. The first assumption is that for approximately the last 100 years in Canada, the CAM professions (e.g., homeopathy) have occupied a position of marginality to biomedicine and the biomedical paradigm, despite the recent widespread acceptance of some forms of CAM such as chiropractic. While CAM has attained partial autonomy from biomedicine through state intervention (e.g., in Canada) and through widespread consumer use, the biomedical paradigm of health, disease and treatment remains dominant, while the profession of medicine remains the single most powerful occupation in the health care division of labour (Coburn, 1988). It is crucially important to recognize the historic and contemporary marginality of CAM in the face of a newly proposed 'integrative health care' in CAM and biomedical communities. The second assumption is that this marginality can be understood partially by the recognition that the state has never been a neutral party vis-a-vis health and other professions, and that it continues to play a significant role in the development of CAM and biomedicine. State support of medicine in creating a 'medical monopoly' in the early twentieth century is a case in point, and will be discussed further. Third, this research assumes that capitalist and biomedical ideology, reinforced both by state and other power relations, was of crucial importance in the establishment of biomedicine as a dominant healing profession, and that it remains integral to the maintenance of the dominance of biomedicine and the biomedical paradigm. This assumption recognizes that biomedicine is based upon a distinct biomedical paradigm that has not been constant throughout history, but has been shaped by power relations to 1] promote distinct notions of health and disease, thereby excluding other treatment paradigms. 1.6 Structure of the Thesis Chapter Two presents a critical review of historical developments and relevant theoretical understandings pertaining to medical dominance, the re-emergence of the CAM professions and the appearance of integrative health care. Chapter Three reviews the methodology used for the research. Chapter Four introduces and critiques substantive areas related to CAM and integrative health care and as they pertain to the main research questions. Chapter Five describes the integrative health care sites for the research study and also locates them within the context of integrative health care in Canada and internationally. Chapters Six and Seven examine the private-public dimensions of the settings and professional interaction in IHC settings. As indicated above, as the research proceeded, I theorized about fundamental challenges to IHC; my vision of these ontological and epistemological differences is presented in Chapter Eight, which builds on a critique of the philosophy of biomedicine, and incorporates ideas from the philosophy of, and social construction of science. Chapter Nine continues by presenting the 'truly integrative' or 'constructive' aspects of integrative health care found in the research sites, and thus contrasts with the critical findings in the previous chapters. I term the resulting vision one that includes both 'enabling' and 'disabling' tendencies, or both subjugation and resistance, in IHC. Chapter Ten discusses the contributions of my research, and by examining current developments in biomedicine and CAM, concludes by considering the 'future' of integrative health care. 12 Chapter 2 UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL DOMINANCE AND THE RE-EMERGENCE OF THE CAM PROFESSIONS In the first part of this chapter, I argue that there were three significant events that had a major influence on the establishment of biomedicine as the dominant healing profession in late nineteenth and early twentieth century North America. These three significant developments were: the creation of allopathic medical acts and associations (1847-1912); the Flexner Report, and the coincident establishment of universities tied to medical schools, funded by powerful philanthropic donations (1910-1940); and the development of diagnostic as opposed to curative allopathic medicine (1880-1950). (See Appendix A for detailed chronological reference of these developments.) In the second part, I outline various developments, such as the self-help movement (1970-1980), and the introduction of health care insurance and the Canadian 'state take-over' of medicine (1960-onwards), that led to a relative decline of biomedical power. These developments are linked to critical theoretical perspectives that help to frame and further contextualize these events. Specifically, I suggest that neo-Marxist, critical closure, anti-colonial and critical philosophy of science perspectives each provide explanatory angles of the process. As Harvey argues, critical social research is not bounded by a single theoretical perspective (1990, p. 8). The overall point of the chapter is to provide a contextual understanding and 'reference point' from which IHC was emerging in 2005. The literature suggests that the relationships between CAM and biomedicine are best viewed as a series of historical movements constituting the rise and relative 'fall' of biomedicine, mirrored by the relative 'fall' and re-emergence of the CAM professions. These historical movements 13 also describe a progression from the 'birth' of professionalized medicine; the creation of what some historians have called the 'golden age' of medicine; and the 'death' of the CAM professions, to the gradual re-emergence of CAM and the development of integrative health care. My review of these historical developments is consistent with critical social research. As Harvey states: Critical historicism reconstructs history through the adoption of a critical Weltanschauung (world view). The point of view informs the historical reconstructive process. However, it involves more than just a different point of view upon which to base a historical account. This approach examines the historical genesis of a social system and shows how oppressive structures have emerged. It addresses historical events in terms of their relation to prevailing social practices and examines the extent to which prevailing structures are sustained through them (1990, p. 28). Although biomedicine was soon to become dominant, historians have documented 'that in mid-to-late nineteenth century North America, there existed a diverse number, or 'plurality' of allopathic (biomedical) and non-allopathic (non-biomedical) healing practices. Among them, allopathic biomedicine was a growing but apparently inconsequential threat to other healing practices (Baer, 1989; Coburn, 1988; Connor, 1991; Hamowy, 1984). Non-allopathic healing traditions such as homeopathy, eclecticism and Thomsonianism were practiced alongside allopathic biomedicine, in contexts that were not necessarily amicable, but nevertheless were not consistently dominated by any single party (Connor, 1991; Hamowy, 1984). The nineteenth century in North America was therefore characterized by a 'multiplicity' of medical systems (Connor, 1991, 1998; Hamowy, 1984; Porter, 1997; Rogers, Connor for example, argues that: \"A distinctive feature of nineteenth-century society was the diverse composition of its medical community\" (p. 59). Connor states that in addition to those practitioners who would be 14 recognized today as physicians, there existed smaller groups of other medical practitioners who were variously called 'irregular', 'alternative', 'marginal', 'unlicensed', or 'quacks' (1991, p. 59). This group of 'irregular' practitioners included female midwives, commercial vendors of medicines, and domestic lay healers. The majority, however, according to Connor, were known as 'sectarian' practitioners, which Connor defines as \"followers of various medical sects or philosophies who offered therapeutic treatment and counsel based on conceptual and clinical frameworks that were often clearly identifiable as different from those used by the majority of the medical profession\" (1991, p. 59). According to Connor (1991), there were arguably six main sects in this majority that formed the basis of non-allopathic healing practices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, in addition to previously mentioned lay-healing practices: Thomsonianism; homeopathy; eclecticism; Christian Science; Appendix A for a detailed chronology of the emergence of these sects, and Appendix B for summaries of these healing practices). In the early twentieth century, however, significant changes occurred, and the profession of allopathic medicine (biomedicine) became the dominant healing modality in Canada and the United States. 2.1 Allopathic Medical Acts and Associations The Canadian historian Ronald Hamowy describes a succession of Canadian allopathic medical acts and associations that restricted late nineteenth and early twentieth-century irregular (non-biomedical) or 'CAM' practitioners in Canada. I will largely draw upon Hamowy here, as a historical expert on these developments. By 1867, 15 the first national federal Canadian Medical Association (CMA) was established, in the words of Dr. Tupper, later Prime Minister of Canada: [t]o protect the health and lives of the people of this Dominion from the unskilled treatment of incompetent men, and to provide in the most effectual manner for the due qualification of the members of a [medical] profession so important as our own (in Hamowy, 1984, p. 97). The CMA's ultimate goal, according to Hamowy, was to eliminate all heterodox 'sects' entirely; it had strict rules against allopathic physicians 'consorting' with irregular practitioners, otherwise known as the 'consultation clause' (1984, p. 98). The CMA also sought to establish a uniform system of medical education and code of medical ethics, and to regulate the granting of licenses (1984, p. 97). According to Hamowy, however, at this point in time, the CMA was more of a philosophy than an active deterrant against irregulars. As Hamowy details, the goals of the CMA began to be realized with the passage of the provincial Ontario Medical Act (OMA) of 1869, reinstating the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, which had previously disbanded due to disorganization. Surprisingly, as in Britain, the Act incorporated both homeopathic and eclectic representation on the Medical Council, causing much internal friction and controversy among allopathic practitioners (Dew, in Tovey et al., 2004, pp. 64-65; Hamowy, 1984, pp. 102-105). Opposition to the inclusion of irregular practitioners in the Act quickly turned to support, however, upon the prediction that through this inclusion, the number of irregular practitioners would ultimately diminish, and that irregulars would be absorbed into the orthodox medical profession. The OMA Act of 1869 stated that before obtaining licenses to practice, all homeopaths and eclectics had first to take four years of orthodox medical education and 16 be registered on a list of licensed practitioners. This was to guarantee their 'competency' (Hamowy, 1984, pp. 101-103). As a consequence, homeopathic and eclectic boards were abolished, and while homeopaths and eclectics still maintained their representation on the CMA, the number of licensed irregular practitioners ultimately was reduced. After the Act, students attempting to study homeopathy had to pay double the tuition compared to an allopathic medical student, drastically reducing the number of homeopathic students able to secure an allopathic medical degree and license to practice (Hamowy, 1984, p. 115). By 1872, eclecticism had virtually disappeared in Canada, leaving homeopathy alone in the competition. Homeopaths, while still on the Ontario Medical Council, co- operated with the wishes of the Council for more rigorous requirements for licensure, and a reduction in the number of entrants into the profession (Hamowy, 1984, p. 115). Later that year, however, the homeopathic representation on the Council resigned, protesting the failure of their key representative Dr. Campbell to be re-elected, and the unfair nature of examinations for homeopathic students (1984, p. 116). Upon resigning, the homeopathic representatives introduced a new bill into the provincial legislature seeking the incorporation of a homeopathic College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, to wield similar powers as those of the Ontario College (1984, p. 117). This homeopathic college would never be established. In 1874, a new Act was introduced in Upper Canada, further regulating 'irregular' practitioners. The Act made unlawful any unregistered person professing to practice medicine or administering medical advice, under penalty of a $100 fine and/or 30 day imprisonment (Hamowy, 1984, p. 121). A public prosecutor in each province was 17 appointed to oversee this legislation. As noted earlier, the Act would cause considerable paranoia in medical circles, as members were under the scrutiny of their colleagues through what was called the 'consultation' clause. Prosecutions against 'illegal' practitioners, while at first few in number, gradually increased. By 1900, Hamowy contends that due to the power of the Medical Acts, homeopathy was effectively eliminated from posing any competitive threat to the Canadian medical community. The final restriction of irregular health professions in Canada came with the passage of the 1912 Canada Medical Act, preceded by the American Flexner Report of 1910, which will be discussed next. Propelled by physician-turned-politician Dr. Thomas Roddick, the Act standardized medical licensing procedures in all provinces across Canada. The ultimate goal of the Act, in the words of Roddick, was to \"promote and effect the assimilation and unification of the various standards of qualification established by the several Provinces of Canada as conditions of admission to the study and practice of Medicine\" (Hamowy, 1984, p. 241). In effect, 'assimilation' meant eliminating all competing irregular health occupations. Historians detailing American developments mirror Hamowy's Canadian observations. Developments in the United States occurred somewhat later than in Canada, but were similar. Also, arguably, the 'fall' of non-biomedical therapies was not as complete in the United States as in Canada. The success of homeopathy and Thomsonianism prompted allopathic physicians to establish the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1847, with the goal of 'elevating' standards for medical education and controlling the occupation in its own 'elite' image (Baer, 1989; Coburn, 1993; Schudson, 1974). The establishment of the AMA was a direct response to the 18 encroachment on medical territory by irregulars. As with the CMA in Canada, the AMA barred homeopaths from regular medical societies, hospitals, college faculties, and consultations with regular physicians (Baer, 1989; Warner, 1998). Despite this antagonism towards irregular practitioners, in 1870, the AMA, just as in the Canadian situation, was forced to include and legally recognize the presence of homeopaths and eclectics on medical examining boards (Baer, 1989). By 1906, after granting official membership status to irregulars only three years earlier, the AMA decided to grant licensure only to graduates of schools that were deemed 'acceptable' by the Council of Medical Education (Baer, 1989). This development marked the beginning of the decline of the pluralistic medical system in the United States, as it effectively put a cap on who could practice 'acceptable' medicine (Baer, 1989). Thus, there is general agreement among historians that medical acts and associations played a key role in the fall of medical pluralism in both Canada and the United States. 2.2 The Flexner Report, Medical Education and Rockefeller Historians further agree that the Flexner Report was part of the expression of the interests of capitalists in biomedicine, and that the Report was integral to the decline of medical pluralism in North America (Baer, 1989; Brown, 1979; Schudson, 1974). According to these historians, in 1904, the AMA set up an annual report to rank medical schools on a national basis, evaluating aspects such as entrance requirements and educational standards for each school (Haller, 1994; Schudson, 1974). The study was under the 19 direction of the AMA's Council on Medical Education, funded by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (Haller, 1994). Abraham Flexner, a graduate of Johns Hopkins in 1886, assisted by Nathan Colwell, a member of the Foundation, was asked to conduct the study (Haller, 1994). 'The Report emerged in a time called the 'Progressive Era' (1890-1914), in which certain social and personal conditions such as alcoholism and 'juvenile delinquency' were identified and defined as 'problems', along with suggested societal remedies for these problems to be addressed by professions such as medicine (Kunitz, 1974). After 1910, the implementation of the Flexner Report, entitled Medical Education in the United States and Canada, drastically altered the socio-economic composition of both allopathic and non-allopathic medical professions (Baer, 1989; Haller, 1994). The Report recommended that more than half of the medical schools across the United States and Canada and most non-allopathic schools, be closed (Chapman, 1974; Schudson, 1974). This amounted to a total subjugation of holistic medicine. The Report suggested a universal four year medical education, with entrance requirements of two years of medical science which included modern pathology, bacteriology, pharmacology, physiology, anatomy, histology and embryology, in addition to other related topics (Haller, 1994). Flexner suggested that medical schools be strongly tied to the university environment, providing further exclusive legitimization and validation for allopathic medicine (Chapman, 1974; Larson, 1977, p. 34). Flexner further recommended restricting entry to a select few. Ironically, the program was to be free from 'dogma', and learned scientific facts were to be presented free from 'theoretical divisions' (Coburn, 20 Torrance, & Kaufert, 1983; Schudson, 1974). Flexner's definition of medicine was 'science', and he insisted that the medical practitioner must be a 'scientist'? (Chapman, 1974; Coburn et al., 1983). Re-affirming the Newtonian-Cartesian model, Flexner urged medical students to view the human body as an \"infinitely complex machine\" (Cohen, 1998, p. 20). Flexner's recommendations were readily endorsed by the American and Canadian allopathic medical communities, and while numbers of medical schools were already in steep decline in the United States due to previous legislation set out by the AMA, his report accelerated the process (Schudson, 1974). As a result of the Report, the number of medical schools in the United States declined from 95 in 1916 to 79 in 1924 (Baer, 1989). The number of American medical graduates declined annually from 5,000 in 1900, to 3,000 by 1920 (Coburn et al., 1983). The Report contributed to the closure of eight American schools which educated African Americans, and the closure of medical schools for women (Baer, 1989). The number of homeopathic schools in the United States declined from 12 in 1910 to five in 1920. Baer (1989) contends that throughout this period, most homeopathic physicians were 'assimilated' into biomedicine. Eclectic schools, already eliminated in Canada, began to decline precipitously in the United States (Haller, 1994). Due to Flexner's new educational requirements, the remaining homeopathic, eclectic and irregular schools closed or 'converted' into allopathic medical schools, simply unable to meet strict new allopathic guidelines (Baer, 1989; Haller, 1994; Kaufman, 1988, p. 112). Medical students saw little reason to attend schools on the basis of sectarian designation, and were attracted to the schools with the best laboratories and other scientific 21 equipment, significantly reducing enrollment in sectarian institutions (Rothstein, 1988, p. 51). By 1936, the New York Homeopathic College, the last homeopathic school, renamed itself the 'New York Medical College' (Baer, 1989; Kaufman, 1988). By 1939, the Eclectic Medical Institute, the last surviving eclectic school, finally shut its doors (Rothstein, 1988, p. 51). Coincident with the Flexner Report was declining philanthropic support from capitalists for non-allopathic practices and institutions. Flexner advocated denying philanthropic funds to homeopathic schools, and after the Report was published, foundations supported only AMA approved schools (Cohen, 1998, p. 20). Large sums of monetary support from figures such as Rockefeller and others enabled allopathic medical schools to build laboratories, buy equipment and hire full-time instructors (Brown, 1979; Coburn et al., 1983; Haller, 1994; Rogers, 1998; Schudson, 1974). For example, in 1913, the Rockefeller General Education Board gave $1.5 million to John's Hopkins University (Cohen, 1998, p. 20). In Canada, Gidney and Miller (1994) also document how universities were investing heavily in scientific medicine. As Shiva notes: The cognitive and structural reconfigurations of biology into a reductionist paradigm were greatly facilitated through the economically powerful Rockefeller Foundation. During the years 1932-1959, the foundation poured about $25 million into molecular biology programs in the United States, more than one- fourth of the foundation's total spending for the biological sciences outside of medicine (including, from the early 1940s on, enormous sums for agriculture) (1997, p. 27). 2.3 'Diagnostic' Medicine The period between 1880 and 1950 has been called the 'modern' period of biomedicine. The ability to make accurate diagnoses, as opposed to cures (at least in the 22 late nineteenth and early twentieth century) dramatically improved (Porter, 1997; Shorter, 1991, pp. 75-106). These developments were preceded by advances made in biology at the beginning of the nineteenth century, at which time the structure of the human body was almost fully known (Capra, 1982, p. 127). The first major development after this time was Louis Pasteur's observation of the correlation between bacteria and disease. His 'germ theory of disease' was swiftly accepted by the early biomedical profession (Capra, 1982, p. 128). The concept of the 'specific etiology of disease' was later formulated by Robert Koch. Known as 'Koch's postulates', they specified a set of criteria needed to demonstrate conclusively that a particular microbe 'caused' a specific disease. The second major advance was development of the antiseptic system and aseptic method, in which surgical instruments and dressings were sterilized, and the use of general anesthesia that led to 'painless' surgery (Capra, 1982, p. 130). Coincident with these developments were advances in medical technology, such as instruments for taking blood pressure; microscopic pathological anatomy; and the X-ray machine. Canadian- born Norman Bethune invented blood transfusion in the field in China. The public image of the 'modern' versus 'traditional' doctor was substantially upgraded (Cohen, 1998; Shorter, 1991). Despite the fact that by 1900 the modern doctor's ability to cure patients remained almost as poor as in earlier times, historians emphasize that due to revolutionary diagnostic procedures, many patients had confidence in doctors as 'men of science' able to predict the future of disease (Shorter, 1991, p. 92). Further, while medicine still could not cure many diseases of the time, it did offer multiple palliative treatments such as the sedative chloral hydrate and related barbiturates; acetaminophen 23 for syphilis (Shorter, 1991). As Cohen states: While in the nineteenth century patients were suspicious of medical authority, in the twentieth century they permitted such authority to establish the social definitions of illness and health. The broader notion of healing\u2014which encompasses all aspects of health and wholeness\u2014was narrowed to biomedical diagnosis and treatment. Medical innovation advanced care but also dehumanized and mechanized the experience of care. While technological methods of diagnosis and treatment provided accuracy, they tended to move evidence away from the patient and to reduce the whole patient to an organ or body part amenable to application of a specific technology (1998, p. 21). To summarize, the major historical developments identified as having had a significant influence on the domination of biomedicine over holistic medicine, according to historians, can be summarized as follows: the formation of medical associations and the enactment of successive medical acts which legalized allopathic medical practices and restricted, eliminated, absorbed or made illegal non-allopathic (non-biomedical) health professions; the implementation of the Flexner Report, and the co-incident restriction of medical education to a select number of medical schools associated with universities and funded by major philanthropic sources, to the exclusion of non-allopathic schools; and the development of diagnostic and palliative (but not curative) medicine. 2.4 _\u2014 Perspectives on Medical Dominance A number of theoretical perspectives in sociology have been used to explain the rise of medical dominance. 'Plural interest group theory' (Alford, 1975) assumes that the rise of medicine was mainly due to the outcome of different degrees of influence exerted by several powerful groups over the state, among which biomedicine was one group 24 (Navarro, 1989, p. 888). The state is viewed as a 'neutral' party merely supporting the most powerful and persuasive argument. In the sociology of the professions, the major theorist associated with plural interest group theory is Eliot Freidson (1970). Freidson argued that medical dominance was attained by the sponsorship and 'shelter' of medicine by a state that had been 'persuaded' of the trustworthiness of the profession, and by medicine convincing the public of its worth in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Coburn et al., 1983; Johnson, 1995). Freidson further argued that medicine also had to persuade the public of its efficacy, and in doing so the public had to be 'convinced' to consult doctors. A second and related theory that has been used to understand the rise of medical dominance is what has been called 'popular choice theory', as espoused by Starr (1983). As Navarro describes, popular choice theory refers to the claim that citizens' beliefs, values and wants, persuaded by medicine, have determined the social, political and economic emergence of professionalized medicine (Navarro, 1984, 1989). The basic premise of this argument is that medicine established its dominance because \"the people wanted it that way\" (Navarro, 1989). Using both plural interest group and popular choice theories, the account of the rise of medical dominance takes on a particular neoliberal theoretical 'flavour'. According to this view, despite early medical technologies having little curative power, the perceived effectiveness of these technologies, combined with the wants and needs of citizens and the endorsement of medicine by the state, allowed biomedicine to become the dominant health profession. The restriction, absorption and elimination of non- 25 allopathic professions via allopathic medical acts, and the establishment of elite and exclusively funded medical schools then became normalized. The above two theoretical perspectives, plural interest group and popular choice theories, have been accepted in many conservative medical and historical circles. I argue, however, after Navarro, that these two perspectives present a 'sanitized' version of the rise of biomedicine, which ignores the powerful class and ideological inequities that are part and parcel of historical developments. One theoretical perspective that highlights these inequities is neo-Marxism. Three major theorists associated with neo-Marxist arguments about medical dominance are Navarro (1976, 1984), Larson (1977) and Brown (1979). | Arguing against plural interest group theory, Navarro suggests that medicine was not merely approved by the public's wishes, but was representative of the dominant class and its ideology. Biomedicine was not merely one of several groups vying for state power, but was representative of the dominant class interests of the time, aided by what Navarro terms \"positive selection mechanisms\", or the state direction of capitalist class interests. That is, he argues that biomedicine was never dominant or not dominant, but always represented dominant class interests (Navarro, 1976). Medical dominance, Navarro contends, was not constructed by public consensus or persuasion of the public by knowledgeable professions, but was maintained and reproduced through the active, overt and covert coercion and repression of alternative philosophies and practices, which Navarro terms \"negative selection mechanisms\" (Navarro 1976, 1984). Instead of medicine 'convincing' the public of its efficacy, state economic and political power asserted medical dominance by shaping popular values of the time through the production 26 and reproduction of dominant class ideology (Navarro, 1989). Navarro argues that as a result, groups that did not share the dominant class ideology were excluded in the historic development of the healing professions. Similarly, arguing against popular choice theory, Navarro suggests that it was not merely citizens' beliefs, values and wants (as Starr, 1983, has argued), but a capitalist class that determined the emergence of medicine as the dominant healing profession. Similar to Navarro, Larson (1977) argues that medicine's rise was facilitated by the 'fit' between the new scientific ideology of 'efficiency' (found in the 'new' science) and the ideology that was being used to justify the increasing power of the corporate (capitalist) class. Brown (1979) also argues that the rise of the new 'scientific' medicine offered the promise of producing a more efficient labour force, aligned with the interests of the new capitalist class. Further, Brown suggests that the new scientific model diverted attention away from the broader social and economic forces that caused or facilitated disease, such as recent industrialization. As will be discussed below and in Chapter Eight, the new biomedical model or paradigm offered a narrow bio-mechanical conception of the body\u2014that disease was caused only by singular, pathological, and often bacteriological agents (Swartz, 1987, p. 261). The germ theory of disease was compatible with the interests of the emerging capitalist class, as it endorsed an individualistic rather than political or ideological view of health and disease consistent with an emphasis on free enterprise (Brown, 1979). As Collyer concludes: Thus, we can see that a fracturing of the healthcare system was created, where the form of prominent healing was that which primarily took only the organic nature of illness into account and offered therapies which were readily commodified as pharmaceutical preparations or other technological forms of intervention. It is not difficult to understand that the much higher potential for profit of scientific medicine ensured that it was supported by class interests and was also provided 27 with the support of the state, the scientific institutions, philanthropic foundations (such as Rockefeller) and importantly, the medical schools themselves (in Tovey et al., 2004, p. 86). A neo-Marxist perspective thus provides insight into the significance of historical observations such as the establishment of medical schools exclusively funded by wealthy businessmen (such as the Rockefeller family); the exclusion of non-allopathic schools; the enforcement of the Flexner Report, and the success of a seemingly 'mystical' diagnostic biomedicine (Navarro, 1984). Social closure theory, explained more fully in Chapter Seven, also provides a useful framework for understanding the exclusionary practices of medicine in the early nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as the enactment of gradually restrictive medical acts, and the purposeful absorption or elimination by medicine of competing non- allopathic ('alternative') therapies. Closure theory, viewed critically, allows for a micro- analysis of patterns of interaction among the health professions. The concept of social closure originated in the work of Weber, who was concerned with how social groups gain and maintain privileged positions in society. The concept of closure has been defined as \"the process of subordination whereby one group monopolizes advantages by closing off opportunities to another group of outsiders beneath it, which it defines as inferior and ineligible\" (Murphy, 1988, p. 8). Similar to Marx, Weber noted the importance of the economic dimension of social stratification, but attributed equal importance to stratification on the basis of prestige and power. For Weber, classes are formed through stratification in the economic order, thereby forming social groups who are in a similar economic situation, versus as a relation to the means of production. These status groups are formed through the use of stratification and prestige and are associated with the 28 consumption of goods rather than economic production, which is central to Marxian theory. Further, parties are also formed, located within the political order of society, and are viewed as structures struggling for domination. In an analysis of medicine in the United States, Freidson (1970) was the first widely recognized analyst to link the dominance of medicine as a profession to social closure practices. Freidson argued that medical dominance was maintained by medicine's monopolization of health knowledge and power through the legal sanction of the state, which enabled medicine to subordinate other health occupations through various exclusionary closure practices. Freidson defined medical dominance as the control by medicine over (a) the content of work, (b) other occupations in the health care division of labour, (c) clients or patients, and (d) the terms and conditions of work. Freidson's analysis also pointed to medicalization, or the development of interests beyond biomedical knowledge; the fact that medicine had a self-deceiving view of its value; and that medicine controls health care because it views itself as the gatekeeper of identifying what is legitimate illness, as defined through a guarded biomedical world view. Freidson was widely criticized by neo-Marxist scholars for neglecting the link between medicine as an extension of a capitalist and bourgeois state, in which the state's bourgeois interests and capitalist institutions also played a role in medicine's seemingly 'logical' rise to professional dominance and power (Brown, 1979; Coburn, 1988; Larson, 1977; Navarro, 1976). As stated, despite its neo-liberal focus, closure theory has much utility for examining microsociological processes of interest to critical theorists. The critical aspects of closure theory will be more fully discussed in Chapter Seven. Most important 29 is the realization that the social closure practice of credentialism, also called 'licensure', is a political process. As Cohen states: \"the power to protect public health, safety, and welfare has been used to exclude or suppress from professional healing those persons and modalities outside the biomedical paradigm\" (1998, p. 24). While legal authority claims to protect patients from dangerous treatments, they also: enforce a regulatory paradigm derived from a historical antipathy toward healing modalities outside biomedicine.... Enforcement and interpretation of such rules consistent with biomedical authority can result in legislative, regulatory, and judicial ratification of biomedical dominance and biomedicine's attempt to monopolize professional healing (Cohen, 1998, pp. 117-118). In effect, legal rules reflect social values and culturally accepted models of health care (Cohen, 1998, p. 119). 2.5 The Nature of Paradigms As already briefly hinted at, the success of the 'new' biomedical paradigm was, in fact, further representative of a historic conceptual shift relating to how the body, illness, disease and health was viewed. It is here that perspectives drawn from the philosophy of science and anti-colonial theory are helpful. A paradigm has been described by conservative social theorists as a shared set of assumptions about the world, by which individuals and communities define the nature of | reality and its epistemology, or what counts as evidence in determining this reality (Cohen, 1998, p. 1; Kuhn, 1970). A paradigm, or 'worldview', from a structural- functionalist point of view, is a learned and shared set of tacit understandings, accessible through a long process of socialization into what has euphemistically been called 'culture' by traditional Eurocentric anthropologists (Larson, 1977, p. 32). Aspects of a 30 paradigm specify how the world is divided, interconnected and known, and specify what is valued and what is not, what is good, beautiful, right, wrong or indifferent (Hahn, 1995, p. 131). A paradigm, viewed more critically, enforces compliance to unproblematized rules of conduct whereby the society's scientists know how to behave and how to judge the behavior of others (Hahn, 1995, p. 131). Conservatively, a paradigm, viewed within a 'cultural' system, has been described as having four distinct components: (1) a domain 'of knowledge or belief, or a definition of the cultural system; (2) a system of values and ideals of behavior; (3) an organized means for teaching this domain and cultural values to recruits and other participants, and (4) the setting of norms for behavior and practice by which these beliefs, values and teachings are enacted (1995, p. 132). Foucault (1977) provides more critical views of paradigms and paradigm shifts in his work. For example, in Birth of the Clinic, he illustrates how the violent social change of the French Revolution was accompanied by a new 'objective' way of viewing the body which he called 'the gaze'. Doyal (1981) has also linked biomedicine with colonialism. More recently, critical medical anthropologists argue that biomedicine is part of a coercively dominant Eurocentric paradigm (Baer, 2004; Porter, 2002), and Shiva (1997) has called it a 'monoculture of the mind'. As such, biomedicine cannot be viewed as an impartial body of knowledge, as it is clearly rooted in dominant ideological neo-colonial presuppositions associated with rules of conduct, and embedded in the societal and historical context of colonialism or the expansion of European powers into the indigenous world. Biomedicine, as with other knowledge forms, is thus open to close scrutiny. 3] In the biomedical paradigm, disease is viewed as having occurred due to a 'failure' in one of the body's parts. Treatment usually involves an attempt to 'fix' the diseased part of the body (e.g., surgery, drugs) by addressing symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the disease. The important link between mind and body is usually not a significant part of the biomedical treatment strategy, illustrating the traditional 'Cartesian split? between mind and body. It is recognized here that new so-called biopsychosocial models have emerged in mainstream biomedical approaches; however, these are not reflected in the majority of biomedical treatments. Biomedicine prevents and cures, studies and treats not persons or their bodies, but the diseases of bodies (Hahn, 1995, p. 133). Disease becomes an 'entity', an 'independent thing', such that death is viewed as 'failure' or 'defeat' (1995, pp. 134, 139). In biomedicine, shared definitions of reality are based on relatively uniform and standardized practices. Biomedicine searches for universal causal laws, claims to enact 'value-free' and empirical observation and analysis, and emphasizes the assumptions of objectivity, rationality, replicability, comparability and generalizability (Clarke, 1983, p. 72; Hahn, 1995, p. 149; Larson, 1977, p 32). Kaptchuk states: Western medicine is concerned mainly with isolatable disease categories or agents of disease, which it zeroes in on, isolates, and tries to change, control, or destroy. The Western physician starts with a symptom, then searches for the underlying mechanism\u2014a precise cause for a specific disease. The disease may affect various parts of the body, but it is a relatively well-defined, self-contained phenomenon. Precise diagnosis frames an exact, quantifiable description of a narrow area. The physician's knowledge is analytic\u2014cutting through the accumulation of bodily phenomena like a surgeon's scalpel to isolate one single entity or cause (1983, p. 4; emphasis in original). The scientific paradigm, as a consequence, facilitates the formulation of new theories and the testing of predictions that fit only within this scientific model (Patel, 1987). 32 Thomas Kuhn was a key conservative philosopher writing on the nature of paradigms, particularly as they pertained to the biomedical scientific community. According to Kuhn, problems and methods outside a particular paradigm are deemed 'illegitimate', thereby 'insulating' a scientific community from problems outside its boundaries (Kuhn, 1970). In anti-colonial terms, this can be linked to the devaluation of indigenous knowledges (Battiste, 2005). In Kuhn's sanitized language, those who follow a particular paradigm find acceptance within the community, while those who oppose the paradigm or envisage problems outside a prevailing paradigm are ostracized. Taking this point one step further, in anti-colonial terms, knowledges outside dominant Eurocentric knowledges are subjugated. Key to Kuhn's notion of a paradigm is that acceptance can 'shift' from one paradigm to another, as when the prevailing paradigm is not seen to account for certain phenomena. Kuhn called this occurrence a 'paradigm shift'. From a more critical perspective, paradigm maintenance and shifts can be seen to be part and parcel of maintaining as well as resisting, prevailing political regimes, such as with historical movements of medical dominance in the nineteenth century. \u2014 Paradigm shifts can be traced to concern with Eurocentric thought since the Enlightenment, which has long been evident in sociological writing. Weber despaired, for example, about the 'disenchantment of the world' that accompanied the move to a mechanical approach. More recently, theorists such as Berman (1981), Capra (1982), Brier (1997), Harding (1998), Wilber (1996, 1998), Shiva (1997) and Battiste (2005) have laid out how the biomedicine paradigm (BMP) emerged as one aspect of a profound paradigm shift in the way nature and the universe was perceived in the intellectual Western world. Harding has called this shift an 'epistemological crisis' of the West 33 (1998, p. 4). They critique the 'paradigm shift? from an 'organic' to 'machine-like' universe that characterizes dominant Eurocentric thought. This shift, as many historians have observed, while tracing its 'lineage' back to 2000 B.C., emerged in the sixteenth century as European powers colonized Africa and the Americas. Accompanied by the forceful subjugation of indigenous peoples and their ways of knowing, it has continued to maintain its dominance throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Battiste, 2005; Berman, 1981; Capra, 1982; Shiva, 1997). As Capra (1982, pp. 53, 54) states: The medieval outlook changed radically in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The notion of an organic, living, and spiritual universe was _ replaced by that of the world as a machine, and the world-machine became the dominant metaphor of the modern era. This development was brought about by revolutionary changes in physics and astronomy, culminating in the achievements of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. Further, Harding notes: The postcolonial science and technology histories record case after case where scientific research clearly was not intended to increase \"human\" freedom and general social welfare for the peoples Europeans encountered. Instead, its achievement was to increase the share of social benefits that accrued to small elites, those colonists who survived and prospered, and even more so, to their sponsors in Europe who were enriched by the gold, silver, platinum, and plantation profits that colonization could produce. For the great majority of participants in European expansion\u2014willing or not\u2014the Europeans' scientific and technological projects delivered increases in mortality rates and in human bondage... (1998, p. 46). In addition, Harding argues that early European sciences throughout this conceptual shift exclusively answered questions about how to improve European land and sea travel; mine newly needed ores; identify the economically useful minerals, plants, and animals of other parts of the world; manufacture and farm for the benefit of Europeans living in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and India; improve their health and occasionally that of the workers who produced profit for them; protect settlers in the colonies from settlers of other nationalities; gain access to the labour of the indigenous residents; and do all this to benefit only local European citizens.... [S}uch elements were not merely taken into European sciences as isolated 34 elements, but combined with others and transformed into new kinds of scientific and technological knowledge (1998, p. 59). Moreover, the rise of European science could not have flourished as it did without heavily borrowing from, absorbing, adulterating and altering non-European technologies from ancient and colonized civilizations from India, China, the Americas and others. Although this point will be elaborated on in later chapters as it relates to CAM and IHC, it is crucially important to note that the conceptual shift accompanied European colonial endeavours, and that each was and is linked to the other. As Harding states: Local scientific and technological ideas for navigation, cartography, agricultural development, manufacturing, pharmacology, and other ways of dealing with local environments and peoples were borrowed from non-European cultures and incorporated into European projects, many of which were intended to decrease the economic and political power of the peoples Europeans encountered. Thus, the fruits of their own scientific and technological traditions were turned against them (1998, p. 49). As noted above, Weber, and Schiller a century earlier, understood this shift as 'the disenchantment of the world' (die Entzauberung der 'disgodding of nature', die Entgotterung der Natur (Berman, 1981, p. 69). Some theorists associate this phenomenon with the ascendancy of Eurocentric science (e.g., Berman, Capra), while others emphasize the subjugation of colonized ways of knowing (e.g., Harding, Shiva). Although colonial endeavours began 100 years earlier, the major conceptual 'shift? began in 1543 A.D. with what has been called the 'Copernican Revolution' \u2014 the publishing upon his death of Nicolas Copernicus' treatise on the place of 'mankind' in the world. Contrary to the Bible, Copernicus proposed that the world was not the centre of the universe, but one planet among others that circle the sun. Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei further supported and validated the Copernican hypothesis, by developing empirical laws of planetary motion, and by proposing the laws of falling bodies, thereby 35 constructing a mathematical description of nature composed of measured and quantified - material bodies and objects. Capra (1982, p. 55) comments: To make it possible for scientists to describe nature mathematically, Galileo postulated that they should restrict themselves to studying the essential properties of material bodies \u2014 shapes, numbers, and movement \u2014 which could be measured and quantified. Other properties, like color, sound, taste, or smell, were merely subjective mental projections which should be excluded from the domain of science. Francis Bacon continued the efforts of previous philosopher-scientists by developing his 'inductive' method of conducting experiments and drawing conclusions, and developing his now notorious patriarchal view (and foundational philosophy) of nature as a feminine form that needed to be dominated and controlled to 'yield up' her answers or 'secrets' (Berman, 1981, p. 28). Ren\u00e9 D\u00e9scartes continued the development of Western scientific thought, with his main goal to distinguish 'truth from error' in all fields of inquiry (Capra, 1982, p. 57), by viewing the 'key' to the universe as a 'machine' constructed of parts governed by laws; and his conception of the separation of the human mind from the body. Cartesian dualism asserts that physical 'bodies' exist in space, subject to mechanical laws, while 'minds' exist elsewhere in an isolated realm (Cohen, 1998). Berman suggests that while Bacon and D\u00e9scartes represented 'twin poles' of epistemology, D\u00e9scartes' goal to measure the universe using universal mathematics helped to realize Bacon's goal of 'testing nature' (1981, p. 29). As Capra further states: The division between mind and matter led to a view of the universe as a mechanical system consisting of separate objects, which in turn were reduced to fundamental material building blocks whose properties and interactions were thought to completely determine all natural phenomena. This Cartesian view of nature was further extended to living organisms, which were regarded as machines constructed from separate parts (1982, pp. 40, 57). 36 Isaac Newton, with his grand synthesis of Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon, Galileo and D\u00e9scartes, developed a complete mathematical formation of the mechanistic view of nature in 1642. In addition to his construction of the concept of gravity, Newton developed general laws of motion that he envisaged as governing all objects in the solar system, with the world as a 'perfect machine'. Newtonian physics constructs the universe as consisting of fundamental building blocks made of matter. Unlike the world of spirits described in Foucault, the motions and interactions of all material bodies in a Newtonian universe obey a few simple laws; the universe is viewed as an immense, sophisticated clock, where whirring objects follow predetermined courses (Cohen, 1998). As Berman (1981, p. 41) explains: By the time of Newton's death in 1727, the educated European had a conception of the cosmos, and of the nature of \"right thinking\", which was entirely different from that of his counterpart of a century before. He now regarded the earth as revolving around the sun, not the reverse; believed that all phenomena were constituted of atoms, or corpuscles, in motion and susceptible to mathematical description; and saw the solar system as a vast machine, held together by the forces of gravity. He had a precise notion of experiment (or at least paid lip service to it), and a new notion of what constituted acceptable evidence and proper explanation. He lived in a predictable, comprehensible, yet (in his own mind) very exciting sort of world. For in terms of material control, the world was beginning to exhibit an infinite horizon and endless opportunities. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the former called the 'Age of Enlightment', the mechanistic model influenced and shaped all sciences and social sciences, including physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and psychology. While the Newtonian universe was soon to be challenged by new discoveries in physics and in evolutionary theory, all phenomena in the natural and social world were viewed with one dominant reductionistic-mechanistic worldview. As already briefly touched upon above, this worldview was realized and affirmed in many scientific discoveries. Brier (1997, p. 113) states: 37 The idea of a purely objective (empirical-mathematical) knowledge appears to be inherent in the basic philosophy of modern science, as Galileo formulated it. By insisting that the exploration of the world is in itself good, that the major qualities of nature can be revealed by measurement, that mathematics is nature's language and finally that nature is basically composed of indivisible lumps of matter, atoms, the foundation was laid for an unhampered hunt for knowledge in and behind nature and for the conviction that true knowledge was not only revealed in books, but existed in nature itself (original emphasis). The twentieth century drew on the nineteenth century Newtonian-Cartesian constructions to develop advances in drugs and vaccines for infectious diseases (e.g., polio; tetanus; diphtheria; malaria); antibiotics; psychoactive drugs; and drugs that regulate biological diseases such as insulin for diabetes. As noted, the biomedical model eclipsed other theories of health related to environmental aspects of illness. Thus as many theorists have argued, 'discoveries' from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries enshrined a singular worldview that discounted social, psychological, spiritual, environmental, and other ways of viewing and interacting with the world and universe. This 'paradigm' shift and its dominance affected all fields of inquiry. In sum, due to historical and philosophical movements aided by colonialism, by 1960, allopathic biomedicine was at the height of its professional and ideological dominance (Coburn, 1993; Harding, 1998). In 1960 in Canada, it has been argued that biomedicine had become a 'private government', in that medicine directly wrote health care state-policy (e.g., through the 'group of seven', a powerful group of physician- politicians) and that health care bureaucracies were staffed by medical experts from the 'top down' (Coburn, 1993). Medicine ruled its own occupation and had the power to exclude, limit, or subordinate other health occupations such as chiropractic and nursing (Coburn, 1993). 38 2.6 The Decline of Biomedical Dominance? During the 1960s, many rich industrialized countries including Canada began to radically restructure their health care systems, and the power of biomedicine was challenged in a fundamental way. According to neoliberal discourse, the main reason for this restructuring was a global fiscal 'crisis' resulting from heavy expenditures on health care and social services, where the state had completely provided for health, education and welfare (Burke & Stevenson, 1993). This was part of a worldwide 'decline of the welfare state' (Teeple, 2000). Paralleling my arguments about the rise of medical dominance discussed above, I argue that there were major developments that signaled the decline of the relative power of the medical profession in Canada. With the implementation of national health insurance across Canada in 1971, the structure of biomedicine changed, such that the profession was no longer primarily in control of national health care. While the implementation of medicare did not initially lead to the decline of medical power, it could be argued that the 'infiltration' of the state 'back into' medicine created a structural inequality whereby medicine no longer held the 'reins' of power, which ultimately led to significant restructuring of medicine and health care (Burke & Stevenson, 1993, p. 57; Coburn, 1993; Coburn, Rappolt, & Bourgeault, 1997). The profession of medicine could be viewed as having experienced the 'death' its former guild power (Krause, 1996). It is important here to briefly review the nature of the welfare state and its contradictory impact on the profession of medicine. The welfare state, from a neo- Marxist perspective, was created by the state to address a gap in the provision of social 39 services created by capitalism, and which ultimately guarantees the continued production of labour, capital and class conflict. Capitalism, for example, disrupted the function of | the traditional family which provided for the needs of vulnerable individuals such as children and the elderly. Teeple (2000, p. 15) defines a welfare state as: a capitalist society in which the state has intervened in the form of social policies, programs, standards, and regulations in order to mitigate class conflict and to provide for, answer, or accommodate certain social needs for which the capitalist mode of production in itself has no solution or makes no provision. Among the many aspects of the welfare state in a capitalist society, the welfare state prepares the working class for the labour market by providing for aspects such as health care, education and child care. It also regulates the labour market by ensuring an 'adequate' labour supply through policies governing minimum wage and hours of work. Class conflict is minimized by allowing for collective bargaining (e.g., unions). The state also provides for the 'after-productive' life in the form of old-age pensions (Teeple, 2000, p. 15). The creation of the welfare state in capitalist societies, as many have pointed out, further represents a paradox or contradiction between resistance to capitalist modes of production (by protecting the working classes) and maintaining capitalism by protecting labour and capital (Teeple, 2000, p. 21). As Quadagno (1987, p. 114) states: Workers must accept the legitimacy of the capitalist system because a sufficient level of profitability and investment ensures an economic surplus that can be used to initiate welfare benefits. Capitalists, in turn, accept the need for basic wages and welfare state expenditures because these benefits ensure a healthy and complacent working class. Thus, public social benefits represent a real gain for the working class, even though welfare programmes also benefit capital. The 'modern' welfare state has been termed the 'Keynesian' welfare state (K WS) after the economist John Maynard Keynes, and can be viewed as a historically situated 40 welfare state development between approximately 1945 and 1973 (Teeple, 2000, >. 17). The Keynesian welfare state was primarily created in an era of post-war economic prosperity, characterized by increased public welfare expenditures (Quadagno, 1987, p. 109). Social programmes were transformed into comprehensive systems of universal benefits, such as in the development of the Canadian health care insurance system, in part to address the changing social needs of an expanding working class (Teeple, 2000, p. 26). The primary motive of the Keynesian welfare state, according to Teeple, was to avoid the extremes of previous business cycles such as in the 1930s, and ultimately to assist with capital accumulation and sustained growth of the Gross National Product (2000, p. 36). Vivienne Walters (1980) argues that its primary purpose was to reduce class conflict. As I will argue later, the welfare state entrenched biomedicine as the dominant healing profession from which citizens could choose. Thus the welfare state exclusively supported the profession of medicine. In the mid-1970s, however, the Keynesian welfare state began to decline. There exist various theories and explanations for its decline, such as the conservative economic explanation of 'excessive government spending', and high inflation. Teeple also argues, however, that it was primarily falling rates of national economic growth and decaying national infrastructure\u2014the beginnings of globalization\u2014that ultimately sparked its decline. Capital began to be 'denationalized', characterized by a high degree of productive capacity such that it had no 'national home' (Teeple, 2000, p. 51; see also Amin, 1997). The creation of global capital was facilitated by growing corporate trade and investment oversees, where multinational corporations began shifting operations out of 41 their home country, facilitated by 'advanced Fordism' and changes in technology (computers; telecommunications). Multinational corporations, in this process, also began shifting to transnational corporations as their production expanded completely from domestic to international markets. As Teeple states: The globalization of finance means that enormous sums of capital can be shifted around the world with unprecedented speed, reaching out to investments with the highest rates of return and entering activities of a purely speculative nature. It means that goods and services can be produced and distributed globally, independent of national sources of, or restrictions on, capital; national markets can be profoundly influenced by movements of capital free of national interest. With the power and enormity of global financial resources, these goods, services, and capital break through all nationally bounded markets, forcing nations to harmonize policies with the demands of global movement of commodities and capital. The decline of national jurisdiction over monetary and fiscal policies renders the national state into a local minister of global affairs (2000, pp. 67-68). By the late 1980s, Keynesianism had shifted to 'monetarism' characterized by the internationalization of capital, where the Keynesian welfare state was no longer needed to reproduce national labour (Teeple, 2000, p. 79). Monetarism, in turn, further enshrined a neo-liberal philosophy and the 'ideal' of a 'free-market'. It is here that the current wave of 'privatization of the public' can be located. Thus, from a critical perspective, the implementation of health care and the later overt state 'take-over' of scientific medicine, driven by globalization, eventually led to curtailing medicine's power and the widespread rationalization and restructuring of health care. These changes can be found in state-legislation in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in Ontario: (1) medical review committees were implemented to monitor physicians' fee claims; (2) in 1986, there was banning of physicians' extra-billing fees; (3) The 1989 Independent Health Facilities Act regulated the expansion of health care 42 facilities outside of hospitals; (4) the establishment of explicit guidelines for medical practices, undermining physicians' exclusive claims to expertise; (5) the establishment in 1991 of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, whose mandate is to analyze the services of physicians; (6) the 1993 'hard-cap' on physicians' payments from government; and (7) government refusal to fund new technologies and efforts to decrease medical school admittance (Burke & Stevenson, 1993; Coburn, 1993; Coburn et al., 1997). Thus, keeping in mind Freidson's (1970) four main elements of medical dominance, it can be argued that medicine could be viewed as having lost control of the terms and conditions or context of 'medical work', and in the process having lost significant economic and political autonomy. In the 1970s and early 1980s, self-help, consumer-oriented and feminist health movements began to develop, and began to challenge previously-held medical definitions of health and treatment options. As Baer (2004) argues, these movements were also synonymous with the 'holistic health' and \"New Age' movements that foreshadowed the re-emergence of the CAM professions in the late twentieth century (discussed at the end of this chapter). This challenge led to the partial loss of medicine's control over clients, or de-professionalization, in that patients were actively seeking health options outside of the traditional medical framework and were educating themselves about conventional biomedicine. In the 1990s, the increasing state regulation of the health care division of labour led to the professionalization of 24 previously unregulated health professions in Ontario, including chiropractic and midwifery in the Health Professions Legislation Review (Coburn et al., 1997). The Review was initially due to public pressure arising from 43 complaints criticising what were viewed as 'overlapping' health services, such as the work of midwives in the community and hospital births. Over eight years, the Review consulted with hundreds of professional interest groups, and finally reported its recommendations in 1990. The 24 out of 75 professions that were selected included such alternative therapies as midwifery, chiropractic and massage therapy, in addition to allopathic occupations (Coburn,1993). The legislation challenged biomedical control over health professions and required that each profession, in addition to professional associations, have their own governing bodies or colleges. It should be noted, however, that not all alternative or competing health occupations, such as homeopathy, naturopathy, or TCM were included in the legislation. It can be argued, however, that in effect, medicine had, for the first time since approximately 100 years earlier, lost control over other health care occupations in the health care division of labour. 2.7. Perspectives on the 'Fall' of Medical Dominance Critical theoretical perspectives provide a framework for understanding the occurrence of these developments. First, a neo-Marxist framework suggests that in the interests of capitalist profit and expansion, an external state, following capitalist interests in globalization, gradually withdrew support for the profession of biomedicine. Increasing healthcare costs, increasing numbers of physicians, and increased patient utilization of health services were throwing the health care system into 'crisis' (Coburn & Rappolt, 1999). This perspective also proposes a 'logic of medicare' that necessitates government rationalization of health care due to the open-ended nature of health care insurance (Burke & Stevenson, 1993, p. 53). These changes led to the further 44 'proletarianization' of medicine, which was also eroded by the processes of 'bureaucratization' and 'deprofessionalization' (McKinlay & Arches, 1985). Proletarianization theory was initially formulated in the 1970s, and is most associated with the work of John McKinlay and his colleagues in the United States (Annandale, 1998, p. 225). McKinlay defines the proletarianization of physicians as \"the process by which an occupational category is divested of control over certain prerogatives relating to the location, content, and essentially of its task activities, thereby subordinating it to the broader requirements of production under advanced capitalism\" (McKinlay & Stoeckle, 1994, p. 200). The basic argument is that proletarianization follows the logic of capitalist expansion, such that all workers, including professionals, will eventually be absorbed into the 'mass' of workers, and through this process, will be stripped of their control over the terms and conditions of their work and reduced to proletarian status (Annandale, 1998, p. 225). A common example found in the proletarianization literature notes that the doctors' 'little black bag' of years ago has now been replaced. In its place in the United States are large-scale organizations such as | health maintenance organizations that are driven by profit. Further, new technologies and increasingly complex organizational structures have evolved (Annandale, 1998, p. 225). Physicians, it is argued, have now been incorporated into large-scale bureaucracies that have gradually taken control over their work, relegating them to salaried positions. It is argued that physicians work in the service of capital, selling their labour power on the market in much the same way as any other worker. As Annandale argues, however, for many sociologists of the professions, \"it takes a great leap of faith to define physicians as members of the proletariat\" (1998, p. 226). 45 Navarro (1989) asserts, for example, that unlike physicians, proletarian labourers do not have the kinds of skills that need to be credentialled by the state, do not supervise others, and have control over neither the means nor the organization of production. Indeed, physicians seem far from the image of the proletarianized worker who is powerless to shape the nature of the product or process of work. In contrast to proletarianization theory, Freidson and others argue that full proletarianization of physicians is unlikely to occur because of the power that is invested in medical expertise. Similarly, one can argue that the implementation of ever-more complex medical technology will only cement exclusive medical knowledge (Freidson, 1985). Thus there is a 'strong' versus 'weak' proletarianization debate (e.g., Murphy, 1990), where the 'strong' argument refers to the complete proletarianization of medicine and physicians, and the 'weak' argument refers to the moderate proletarianization of physicians and medicine. McKinlay and Arches (1985) argue further that the proletarianization of biomedicine is a direct result of bureaucratization, which is a result of capitalist expansion. Bureaucratization may be defined loosely as a complex grouping of expectations, rules and regulations in societal organizations and professions, with the main overarching goal of exercising social control in the interests of capitalist profit: \"Capitalism, especially in its advanced monopoly form, requires and promotes hierarchical bureaucratic structures in order to maintain control over workers, to protect and fulfill its own perogatives (capital accumulation), as well as to contribute to the efficiency of production\" (McKinlay & Arches, 1985, p. 172, original emphasis). As such, bureaucratization is viewed as reducing competition, though it stems from the development of capitalism. Various processes such as hospital-based health care, 46 physician dependence on technology, physician specialization and deskilling (loss of control over technology/knowledge), increasingly specialized medical knowledge, for- profit hospitals and health maintenance organizations, the 'demystification' of medicine, and the emergence of paraprofessional health workers, it is argued, are gradually contributing to the proletarianization of physicians in particular and the profession of medicine in general (Coburn et al., 1983; McKinlay & Arches, 1985). But it can also be suggested that with the so-called state take-over of biomedicine in Canada, the biomedical paradigm did not weaken, but was strengthened and further enforced. The state regulation of several CAM professions in Ontario could be viewed as the state's attempt to control or subsume these CAM professions, in the process molding them further to the dominant biomedical paradigm. For example, increased legislation for some alternative health occupations in Ontario has not been without consequences. Mandated by the Health Disciplines Act, each college is required to have 40 per cent of the governing council of the colleges as lay members (Coburn, 1993, pp. 129-38). The colleges were designed to be part of a system of organizations with lay input, and to be responsive to quasi-state influence in some respects and direct state control. Asa consequence, the colleges' powers have narrowed in that they are now directly answerable to state authority and public opinion (Coburn, 1993). Thus, the gaining of power by competing health occupations also ironically led to greater state control of them through regulatory bodies, and autonomy became 'relative' to state control. The original establishment of national health care in Canada, as I have argued above, could be viewed as the governance of populations by the widespread endorsement of the biomedical model. 47 As noted above, there is an anti-colonial theoretical perspective that can be used to contextualize the occurrence of global capitalism and the widespread acceptance of the biomedical paradigm as part of a new world phenomenon. This is Vandana Shiva's thesis regarding what she terms 'monocultures of the mind', or the dominance of Eurocentric thought (Shiva, 1993). Shiva's concept is similar to the idea of the 'McDonald-ization of the world', although Shiva, physicist, philosopher and feminist ecologist, develops this concept much further. Shiva states: [D]ominant scientific knowledge thus breeds a monoculture of the mind by making space for local alternatives to disappear, very much like monocultures of introduced plant varieties leading to the displacement and destruction of local diversity... [B]y elevating itself above society and other knowledge systems from the domain of reliable and systematic knowledge, the dominant system creates its exclusive monopoly (1993, p. 12). Shiva argues that local knowledge disappears through its interaction with dominant Eurocentric knowledge; and that local knowledges are subjugated simply by negating their very existence (1993, p. 9). Dominant 'bioscientific' knowledge appears universal, but it is in fact a globalized version of a local knowledge made global through its colonization of other equally valid knowledges. Dominant knowledge is viewed as inherently superior to local knowledge, which is viewed as 'primitive' and 'unscientific'. Drawing on Shiva, it could be argued that her concept of 'monocultures of the mind' is illustrated by the relationship between biomedicine and CAM. In its heyday, biomedicine can be viewed as a 'monoculture' that has invaded both Western and non- Western countries alike, suppressing and colonizing alternative/indigenous health ideologies and practices. Following Shiva, I argue that complementary/ alternative medicine may be subjugated to, or assimilated/appropriated by, a dominant biomedical paradigm that could make CAM simply 'disappear', thereby eliminating diversity. As is 48 generally the case for indigenous knowledges, from which many CAM practices derive in North America, CAM is often viewed by the scientific biomedical community as 'primitive' and 'unscientific'. In sum, the role of medicine as a profession can be seen to have changed from an autonomous to relatively proletarianized profession in recent years. CAM occupations in North America, during the same period, have moved from almost complete marginalization, particularly in the area of clinical autonomy, to a wider degree of independence through client and state support. Thus, reviewing historical developments with regard to CAM and biomedicine (both within the last 30 years and the last 100 years), reveals a trend back to a situation in which biomedicine is one of many competing health occupations in the health care division of labour. Similarly, competing health occupations have now regained at least some of their former autonomy as in the nineteenth century. The question remains as to whether biomedicine now maintains its control in other ways, such as reinforcing the biomedical paradigm through health care insurance and biomedical technology in non-Western countries. 2.8 The 'Rise' of Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) and 'Integrative' Health Care (HC) In the early-to-mid-1980s, competing or 'alternative' health occupations to conventional biomedicine began to re-establish themselves in North America. For example, community nurses previously completely subordinate to medicine, began to practice independently (Coburn, 1988). Midwives in Ontario, the most biomedically dominant jurisdiction, began to gain recognition in traditional and non-invasive birthing practices. Other drugless healers, such as chiropractors, continued to gain legitimacy. 49 One may argue that this period of resurgence in 'alternative' competing health occupations marks the beginning of the questioning of biomedicine, and its near- exclusive right to determine how medical care is delivered (Coburn, 1988). As Baer (2004, pp. xi-xii) contends, although varying by country, the re-emergence of the CAM professions can be seen partly as under the 'umbrella' of the holistic and self-help movements in industrialized countries such as the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany and The Netherlands. As Baer notes (2004, p. xi), throughout the 1980s, some of the CAM professions re-emerged and were re-recognized (e.g., homeopathy). In contrast to the biomedical paradigm, many CAM therapies stem from non- biomedical, indigenous or 'holistic' paradigms, which incorporate nonmechanistic, nonreductionist understanding of health and illness (Cohen, 1998, p. 4). Health is viewed on four levels: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Ill-health is viewed as illness, rather than disease, and is concerned with more than simply the poor functioning of bio- physiological processes. CAM therapies often base notions of health on concepts such as 'energy', 'holism' and 'harmony'; treat illness as unique to the individual rather than to all human bodies; and recognize and value personal or 'subjective' models of illness causation (Patel, 1987, pp. 669-78). In these paradigms, health involves not only physiological health and the absence of disease, but also psychological and spiritual well- being. Illness in a holistic paradigm is the result of a complex web of interrelated factors on the four levels, viewed as imbalances, versus a single reductionist cause. Treatment approaches usually attempt to address one or more of these imbalances, by treating the 50 root cause of the illness in addition to the prevailing symptoms, such as in homeopathy. In contrast to the biomedical physician, Kaptchuk states, for example: The Chinese physician ... directs his or her attention to the complete physiological and psychological individual. All relevant information, including the symptom as well as the patient's other general characteristics, is gathered and woven together until it forms what Chinese medicine calls a \"pattern of disharmony\" (1983, p. 4). As of 2005, there are literally hundreds of alternative forms of medicine across North America and Europe, ranging from re-established therapies such as homeopathy, osteopathy and naturopathy to ancient healing systems such as traditional Chinese \"medicine, and even more esoteric or spiritual therapies such as reiki and sound therapy. 'Holistic clinics', offering multiple CAM practices, seem to be on every street corner. Moreover, complementary/alternative therapies, as they become more widespread, are fast becoming 'conventional' therapies, replacing their 'alternative' label. The rise of alternative health occupations seems to have been further aided by internal fragmentation within the medical community, led by physicians who favour the decentralization of technology and expertise (Coburn et al., 1983). This raises the question of which tradition is appropriating which. Part and parcel of this biomedical shift has been what has been called the 'interdisciplinary model for the multicausality of disease' or the 'biopsychosocial model'. The new model goes beyond a biological etiology for disease and recognizes the importance of social and cultural etiologies in the definition and treatment of illness (Kleinman, 1988; Turner, 1990). An example of the internal fragmentation of biomedicine is illustrated by the appearance of what are called 'complementary physicians'-\u2014physicians who, alongside - their medical practice, also practice and support one or more alternative therapies such as 31 acupuncture. For example, the Canadian Complementary Medicine Association (CCMA), distinct and independent from the CMA, was established in 1996 to support complementary physicians, and to protect them from harassment from medical colleges. In the United States, the American Holistic Medical Association was created in 1978 with the main goal to licence 'holistic physicians' practicing various CAM therapies, and now has increasing presence in the United States. And, of most significance for my research, new 'integrative' clinical settings have arisen, combining aspects of both biomedicine and CAM (Faass, 2001). Differing from holistic clinics, these 'settings' often involve multiple biomedical and CAM practitioners treating patients in a shared clinical practice. As stated earlier, however, major questions exist concerning the nature of these environments. Further, in light of the above theoretical discussions, there are questions about what kind of integration is actually occurring. As Baer argues, the development of the labels of 'integrated/integrative' medicine and/or health care combining biomedicine and CAM marks a new shift from the holistic health movement of the 1980s. He suggests, however, that the 'new' integrative movement could merely be a 'biomedical construction' and \"nationally based dominative medical system under which biomedicine exerts hegemonic influence\" (1989, p. Xix). As this review of historical developments of the biomedical and CAM professions has shown, the rise of the biomedical profession was characterized by CAM (non- allopathic) professions either a) merging with biomedicine; b) being absorbed and/or appropriated by biomedicine; or c) declining and becoming extinct (and perhaps at times a combination of all three) (Baer, 2004). As the CAM professions have re-emerged, they 52 now also represent 'parallel' forms of medicine. The question remains, however, as to whether or not the above three historical trends will begin to occur again with the development of integrative health care. As Kaptchuk and Miller ask: Whose worldview is expressed in \"integrated\" medicine? Whose worldview is excluded? Does integrated medicine include Navaho chanting in a New York City hospital or crystals and pyramids at an academic health center? Who decides? On what basis are decisions made between competing worldviews and standards of evidence (2005, p. 289)? Questioning the emergence of a new 'medical pluralism', Cant and Sharma ask, \"will the impetus to 'integration' simply lead to the incorporation of certain holistic healing modes into the biomedical clinic without any concession of authority by the latter\" (1999, p. 157)? 53 Chapter 3 METHODOLOGY The methods for gathering information in this research included in-depth qualitative interviews, ethnographic observation, and document analysis. These qualitative methods are an integral part of critical ethnography, which guided my microsociological research in integrative health care settings. Critical ethnography draws on a critical social science perspective (or 'CSSP') that involves moving beyond traditional naturalistic ethnographic methods by applying critical theoretical concepts. Critical social science research is based on an epistemology that constantly strives to interpret historically specific and often oppressive social relations. Rather than accepting dominant conceptual frameworks and/or ideology, the goal is to engage dominant viewpoints in order to illuminate their constitutive processes and practices\u2014 what Smith calls the 'ruling apparatus' (1987, p. 108). By focussing on the institutions that legitimate knowledge, critical social research asks \"how ideology or history conceals the processes which oppress and control people\" (Harvey, 1990, p. 6). It is \"intrinsically critical', and assumes that critical processes inform knowledge (Harvey, 1990, p. 6). Critical social research now takes many forms in varying disciplines (e.g., anthropology, sociology, psychology, women's studies, community health). The term 'critical' has been critiqued by some for being over-used, too heterogeneous, politically- activist and 'epistemologically ungrounded' (Hammersley, 1995). I suggest, however, that a well-rounded critical approach is useful in my study because it values heterogeneity; that activist-informed research with the goal of illuminating oppressive 54 social structures is a valid approach; and that its epistemology is in fact grounded by its critical relation with local and dominant knowledges. While arguing against accepting a 'false unity' of critical theory, theorists Kincheloe and McLaren (1994) suggest that certain basic assumptions do exist, for example: that all thought is fundamentally mediated by power relations that are social and historically constituted; that facts can never be isolated from the domain of values or removed from some form of ideological inscription; that the relationship between concept and object and between signifier and signified is never stable or fixed and is often mediated by the social relations of capitalist production and consumption; that language is central to the formation of subjectivity (conscious and unconscious awareness); ... that oppression has many faces and that focusing on only one at the expense of others (e.g., class oppression versus racism) elides the interconnections among them... (1994, pp. 139-140). As briefly noted in Chapter One, if research is to be called 'critical', it must further be concerned with the empowerment of individuals, and be transformative. As Kincheloe and McLaren state: Inquiry that aspires to the name critical must be connected to an attempt to confront the injustice of a particular society or sphere within the society. Research thus becomes a transformative endeavor unembarrassed by the label \"political\" and unafraid to consummate a relationship with an emancipatory consciousness. Whereas traditional researchers cling to the guard rail of neutrality, critical researchers frequently announce their partisanship in the struggle for a better world. Traditional researchers see their task as the description, interpretation, or reanimation of a slice of reality, whereas critical researchers often regard their work as a first step toward forms of political action that can redress the injustices found in the field site or constructed in the very act of research itself (1994, p. 140). In addition to practical forms of emancipation that may lead directly to observable change (e.g., enforcing labour rights), emancipatory transformation may also occur with a change in the researcher's worldview, marked by the research 'exposing contradictions' (Kincheloe & McLaren, 1994, p. 140). Along with critical realism, critical researchers 55 accept firmly that \"ideologies are not simply deceptive and imaginary mental relations that individuals and groups live out relative to their material conditions of existence, but are also very much inscribed in the materiality of social and institutional practices\" (Kincheloe & McLaren, 1994, p. 140). Yet, critical ethnography also differs from such post-positivist realist statements as 'the world exists completely independently of our knowledge of it' and that 'all social phenomena must be constantly evaluated positivistically in order for a critical stance to be maintained'. A critical ethnographic methodology was chosen as particularly suited for the study, as integrative health care settings involve complex social processes and experiences located in power relations. This approach will yield a unique view of IHC as there appear to have been no previous critical studies examining these microprocesses in IHC settings. This research involved an examination and analysis of three IHC settings. These multiple 'cases' were theoretically positioned to represent a diverse spectrum of IHC situations. 3.1 Critical Ethnography Ethnography was traditionally used by nineteenth and early-to-mid twentieth century structural linguistically-oriented anthropologists to provide large-scale descriptions and 'grand-narratives' of third world societies and cultures (e.g., Levi- Strauss; Malinowski). As Clifford states: \"The predominant mode of modern fieldwork authority is signaled: 'You are there ... because I was there'\" (Clifford, 1988, p. 22). Ethnographies, when read, were meant to convey by the anthropologist a certain form of authority to the reader: 56 During this period a particular form of authority was created\u2014an authority both scientifically validated and based on a unique personal experience. During the 1920s Malinowski played a central role in establishing credit for the fieldworker, and we should recall in this light his attacks on the competence of competitors in the field (Clifford, 1988, p. 26). For example, as Clifford describes, the early anthropologist Malinowski \"was greatly concerned with the rhetorical problem of convincing his readers that the facts he was putting before them were objectively acquired, not subjective creations\" (1988, p. 29). Further, as Clifford notes: the authority of the academic fieldworker-theorist was established in the years between 1920 and 1950. This peculiar amalgam of intense personal experience and scientific analysis (understood in this period as both \"rite of passage\" and \"Jaboratory\") emerged as a method (1988, p. 34). Later anthropologists acknowledged that this style of ethnography did not problematize the dominance of the ethnographer and was historically limited. Worse, early ethnographies reproduced Eurocentric discourses. These treated so-called 'primitive' societies as inferior in their attempt to explain 'foreign' socio-cultural practices. As Clifford argues, during the years 1900 to 1960: a new conception of field research established itself as the norm for European and American anthropology. Intensive fieldwork, pursued by university-trained specialists, emerged as a privileged, sanctioned source of data about exotic peoples (1988, p. 24). These neo-colonial practices have been further critiqued by theorists such as Edward Said (1979) as a form of 'Orientalism', or the paternalist privileges unhesitatingly assumed by Western writers who \"speak for\" a mute Orient or reconstitute its decayed or dismembered \"truth\", who lament the passing of its authenticity, and who know more than its mere natives ever can (Clifford, 1988, p. 258). Further, and perhaps equally problematic, was the criticism that traditional ethnography did not recognize the inherent structural forces that shaped both the anthropologist and 57 the society or culture under study. Today, debates continue concerning whether or not ethnography can systematically describe complex social organization, and informants' meanings, without linking these meanings to wider social structures. Yet, critically- informed anthropologistts such as Clifford recognize that while 'ethnography is interpretation', [i]t becomes necessary to conceive of ethnography not as the experience and interpretation of a circumscribed \"other\" reality, but rather as a constructive negotiation involving at least two, and usually more, conscious, politically significant subjects. Paradigms of experience and interpretation are yielding to discursive paradigms of dialogue and polyphony (1988, p. 41). In response to the above debates, critical ethnography developed by drawing on critical social research to argue that social actions are, in essence, an aspect of patterned social structures and systems of power relationships (Harvey, 1990; Porter, 2002; Smith, 1987). As Smith states: The conditions of our action and experience are organized by relations and processes outside them and beyond our power of control. The everyday world is not fully understandable within its own scope. It is organized by social relations not fully apparent in it nor contained in it. This is the social organization of the sociological problematic in the actual work and practices of real individuals (1987, p. 92). In fact, both Durkheim and Weber recognized that ethnographic material can tell us something beyond the particular experiences of individuals. Thus, critical ethnography suggests that while certain notions of 'reality' may depend on perceptions, as noted earlier reality is also shaped by the capacity of certain social relations to have effects outside or alongside that of perception. As Kincheloe and McLaren emphasize: \"a significant aspect of the critical research process involves challenging the ideological assumptions that inform the interpretation of their experiences ... critical theoretical research must never be allowed to confirm simply what we already know\" (1994, p. 149). 58 My approach in this research conforms to what can be called a modified 'critical realist' ethnography that suggests that both the phenomenological understanding of subjective meanings of individuals, and the postmodern caution in making absolute truth claims must be incorporated into critical ethnography. Critical ethnography allows for the possibility of generalization in moderation while accepting at the same time that there is a 'reality' beyond individuals. Further, since reality is historically-shaped and situated, claims about how much one can know about this reality must be tempered, as must claims about the degree to which a form of external reality can 'control' the decisions of individuals. This type of ethnography bridges the gap between interpretation and social relations, which is what I am intending to do in this research. Ethnographic techniques are used to 'go beyond' surface appearances, where subjects' meanings are not the 'end of the story' (Harvey, 1990, p. 12). Harvey states: The role of the critical ethnographer is to keep alert to the structural factors while probing meanings: to explore, where possible, the inconsistencies between action and words in terms of structural factors; to see to what extent group processes are externally mediated; to investigate how the subjects see group norms and practices constrained by external social factors; to see how prevailing ideologies are addressed; to analyse the extent to which subversive or resistant practices transcend prevailing ideological forms; and so on.... Critical ethnography requires the location of interesting social microcosms in wider structural forms. It also requires that the understanding of these structural forms is mediated by the closely observed detail of social practices and the meanings they encompass (1990, pp. 12-13). [emphasis added] The social world, Porter suggests, is an open system. Thus, in contrast to the experimental notion of cause-and-effect variables inherent in much of the CAM literature, critical realist ethnography replaces this concept with the 'notion of tendencies'. Tendencies consist of 'structures of relations' (Porter, 2002, p. 62). This approach also addresses oppression by examining whether or not these relations 59 \"promote or constrain the human freedom and dignity of those involved in them\" (Porter, 2002, p. 63). The role of social science then, from a critical point of view, is \"not only to uncover the structuring of relations, but also to use that information as the basis for informed action to remove the sources of structural oppression\" (Porter, 2002, p. 63). The role of critical ethnography is thus twofold. First, it is used as a method to uncover interactions of the social world, which are then theorized to infer the structural conditioning of those interactions. Second, this type of ethnography is used to explore the consequences or effects of these structures on social relations. As Porter describes, Rather than confining its focus to individual experience, or rejecting the notion of knowledge altogether, critical realism is able to use ethnographic data to illuminate structured relations, and beyond that, to show how these relations may be oppressive and to point to the sort of actions required to make them less oppressive (2002, p. 65). As Porter notes, the social world is a complex and often contradictory place, consisting of multi-layered social situations. As a result, the ethnographer/researcher must have a clear picture of the interactions of individuals, both at the level of action, and of motivation. This 'picture' is obtained by using social science techniques for collecting information, such as ethnographic observation and interviews. Ethnography, ina critical sense, also requires theoretical concepts to help to explain why individual interactions take on certain patterns over others. Finally, the ethnographer must accept the existence of structured but non-determining social relations. Kincheloe and McLaren also emphasize the link between qualitative research methods in ethnography and the use of these methods for emancipation. For example, they state: workers can use qualitative research to uncover the way power operates to construct their everyday commonsense knowledge and undermine their autonomy 60 as professionals. As they explore the market-driven objectives that shape the ways their jobs are defined, workers can begin to see themselves in relation to the world around them, and to perceive the workplace as a site within larger economies of power and privilege. Such explorations can serve as invitations to workers to understand both the way the workplace is \"governed\" by a top-down series of directives and the way power is utilized on a day-to-day basis. They come to see the language of the marketplace as a tradition of mediation that defines whose knowledge is most legitimate and whose voices count the most (Kincheloe & McLaren, 1994, pp. 146-147). It is here, also, that what can be called a form of 'modified emancipation' differs from the realist concept of certain pragmatic, and indeed 'logical', solutions to inequities. As Kincheloe and McLaren argue: 3.2 The narrative of emancipation is not forsaken, but it no longer becomes a determining master narrative. Rather, it takes the form of a contingent foundation out of which further dialogue can develop that is attentive to the contextual specificity of the local and the overdetermining characteristics of larger institutional and social structures. Further, critical researchers understand that individual identity and human agency form such a chaotic knot of intertwined articulations that no social theorist can ever completely disentangle them. Without such a cautionary stance, any critical theory is vulnerable to the rationalistic tendency to develop a road map to a \"logical future\", a direct turnpike to the Emerald City of emancipation (1994, p. 146). Collecting Information As noted, my research employs three main methods to collect information, as part of the critical ethnographic approach: (1) in-depth interviews; (2) observation; and (3) document analysis. Interviews are commonly used by social researchers to obtain information from individuals (also called 'informants') that cannot usually be obtained using other methods, such as by observing individuals and/or social settings. Interviews can be defined as a conversation \"initiated by the interviewer for the specific purpose of obtaining research-relevant information, and focussed by him or her on content specified by research objectives of systematic description, prediction or explanation\" (Cohen & 61 Manion, 1989, p. 307). While there are various types of interviews ranging from structured to open-ended, my research employed a semi-structured interview format, using an interview guide. A semi-structured interview is characterized by the interviewer having worked out a set of research questions in advance, but the interviewer is free to modify the order of questions, or add new ones, as the interview progresses (Robson, 1993, p. 281). An interview guide represents the physical list of questions that guides the interview, and each guide was modified slightly for each unique IHC setting (see Appendix C for the semi-structured interview guide that was used for each IHC setting in this research). Following the CSSP, the research questions in the interview guide were informed critically by the perspectives described above; they are further detailed below. The 'social location' of each informant was inherently noted in the context of the interview and later analysis. A total of SO interviews were conducted, which included patients, practitioners, health care administrators, and stakeholders (see Chapter Five for specific site information). As a supplement to informant observations gathered in interviews, direct observation was used as a second method. Observational method is typically used to find out \"what people do in public\" (Robson, 1993, p. 281). The proposed research employed an 'observer-as-participant' approach (Robson, 1993). The observer-as-participant is someone who makes an overt effort to take no part in the social activity being observed, keeping in mind that this is only an overt effort. In other words, the concept of the researcher 'objectively' not influencing any aspect of the research setting is now identified by reflexive social scientists as theoretically impossible and even undesirable, even when the status of researcher is unknown to the participants. As Smith states, \"the 62 sociological knower is always and cannot escape being part of the world...\" (1987, p. 117). Observation was used to describe and analyze the geographical (i.e., physical space) and the social context of the research (e.g., actors; activities; objects; contextualizing discourses collected in interviews. The key processes observed were the organization of the integrative health care setting. For reasons of confidentiality, only events occurring in the public space of the IHC setting (e.g., waiting room; administrative office; board meetings) were observed. Due to ethical restrictions, private interactions between patients and practitioners were not observed by the researcher. Publicly available and accessible documents and records from the research sites, such as promotional information and minutes of meetings, were also gathered. Following a CSSP approach, written accounts of social processes are considered an important aspect of the construction of power relations. Document analysis was used as a supplement to information gathered using the first two methods of interviews and observation, for example, by comparing and contrasting formalized textual information with more interactive social processes. 3.3. Analysis and Contextualization As already noted, the critical ethnographic approach recognizes power relations as part of complex social interactions, which can also shape and guide these interactions. Ultimately, each case is viewed from within the CSSP theoretical angle, and by drawing on the concept of critical ethnography, is also located in broader socio-political and cultural contexts. For example, each IHC setting in this study can be located in the larger 63 socio-political and cultural 'structure' of the health care system, defined by many different historically-constructed power relations (e.g., biomedical dominance, class, status and power, and economics) and relations among forces that shape to a certain degree each IHC setting. Observations and informant questioning was guided by the main research questions of the study, as stated in the Introduction. Using a critical approach, conceptual categories were developed into core concepts, which then became the central themes of the analysis chapters. Specifically, three main critical theoretical perspectives, discussed above in Chapter Two and below as part of the research design for the study, provided three over-arching explanatory 'windows' on the ongoing social processes in integrative health care settings. The three main critical social science perspectives informing and guiding this research are 1) neo-Marxism, as it relates to the rise of the profession of medicine and its creation of medical dominance; 2) a modified form of Weberianism, as it applies to the professional closure tactics used by biomedicine to maintain dominance in the health care division of labour, and 3) anti-colonial theory, specifically as it relates to discussing the dominance of Eurocentric knowledges (i.e., techno science and biomedicine) over other, subjugated knowledges (i.e., CAM). The first two perspectives have already been reviewed in Chapter Two and will be taken up more fully in Chapters Six and Seven, and thus will not be summarized again here. I will focus instead on anti-colonial theory, which will be taken up more fully in Chapter Eight. As touched upon in Chapter Two, anti-colonial theory (also referred to as post-colonial science and technology studies, histories and/or perspectives) begins from 64 the standpoint of colonized and therefore marginalized peoples, cultures, concepts, sciences and histories, in order to illuminate a different perspective than that of the dominant viewpoint. The main philosophical arguments are drawn from the perspectives of 'isolated' histories of Europe, Africa, China and the Americas, and other cultures and continents not usually included in traditional Western historical and educational texts. Essential for this approach is to thoroughly examine how different cultures have interacted across recorded human history (Harding, 1998, p. 8). In contrast to traditional historical accounts, diverse cultures and continents (e.g., Africa, India, Asia) have exchanged their own 'sciences' for millennia prior to Columbus's voyages beginning in 1492 (a mere 500 years ago, versus the 40,000 years over which humanity is known to have conducted trading). As Sandra Harding, a leading anti-colonial philosopher of science, states: Such a strategy enables postcolonial theory to detect features of different cultures' scientific and technological thought and practices that are not visible from within the familiar western accounts of science. This new kind of account does not merely add new topics to conceptual frameworks that are themselves left unchanged. Instead, it forces transformations of them (1998, p. 8). Following the above perspective, the term 'science' refers to any systematic attempt (European or non-European) to produce knowledge of the natural world, in that multiple 'sciences' can, and do, exist (Harding, 1998, p. 10). Of great importance is that anti- colonial perspectives lead to opening up space for new questions to be asked, beginning from marginalized and usually 'invisible' viewpoints. Referring to feminism, Harding states: Less problematically, postcolonialism and feminism can usefully be thought of as thinking spaces that have been opened up by changes in social relations and in ways of thinking about them\u2014by changes in \"discourses\". Within such spaces, new kinds of questions can be asked and new kinds of possible futures can be 65 articulated and debated. Starting thought from the lives of those people upon whose exploitation the legitimacy of the dominant system depends can bring into focus questions and issues that were not visible, \"important\", or legitimate within the dominant institutions, their conceptual frameworks, cultures, and practices (1998, p. 17). Clearly, asking different questions does not equate with extreme post-modernist and/or culturally relativist positions of 'all are equal'. Each perspective adds a unique and different standpoint on the world, with the researcher weighing and choosing carefully what becomes 'meaningful'. Drawing on Harding, the question is not: \"Which perspective is more 'real' or 'accurate'?\", but rather: \"What does each perspective contribute or not contribute?\" (1998, p. 21). Anti-colonial theory is not only a perspective, but a specific standpoint (drawn from standpoint theory) of asking questions from marginalized/exploited groups, whose lives are shaped by dominant groups. A different standpoint then enables an expansion of the entire research enterprise (Harding, 1998, p. 159). As Harding states: Standpoint approaches can show us how to detect values and interests that constitute scientific projects, ones that do not vary between legitimated observers, and the difference between those values and interests that enlarge and those that limit our descriptions, explanations, and understandings of nature and social relations. Standpoint approaches provide a map, a method, for maximizing a \"strong objectivity\" in the natural and social sciences. They provide more objective ways of explaining the limitations of standard accounts of nature and social relations, and the surprising strengths of the post-Kuhnian, postcolonial, and feminist studies of science and technology that have emerged since World War II (1998, p. 163). Anti-colonial theory has rarely if ever been applied to CAM research and/or practice, leaving large areas critically under-theorized. A mere 'scratch on the surface' leads to pertinent conceptual links. As has been discussed earlier, the use of biomedicine is inherently linked with the success of colonial exploits. As will be further explored in Chapter Eight, not only did biomedicine historically appropriate indigenous sciences and 66 medicines, but it continues to do so today as it appropriates various aspects of CAM practices that are indigenous knowledges (e.g., medical acupuncture). CAM therapies, as with indigenous sciences, are continuously devalued using biomedical evidence. Moreover, using anti-colonial theory one might ask: \"Does CAM not have its own uniquely valid sciences, that can stand on their own? Do historically marginalized CAM practitioners, as with colonized indigenous healers and shamans, have a voice to share?\" Using this variety of critical theoretical perspectives, then, Chapter Six draws more fully on a critical neo-Marxist perspective, to discuss how privatization of both biomedicine and CAM negatively impacts IHC and maintains the dominance of biomedicine. Chapter Seven draws on a critically-modified form of Weberian closure theory to illustrate how patterns of micro-professional interaction maintain biomedicine's state-supported dominance in integrative health care settings. Finally, as noted, Chapter Eight draws on anti-colonial theory to demonstrate how the dominance of the biomedical paradigm has far-reaching effects on IHC. As each perspective is 'critically-informed', they complement each other by providing related explanatory 'angles' on integrative health care. 3.4 Ethical Considerations Before commencing research, approval for this study was obtained from the University of Toronto Human Subjects Review Committee, and the researcher fulfilled the ethical requirements of the research sites (e.g., Mount Sinai Ethics Review). All three sites agreed to participate in the research prior to commencement of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual and setting before being 67 interviewed, based on a detailed consent form (see Appendix D and Appendix E for the consent forms that were used for this research). All raw data were treated as confidential and available only to the researcher and his supervisor. No individuals were identified in the research. 68 Chapter 4 AN INTRODUCTION TO CAM AND IHC IN NORTH AMERICA The literature dealing with CAM is vast and uneven in depth. For example, there are literally hundreds of different types of CAM therapies today, some with detailed published histories. In other areas, such as evidence-based studies of CAM therapies and outcome studies, the literature is growing but at present limited. Empirical studies of integration and integrated clinics, the focus of this research, are practically non-existent. Even in particular areas of CAM research that have been well-researched, such as demographic surveys of CAM users, methodologies and findings have not been entirely consistent. The following overview will thus focus on two substantive areas deemed important to provide a context for this research on integrative health care. The two areas are: (1) CAM demographics, and (2) contextual information on integrative health care. Concerning CAM demographics, six main areas will be reviewed: (1) CAM use in Canada and the United States; (2) generated revenue from CAM; (3) demographics of CAM users; (4) reasons for choosing CAM; (5) number of CAM practitioners; and (6) CAM, medical school education and physicians. Concerning information on integrative health care, three main areas will be reviewed: (1) integrative medical settings; (2) existing research on integrative settings; and (3) IHC definitions and models from biomedicine and CAM. The overview will mainly address research undertaken in Canada and the United States. Each of these substantive areas will be critiqued for what they add, or do not add, to the overarching research focus of the study. 69 4.1 Demographic Information The demographic information collected on CAM is useful for assessing the extent - to which biomedicine is losing its appeal vis-a-vis CAM therapies. Information pertaining to what percentage of the population is using CAM; how much revenue it is generating; the type of people who choose CAM and why they choose it; the number of CAM patients; and the degree to which CAM is being taught in medical schools supports the argument that this trend is occurring on a fairly large scale. What is clearly missing, however, is a link between theories of professions, the state, and capital that contextualizes these trends towards increasing use of CAM therapies. Nevertheless, it is useful to review existing information on CAM. 4.1.1 CAM Use in Canada and the United States As suggested above, the use of CAM by citizens in industrialized countries has risen significantly. It has been estimated that approximately half of all citizens in industrialized nations regularly use some form of CAM (Bodeker & Chaudhury, 2001). For example, eight surveys in the United States are in approximate agreement that 40 to 42 per cent of the United States general population use CAM in some form (American Specialty Health [ASH], 2000; Astin, 1998; Consumers & Ettner, 1999; Kessler, & Foster, 1998; Gordon, Sobel, & Tarazona, 1998; InterActive Solutions, 1998; Wooten & Sparber, 1999). In one of these surveys of 2055 nationally-representative households, Eisenberg et al. (1998) reported that CAM use in the United States had grown from 34 per cent of adult Americans using CAM in 1993 (60 million Americans) to 42 per cent in 1997 (83 70 million Americans). Eisenberg et al. further reported that the top two CAM therapies used in the United States were chiropractic and massage therapy, accounting for approximately 70 per cent of all visits to CAM practitioners. Another American study reported a 73 per cent increase in pharmacy sales of supplements and natural remedies from 1991 to 1995, while prescription drugs experienced an increase of only 31 per cent during the same time period (Weeks, 1997). In Canada, estimates of CAM use range from 17 to 73 per cent. A 1998/1999 Statistics Canada survey estimated that approximately 17 per cent, or 3.8 million Canadians 18 years or older, sought the care of a CAM practitioner in the previous year (Statistics Canada, 1998/1999). Other surveys report higher use. For example, a survey of 1500 randomly selected Canadians 18 years and older by Ramsay, Walker and Alexander (1999) for the Fraser Institute, reported that 73 per cent of their sample had used CAM at least some time in their lives. Fifty percent of respondents also reported using at least one form of CAM in the previous 12 months. The top five most commonly used therapies were chiropractic therapy (36 per cent), relaxation techniques (23 per cent), massage (23 per cent), prayer (21 per cent), and herbal remedies (17 per cent). In particular, the use of herbal remedies in Canada has grown dramatically, almost tripling to 28 per cent of Canadians using these therapies in the year 2000, from only 10 per cent in 1997 (Foss, 2000). For example, in one municipal survey of Toronto, Ontario, 65 per cent of respondents in 2000 indicated they had used CAM in the past year, the top three out of 11 being herbs, massage and supplements (Canadian Institute for Health Information [CIHI], 2003, p. 23). 71 Surprisingly, TCM was the least used, but the survey may not have fully included Toronto's large urban population using TCM. In summary, similar to the United States, the proportion of the Canadian population using CAM is increasing. The Canadian Berger Monitor survey (March 1999), reported notable increases between 1993 and 1999 in six-month use of chiropractors (from 9 to 12 per cent), massage (from 4 to 10 per cent), herbalists (from 1 to 3 per cent), acupuncturists, homeopaths and reflexologists (all three from 1 to 2 per cent). The Monitor survey also found that 24 per cent of respondents had consulted one or more alternative practitioner. As in the United States, a significant and increasing proportion of the Canadian population are using a natural health product instead of filling a prescription (7 per cent in 1999 versus 4 per cent in 1998), or are using a natural health product instead of going to a physician (16 per cent in 1999, versus 10 per cent in 1998) (De Bruyn, 2001). The most recent Canadian survey of CAM use indicated that in 2003, one-fifth of Canadians aged 12 or older, or an estimated 5.4 million people, reported using some type of CAM in the year before the survey (Health Reports, 2003).. This finding is an increase from 3.8 million Canadians using CAM in 1998/1999. Similar to previous surveys, chiropractic was the most commonly used form of CAM. 4.1.2 Revenue The increased use of CAM has also generated significant revenue. In Eisenberg et al.'s (1998) United States survey, total CAM expenditures were estimated at between 36.0 and 47.5 billion U.S. dollars for 1997. Reimbursed expenditures for CAM professional services and therapies in the United States in 1997 were estimated to be 72 between U.S. $9.0 and 13.1 billion; out-of-pocket expenditures were estimated at between U.S. $12.2 and 19.6 billion; and out-of-pocket expenditures on self-care, such as megavitamins, diet products, herbs, classes and equipment, were estimated to be between U.S. $14.8 and 14.8 billion. In Canada, the use of CAM has fueled a Canadian market estimated in 1997 to be worth Canadian $3.8 billion (Canadian Overview, 1999, p. 263). This includes Canadian $1.8 billion on complementary/alternative therapies; $937 million on herbs and vitamins; $104 million on special diet programs; and more than $998 million on books, classes and equipment. While Canadian revenue for CAM services is significantly less than in markets in the United States (perhaps due to the publicly funded nature of the Canadian health care system), this revenue remains substantial. 4.1.3. Who Uses CAM? In Eisenberg et al.'s survey of the American population (1998), it was found that CAM use was more common among women (48.9 per cent) than men (37.8 per cent). People aged 35 to 49 reported higher rates of use (50.1 per cent) than did older age groups (39.1 per cent) or younger age groups (41.8 per cent). The results also showed that use was higher among those with post-secondary education (50.6 per cent) than with no post-secondary education (36.4 per cent), and that use was higher among those with _ incomes greater than $50,000 (48.1 per cent) than among those with lower incomes (42.6 per cent). CAM use was also more common in the West (50.1 per cent) than elsewhere in the United States (42.1 per cent). Other United States surveys mirror Eisenberg et al.'s findings (e.g., Astin, 1998). 73 Surveys of the Canadian population have also been generally consistent with findings in the United States. However, Ramsay et al.'s 1999 survey showed that those in the 18 to 24 age group were more likely to have used CAM (55 per cent) in the previous 12 months. Differing from Americans, income did not seem to be a factor in the use of CAM for Canadians in this particular study. Yet, a 2003 survey found that 26 per cent of individuals using CAM in their sample were in the highest income group, while only 13 per cent of the lowest income group used CAM (Health Reports, 2003). But similar to the United States, those Canadians with some post-secondary education were higher users of CAM (58 per cent) than those with less than a high school education (40 per cent). The use of CAM was more prevalent in the West, and least likely in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, despite popular belief that indicates that CAM use is higher in Quebec than in Western provinces. The results from the Ramsay survey also showed that respondents tended to first use CAM in their late 20s and early 30s. Initial use of chiropractic care usually began between ages of 30 and 33, while the use of lifestyle diets began between ages of 24 and 32. The initial use of folk remedies and prayer typically started at the early age of 14. | It is of interest that the study also reported use of CAM among children. It found that 17 per cent of those households with children under 18 had used CAM therapies for their children in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most widely used CAM therapies were chiropractic care (39 per cent), herbal remedies (29 per cent) and homeopathy (21 per cent). 74 In a 1998 Angus Reid Group opinion poll of 1,200 Canadians 18 years and older, it was found that CAM use was higher among Canadians aged 35 to 54 (49 per cent), among females (46 per cent), and among those reporting incomes greater than $60,000 (52 per cent). Use was also found to be higher in the West, and of those respondents reporting the use of CAM, the majority of users (55 per cent) indicated that they had been using it for more than five years. Length of CAM use did not differ by region or gender, but did increase with age. For those aged 18 and older, the incidence of CAM use increased from 23 per cent (those using CAM five years ago) to 42 per cent. The growth in incidence differed among age groups, with the largest increase for those aged 18 to 34 (with an increase of 146 per cent), while the incidence for those aged 35 to 54 increased by 76 per cent, and for those aged 55 and older, there was an increase of 49 per cent. In summary, one can conclude that the majority of CAM users in the United States and Canada are female, with both higher incomes and education. The major areas of discrepancy between surveys of demographics associated with CAM users have to do with the popularity of specific therapies with specific age groups and level of income. 4.1.4 Why Do People Choose CAM? Ramsay et al. (1999) found that in the previous 12 months, 81 per cent of all CAM therapies were, not surprisingly, used to prevent illness or to maintain health and vitality. The study found that more children used chiropractic care, homeopathy, folk remedies, massage, and lifestyle diets to treat illness rather than to maintain wellness. To maintain wellness, relaxation techniques, herbal remedies and prayer were used. Eisenberg et al. (1998) found that 42 per cent of all CAM therapies were used more for 75 the treatment of existing illness, while 58 per cent of all CAM therapies were used in part for prevention or maintenance of wellness. Consistent with this finding, the Canada Health Monitor (1999) found that 57.5 per cent of respondents had used CAM in the previous six months. Of these users, 84.1 per cent were taking CAM to either prevent illness or for general well-being. Thus, one conclusion is that individuals are primarily using CAM for the general prevention of illness and the maintenance of wellness. Millar (1997), however, found that the use of CAM practitioners was positively associated with the number of diagnosed chronic illnesses. CAM use for those with no chronic diseases was found to be nine per cent; for one chronic disease 16 per cent; for two chronic diseases 20 per cent; and for three or more chronic diseases, 26 per cent. Similarly, So (1997) found that users of CAM reported slightly higher levels of chronic stress than non-users. These results show that individuals are also choosing CAM in an attempt to treat chronic illness, and that individuals with chronic illness are a major group of CAM users. Some have even suggested that the most frequently cited reason for consumer use of CAM is dissatisfaction with the ability of conventional medicine to adequately treat chronic illness in particular (Eisenberg et al., 1993). For example, Astin (1998) found higher use of CAM to be correlated with the presence of specific chronic health conditions. The likelihood of CAM use among respondents with back problems was twice that of respondents not reporting back problems; the likelihood of CAM use among respondents with chronic pain was found to be twice that of respondents not reporting chronic pain; and respondents who reported anxiety were three times as likely as the average survey respondent to use CAM. Other studies have found that use of CAM is especially high in patients with Alzheimer's 716 disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatic diseases, cancer, HIV/AIDs, back problems, anxiety, headaches, and chronic pain (Astin, 1998; Clinical Oncology Group, 1993; Eisenberg et al., 1993; Singh et al., 1996). Others have also suggested the use of CAM by both the public and practitioners is likely to escalate with the growing incidence of chronic illnesses as populations age (Gordon, 1996). According to an analysis of disability in the United States by a team of Stanford researchers (Hoffman, Rice, & Sung, 1996), approximately 44.5 per cent of the ambulatory, non-institutionalized adult population experienced one or more forms of chronic illness in 1989. In the United States, the total number of persons in 1989 with one or more chronic conditions was 88.5 million. Outside of the powerful impact of chronic illness, and the general maintenance of wellness and the prevention of iliness, there are other significant reasons for people choosing CAM services in the literature. One major reason that has been attributed to individuals choosing CAM is that they have found little or no relief from their health problems using conventional medical services (Kelner & Wellman, 1997). Many other studies have suggested that patients mainly use CAM due to negative past experiences with biomedicine (e.g., Furnham & Smith, 1988). While these reports are important, other studies suggest that the use of CAM services by individuals stems not from a sense of 'desperation', but rather from a deliberate strategy based on a belief in an 'alternative therapy ideology'. Pawluch, Cain and Gillett (1994) propose that this ideology encompasses the following components: (1) definition of the illness as a chronic condition; (2) commitment to a proactive and preventive role in one's own health care; (3) a holistic understanding of health as 77 physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being; (4) an openness to the full range of available therapies; and (5) an emphasis on individual and personal responsibility for all health care decisions. Sharma (1993), however, based on a small-scale study of users of CAM services in a non-metropolitan area of Britain, argues that both ideological and pragmatic considerations influence individual decisions about what kind of treatment to seek in the face of illness. The patients in her study suffered from chronic illnesses for which conventional medical care had not offered much help. As a result, these individuals had turned to CAM in the hope of finding some relief. A number of the patients, however, were also ideologically predisposed to using CAM, and were also highly critical of the conventional biomedical profession. Further, these individuals felt the need to engage in an active search for information pertaining to their problems, and had considerable confidence in their ability to make independent health care decisions. Vincent and Furnham (1996) support Sharma's conclusions, and suggest four principal reasons for why people choose CAM: (1) belief in the positive value of CAM; (2) previous experience with conventional biomedicine, which was ineffective; (3) concern about the adverse side-effects of conventional biomedical care; and (4) poor communication between conventional biomedical practitioners and their patients. In addition to ideological beliefs and past experience, Kelner and Wellman (1997), in a study of 300 CAM users in Toronto, suggest that certain characteristics or 'factors' will influence people and make it possible for them to use certain health services, such as CAM. These factors have been labeled 'predisposing' and 'enabling' factors. Predisposing factors refer to certain characteristics that will influence people to 78 use certain health services, such as sex, education, type of occupation, and income. The conclusion that the majority of CAM users are women with a higher than average level of education and income are examples of what they call predisposing factors. Enabling factors, related to predisposing factors, refer to both community and personal resources, which make it possible to use certain health care services. Kelner and Wellman suggest that, with regard to community resources, individuals who wish to take advantage of alternative therapies must be located in an area where such services are available on a regular basis. Enabling factors further involve 'personal enabling factors', such as personal knowledge of available services, referrals to a particular practitioner, and a convenient location. For example, Kelner and Wellman reported that 36 per cent of their total sample chose to use a CAM service because it was suggested by others who had experienced positive results. Sixty-two percent of referrals came from family members, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and other CAM practitioners. Thus, both predisposing and enabling factors influence the individual choice of therapy, choice of practitioner, and the ability to pay for CAM services: \"Knowledge about what kinds of health services are available is essential if people are to make choices about therapies\" (1997, p. 207). 4.1.5 Number of CAM Practitioners The number of certified CAM practitioners is also significant in looking at the impact of CAM. Estimates suggest that the United States has approximately 50,000 to 60,000 chiropractors, 8,000 to 10,000 licensed acupuncturists, 1,500 licensed naturopaths, and over 120,000 massage therapists and other 'body' workers (Faass, 79 2001). A 1994 United States study estimated that 11 per cent of the direct care providers in the United States were chiropractors, acupuncturists, or naturopathic practitioners (Faass, 2001). In Canada, there are no clear estimates of the total number of CAM practitioners. Estimates of the number of CAM practitioners by province, however, do exist. For example, while already dated, in Ontario, previous estimates suggest that there are approximately 280 working naturopaths, 6,500 acupuncturists, and over 1,000 homeopaths (York University Centre for Heath Studies [YCHS], 1999). 4.1.6 CAM, Medical Education and Physicians The widespread use of CAM has also been shown to have influenced medical school education. For example, in 1993, only 15 out of 125 American medical schools included some form of CAM education, while in 1998, 75 schools included CAM courses or electives (Wetzel, Eisenberg, & Kaptchuk, 1998). Studies have estimated that 38 per cent of Canadian (Reudy, Kaufman, & MacLeod, 1999) and 67 per cent of American medical schools (Wetzel et al., 1998) now offer 'stand-alone' courses in CAM. An increasing number of physicians\u2014an estimated 20,000 in the United States\u2014 are both referring to CAM practitioners and practicing certain forms of CAM therapies. The most accurate depiction is a study by Astin, Marie, Pelletier, Hansen and Haskell (1998), who conducted a detailed, systematic review of 19 international surveys conducted between 1982 and 1995, evaluating the attitudes of mainstream physicians' (MDs with no known vested interest in CAM) toward or use of CAM. In terms of physician referrals for CAM services, they found highs of 83 per cent for referral to 80 chiropractic (Canada), 71 per cent for acupuncture (New Zealand), 42 per cent for homeopathy (England), 35 per cent for massage (United States) and 9 per cent for herbal medicine (United States). In terms of the physician practice of specific CAM therapies, they found highs of 78 per cent for herbal medicine (Germany), 51 per cent for both acupuncture (United States) and chiropractic (The Netherlands), 45 per cent for homeopathy (Germany) and 35 per cent for massage (United States). In terms of the physician belief in the use of or efficacy of CAM, highs ranged from 91 per cent for chiropractic (United States), 88 per cent for acupuncture (Scotland), 80 per cent for massage (The Netherlands), 52 per cent for homeopathy (Scotland) and 23 per cent for herbal medicine (England; United States). Belief in and the practice of CAM was greater among younger than older physicians. The practice of, referrals for, and belief in CAM were also greater among general practitioners than among hospital-based physicians. In summary, across all the 19 studies (mean percentage), acupuncture had the highest rate of referral (43 per cent), followed by chiropractic (40 per cent), massage (21 per cent), homeopathy (15 per cent) and herbal medicine (4 per cent). In terms of physician practice of CAM therapies, chiropractic therapy and massage were the most practiced by physicians (19 per cent), followed by acupuncture (17 per cent), herbal medicine (16 per cent) and homeopathy (9 per cent). Physicians rated chiropractic as most efficacious (53 per cent), followed by acupuncture (51 per cent), massage (48 per cent), homeopathy (26 per cent) and herbal medicine (13 per cent). The above findings are not surprising, given that it is usually the most 'physical-based' versus 'energy-based' CAM therapies that are integrated with biomedicine. $1 4.2 Integrative Medical Settings and Research The main critique of these IHC descriptive studies and research is that they lack theoretical or historical depth. In other words, similar to CAM demographic studies, this research does not explore systematically the complex social processes and patterns of professional interaction in the settings themselves. Nor do they explore the political and economic context of JHC. It should also be noted that the few studies related to IHC do not deal with IHC settings per se, but close approximations. For example, Anderson's study, reviewed below, is of a 'mock' IHC trial process. The analysis by Shuval, Mizrachi and Smetannikov (2002) is an empirical study, but it is of solo CAM practitioners in hospital units, not IHC settings. It thus remains to be seen, whether a true integration of formerly competitive traditions can be negotiated. 4.2.1 THC Settings Although THC represents the minority of CAM environments, clearly the popularity of CAM has also led to the establishment of integrative medical settings. These settings range from clinics in hospitals to free-standing institutions. For example, in Canada, two important settings were the Tzu Chi Research Centre for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (now closed), and the Centre for Integrated Healing (one of the research sites in this study), both located in Vancouver, British Columbia. Both of these free-standing institutions employed and employ a number of biomedical doctors working conjointly with various CAM practitioners. There are also a minority of other smaller clinics across Canada in various cities. 82 In the United States, there are a significantly higher number of integrative medical settings as compared with Canada. These settings are also functioning within an American context which recently championed CAM through the development of a nationally-funded Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), with an annual budget in 2001 of US $110 million (Faass, 2001). A United States publication on the integration of CAM into the American health care system listed and summarized in detail over 10 integrated medical settings, ranging geographically from Hawaii, California and Seattle, to Denver, Minnesota and New York (Faass, 2001). Of these settings, two are particularly interesting, and highlight unique combinations of CAM and biomedicine (although they remain biomedically dominant, with physicians remaining as gatekeepers). The clinic in alternative medicine at Hennepin County Medical Centre (HCMC) has been in place since 1993. The clinic is a division of the Department of Medicine, which is in one of the teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Minnesota (Faass, 2001, p. 391). The clinic receives up to 22 per cent of referrals from general practitioners and internists in the hospital for a number of conditions ranging from fibromyalgia to chronic fatigue syndrome. The program has a medical director who is an internist and acupuncturist, and who serves as medical supervisor of the clinic. When a patient is seen for the first time, the medical director reviews the patient's entire medical history for any 'red flags' that might suggest a patient needs to be seen by a primary care physician for a diagnostic work up. Patients with any potentially serious acute complaints are referred immediately to their primary care physician or other physicians. Patients are then referred for appropriate CAM treatments. The clinic offers acupuncture, acupressure, Shiatsu, body-work, herbs and 83 chiropractic. Herbs are provided by a unique in-house herbal pharmacy and dispensary, purchased by patients; the pharmacy is regulated according to strict standards, monitoring herb quality and any adverse events. The clinic is in the process of developing clinical pathways or guidelines addressing the integration of biomedical and CAM services. What is particularly unique about the clinic is the use of integrated medical records. These records include notes from the patient's physical examinations and the records from all previous treatments the patient may have received, in addition to all CAM treatments, and contraindications between therapies. These records are integrated with 13 other clinics in the hospital, including primary care and surgery. The records also include chart notes, biomedical and CAM treatment and diagnosis, including notes from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners. What is interesting is the observation that most physicians do not fully understand the CAM notes. This indicates that CAM and biomedicine are not fully integrated, despite the integration of CAM and biomedical services (Faass, 2001, p. 396). This is not a surprise, given the divergent histories of CAM and biomedicine. An analysis of the details of how these arrangements are negotiated, however, could reveal much about the dynamics of the CAM and biomedical professions. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC), a second significant IHC Centre in the United States, is located in New York. It is the oldest and largest private institution in the world devoted to cancer treatment, prevention, patient care, research, and education (Faass, 2001). Selected CAM therapies are being integrated into the Centre's mainstream cancer care. The 'Integrative Medicine Service' was designed to support the mission of the hospital by providing therapies found to improve patient 84 quality of life and enhance the healing process. CAM therapies were selected on the basis of their ability to decrease pain, depression, or fatigue and to improve the patient's sense of well-being. The Integrative Medicine Service provides care using a three tiered approach: clinical services, such as at inpatient programs; outpatient programs; and a fully integrative medical centre. At the inpatient program, CAM therapies are provided to patients as an adjunct to their primary treatment program. For example, massage, acupuncture, mind/body therapies, and music therapy are provided to hospitalized patients free of charge. At the outpatient program, CAM treatments such as massage are available to patients prior to being seen by their physician or having tests. The third site, the integrative medicine centre, is considered the 'crown jewel' of the program. It is a 3,700 square foot facility, where a full range of CAM services are provided, from acupuncture to Reiki. Classes are also available in yoga and T'ai chi. These CAM therapies at the third site, however, are private and presumably cater to elite patients. As Caspi (2001) states: \"Almost no systematic research is taking place on the delivery, organisation, and financing of different integrative healthcare models or on the appropriateness, quality, availability, and cost of CAM modalities in the current healthcare system\" (p. 168). To date, there are few research studies that have critically examined existing integrative health care settings. Most information on integrative medical settings, while valuable, is descriptive, rather than evaluative or theoretical. While few in number, the closest approximation to an analysis of an integrative medical setting are two recent studies, one by Anderson (1999), and the other by Shuval et al. (2002). A few previous studies of emerging IHC settings in the early 1990s were undertaken in the United Kingdom and Europe, but offer only preliminary critical 85 findings related to practitioner interaction (Nielsen, 1993; Paterson & Peacock, 1995; Reason, 1991, 1995). Anderson conducted a case study of the treatment of a patient with chronic low back pain handled by an integrative team of six practitioners at the Health Medicine Forum (HMF), John Muir Medical Centre in Walnut Creek, California. The HMF is directed by a specialist in internal medicine. From three to six medical doctors, and between 50 to 75 CAM practitioners meet monthly in an annual convention to explore how they could work together. At the time of the study, this group did not share patients, with the exception of the case study that Anderson documented. The core group of practitioners consisted of one orthopedic surgeon; a family physician specializing in orthopedic medicine; a psychologist specializing in biofeedback; a chiropractor; a practitioner of Chinese medicine (TCM); and a body worker. The purpose of the workshop was to allow the six practitioners to explain how they would treat the patient if they were to collaborate. Anderson's main research question was: \"How can practitioners share a patient if they evaluate and diagnose in terms of explanatory models that constitute radically different alternatives to one another\" (1999, p. 166)? The descriptive ethnographic information collected on the six modalities is too detailed to summarize here. Briefly, the patient was reported to have ultimately improved from the use of chiropractic therapy. Anderson's main finding, however, was that despite the presentation of different treatment modalities to the patient, all modalities were communicated in the 'language of biomedicine'. Anderson concluded that for CAM practices to survive as unique medical systems, they will have to practice in a different environment than that of biomedicine: 86 Alternative systems may well survive in integrated settings, in other words, as treatment modalities, as alternative therapies, but not as highly differentiated ways of conceptualizing ill health and healing. If they are to survive as unique medical systems, as truly different paradigms, perhaps they must be practiced in a competitive environment rather than one of integrated medicine (1999, p. 172). He argues that we are experiencing a shift from alternative medical systems as we have known them in the past toward a future in which highly divergent underlying theoretical bases may become increasingly subsumed as variations or versions of basic biomedicine with its foundations on scientific anatomy, physiology, and pathology (1999, p. 172). Anderson, however, seems to favour the biomedical model when he states that \"under the impact of globalization, the biological sciences widely if not universally provide a shared basis for discourse that is adequate, if not perfect, for integrated practice\" (1999, p. 172). While Anderson's findings are interesting, then, his endorsement of the biomedical model as the over-arching paradigm for integrative medicine is open for critique from an anti-colonial theoretical perspective. The other study relating to integrative settings also showed that CAM modalities were threatened by biomedicine. Shuval et al. (2002) conducted a study of solo CAM practitioners working in departments in publicly-funded hospitals in Israel, examining collaborative patterns between biomedical and individual CAM practitioners. The study found a wide variety of CAM practitioners (e.g., in the fields of Chinese medicine; homeopathy; chiropractic; herbal medicine) in various hospital departments. Only a small minority of the CAM practitioners, however, were employed full time in a formal hospital position, or with a regular salary. Further, CAM practitioners were geographically isolated; more generally not included in departmental clinical conferences or hospital rounds; and certain biomedical practitioners had crossed classic biomedical boundaries by appropriating certain CAM modalities (e.g., acupuncture; osteopathy). 87 4.3 THC Models and Definitions 4.3.1 Defining Integrative Health Care While biomedicine and CAM have generally agreed-upon definitions, there appears to be much conceptual diversity in defining integrative health care. A useful starting point in this literature is to briefly review definitions and various other terms . referring to IHC stemming from some of the diverse communities that use the term 'THC'. Shortell and colleagues in the United States (1993) are well known for health policy and systems perspectives concerning the integration of health care services primarily within biomedicine. Preferring instead to use the term 'organized delivery system' (ODS), Shortell, Gillies, Anderson, Mitchell and Morgan define IHC as \"networks of organizations that provide or arrange to provide a co-ordinated continuum of services to a defined population and who are willing to be held clinically and fiscally accountable for the outcomes and the health status of the population being served' (1993, p. 14). Also within biomedical health policy writing, de Jong and Jackson (2001) define 'integration' in health care as a term used loosely to mean service co-ordination, linkage, care collaboration, or multidisciplinary management. Similarly, in the area of family medicine and nursing, Way, Jones and Busing (2000, p. 3) refer to 'collaborative practice', and define it as an \"... inter-professional process for communication and decision making that enables the separate and shared knowledge and skills of care providers to synergistically influence the client/patient care provided\". Yet other theorists, in the area of complementary and alternative health care, refer to the terms 'integrated' or 'integrative' medicine. Some argue that integrated medicine 88 is not the same as the mere combination of complementary and alternative medicine with biomedicine. Rees and Weil (2001, p. 119), for example, argue that whereas CAM refers to \"treatment that may be used as adjuncts to conventional treatment that are not usually taught in medical schools\", 'integrated' medicine, on the other hand, \"has a larger meaning and mission, its focus being on health and healing rather than disease and treatment\". Integrated medicine, they argue, is \"... practicing medicine in a way that selectively incorporates elements of complementary and alternative medicine into comprehensive treatment plans alongside solidly orthodox methods of diagnosis and treatment\" (2001, p. 119). Integrated medicine further involves viewing patients as \"whole people with minds and spirits as well as bodies\", with patients and doctors \"paying attention to lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, quality of rest and sleep, and the nature of relationships\" (2001, p. 119). Similarly, Bell et al. refer to 'integrative medicine' as a \"... higher order system of systems of care that emphasizes wellness and healing of the entire person (bio/socio-psycho/spiritual dimensions) as primary goals, drawing on both conventional and CAM approaches in the context of a supportive and effective physician/patient relationship\" (2002, p. 133). Maizes and Caspi (1999, p. 148) also define integrative medicine as the understanding of the body's innate ability to heal, where healing is believed to originate within the patient rather than the physician, and a 'shift' is required from the 'fixing' paradigm of biomedicine to recognizing the individual and social context of disease. From an international health systems perspective, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002, p. 8) refers to an 'integrative system' where traditional and complementary/alternative medicine are \"officially recognized and incorporated into all areas of health care provision\", such as national drug policies, hospitals and health care insurance. 89 Thus definitions of IHC are diverse in nature, drawing on a number of different conceptual elements. Despite the diversity of meanings, I suggest there are two primary ways to organize these different elements. First, as proposed by Tataryn and Verhoef (2001) and as will be discussed below in more detail, integration in health care can occur at many different 'levels' within a health care system, including at patient, practitioner, clinic, institution, regulatory/professional body, and health policy/systems levels. Some concepts may be oriented primarily towards one level over another. For example, definitions of IHC from biomedical health policy largely refer to IHC on the practitioner and clinical levels. IHC from CAM theorists, while also articulating concepts at the practitioner and clinical levels, also refers to the patient level in terms of expanding the concept of illness, disease and wellness. In the areas of international health or comparative health systems, [HC is primarily conceived of on the macro health systems level, also encompassing other levels. Complementing the 'levels' analysis, Boon, Verhoef, O' Hara, Findlay and Majid (2004) review 57 articles on IHC and suggest it is possible to organize concepts in IHC in a second way by referring to (a) philosophy or set of values; (b) structure; (c) process, and (d) outcomes. Philosophy and/or values refers to \"an underlying world view or set of values as a fundamental basis for guiding the emergence of integrative health care\". Structure refers to the \"constituent elements and the infrastructure that links them together\" in the IHC setting. Process refers to \"the unique process of interaction between the patients and practitioners and among practitioners\". Outcomes refers to the \"possible products or results that might occur when integrative health care is operational\". 90 While envisioning IHC as occurring on different levels is a necessary first step to establishing where IHC is occurring, and by default includes some conceptual ideals when these levels are described, this first approach does not necessarily indicate the 'core' ideals of IHC. Thus, the remainder of this section on defining IHC will focus on Boon et al.'s four core categories where ideals of IHC emerge. I suggest it is important to keep these ideals in mind, and whether or not they actually reflect IHC settings. In their review of the literature on IHC, Boon et al. (2004) conclude that ideals relating to philosophy and/or values are central to the concept of IHC. Central to the philosophy on IHC is an understanding of patients as 'whole persons' comprised of an expanded concept of health, viewed as a balance between physical, psychological, spiritual, social, environmental and cosmological levels/dimensions. The patient is viewed as a locus of innate healing capabilities where the focus is on the wellness and healing of the person, versus purely disease or symptom management. This process is facilitated by a partnership between patient and practitioner. The end goal of treatment is a 'fuller realization of the person' and a 'healthier state of being' as a form of 'emergence' where illness may become an opportunity for 'learning and personal growth'. Central to this philosophy is a person-centred 'empowering' approach to health care, where the person becomes centrally involved in choosing health care modalities that fit their worldview. Second, Boon and colleagues stress that ideals relating to structure are also of central importance for the concept of IHC. Drawing from Schroeder and Likkel's (1999) definition of IHC listed earlier, the structural ideal of IHC is a non-hierarchical blend of CAM and biomedicine. Rather than a 'cut and paste' approach, this ideal assumes a \"collaborative team care approach between a variety of Western medical, traditional and 91 indigenous, and CAM licensed health care providers\" with \"comprehensive access to a full range of health care systems\" (Boon et al., 2004). These health care services are envisioned to integrate health promotion, disease prevention, wellness, health maintenance and community-based care. Central to this structural category is the provision of a diverse number of health care practices and modalities including but surpassing purely biomedical services, where patients have access to a wide range of therapeutic options. Third, ideals relating to process envision an inter- and intraprofessional style of interaction where providers synergistically work collaboratively, interdependently and with mutual respect, trust and appreciation for the skills and knowledge of other professions. Rather then being merely multidisciplinary\u2014or where professions are at the most aware and tolerant of each other and \"communicate with each other through varying degrees of contact while nevertheless primarily practicing within their respective silos\"\u2014 that collaboration must either be interdisciplinary, or transdisciplinary. An interdisciplinary style of professional interaction envisions professions co-ordinating their services across disciplines, facilitated by consensus and equal participation in decision making. A transdisciplinary practice, on the other hand, envisions different professions actually sharing knowledge and skills, thus collapsing traditional boundaries between professions. One example from within the biomedical professions of transdisciplinarity is the expanded skills of the registered nurse who can, in some instances, prescribe medicines to patients (e.g., the 'abortion pill'). As will be shown in my research, examples from IHC sites include biomedical physicians practicing certain CAM therapies and therapeutic interventions, and certain CAM practitioners, such as naturopathic 92 doctors, practicing skills or using certain modalities from either biomedicine or other CAM professions (e.g., acupuncture or homeopathy). Fourth and last, ideals relating to outcomes refer to the optimal form of care that is delivered, such as 'high quality' care, 'cost-effectiveness' and the expectations of the ideals presented in the three previous categories such as health promotion and a collaborative team approach. Increased quality of life is also an important ideal relating to outcomes of IHC. In summarizing the four categories of IHC based on a number of ideals, Boon et al. (2004) then propose a definition of IHC. According to their definition, integrative health care \"seeks, through a partnership of patient and practitioner, to treat the whole person, to assist the innate healing properties of each person, and to promote health and wellness as well as the prevention of disease\"; \"is an interdisciplinary, non-hierarchical blending of both conventional medicine and complementary and alternative health care that provides a seamless continuum of decision-making and patient-centred care and support\"; \"employs a collaborative team approach guided by consensus building, mutual respect, and a shared vision of health care that permits each practitioner and the patient to contribute their particular knowledge and skills within the context of a shared, synergistically charged plan of care\"; and \"results in more effective and cost-effective care by synergistically combining therapies and services in a manner that exceeds the collective effect of the individual practices\" (2004, p. 11). In keeping with the concept of ideals, Boon and colleagues view this definition as a form of Weber's 'ideal-type' of how IHC 'should be delivered'. Thus, based on ideal types, they admit that their definition of IHC \"is not necessarily an accurate representation of any specific system of care delivery, 93 but rather a theoretical concept that is used to compare and differentiate systems of care delivery along theoretically relevant categories\" (2004, p.11). Boon et al. also note that ideals of IHC can become indicators of IHC itself, in that they argue that it is possible to locate \"indicators demonstrating when IHC is occurring, and as these indicators relate to the particular level on which IHC occurs\". While there are many possible indicators, following Boon et al., an indicator for each category could take the form of a series of questions for each IHC site: For example, one can create the following questions based on the above ideals: (a) philosophy: is there an expanded concept of illness and disease to include physical, psychological, spiritual, social and environmental dimensions? (b) structure: is there a wide range of multidisciplinary health services well-outside but including the biomedical model? (c) process: is there a demonstrable pattern of collaborative care co-ordination, communication, trust and respect where health care professions move beyond their traditional boundaries to establish inter- and/or transdisciplinary styles of interaction? (d) outcomes: do patients report increased quality of life and feel that their illness experience has been validated and that they are in control of their own care and healing? Although these definitions of IHC are a starting point, a fundamental problem lies in their very nature\u2014that they are 'ideal' definitions of what IHC 'should look like'. IHC ideals do not reflect 'everyday' health care settings (Smith, 1987). For example, regarding ideals pertaining to philosophy and/or values, there is no specification in terms 94 of the extent to which this philosophy must be in place. In this sense, would one site be less 'philosophically-inclined' than another? Or, would each site have equal merit? Further, the notion of patient 'empowerment' is also under-theorized. For example, the concept of empowerment assumes that patients can, in fact, be empowered. The question remains then, if certain patients are only 'moderately' empowered, are patients empowered at all, and would they fit an IHC model? Concerning ideals relating to 'structure' that describe a wide range of biomedical and non-biomedical (CAM) modalities, one major criticism is that there is no specification in terms of the range or amount of these services. In other words, would IHC sites be considered structurally ideal because they have a minimum of one or more biomedical and CAM provider(s), or would one site be considered the most integrative site due to a higher number of CAM practitioners, versus another with a lesser amount? Ideals relating to process can also be critiqued. For example, concerning the appreciation of, and value placed upon certain modalities in IHC settings, both CAM and biomedicine could have varying degrees of support depending on each practitioner, thus not presenting a unifying view as the ideals of 'trust' and 'respect' would suggest. 4.3.2 Biomedical IHC Models By far the largest literature on IHC is normative, most of it produced by the biomedical community. For example, in a theoretical article, Leatt et al. (2001) define health care integration and develop a model of integration specifically designed for the Canadian health care context. Most important for the involvement of CAM services, Leatt et al. insist that health services should be provided by the health professional that 'can best meet the individual's 95 needs', such as a nurse practitioner or registered nurse, chiropractor, naturopath, midwife, optometrist, pharmacist and others. They unproblematically suggest, however, that the use of these kinds of practitioners would leave the physician's time and skills for the 'more complex cases needing medical treatment'. Moreover, physicians would always be seen first, keeping physicians in control, similar to American IHC sites described earlier. A second model of IHC at the systems level has been developed by de Jong and Jackson (2001). As stated earlier, the authors define 'integration' loosely to mean service coordination, linkage, care collaboration or multidisciplinary management. They state that IHC should involve an overarching sense of unity and of working together with a unified purpose. De Jong and Jackson make a rational argument that integration allows for reduced duplication, improved access to health care, and safe, high quality care supported by efficient information flow. Echoing Leatt et al., a fully integrated health system, they argue, requires transformation from a compartmentalized health system fuelled by professional and organizational competition, to a system that regards itself as a single entity serving the patient/ client. After all, de Jong and Jackson state, \"health care integration involves doing things in new, non-traditional ways\". In outlining their model of health care integration, de Jong and Jackson state that such a model requires three essential ingredients\u2014what they have called the '3Cs' of effective health care integration. Similar to Leatt et al., these concepts are not problematized in any way, and it is assumed that they will simply 'happen'. The '3Cs' are: (1) communication and access; (2) culture, values and teamwork; and (3) commitments and incentives to deliver integrated care. 96 In a third model, Way et al. (2000), as part of a joint task force with the Ontario College of Family Physicians and the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, further defined the concept of 'collaborative practice', or CP, as a foundation of IHC. They state that CP is a way of working, organizing, and operating within a practice group or network in a manner that effectively utilizes the provider resources to deliver comprehensive primary healthcare, in a cost-efficient manner to best meet the needs of the specific practice population (2000, p. 3). They suggest that a CP model needs to be flexible to meet the diverse health needs and health practices in Ontario, beginning from a foundation of seven main elements that are familiar from the other models reviewed: responsibility/accountability, co-ordination, communication, co-operation, assertiveness, autonomy and mutual trust.\u00b0 These are rather simplistic models from the perspective of a critical social science perspective. Each has developed a reductionist framework that lists core principles and some strategies for establishing an integrative health care system in the context of a biomedical health system. Leatt et al.'s model acknowledges CAM services as a part of this model, primarily as a service that patients may choose as a part of tailoring their own treatment plan. The other models, however, do not mention CAM as an important part of an integrative health care system. In fact, the models that leave CAM out can be seen as a subsection of the biomedical health systems literature on integration. This broad non- 3 Responsibility/accountability refers to practitioners actively participating in independent and shared decision making and responsibility for a treatment care plan. Co-ordination refers to providers making joint decisions about \"who will do what\", and the most effective treatment plan undertaken by the most \"appropriately qualified professionals\". Communication refers to the communication of both content and relationship where \"each professional is responsible for sharing with the other provider, clinical information regarding a patient and issues relating to decision making in a relevant, concise and timely manner\". Each practitioner is free to voice ideas and concems. The authors are careful to note, however, that the conveyed social status of the practitioner (superior, inferior) has a direct influence on how information is sent and received. Co-operation refers to \"acknowledging and respecting each discipline's approach to care. Assertiveness refers to the ability fostered by co-operation and communication to present opinions in a respectful environment. Autonomy refers to the \"authority of the individual providers to independently make decisions and carry out the treatment plan without contradicting the five previous tenets\". Lastly, mutual trust and respect binds all previous elements together as \"each provider must be able to depend upon the integrity of the others as the foundation for the professional relationship\", or all other elements cannot exist. 97 critical literature discusses integration of mainstream health care systems (e.g., the development of concepts and categories of integration, and attempts to 'link' different levels of the biomedical health care system to each other). Upon reading these models from a critical perspective, it becomes evident that many of their core principles and strategies, while commendable, are vastly under- theorized and will not 'work' when incorporating at times radically different CAM therapies and paradigms, and conducted by practitioners who have received different forms of professional education and socialization. For example, Leatt et al. state that care in an integrative health system must coordinate and integrate care across the continuum; must have information systems to link consumers, providers, and payers across the continuum of care; and that services should join together around a common vision and goals. Similarly, de Jong and Jackson state that effective health care integration must have clear communication between all providers; clear integrated clinical pathways and guidelines; trust and respect for other caregivers an organizations; collaborative involvement in planning, policy development and patient care delivery; and joint clinical and management guidelines. It could be predicted, however, that few of these aspects are possible when providers are working from opposing health paradigms. As noted above, how is it possible to coordinate and integrate care across a continuum, and to link patients and providers, when practitioners are not familiar with treatment strategies? How is it possible to achieve clear integrated clinical guidelines, when therapies stem from different ways of envisaging health and illness? How is it possible to achieve collaborative planning and policy development, when there is no common ground? How 98 is it possible to achieve trust and respect between biomedicine and CAM, when biomedicine has historically persecuted many CAM therapies? And finally, how is it possible to construct a fair and equitable method of payment and compensation for health services, when the majority of CAM therapies are not covered by public health insurance, and are paid for directly from the patients' own financial resources? Further, Leatt et al. state that greater attention needs to be given to patient autonomy, by allowing the patient to 'construct' a multidisciplinary health care team comprised of physicians and potential CAM practitioners, mediated by interprofessional arrangements; and monitored by a method of integration evaluation. This reflects conservative reductionist views that do not recognize power relations between practitioners and patients. Despite the merit of these core principles of biomedical models of IHC, the inclusion of CAM services as part of a multidisciplinary health care team essentially represents an 'add CAM and stir' mentality. The proposed integrative health system would remain reductionist and biomedical, having not addressed the inherent paradigm challenges of communication between practitioners. The discussion will now turn to a review of recent models of integrative health care from CAM theorists that show somewhat more sophistication. 4.3.3 CAM IHC Models In a publication by Health Canada entitled Perspectives on Complementary and Alternative Health Care (2001), a group of health theorists have prepared a collection of papers dealing with the current state of CAM in Canada. They also commented on policy issues such as the possibility of CAM as an integral part of the biomedically-based 99 Canadian health care system. In the Report, two papers were specifically aimed at discussing the nature of an integrative health care system that combined biomedicine and CAM. The concepts presented in these two papers will be reviewed next in detail, as they are widely regarded as one of the first major contributions to integrative health care theory in Canada, and perhaps internationally. The first paper, written by the entire group of theorists\u2014the Advisory Group on Complementary and Alternative Health Care\u2014outline expected outcomes, core values, key concepts, challenges, and strategies for the implementation of a national integrative health care system incorporating both CAM and biomedicine. They list expected outcomes for users as: satisfaction; choice; personal responsibility; quality of life; and access to programs, resources and user-friendly, non-partisan information. Expected outcomes for practitioners are listed as: optimal multidisciplinary cooperation and respect; professionalism; equal legal health practitioners; evidence-based practice; access to research resources; and access to health care institutions. Expected outcomes for policymakers are listed as: balanced and efficient resource allocation; accountability (such as safety of persons, evidence-based decision making, and efficient use of public monies); universality and accessibility of essential health services; and access to reliable, quality information. Following the pattern of biomedical writers, the Group lists 10 core values of an integrative health system that closely follow the biomedical lead except for the emphasis on multidisciplinary understanding: (1) Accessibility: all Canadians have equal access to essential health services regardless of residence or financial means; (2) Accountability: each party is accountable for its responsibility in care and use of resources; (3) Balance: 100 resources flow appropriately between and among wellness promotion, preventive care, disease treatment, and self-care; (4) Choice: capacity and resources to make personal lifestyle and health care choices optimize the likelihood of individual and community health; (5) Comprehensive Outcomes: evidence-based decision-making is done with assessment and consideration of a full range of outcomes including quality of life satisfaction; (6) Efficiency: efficient use of scarce resources; (7) Mutual Respect: multidisciplinary understanding and respect for diverse traditions and cultures, reflecting both consumer and practitioner cultures; (8) Responsibility: active participation and shared responsibility for health care are central to the roles of users, practitioners and policy-makers; (9) Universality: Canadians in all provinces and territories have equal access to and choice of integrative services; and (10) Wellness: health promotion and disease prevention are valued equally with disease/illness/sickness care. The Group lists six key concepts that they argue are vital to achieving an integrative system: (1) Planned action and resources should be based on a population health approach, balanced by individual variation, which supports not only clinical care but also wellness promotion, disease prevention and treatment, and self-care; (2) Product and practice issues should be appropriately balanced; (3) The public, practitioners and policymakers should have access to reliable, balanced information on evidence of safety and efficacy, upon which they can base decisions; (4) Funding should be available to develop and expand the capacity for quality research on complementary and alternative health care; (5) The definition of essential health services and payment options must be re-examined in light of public demand for CAM; and (6) Education of practitioners must be expanded to include greater diversity of health information, roles, skills, and structure. 101 Differing from the biomedical models of IHC discussed above, the Group then discusses five major challenges that they argue must be overcome before expected outcomes, core values or key concepts of an integrative health system can be realized. The first major challenge is what the Group calls 'product versus practice and informed consumer choice'. Tackling economic (but not explicitly, power issues), the authors state that there is a complex interdependence between product regulation\u2014some of which is under federal jurisdiction (in Canada)\u2014and scope of practice, education and training of health professionals and regulation of health disciplines, which primarily fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction. They note that 'natural' health products (e.g., herbs and vitamins) often are a major form of treatment, although many of these products are inappropriately regulated. Although the Office of Natural Health Products was created by Health Canada in 1999 to regulate safety and access of natural health products for Canadians, the authors feel that further dialogue is needed between professional associations and educational institutions that train CAM practitioners. The second major challenge the Group calls 'reliable evidence of safety and efficacy', referring to the fact that in some health care quarters, there is resistance to CAM approaches because of an assumption that they are not evidence-based, and therefore not safe and efficacious. This challenge is also referred to as the 'evidence debate'. Further complicating matters is the debate around the testing of CAM using the conventional strategies of double-blind, placebo controlled randomized trials. Some argue that aspects of CAM elude such testing. However, the authors argue that this is also true for many of the practices currently sanctioned within biomedicine and health care. The Group argues that it is essential that appropriate, rigorous and relevant means 102 be developed to systematically gather and disseminate information that is necessary to protect public safety, evaluate efficacy and contribute to better understanding of the role of a range of activities and promoting and protecting the health of Canadians. The third major challenge the Group calls 'expanded capacity for quality research'. That is, much research about CAM still needs to be done. To facilitate this research, the authors argue that the investment of funds and the commitment to a national research agenda for both CAM and integrative medicine is required. The fourth major challenge is stated as the 'definition of essential health services'. There must be recognition and distinction between 'essential' services and those that are less essential in an integrative health care system. The fifth major challenge is what the authors refer to as the 'education of practitioners'. They note that CAM practitioners practice a diversity of approaches, _ many of which are not consistently credentialed and that there exist widespread differences in licensing and regulation of CAM practitioners. Further, the authors point out that there are very few individuals within conventional institutions with the skills and knowledge base to adequately teach or incorporate CAM approaches in conventional medical school education. Likewise, many CAM practitioners have too little foundation in conventional biomedical approaches and practices to enable integrative care. Finally, the Group lists 10 major strategies to address the above challenges, and to work towards a fully integrative health system.* 4 (1) Promote extensive collaboration between key federal government groups, at the federal/provincial/territorial interface and ultimately between provincial/territorial groups and regional health authorities, and across a broad spectrum of stakeholders including the public, consumers, manufacturers, regulators, the voluntary sector, retailers, practitioners, delivery agency administrators, researchers, educators, and insurers; (2) Develop and evaluate various models for delivering integrative care in which respectful and professional collaborations between practitioners and service providers capitalize on the most effective, efficient and appropriate strategies to deliver high level health care to 103 In the second paper on integration from the Health Canada Report, entitled Combining Conventional, Complementary, and Alternative Health Care: A Vision of Integration, two of the authors, Tataryn and Verhoef, develop a 'vision' of integration. The authors argue that the existence and increasing emphasis on population health and patient-centred care in mainstream health systems provides possibilities for collaboration between CAM and biomedicine. For example, they suggest that research evidence is slowly revealing that socio-economic status, stress, lifestyle (e.g., smoking; exercise; diet; etc.) and sense of control are critical determinants of the health of populations. Further, patient-centred care, they note, is increasingly being recognized by family medicine, which has recently created a patient-centred model of six guiding principles, such as exploring both the disease and illness experience, understanding the whole person, and finding common ground regarding treatment management. Following this initial review of compatibilities between CAM and biomedical paradigms, Tataryn and Verhoef tackle the concept of the implementation of integration. The authors claim that integration is currently occurring at six different levels in the health care system, envisaged as an 'integration pyramid'. The six main levels, from top health policy; profession/regulatory bodies; institutions; clinics; practitioners; and consumers. Similar to the biomedical IHC models cited above, at the individuals, groups, and communities; (3) Develop a research agenda that looks at the safety and efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine and that includes development of best practice models for integrative care and the dissemination of proven models; (4) Provide health system users, health professional and policymakers with access to reliable, timely information; the training and services that enable them to use that information; and support for decision-making; (5) Reach consensus on the definition and parameters of \"integrative patient-centered care and outcomes\"; (6) Develop linkages and encourage cooperation among the groups creating standards and regulation for products, devices, and services; (7) Identify and/ or develop exemplar models of effective licensing and credentialing; (8) Review public funding of services and products defined as essential; (9) Develop appropriate incentives for the effective and optimal integration of, and access to, conventional/ alternative services; and (10) Address accessibility issues for those integrated services. 104 level of the consumer, the CAM-oriented authors argue that it is health care consumers who are most advanced in integrating CAM and conventional health care. Patients, after all, are selecting practitioners and products from all categories of health services to create a health care package that meets their personal needs and beliefs. This consumer movement, they argue, is causing a strong bottom-up pressure for integration at the other levels of health care. At the second level, that of the health care practitioner, the CAM advocates claim that the demand for CAM has spurred some conventional practitioners to make referrals to CAM practitioners (as noted earlier) and to become educated and to provide some CAM services. The phenomenon of assimilation is also noted, in that some CAM professions, for better or worse, are observed to also be increasingly absorbing and endorsing evidenced-based medicine approaches. At the third level, that of clinics, the authors identify an increasing number of new initiatives in Canada and the United States seeking to provide integrative health care in a clinic environment. The authors add unproblematically that while rare, the existence of CAM in biomedical teaching institutions is growing, such as in medical schools. At the level of professional/regulatory organizations, Tartaryn and Verhoef note that very recently, medical associations have allowed referral for particular CAM therapies, such as chiropractic (but only after a lengthy legal battle). At the level of health policy and health systems, the authors feel that while practically non-existent, particular 'signs' of integration are emerging, such as specific CAM services (e.g., acupuncture; chiropractic; homeopathy; naturopathy) being covered by some insurance companies (e.g., Blue Cross in British Columbia; Sun Life in Ontario). 105 In advocating their model of integration, Tataryn and Verhoef state that such a system would have positive outcomes for users of health services, practitioners/ service providers and policymakers. They claim that supporting integrative health care at all levels of a health system would contribute to developing seamless and transparent health care and delivery, and greatly reduce existing fragmentation and haphazardness. In outlining their model, Tataryn and Verhoef emphasize that the model would begin with evidence of: (1) safety and efficacy of the CAM treatment modality; (2) improved quality of life; and (3) the potential to prevent disease and illness. Acquiescing to the terms of biomedical research and evidence-based medicine, they agree that the criteria for evidence should be based on the results of both randomized controlled trials and other proven methods such as observational studies. Acknowledging issues of power, the authors then describe three possible models of integration at the health systems level: co-optation; co-existence; and systemic integration. A co-optation model of integration in their model refers to the delivery of CAM services by a biomedical practitioner. While aspects of co-opted integration already exist, Tataryn and Verhoef state that they are morally and ethically difficult to defend, as the original modality and practitioner do not receive fair recognition and compensation for their services by the 'official' health care system. They add that co- opted CAM services may be dangerous to the patient, as the full modality has not been mastered by the conventional practitioner. Co-existence, also currently taking place, refers to the practice of biomedical and CAM therapies and professions alongside each other. The authors argue that co-existence integration is also not ideal, as it fosters inter- professional isolation and mistrust, stifled knowledge flow, and places tension between 106 the practitioner and consumers who use both systems. Systemic integration, however, is their ideal model. This type of IHC would be system-wide, recognizing all levels from consumer to policymaker. Systemic integration from this perspective, would synthesize empirical evidence with clinical understanding and academic knowledge to provide an integrative health care system that balances the needs of consumers and practitioners with the longer term responsibility to society at large. This approach would thus fit a system of health care with caring for the body and promoting and maintaining wellness, to healing disease in the body, mind, heart and soul of the individual. Tataryn and Verhoef then describe how facilitating systemic integration could be achieved. At the consumer level, like their biomedical counterparts, they point to the need for better information about CAM. Like rational consumers, rational biomedical and CAM practitioners should be open and willing to discuss the use of the entire range of treatment modalities with their patients so that patients would then feel free to discuss their needs and preferences. Both biomedical and CAM practitioners would need to be aware and informed of each other's scope of practice, and to keep an open mind about each profession's ability to help patients. Sidestepping the difficulties of crossing paradigms stratified by power relations, they note casually that this also requires a different approach to training and education, and that all practitioners should be able to refer patients to each other. Calling for 'demonstration projects', they want pilot integrated health care delivery clinics to be established and evaluated. Rational comparisons would be made between IHC users and patients not seeking integrative care, and the results would be distributed among stakeholders and policy planners. Those clinics that demonstrate efficacy and high 107 consumer and practitioner satisfaction, just as with biomedicine, would be marked for further expansion. CAM services might also be implemented as part of hospital services (e.g., herbal and neutraceutical products such as nutrients, vitamins and minerals; or counseling for chemotherapy patients). Professional biomedical regulatory bodies could allow their members to make referrals to, and formally communicate with, other CAM professionals. More novel programs could include interprofession residencies and fellowships. Continuing integration at health policy and system levels could also be fostered by expanded government support and infrastructure, and by clarifying and regulating the logistical and fiscal responsibilities of the new system. The above summaries suggest that IHC models from CAM theorists have gone slightly further in addressing the complexities of combining biomedicine and CAM than their biomedical counterparts. For example, the models have recognized some of the challenges to IHC. Reflecting previous work by the WHO on health systems integration, one of the models (Tataryn & Verhoef, 2001) even recognizes that IHC, although not preferable, can exist in a 'co-opted' form. Yet, similar to the earlier critique of biomedical models and IHC ideal definitions, aspects of the above models also remain within the biomedicinal model. The possibility that equal access to CAM therapies, due to entrenched privatization, may never occur, is not acknowledged. The fact that funding for CAM research is at present resisted in Canada is not seriously examined. And although the CAM advocates recognize the relativity of evidence, biomedical evidence remains at the top of the 'evidence pyramid' in these models. Also, physicians would maintain their exclusive practice guidelines. Further, while it is noted that medical schools are expanding their CAM curriculum, it is 108 not noted that they are also appropriating and assimilating CAM modalities. As has already been discussed in detail in Chapter Two, the Canadian health care system is defined as a biomedically-dominant acute-care system, and for historic, economic, political and other reasons, the possibility that it is unlikely to change towards a preventative CAM system is not examined. In a third example, systems theory is widely and unproblematically drawn upon by today's biomedical and CAM proponents of integrative health care as a conceptual model for framing the location and conceptual relationship of biomedical and CAM modalities. As Capra describes, systems theory has been influenced by environmental theory that envisages how \"larger networks of organisms form ecosystems together with various inanimate components linked to the animals, plants and microorganisms through an intricate web of relations involving the exchange of matter and energy in continual cycles\" (1982, p. 279). Systems theory involves a study of the \"whole as a whole\" (Bell et al., 2002). Key to the concept of systems theory is that it is both 'dynamic' and 'emergent': it is dynamic because its properties evolve and change with time, and it is emergent because it is a complex system in which the whole is more than the sum of its parts (Bell at al., 2002, p. 136). As Bell et al. state, \"The larger system exhibits properties that are not the result of simply summing the properties of its component parts. Thus, no part by itself has certain properties that the larger system possesses\" (2002, p. 136). As Dacher describes (1995, p. 188), systems theory is an attempt to integrate or to create wholes out of parts: 109 It is, in essence, a science of wholeness. Its concepts and principles are based on the observation that nature is organized in patterns of increasing complexity and comprehensiveness, and that these larger wholes, or units, have characteristics and qualities unique to the whole and cannot be identified or accessed through an analysis of their component parts. For example, the human organism, composed of cells, tissues, and organ systems, contains qualities and characteristics that cannot be exclusively accounted for through the linear summation of its parts. These include the capacity for self-organization, integrated action and adaptability, will, intention, and creativity (1995, p. 188). As Dacher notes (1995, p. 188), in the 1970s George Engel, by using and drawing upon the principles of systems theory, developed the biopsychosocial model which is an expanded model of health and healing. As Dacher describes, Engel's intent was to extend the biomedical model to include the psychologic and psycho-social factors that are excluded from it. Current proponents of integrative health care, by drawing on systems theory, go further than Engel by developing a health continuum based on a hierarchy of healing systems. For example, Dacher's model of integrative health care, which he calls \u2014 an 'expanded medical model', is composed of four healing systems: homeostasis; treatment; mind/body; and spiritual. Dacher argues that by adopting the four healing systems or paradigms, the tension between biomedical and CAM modialities is resolved or 'disappears', and further, that the challenges of relying exclusively on select biomedical evidence is solved by using the methodology relevant to the specific healing systems: The adversarial distinction between conventional and holistic/alternative therapies disappears as we consider the intent, usefulness, and mechanism involved in each form of therapy and properly assign it to one of the four healing systems: homeostasis, treatment, mind/body, and spiritual. This is a more functional way to characterize a therapeutic practice than the current arbitrary and capricious view of its status as \"conventional\" or \"holistic/alternative\". To the extent that a practice, conventional or holistic/alternative, fits within a specific system, it then, by necessity, must attain its legitimacy and credibility through the disciplined exploration of 110 its efficacy by means of the research methodology appropriate to that specific system (1995, p. 192). He further goes on to state: This model is inclusive rather than exclusive, honoring and respecting the contributions, independence, and interdependence of each of these healing systems, and the integrity and professionalism of the many and varied practitioners whose practices, when proved efficacious through a rigorous system-based research methodology, serve as accepted and valuable resources for one or more of the healing systems. Reductionistic and holistic thinking, and conventional and alternative practices are each seen as essential components of a comprehensive intellectual process and a unified approach to health and healing. (1995, p. 192). Dacher's model is similar to Tataryn's 'four paradigms of medicine' (body, body/mind, body/energy, and body/spirit), which classifies CAM therapies into four main categories. The main point of Dacher's model is that by drawing on systems theory, biomedicine and CAM can be constructed to 'fit' together as equal aspects of a larger 'system'. As Capra suggests, the main purpose of systems theory as it relates to health, is to locate health as a \"multidimensional phenomenon involving interdependent physical, psychological and social aspects\" (1982, p. 322). Capra reinforces that the concept of 'dynamic balance', or dynamism, is an essential aspect of systems theory and health, and that the concept of health is one of 'dynamic balance' where an organism's innate tendency is to reestablish balance when disturbed: This notion of dynamic balance is a useful concept for defining health. \"Dynamic\" is of crucial importance here, indicating that the necessary balance is not a static equilibrium, but rather a flexible pattern of fluctuations of the kind described above. Health, then, is an experience of well-being resulting from a dynamic balance that involves the physical and psychological aspects of the organism, as well as its interactions with its natural and social environment (1982, p. 323). Thus, Capra argues that systems theory fits with many non-biomedical paradigms of healing such as traditional Chinese medicine. In envisioning a 'systems view' of IHC 111 over 20 years before it was attempted on a more wide-scale basis, Capra states: Such an approach to therapy will be multidimensional, involving treatments at several levels of the mind/body system, which will often require a multi-disciplinary team effort. The members of the health team will be specialists in various fields, but will share the same holistic view of health and a common conceptual framework that will allow them to communicate effectively and integrate their efforts systematically. Health care of this kind will require many new skills and disciplines not previously associated with medicine, and is likely to be intellectually richer, more stimulating, and more challenging than a medical practice that adheres exclusively to the biomedical model (1982, p. 336). Describing what an IHC model of care 'would look like' in the systems view, Capra notes: Some of the therapies address themselves to the physical aspects of this balance by dealing with the body's muscular system or with other structural elements; others influence the organism's metabolism; and still others concentrate on establishing balance through psychological techniques. Whatever their approach, they all recognize the fundamental interdependence of the organism's biological, mental, and emotional manifestations, and are therefore mutually consistent (1982, p. 345). The main critique of systems theory can be found in its ontology. It assumes a view of reality composed of inter-relating parts (i.e., systems) that work together to form a functioning larger system, despite that a form of synergy occurs by the whole surpassing the sum of its parts. Sociological varieties of systems theory are called 'structural functionalism' or 'organizational theory'. Systems theory has therefore been applied to many substantive areas such as the study of 'functioning' societies. The main critique of systems theory, however, is that it cannot account for dissensus or conflict, based as it is on a 'consensus' model of co-operation and participation. Despite that cooperation can often be constructive, notions of power related to an unequal balance favouring one 'system' over another, are either 'glossed over' or simply assumed not to exist. This represents a serious drawback to accepting systems theory as a viable 112 theoretical model for IHC. As Shiva argues: When an organism or a system is mechanically manipulated to improve a one- dimensional function, including the increase in one-dimensional productivity, either the organism's immunity decreases, and it becomes vulnerable to disease and attack by other organisms, or the organism becomes dominant in an ecosystem and displaces other species, pushing them into extinction (1997, p. 32). For example, Dacher naively suggests, similar to Leatt et al. (2001), that through his expanded model a form of 'triage' will occur. In this 'triage', the primary biomedical health care provider, having retrained in the principles of each health system, will become the \"critical triage officer\" who \"should co-ordinate and overview the various aspects of care\" (1995, p. 194). But given the history of these paradigms, the concept of triage must be problematized. On a broader level, systems theory cannot account for the occurrence that one healing system or paradigm could be more dominant than another. The foundational concept of systems theory of the 'whole becoming more than the sum of its parts' through dynamic interaction, while perhaps explaining how individual healing can occur when using multiple biomedical and CAM therapies, is not consistent with how biomedical and CAM professionals have so far been observed to interact in IHC settings. Specifically, the subtle 'give-and-take' of an ecosystem does not seem to be a representative metaphor portraying how IHC modalities interact. Thus, Capra's view of IHC, while attempting a 'universal language' (currently only biomedical) where health care professions establish a new healing system, has serious limitations. The universal synthesis of all healing modalities may thus be an unattainable and unwanted ideal. The distinction I am making here is between the appropriateness of systems theory for explaining individual healing versus the appropriateness of system theory for 113 understanding interactions of health care practitioners and professions from multiple healing systems. Overall, I suggest that IHC models to date have important practical and theoretical limitations. In the following chapters, I turn to the critical ethnographic findings from the study. 114 Chapter 5 CRITICAL ETHNOGRAPHIES OF INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS This chapter presents ethnographic observations of the three integrative health care settings in this study. The chapter also draws upon information presented in written documents gathered from each of the research settings, such as promotional materials and surveys that were readily available at each of the sites, as each of the IHC settings was being ethnographically observed. As noted in the introductory chapter, I chose to focus on a particular type of integrative health care setting that combined one or more biomedical practitioner and/or paramedical practitioner with various types of CAM or 'holistic' health care practitioners in a formally-organized health care setting. These types of integrative health care settings are in the minority, but are gradually increasing in numbers in Canada and the United States. They are outnumbered by integrative health care settings with multiple CAM practitioners without a biomedical practitioner (also commonly known as 'holistic clinics or centres'), as well as by IHC settings within biomedicine that combine multiple types of biomedical and paramedical practitioners (i.e., community health centres, or CHCs, and multi-disciplinary pain clinics). The distinction I am making here is important to the analysis that follows. The types of IHC settings in this study are only one form that may or may not survive in the future. For example, it is possible that holistic clinics without biomedical practitioners may keep proliferating. Thus they may always outnumber IHC settings with biomedical and CAM practitioners. The IHC settings with biomedical practitioners, however, offer 115 an opportunity to observe how CAM and biomedicine relate to one another at a micro- sociological level, and to address some of the questions raised above. It should be added here that IHC exists in countries such as China, India, Korea and Vietnam, in the form of nationally 'integrated' medical systems that combine 'traditional' or indigenous medicines with biomedicine (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM in China, and Ayurveda in India). IHC occurs in these countries such that traditional medicine and primary biomedical health care initiatives are both directed towards anti-HIV/AIDs and malarial campaigns (Bodeker, 2001; WHO, 2002). I identified IHC settings in this study as any health-related context or setting that _ coordinates a multiple number of biomedical and CAM practitioners, or combines biomedical and CAM approaches, with the intent to treat and/or heal patients or clients. As already described in detail above, these types of IHC settings can range from a small- scale independent clinic to a clinic within a hospital, or a freestanding institution. As the selection for the research sites began, I discovered that CAM and biomedical IHC settings were very limited in number in Canada. However, there existed a small number of new Canadian initiatives that matched some of the integrative health care settings in the United States. I was able to locate three of these 'new' IHC settings, which were: 1) The Centre for Integrated Healing, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, which could be classified as a small-scale independent clinic and a free- standing institution; 2) The Wasser Pain Management Centre, located at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, which could be classified as a tertiary clinic located within a hospital; and 3) The Sunnybrook and Women's College Hospital Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic Initiative, located in Toronto, Ontario, which could also be identified as 116 a new clinic initiative within a hospital. As will be described in more detail below, the third site selected for this study was a new initiative without a physical clinic location (although the proceedings and discussions for this initiative were undertaken in a hospital setting). Choosing this site for my research proved valuable in that it allowed me to document the process of establishing an integrative health care setting in Canada. As detailed below, in contrast to more 'new age' types of CAM practices, the CAM practices located in this research are more specifically classified as occurring within three of Tataryn's (2001) CAM classificatory framework: 1) Body Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine; Reiki; and Therapeutic Touch). The summary descriptions of these three IHC settings are critical, with my observations guided by the research questions regarding the dominance of the biomedical paradigm. That is, I focussed on critically relevant areas, such as: funding structure; the background of the various health care practitioners in the IHC settings; the types of programs and philosophy created by each of the settings; the types of therapies in the setting, and the types of patients that would be attending each setting. These observations (e.g., funding structure and philosophy) then guided my subsequent interviews. As the analysis for this study progressed, my initial observations were drawn upon to contextualize and highlight findings in the research interviews. 117 5.1 The Centre for Integrated Healing (CIH), Vancouver, British Columbia: 5.1.1 Background The Centre for Integrated Healing (CIH) was founded in 1996 as a non-profit society funded largely by private donations, and partially by the Province of British Columbia's Medical Services Plan (MSP). The Centre's main mission is to provide an integrated complementary cancer care programme for people with cancer and their families, and to encourage a holistic healing approach to cancer care that includes self- care, nutrition, vitamins, supplements, and a range of complementary medical therapies. The Centre is the first integrative cancer clinic in Canada, and the first to have physicians funded by a provincial government to provide complementary care. It is thus a unique IHC setting, established ostensibly on CAM principles to deal with a chronic disease that is a challenge to biomedicine. 5.1.2 Practitioners The Centre consists of five medical physicians and eight complementary medical practitioners. The medical physicians can be classified technically as general physicians (GPs) or family doctors. They are unusual, however, in that most have a philosophical orientation and pragmatic or personal experience with various non-biomedical paradigms of healing. These unconventional interests range from nutrition, supplements, clinical hypnosis and mind/body medicine (or psycho-neuro-immunology), to acupuncture, Tai chi, Qi gong, yoga, nature therapy and spiritual healing. For example, two of the physicians, one of whom is the Centre's director, have visited and studied in South 118 America, Africa and Asia. The Centre's eight complementary medical practitioners, called associate practitioners (APs), include a massage therapist, doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, registered nutritional consultant, naturopathic doctor, two homeopathic practitioners, holistic counsellor, and an integrative body work counsellor. 5.1.3 Physical Layout The CIH is located on the second floor of a newly-built building that houses other offices. Upon entering the front door of the Centre, one is immediately presented with black and white photographs of the Centre's staff and practitioners, located at the front of the reception desk\u2014in contrast to the typical biomedical practice in Canada. The front desk is staffed by one receptionist and two other staff who perform various administrative activities such as booking patients. Immediately to the right of the front desk is what is called 'the living room', or the patient waiting room. The most welcoming room of the Centre, the living room has four couches and two chairs, several plants, one video terminal, one computer, several lamps, and a large library of books, tapes and videos donated to the Centre. As opposed to a traditional medical waiting room, the living room welcomes patients into a relaxing atmosphere in which to wait for appointments. Immediately adjacent to the living room is the kitchen. The kitchen, donated by various sponsors, provides a practical classroom for the cooking classes offered by the CIH. Across from the kitchen, along a long hallway ending with the intravenous room are the practitioners' offices. The 'intravenous room', filled with comfortable chairs and lit by natural light from two glass walls, provides a relaxing environment where patients 119 receive hydrogen peroxide, vitamins C and B, ozone, and other intravenous injections administered by the naturopathic doctor. The first three offices house the four medical doctors, while the rest house the associate practitioners. The fifth MD works outside the Centre in a separate but related clinic. The geographical dominance of biomedical over CAM offices has been noted in other research (e.g., see Shuval, 2002). It could be argued that a similar geographical dominance was present here as well, in that the first offices encountered were those of biomedical practitioners. 5.1.4 Funding Structure The Centre, at the time of research, had 2.5 of the five medical doctors funded by the Province of British Columbia's Medical Services Plan (MSP). The MSP is the Province's funding organizational structure that provides for all medical services covered under the Canada Health Act. The medical doctors receive funding in salary form from the MSP for the specific purpose of extended patient visits of approximately one and a half hours. Accordingly, patients are not charged for visits with medical doctors. This places biomedicine in a clearly favoured position. The other half of funding for the medical doctors is provided by private donations. All the medical doctors work part-time at the Centre \u2014 approximately two to four days a week \u2014 to accommodate the funding structure. Private donations also account for the salaries of administrative and research staff, the Centre's library and kitchen, and help to subsidize the two-day introductory programme for patients and their families. Complementary practitioners rent office space in the Centre, where they locate their private practices. Complementary practitioners charge on a fee-for-service basis set 120 by the individual practitioner. Several of the CAM practitioners and three of the medical doctors also work simultaneously outside of the Centre in an additional private practice. For example, one of the medical doctors worked in her own private pain clinic, while the doctor of traditional Chinese medicine was located outside of the Centre in her own private practice. 5.1.5 Programmes and Activities The Centre offers a two-day introductory programme for patients and their families, private patient consultations with physicians (free of charge), consultations with associate practitioners and seven ongoing educational classes. The introductory programme consists of 12 hours of seminars and workshops over a two-day period, including an introduction to: complementary cancer care and healing; meditation; nutrition; visualisation; group sharing; decision making; vitamins and supplements, in addition to the opportunity to meet informally with the Centre's medical doctors and associate practitioners. The programme also includes and invites family members or other persons to support the participant and to acquire information during the seminars. For example, one seminar programme consisted of 20 participants and 13 family or friend support members. At the time of research, the programme occurred every two weeks with a subsidized cost of $280 Canadian, and $50 extra per support person, which included a two-month supply of vitamins with the retail value of $200 Canadian. Few family practices, or even holistic centres, are able to match this level of subsidization for new patients. 121 As noted, the Centre's medical doctors usually conduct private consultations of approximately one and a half hours with patients, after patients have completed the introductory programme, in order to 'fine tune' their personal cancer care programmes. Again, this is unusual in primary care in Canada, with patient consultations usually lasting no longer than 10 minutes. Patients have the option to consult with medical doctors with or without programme completion. Patients' private consultations with physicians involve the physicians taking a thorough medical history and reviewing participants' current medications. This is done, informants assured me, in order to exclude contraindications between vitamins or supplements and pharmaceutical drugs. Practitioners explained that in addition to ensuring a vitamin/supplement regime most appropriate for the patient, an appropriate follow-up plan is also made, including more in-depth consultations if necessary. Patients are encouraged to bring family members or other support persons with them to the physician consultation which is also not typical in biomedical primary care. Patients at the Centre may choose to work with and pay privately for one or more of the eight associate practitioners by contacting them directly. The Centre's eight ongoing classes include meditation, yoga, nutrition and cooking, Qi gong, support groups, and two classes of homeopathy. Other 'within house' activities at the Centre include doctor's meetings, held once every week. This practice will be critiqued in Chapter Seven, since these meetings consist only of the Centre's medical physicians and exclude CAM practitioners. The main purpose of the meetings, chaired by the Centre's director, is, in the words of informants, to \"discuss biomedically clinically-relevant information\". 122 5.1.6 The Centre's Philosophy In contrast to these subtle aspects of biomedical dominance, the Centre's philosophy is that 'illness is not separate from self? and that 'mind is not separate from body'. This differs from conventional and historic biomedical theory, where illness is usually separated from self/mind/spirit. The Centre is described as viewing how one feels as a crucially important element in the healing process. While the Centre's literature certainly recognizes the merits of conventional biomedical cancer treatment, it presents biomedicine as just one 'spoke in the wheel' of an integrated approach to healing. Specifically, in the philosophy outlined in the patient handbook, called the Blue Book, conventional biomedical therapies are represented as only one 'spoke' in a group of 13 others that include: supporting the will to live; spiritual and emotional connection with others; healthful diet and water; exercise; and adequate sleep and relaxation. The texts distributed by the Centre emphasize that all spokes are interrelated and contribute to the overall health of the patient, in that the total treatment is far greater than the sum of individual therapies. This is reminiscent of the systems theory thinking that pervades the IHC literature, however, here it may be more applicable to patients rather than professions. Further, the Centre's literature presents healing as a journey that is unique to each individual. It is recognized that what is of great benefit to one person may not necessarily be of benefit to another. In this sense, the Centre suggests that patients, in addition to receiving some professional guidance, reclaim their own inner wisdom and healing, and feeling of control, in order to design their own healing recovery plans. It might be argued that the model, while holistic, still avoids critical discourses of health 123 such as represented in neo-Marxist and feminist views of health. As such, it focusses, like biomedicine, on individuals rather than social groups at risk. 5.1.7 Philosophical Treatment Model Drawing on their holistic philosophy, the Centre has expanded the conventional biomedical tumour-centred model of cancer to create what they term a new person-based model that includes the 'spokes in a wheel' concept described above. The Centre rejects the old tumour-based model based on the conventional options of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer, all delivered through a patriarchal and hierarchical doctor/patient relationship where patients are told what treatments they are to have, resulting in loss of patient autonomy, empowerment and self in the healing recovery process. The Centre's new person-based model thus acknowledges surgery, radiation and chemotherapy alongside the other 'spokes' such as diet, prayer and exercise, where personal patient empowerment is honored and supported in a three-way patient/doctor relationship; and the self plays a fundamental role in healing and recovery, resulting in the enhancement of the patient's well-being and immune system and the support of the mind, body and spirit in the healing process. Despite philosophies that postulate the equality of the spokes in the wheel and the rejection of the tumour-based model, the Centre views particular spokes as more fundamental than others in terms of creating what the Centre calls a 'specific foundation of recovery', beginning with the will to live, hope and spiritual connection. Thus there is a commitment in the Centre's discourses to what they term holism, which runs counter to reductionist biomedical discourses. 124 5.1.8 Patient Demographics At the beginning of 2001 until July 2002, a demographic survey and analysis of 100 randomly-selected patient records was undertaken at the Centre by a separate research study, in addition to 16 randomly-selected qualitative interviews from the sample. The results indicated that 44 per cent of participants were male and 56 per cent female. Thirty-five per cent were between the ages of 51 to 60, 21 per cent between 61 and 70, 17 per cent between 41 and 50, 15 per cent between 71 and 80. Thirty-eight per cent lived in the lower mainland, 22 per cent in Vancouver, 35 per cent in other areas of B.C., and five per cent were from outside B.C. The top five cancer-related diseases in the sample were breast (29 per cent), colon (13 per cent), lung (12 per cent), and prostate cancer (11 per cent), and non-Hodgkin's disease (5 per cent). Prior to treatment at the Centre, 59 per cent of patients had undergone surgery, 43 per cent chemotherapy, 34 per cent radiation therapy, 15 per cent hormonal therapy, and 12 per cent other therapies. Thirty-three per cent of the sample began treatment at the CIH within one to three months of their initial diagnosis. Fifty-seven per cent had a follow-up visit with the medical physician at the Centre after their initial consultation. The top five treatments recommended or discussed by physicians during patient consultations were, in ascending order of significance: the use of vitamins or supplements; chlorescence herbal tea; flax seed oil; dietary changes; and complementary medical treatments. The top 10 complementary medical treatments recommended or discussed during physician/patient consultations were: traditional support groups; in addition to spiritual healing and herbs. The top six 125 biomedical therapies recommended and discussed by physicians were: cimetedine; indomethacin; 714X; Respivax; MRV; and maltrexone. The study was useful in showing the impact of lack of funding on CAM consultations: only 20 per cent of patients saw more than one associate practitioner; and only 33 per cent of the sample pursued any treatment with an associate or complementary practitioner: a nutritionist (18 per cent), naturopath (7 per cent), massage therapist (7 per cent), traditional Chinese medical doctor (6 per cent), homeopath (4 per cent), or relaxation or imagery practitioner (4 per cent). This may also have been a function of illness, however. Only 12 per cent of patients participated in the various classes offered by the Centre, with the highest attendance being cooking, followed by meditation, yoga and Qi gong/T'ai chi. Seventeen per cent borrowed books and resources from the Centre's library. Thirty-eight per cent of the sample pursued treatment at the Centre for a minimum of one month, 17 per cent for one to two months, 21 per cent for three to four months, 12 per cent for five to six months, six per cent for seven to eight months, and one to four per cent for nine months or more. At the end of the study in July of 2002, 30 per cent of the sample had died. Qualitative interviews and analysis with 16 randomly-selected participants from the sample surveyed by the clinic revealed that relatively inexpensive treatments were popular. The top 12 treatments or activities were diet (75 per cent), exercise (55 per cent), vitamins and supplements (50 per cent), meditation (25 per cent), healthy water (20 per cent), education and research (20 per cent), complementary medical treatments (20 per cent), green tea (10 per cent), relaxation (10 per cent), rest (10 per cent), an emphasis on spiritual life (10 per cent), and attending a support group (10 per cent). This points to a significantly higher rate of self-care practices by patients than indicated in the larger 126 survey. Forty-five per cent were referred by friends or family, 40 per cent by other cancer patients. Fifty-five per cent mentioned learning about complementary approaches for their specific cancer as reasons for coming to the Centre, while 25 per cent mentioned \u00a9 wanting to learn about the integration of conventional and complementary cancer treatment. This was ironic in view of the relatively low use of CAM consultation. Twenty-five per cent mentioned knowledge about nutrition as the most valuable aspect for them. Over 60 per cent of the interview participants created specific healing plans for themselves after physician consultations, and were able to implement the plan. Thirty- three per cent of the interviewed participants continued to follow up with the physician at the CIH, while 70 per cent did not, mentioning distance as their chief reason. Most telling was the fact that 55 per cent of those interviewed did not see an associate health practitioner at the CIH, mentioning cost as the primary reason. 5.2 The Wasser Pain Management Centre (WPMC), Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto: 5.2.1 Background The WPMC is a tertiary multi-disciplinary pain management Centre that is part of Mount Sinai Hospital. In 2000, a partnership was formed between Mount Sinai Hospital and the Michener Institute for Applied Sciences (Toronto) to establish an acupuncture service as part of the WPMC, and as an extension of the Michener Institute's Diploma Program in Acupuncture. At the time of research, the WPMC was the first Canadian hospital to have an acupuncture service linked to a program of acupuncture, staffed by acupuncturists trained as traditional Chinese medical practitioners in China. As such, the 127 WPMC represents one of the first IHC endeavours in Canada. The acupuncture service has the dual function of treating patients, and of serving as a practicum site (among 10 other sites) for senior students in the Michener acupuncture program. 5.2.2 Practitioners and Mission The WPMC's mission is to provide a range of effective care for complex pain conditions. The Centre has a wide range of biomedical, paramedical and CAM practitioners located both within the Centre and in other Mount Sinai Hospital departments. At the time of research, the Centre had 13 biomedical practitioners (including four neurologists, four anesthetists, four psychiatrists, and one intern); eight paramedical practitioners (including one registered nurse, five dentists, and two physiotherapists); and three CAM practitioners (traditional Chinese medicine, or \"TCM\" practitioners). 5.2.3 Patient Population and Referrals The WPMC receives patients with a diverse number of chronic pain conditions, including migraine headaches, pelvic pain, facial pain, various musculoskeletal conditions, whole limb and diffuse body pain. Patients are referred from their general practitioners. Patients are first mailed a lengthy questionnaire, which must be filled out and returned to the Centre prior to patients being admitted. The questionnaire and referral process, in addition to the high number of patients referred to the Centre, cause a considerable delay and frustration for patients entering the clinic. Patients are first seen by a biomedical specialist and nurse, after which time the patients' treatment protocol and 128 referral to other WPMC practitioners occurs. As with the Vancouver centre, access is to biomedical practitioners first. 5.2.4 Acupuncture Service and Physical Layout The WMPC is located on the eleventh floor of Mount Sinai Hospital on University Avenue in downtown Toronto. The acupuncture service is located at the entrance to the patient waiting area. The acupuncture service is in a self-contained suite with four treatment rooms and one office where TCM practitioners' patient files/charts are filed. It should be noted that CAM charts are stored separately from biomedical files. The waiting area contains an enclosed receptionist booth with two WPMC receptionists and other staff for the Department of Rehabilitation (who also share the reception). The majority of main patient charts are filed in the main reception area. The patient waiting area is arranged in traditional hospital style with molded fabric chairs and florescent | lighting, popular magazines and sparse biomedical d\u00e9cor. An east-facing wall of windows lets in partial natural light to this area. Directly following the waiting area are several examination rooms for biomedical and paramedical staff to conduct patient visits. The majority of physicians' offices, which also double as examination rooms, are located further down the hall, behind a private entrance. Also arranged in a separate enclosed area are the other health professional staff offices, located prior to entering the clinic. In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the acupuncture service received an estimated 314, 588, and 310 patients respectively. Patients must be referred directly from their attending WPMC physician in order to admitted to the acupuncture service, so that the biomedical practitioner serves as the gatekeeper. 129 5.2.5 Patient Therapies As indicated by the range of WPMC practitioners listed above, the Centre offers a variety of therapeutic options that include various pharmacologically-active agents for preventing pain, including analgesics; narcotic-based drugs (e.g morphine) and injections (e.g., Botox, used as an analgesic); physiotherapy, including mobilization and manipulation of soft tissues; bio-feedback; hypnosis; psychiatric and lifestyle counseling; and acupuncture. 5.2.6 Other Activities Other activities at the WPMC include weekly practitioner and educational rounds. As will be further discussed in Chapter Seven, practitioner rounds here have the main purpose of allowing discussion on patient 'cases' that need further clinical attention and practitioner coordination. Just as in Vancouver, these weekly lunchtime rounds are attended by the majority of WPMC practitioners. However, the TCM practitioners rarely attended (see Chapter Seven for further discussion). The educational rounds, also at lunch-time, occur every one to two weeks, and are open to the larger hospital community. These latter rounds feature guest speakers to present on topics related to pain. It should be noted that during my observations of these meetings, only two education seminars/rounds were presented on CAM (TCM; and meditation). These topics were poorly received by the audience, as evidenced by lack of overt interest, and in one case (the meditation seminar), condescending remarks were directed at the speaker during audience questions. 130 5.3 The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Clinic Initiative of the Toronto- Sunnybrook and Women's College Hospital (TSWCH): 5.3.1 Background Attending planning meetings for this proposed centre as well as interviewing key informants provided me with insights into a proposed TCM clinic initiative in the process of developing its policies, guidelines and physical space. In comparison with the previous two sites, the third IHC site did not yet have a physical clinic location in which to observe and interview practitioners and patients. Instead, a core group of 10 stakeholders were interviewed; three organizational committee meetings were observed; and key committee documents were analyzed. The group of stakeholders included, among others, the Chief Executive Officer or CEO, in addition to physicians and research analysts. In early 2002, the Toronto-Sunnybrook and Women's College Hospital (TSWCH), prominent teaching hospitals located in Toronto, undertook a three-way partnership with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto to establish a traditional Chinese medicine clinic at Sunnybrook and Women's Ambulatory Care Centre (or what was previously Women's College Hospital). The impetus for this initiative initially emerged from a proposal and investment from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau in Shanghai, China, to establish a traditional Chinese medicine clinic somewhere in North America. This investment was provided by the physical investment arm of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, a pharmaceutical company named Lei-Yun-Shang Limited, located in Shanghai. 131 The initial scope of the service was constructed as providing traditional Chinese medical treatment, health care services and rehabilitation, Chinese medicines, drugs, and TCM health products. In terms of financial and other commitment, the pharmaceutical company was to provide the initial monetary investment; TSWCH would provide the workplace and physical facilities; and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau would provide the traditional Chinese medicine experts and technical support. In addition, the pharmaceutical company would provide for the professional management of the clinic and traditional Chinese medicine and medical products. TSWCH would ensure appropriate professional legal and administrative support for the importation of traditional medicines and other related products. This was planned to enable establishing practices for visiting TCM specialists and handling relations with local government and community, in addition to establishing communications and marketing to promote patient flow. As agreed, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau would provide TCM specialists of high calibre and clinical experience and research, and also ensure their quality. In order to oversee the entire breadth of these services, a board of directors would be formed, made up of representatives of all three parties, under which would be a management committee. The stated objective of the clinic initiative was to open and operate a revenue- driven TCM clinic in downtown Toronto with three primary functions. These were expressed in the quality-of-investment business terminology that has become characteristic of health care discourse in Canada: 1. To provide high quality and accessible traditional Chinese medicine to the Canadian public; 132 2. To provide a venue for teaching, academic exchange, and for collaborative research involving Chinese, TCM and Canadian medical practitioners, professors and research investigators; and 3. To generate revenue streams that will sustain the operations of the clinic, finance research and, where appropriate, reward private investors. In addition, the proposed clinic was described in the discourses of holism and mutual respect characteristic of CAM models. For example, it was envisaged as striving to enhance mutual understanding and fostering improved relations between Chinese and Canadian medical practitioners; other professionals in the health sciences and services; between Toronto's Chinese and non-Chinese communities; and among academics and researchers at the University of Toronto, TSWCH, and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and its related institutions. The mission or goal of the clinic was simply stated as promoting good health by providing proven TCM treatment modalities as alternative and/or complementary approaches to biomedicine. The clinic anticipated operating at the highest possible TCM standards as demonstrated by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to embodying the University of Toronto's stated emphasis on excellence in teaching, ethical research practices; and on research outputs that would lead to positive health outcomes, policy outcomes, and innovative health care solutions and delivery strategies. The scope of practice of the proposed clinic was framed in health terms as the promotion, maintenance and restoration of health and the assessment, prevention and treatment of diseases, disorders and dysfunctions of an individual using traditional Chinese medicine treatment modalities such as acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine therapy, Chinese dietary therapies, exercise therapy, and Tuina massage. It was assumed that the clinic would draw liberally upon the knowledge, expertise, and wisdom of its 133 colleagues in Shanghai and upon the rich tradition of TCM in China, though none of the details were examined. The clinic was envisioned to function on a fee-for-service basis or as a private form of health care by providing expert clinical practice and consultation in all the areas of traditional Chinese medicine. The proposed areas for research and treatment included: cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, internal medicine, ageing, and pain management. An initial total of five TCM practitioners were to be sent from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to the proposed clinic in Canada. Due to Canadian regulations, it was recognized that the Chinese TCM practitioners could not use the title of 'Doctor', a significant indicator of biomedical dominance. However, they would have some prestige in that they were to be formally appointed through the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto as 'visiting professors of TCM', meaning that, in addition to being able to practice TCM within a clinical setting, they would also be able to teach, lecture and conduct research as professors of TCM in Toronto. The TCM practitioners, however, would not be authorized to give a biomedical diagnosis, or to prescribe biomedical treatments and/or pharmaceutical drugs to patients. This reflects the limitations on CAM observed at the other two IHC centres, and will be discussed in Chapter Seven. The proposed TCM clinic at TSWCH is unique in that if established, it would be the first ever TCM clinic in a Canadian teaching hospital or, indeed, in a Canadian hospital. The initiative also represents the first ever international collaboration between China and a Canadian hospital to establish an integrative TCM/biomedical clinic. It would also provide, as will be argued in the next chapter, a foothold within the publicly- supported Canadian health care system for private interests to flourish. 134 Chapter 6 THE ROLE OF PRIVATIZATION IN IHC SETTINGS IN CANADA Early in the analysis, it became apparent that aspects of privatization were deeply impacting IHC settings in Canada. A brief review of the nature of the Canadian health care system and privatization is required before discussing further research findings in this chapter. 6.1 A Review of the Canadian Health Care System and Privatization Canada's health care system is based on the principles of universal access to care, according to which patients are assumed to have 'free' access to biomedical health care providers and services such as family physicians, specialists and hospital care. Canada, however, has had a particular type of welfare state, a 'liberal welfare state' on which its health care system is based. Only modest universal health care transfers and public insurance plans are available, as compared to other countries such as Sweden and Austria with social democratic states (Esping-Anderson, 1989). Although Canada is classified as having a national health service or \"Beveridge-type\" health care system (Angus, 1998) with universal coverage for residents and financed by national general taxes, Canadians only have 'universal' access to certain health services over others. Canadians are thus left paying out of pocket, or must purchase additional private health care insurance for unfunded biomedical health care services or products. These include, among others, the majority of pharmaceutical drugs (unless admitted to hospital), and fees for paramedical professions (e.g., dentists; physical therapists). 135 Further, as indicated above, up to 73 per cent of Canadians are also using many other health care practices such as non-biomedical or CAM therapies that fall outside of biomedicine and universal health care coverage (Ramsay et al., 1999). A minority of CAM therapies are covered by additional private insurance packages, or partially subsidized by government (e.g., chiropractic) (Boon & Verhoef, 2001). The majority, however, are paid for without reimbursement to the patient, as CAM in Canada has traditionally existed only in the private sector. As Collyer states, \"CAM has generally been excluded from state support and financial subsidy, and it has not been granted a presence within public institutions\" (in Tovey et al., 2004, p. 81). Privatization refers to a process by which \"activities, assets, costs or control are shifted from the public to the for-profit sector\" (Leduc-Brown, 2000). According to Bendick (1989), the shift of responsibility for services from public to private can either be explicit and direct (i.e., when public services are contracted to private providers) or implicit and indirect (i.e., when government begins to disengage from service provision). Clarke (2000, p. 250) notes that there are many new incentives in Canada reflecting the development of private biomedical health care services, such as increasing numbers of walk-in family clinics; privatized laboratory tests; laser surgery; cosmetic surgery; privatized MRI tests; and attempts at establishing privatized hospitals such as in Alberta. The ongoing de-listing of paramedical professions such as physiotherapy, and the recent cancellation of partial provincial coverage for chiropractic in Ontario, suggests that CAM in Canada will continue to be entrenched in the private sector. These trends to further rationalize, bureaucratize, and privatize can be attributed to global economic forces driving the Canadian health care system. For example, as 136 mentioned in Chapter Two, the 'logic' of medicare argument suggests that all publicly financed health care systems must inevitably control public spending through rationalization and bureaucratization, to prevent public health care costs from further 'spiralling out of control' under the guise of universal health care. Analysts are suggesting that the world has now shifted from a state of 'monopoly' to 'global' capitalism, characterized by a 'rolling-back effect' of all welfare states' provision for publicly-funded social and health services; and the state's lessening resistance to \"big business' interests in privatizing and rationalizing health care and other social services (Teeple, 2000). 6.1.1 Privatization in the Keynesian Welfare State While privatization has always existed to some degree in all publicly-financed health care systems, the Keynesian welfare state is viewed by advocates of globalization and capital as a 'barrier' to expanded global reproduction, which needs to be 'unburdened' (Teeple, 2000, p. 97). As Teeple argues, while the Keynesian welfare state was previously useful to capital, it is useful no longer. This 'unburdening' of the Keynesian welfare state is most usefully viewed as a 'blurring of boundaries' that gradually introduces the private into the public sector. As Teeple suggests, the least visible form is the incremental degradation of public benefits and services, which ultimately reinforces privatization and a two-tiered system. As Teeple states: The least visible and yet a widely taken route of privatization is the policy of incremental degradation of benefits and services. By increasingly restricting public services through rising eligibility criteria or declining quality, and by allowing income benefits to fall behind the rate of inflation, the policy eventually reaches its objectives: to create pressure for improved quality and benefits to be met by the private sector. The 137 public health-care systems provide good examples of this form of privatization with the growth of user fees, deductibles, and restricted treatments, operations, and facilities while at the same time a variety of incentives encourage private insurance and medical treatments. The interim goal of many governments would appear to be a two-tiered system: private but publicly supported medical treatment for the well-off, and a degraded state programme for those who cannot afford to pay for private care (2000, p. 110). Further, privatization of the public can also be viewed as the 'inward' expansion of capital versus the outward or global form. Inward expansion is linked to consumerism and commodification. As Teeple states: Consumerism is the commodification of socio-cultural needs; it is the penetration of capital into all facets of human need - satisfaction previously fulfilled outside the realm of contract. It is, in other words, the commodification of everyday life, of culture in the broadest sense. Such subjection to the demands of capital means that all socio-cultural dimensions of life become dominated by corporate interests; the corporation comes to determine broadly the main cultural boundaries and to define and structure human needs so that they correspond with society as marketplace (2000, p. 134). Indeed, the Canadian health care system is now a billion-dollar industry second to only the United States, with over 100 billion Canadian dollars generated in 2001 (CIHI, 2002). The percentage of health care of GNP is only predicted to rise (Clarke, 2000, p. 255). There appears to be a constant striving for the creation of goods and services in health. As noted earlier, complementary/alternative medical products and services are part of this trend, with approximately $13.6 billion Canadian spent in 1999 alone. There are three important aspects of the Canadian health care system that I will argue have a significant impact in IHC settings. First, the privatization of health care, either biomedical or CAM, can be predicted to lead to decreased patient access to health care services for those of lower socio-economic status. Further, the existence of private health services contradicts the first tenet of the Canadian Health Act, that of universal 138 access to care. As many have noted recently, much of Canada's publicly-funded health care system is already private and under continuous threat of privatization. As Armstrong and Armstrong state: \"most hospitals and other institutions are owned by a wide variety of organizations, not by the State. Most doctors are in private practices and most services such as home care are purchased by the government from other organizations\" (1996, 187, in Clarke, 2000, p. 250). As Clarke argues, a partly privatized two-tiered system is now a reality in Canada, where increases and expenses for private health care are rapidly increasing, while public financing slowly decreases. For example, between 1991 and 1997, private health care expenditures grew by 30 per cent, while public expenditure decreased by 1.6 per cent (Fuller, 1998, p. 6). Decreased public expenditures and disengagement with public services is leading to the privatization of certain health care services, such as home care. Yet, as many studies have historically indicated, there is a positive and clear relationship between individual income level, and the ability to use medical services prior to the implementation of public health insurance in Canada (Medicare). Even prior to Medicare, low-income groups visited biomedical physicians over 10 per cent less often than those in higher income groups. After Medicare was implemented, this pattern was reversed, in that low-income groups were more likely to visit their medical doctor. Thus it could be argued that Medicare entrenched biomedical dominance in Canada. If privatization in Canada, however, is as widespread as some analysts suggest, then is not the first and fundamental tenet of health care, that of 'universality', being undermined? Second, it has become apparent that health care insurance in Canada, while marginally resolving inequities in access to health care services, did not radically alter the 139 health status of Canadians. As Clarke suggests: In spite of the equal availability of health care to people of all classes and the disproportionately greater use of medical care facilities by the poorer classes, health continues to vary by class. People of the lower classes still live shorter lives and have more days of disability during these shorter lives. The health of those of lower income and education in Canadian society continues to be poorer than that of those of higher socioeconomic status (2000, p. 249). As the influential Black Report (1982) convincingly argues in its evaluation of Britain's National Health Service and its impact on the health of the British population, illness results primarily from social determinants such as class differences, resulting from such material aspects as the conditions of work; adequate supply of money to provide for nutritious foods; and other materialist aspects of health. Age, gender, occupation, marital status, rural/urban background, religiosity, size of social network, and ethnoracial background, also intersect class and affect health in varying ways (Clarke, 2000). This is also true internationally, where health and colonialism are linked (Doyal, 1981). Low socio-economic status is consistently associated with ill-health and disease, including infections and parasitic diseases, degenerative and chronic illness, and disability. For example, a 1994 Statistics Canada survey entitled Health Status of Canadians indicated that 73 per cent of those in the lowest income bracket had a health problem, versus only 61 per cent in the highest income bracket. Concerning specific health conditions, the lowest income group was significantly more likely to have emotional illness (nine times); emphysema (five times); stomach ulcers and heart trouble (four times); arthritis (three times); digestive problems and recurring migraines (two times), than the highest income group. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated a relationship between income and mortality, indicating that people with an income loss of 140 greater than 50 per cent over five years were 30 per cent more likely to die (McDonough, 1997). Moreover, because people in lower income groups are sicker, they are less able to work, and therefore are less able to afford privatize health care treatments. Third, as outlined in the literature review, the Canadian health care system remains biomedically dominant in the health care division of labour, despite many challenges to biomedicine on patient, professional and state levels. And publicly-funded health care remains restricted to biomedically-based treatment modalities and practices. Biomedically-funded health care services, as Swartz (1987) argues, can be traced directly to the implementation of national health care insurance. Swartz suggests that health care insurance did not alter the control of medical doctors over health care practices and services, but instead, left control of the health care system with physicians as part and parcel of their status as the dominant upper class. Further, Angus (1998, p. 28) and Grinspun (2000, p. 36) suggest that decisions made by physicians today continue to have a significant impact on resources and health care practices in the health care system, while physicians remain as 'gatekeepers' for patient access to hospital services. This, of course, was expected to significantly influence the IHC settings in this research. It was found that three aspects of services were affected by biomedical dominance: patient access, continuity of care and the commodification of CAM services. 6.2 Patients' Experiences: Privatized Services and Inequitable Access to Care At all three IHC sites, patients were required or were anticipated to pay out-of- pocket for certain modalities or therapies, both biomedical and CAM included. Concerning biomedical therapies, patients were required to pay for those therapies not 141 covered by the clinic or hospital's global health budget, Canadian health care insurance, or the patient's extended health care insurance plan. At the WPMC, for example, patients were required to pay for certain drugs, orthopaedic devices and the pool physiotherapy programme. There were also fees for administration upon entering the clinic, and for particular analgesic injections facilitated by doctors. At the WPMC, acupuncture patients were required to pay for all CAM therapies provided. Eight out of 10 patients interviewed indicated difficulty in affording private treatments. They struggled most to pay for pain-relieving analgesic injections\" and private acupuncture treatments. For example, one 50-year-old female patient at the WPMC, suffering from chronic lower pelvic and lower back pain since 1993, described her experience of being a single mother trying to cope with the costs of the privatized treatments she was receiving. Having spent approximately $5,000 on non-reimbursed treatments (which included those at the WPMC), she conveyed her distress at trying to afford privatized health care costs, both biomedical and CAM, along with other financial constraints such as her son's university tuition fees. She also conveyed to me her struggle with health care insurance companies to cover her out-of-pocket costs. When asked if she was suffering a financial burden, she replied: Yes, I am, definitely. My son's in college so he's\u2014it's $13,000 for him this past year. Now I find that my Botox isn't covered. Now Dr. G. just told me today I could try my insurance company because they might do it because, you know, it's something I need. But I was disappointed with my insurance company, actually, because Dr. G. wrote a letter and they just came back with a \"no\". 5 . . : Botox was used here as an analgesic rather than as a cosmetic technique. 142 When asked how she was surviving financially, this patient responded: Well, I just, you know, I'm trying to do the best I can. I'm okay for now because I haven't really been off work for a long time. But then it's going to start changing and I don't know how that's going to work. And that bothers me in a lot of ways, you know. And finding out that I'm not covered [for] Botox, that even made it a little worse. When asked if she anticipated having to terminate any of the private treatments, she replied: I may have to, yes. It just depends. You know, what am I going to do if I need more? Like I've got two vials, and he wants me to have three more. And now where am I going to get it paid for, you know? A second woman of similar age suffering from chronic neck and shoulder pain since 1996 described her struggle to pay for private health care. When asked her main reasons for stopping acupuncture treatments, she replied: \"I spent about $300 a month that isn't covered by my benefits on health care, so that's why I don't go to acupuncture any more\". When asked if she thought acupuncture should be covered under hospital insurance, she emphatically stated: I do not think you [should] have to pay. I think you should not pay for it. I think that it's a medically proven effective way of curing chronic pain and alleviating chronic pain, and there are a significant number in the population that would subscribe to that, would believe in that; not just [Asians], but other people too. And it's safe, and I think that it should be covered. A third female patient at the WPMC suffering from a chronic pain condition due to fibromyalgia following two consecutive car accidents, also reveals the inequity perpetuated by private services illustrated by the two previous patients' experiences. When asked how she was able to afford the private biomedical treatments she was receiving, she replied: 143 Well, I wasn't able to actully afford to pay for Botox, that's why I had so much pain for so long, until Dr. G. was nice enough to call me and said that there was a demonstration that he had for other doctors. And when he does that to teach them how to do the injections, the company provides the Botox for free. So he used me as, you know, the person to do that. So that helped me. As revealed by this patient, she was only able to receive the treatment by participating in a pharmaceutical company-sponsored drug demonstration. Thus she became part of company marketing. This patient also described a lengthy struggle with her work-based insurance company to pay for the private treatments she was receiving. She stated: \"For a long time, actually, I paid from my pocket because they didn't cover it. Now I got to the point I can't any more because I haven't been able to work for two years now\". She added: \"My insurance company, just for no reason, stopped all my treatments, regardless, from physio to acupuncture to any other things that I've done\". Fortunately for this patient, she had just won a legal battle with her insurance company to cover all prescribed private treatments, as her insurance company had finally validated her illness as 'real'. Thus, in a private system, insurance companies help decide whether patients receive treatments. WPMC physicians were well aware of the financial strains faced by patients needing new private, biomedical treatments. As one physician explained: The way I get around the issue of affording [private treatments] is I do a lot of demonstrations and teaching on Botox. So once a month people come in to observe, so I bring patients in who can't afford it. I don't charge them anything...and they get it for nothing. So I have that option. This particular physician pointed to his ethical concerns about choosing certain patients for private drug demonstrations. Describing a situation where ethical concerns took precedence over marketing, he explained: 144 What in fact happened was that I thought she [the patient] would benefit from Botox, I wanted to treat her, but it would cost easily 1500 bucks with the Botox... which she didn't have. So the company actually asked me to demonstrate this technique to other practitioners, so essentially we bring in two or three practitioners, I would talk to them and I would then inject one of my patients, and sometimes we would get good results. But I began to have concerns about that from an ethical point of view in two ways: I was choosing who would be done, and a lot of them couldn't afford it, so the question is \"why is this one chosen over that one?\" Is it favouritism? The other thing is that if it works it has to be repeated every three months. So is it ethical to start a programme that is helpful? So I think we're not going to do that very much anymore. It became like almost a two-tiered system, the worst sort.... If anyone actually audited who I did, they might say \"Well how come you chose certain patients over others?\" So I didn't like it. But on the other hand, that was the only way to treat patients. [emphasis added] In the above example, equity is observed at the whim of the health professional and the drug company. One physician described her personal way of 'helping out' patients in financial need by modifying her choice of treatments. In this particular case, if patients needed acupuncture but could not afford it, she would administer acupuncture herself (although it would be medical acupuncture versus TCM style), with only a very small administration fee ($10). If the patients could afford the $50 fee for the acupuncture clinic, however, she would then refer patients appropriately: I usually think about finances...with each of the patients. So if they can pay for it I usually refer them over there [to the acupuncture service]. Also if it's something very short term...then I'd rather just do it myself because then they'll be on the waiting list. Some patients who could not pay for private biomedical or CAM treatments explained that their illness had prevented them from working in full-time employment, thus further limiting their financial ability to pay for private treatments. It was only through unforeseen opportunities such as the charity of the doctor to invite the patient to 145 participate in a drug demonstration, or a hard-fought battle with an insurance company, that patients of low socio-economic status could benefit from private treatments for a longer period of time. In each case, individual patients who need care come up, as individuals, against well-heeled corporate institutions. In such a system, indigent patients receiving biomedical treatments through a drug demonstration also have an advantage over other indigent patients awaiting acupuncture at the WPMC, as there were no free trials for acupuncture. As one physician commented regarding the cost to patients for acupuncture: I would like to probably refer more [patients to acupuncture], but there's a cost implication. And most of the patients I see cannot afford the cost of acupuncture. Most have been out of work for many years and have economic problems, and most of the health plans don't include acupuncture as part of the benefits. So it becomes, as I say, more of an economic issue than anything else. A different WPMC practitioner explained how, in her opinion, private treatments in a hospital confuse patients: I think part of the problem here is that because patients have to pay for services, that always creates some difficulty for some patients. There are patients [who] feel that once you come into a hospital, you don't pay for anything. So there's a paradigm shift there that has to be worked out\u2014 I'm not sure that I have the answer for it. Another physician, while recognizing that patients with fewer financial resources are less able to access privatized health care services than patients with more financial resources, linked access to health care services to the larger context of priority-setting for health care between biomedicine, the public, and insurance companies, and tensions between public/private financing of heath care. As he explained, So I think that access to certain services is very limited. I think that there's a disadvantage there. It's quite possible, for instance, to say one sort of treatment is the best thing for certain kinds of pain conditions than 146 other kinds of services.... But you know, if someone can afford $20,000 to pay for bypass surgery, that's what it costs, should they be able to buy bypass surgery at the Toronto General Hospital or not? And right now you can't because that's a government-funded service. The trend is to get more and more things excluded from government funding. As of June, 2005, a Quebec court has ruled that individuals can seek private care if they are on long waiting lists. This is not yet the case in Ontario. Further elaborating on the tensions concerning priority-setting for certain therapies over others, the physician cited above went on to speculate: If you say everything should be funded, then we'd all go bankrupt. If you say, however, that there should be standards of care, that may be the way to go. In other words, what is the standard of care for this? Establish in some way [a] study of people... for instance in pain management [to determine] what should the standard of care be? Should the system allow $10,000 to be spent on Nervalon which is useless or should the system allow $10,000 to be spent on a psychologist's time? Psychologists can deal with, you know, 30 people for three months, for $10,000 in group therapy. So it's actually reallocation. It is interesting to note that the physician has 'bought into' the quality/cost, 'evidence based' discourse of contemporary health care. This physician added: If you decide that you want everyone to have access to all sorts of treatments, whether naturopathy and irridology and what everyone is calling aromatherapy, so you decide that\u2014how do you decide and why would you begin to pay for that? What evidence do you have? I mean, so maybe it's cultural, it's value, people believe, you know, the so-called placebo effect or whatever it is. But I don't know. You may want access to everything. But I mean, that would be impossible. Further elaborating on the tensions between private and public services, a patient commented: \"Well I do find it curious that they have this private clinic as it were, functioning in [the hospital]. But nevertheless, if I think [if acupuncture is] going to work for me, I'd go for it\". Few public venues exist for these debates, as they are decided in the cases of individual patients. 147 A minority of patients were able to afford private treatments at the WPMC. As one patient commented regarding her payments for acupuncture: \"I have a business and it's a successful business. I'm very fortunate that $40 is not something that I questioned\". Another patient who had spent approximately $10,500 on private health care treatments joked: \"I made a number of good investments\". She was aware that she was supporting the private sector, however, as well as the inequities that private services involve: Because I had gotten the injury in France and didn't have insurance at that time, I could not get any kind of insurance, medical insurance. And now I have a pre-diagnosed condition, so I'm out of luck.... If the insurance companies are not covering it, then there should be some other means of patients being able to get it, because it makes such an enormous difference in their life.... [Botox] wouldn't be covered in my case. But it is the only treatment that I've had that has had no negative side effects. Promoting the benefits of Botox as a new (albeit private) treatment, this patient elaborated: With Botox, I think it's just been a phenomenal discovery, and it is expensive right now, but the alternative for other patients is to take a less expensive drug which would be some opiate. And if you're taking opiate, it does not get rid of the pain. It dulls it, but it also dulls your whole mind and you do not have a clear head. With the Botox, you know, I can have moments of brilliance, whereas before I was just a zombie. I couldn't even look at the computer for more than about an hour because it started like burning a hole in my head, it was hurting me. At the Centre for Integrated Healing, patients were also required to pay for all CAM and certain biomedical treatments. Patients were required to pay for all complementary medicines such as herbs and supplements, physical treatments, and for consultations with associate practitioners (e.g., the traditional Chinese medical doctor, the homeopathic medical doctor, the registered massage therapist, the registered nutritional consultant, and the integrative body work counsellor). As mentioned earlier, a few CAM 148 treatments were subsidized by the Centre's global health budget for the two-day introductory programme, which included a two-month supply of cancer-fighting supplements as part of the general fee. There was no subsidization, however, for any treatment or consultation provided by associate practitioners, which also included other types of physical medicines such as traditional Chinese medical herbs. Further, the only biomedical service at the CIH covered by health insurance was consultation with physicians; new pharmaceutical drugs were paid for by the patient. Similar to the WPMC, as noted earlier, a recent survey of 100 randomly-selected patients at the CIH had found that one-third could not afford seeing a private associate practitioner due to financial constraints. Finally, at the Sunnybrook and Women's proposed traditional Chinese medicine clinic, it was anticipated that patients would pay for all traditional Chinese medicine treatments including acupuncture, herbs and massage. In summary, the primary consequence of patients having to pay for non- reimbursed biomedical or CAM health care practices and modalities was that many patients could not afford the treatments and ultimately stopped receiving them or seeking them out. This 'dilemma' has also been observed in the United Kingdom, which somewhat parallels Canada's health care system (Paterson and Peacock, 1995). This situation thus approximates class-based access to biomedicine that existed prior to the institution of health insurance. Health-wise, poor patients experienced a disrupted care plan that involved the premature termination of an integrative form of care. 149 6.3 CAM Practitioners' Experiences with Private Health Services: The Constraints of Private Practice and Fragmented Care The fact that CAM practitioners operate in the private health care sector also had a significant impact on the organization of clinical care. As CAM practitioners are essentially private entrepreneurs, they have various commitments that prevent them from attending group rounds with other practitioners. These commitments involve scheduled appointments with patients as well as teaching responsibilities. For example, at both the CIH and the WPMC, CAM practitioners had appointments with patients at hours that prevented them from regularly attending group rounds and meetings. At the WPMC, traditional Chinese medical practitioners also had teaching responsibilities that often coincided or conflicted with rounds. As one of these practitioners commented: \"So after my class, usually if I don't have a meeting, if my time is free, I will go\". Another practitioner, commenting on whether or not he is able to attend group rounds, stated: It depends on my schedule and teaching. So pretty much every week, you know, if I'm busy I just don't go. Like this semester I'm teaching Wednesday till 1:00 p.m. which conflicts with the rounds, so I just don't go. It's unfortunate. Biomedical and paramedical practitioners also commented on the low and decreasing attendance of the TCM practitioners at the WPMC. As one physician commented of CAM practitioners: [T}hey're not here that often, and maybe they're here when I'm not here. I'm only here Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, so maybe they come on Mondays and Fridays, I don't know. So we just don't see each other. They used to come to rounds very regularly. I don't see them as much now, I don't think, as I used to, although they still come, but I don't see them as much. Another health care practitioner commented: \"And that's also the complication of the fact that we're on opposite hours. Acupuncture is here in the afternoon, I'm here in the 150 morning at the Pain Centre, right, so I mean really, that's sort of our window of opportunity\". Several CAM practitioners linked the private nature of their practice with disrupted schedules and financial difficulties. For example, one CAM practitioner at the CIH stated the following: \"The way the Centre is set up, associate practitioners are really small, independent businesses, so we are not on staff. We are not paid staff. We essentially rent our rooms and run our practices\". Another CAM practitioner at the CTH, explaining why she was unable and unwilling to attend doctors' meetings, explained: One of the reasons is sometimes it's financial. I can't afford to, you know, spend an extra hour of time sitting there [when] I can be doing something else. The doctors get paid doing it, I don't. So I lose an hour or so, so I don't bother. Not being able to attend formal group rounds or meetings is a direct result of the fact that CAM services are not publicly funded. In order to cope, CAM practitioners developed a style of clinical communication with other practitioners that could be called 'hallway rounds'. Hallway rounds refers to the communication of clinically relevant information outside of a formally-designated meeting time or location, where clinical information is communicated in an informal, verbal, and sometimes rushed manner in places such as hallways, corridors, or doorways of offices. Describing this practice, one CAM practitioner explained: If there is a problem during one of my treatments of a patient that I want to check with the doctor, then I just hustle down the hall and see if one of the doctors [is] free and, you know, if there are some suspect signs and symptoms I try to double-check with them. Further explaining this practice, one biomedical doctor explained: We wait for the [CAM practitioners]. We don't have any formal referral system. If the [CAM] practitioner needs to meet with one of the doctors to 151 discuss the case, they're more than welcome to meet with us any time they want, to catch us in the hall, or meet with us to find out more about the case [added emphasis]. When asked if it would be beneficial if CAM practitioners were paid to attend doctors' meetings, one CAM practitioner stated: I think it would be very beneficial because there's a lot of things that we can discuss, you know, more in terms of therapies, alternative therapies, approaches, things that I've done more investigations on and they haven't done that. Things that were more taught in naturopathic school, little things, you know, and those things they don't know about. It's just like I said, I just cannot afford to sit there and, you know, waste an hour of my time. This practitioner went on to state: I think that would be great. The case studies\u2014I've presented at the Cancer Treatment Centre of America where they have oncologists working with naturopathic doctors and they both are salaried\u2014and over there, at lunch time, they would see patients in the morning. All the practitioners would get into the lunch room, and the doctors and the naturopath, would be sitting down and the oncologist would be teaching the naturopath on some of the chemotherapy drugs, side effects, what to look for. And the naturopath would say, \"These are the vitamins, these are what I'm recommending to you\". So there's more communication between the two of them. Another CAM practitioner, explaining why he thought attending group rounds would be helpful, simply said: \"I think the doctors would like to know what can benefit their patients and what we can do for their patients\". A third CAM practitioner went on to state that due to the fact that she could not regularly attend group rounds, the clinic team was not familiar with her either personally or professionally, which ultimately prevented her from becoming a part of the health care team. She stated: We didn't go to rounds very often. Maybe they are not very familiar with us, you know, because if you go there all the time you become a part of the team and it's very much involved. I think that they would approach you more, but we didn't go. 152 The fact that CAM practitioners could not attend group meetings could be viewed as a significant challenge to the development of an integrative care model at each of the sites. For example, if CAM practitioners are unable to discuss clinically-relevant information regarding patients in a focussed and detailed manner with other practitioners, including biomedical doctors, then the co-ordination of care between practitioners of multiple healing paradigms is at risk. For example, there are potential side effects between modalities; at the very least, such fragmentation belies the claim of 'integration' and risks a reduced level of care and effectiveness for patients. But the development of hallway rounds was the norm, and biomedical doctors seemed very comfortable and even confident that they were receiving adequate clinical information from the CAM practitioners regarding patients that they shared. The level and continuity of care that was being achieved through this style of interaction, however, can be questioned. 6.4 The Commodification of CAM in Biomedical Institutions I have argued here that the differential availability of public and private services seriously disrupts the co-ordination, implementation and integration of clinical care amongst patients and practitioners in IHC settings. The combination of financial shortfalls and promise of income from private services, however, also makes a difference in the way these health services are viewed. That is, CAM was being viewed by health care institutions intent on the integration of health care services as a commodity for generating revenue, increasing profit, and ultimately lowering deficits in institutional health budgets. 153 A commodity, one can suggest, is a phenomenon, either material, (i.e., object) or immaterial (i.e., process) to which additional meaning is attached independent of the original phenomenon. In traditional Marxist theory, commodities are viewed as an aspect of production in which material phenomena, through social relations, become exchanged and 'commodified', thereby taking on both symbolic and monetary value with the intent to generate profit. In other words, a car is simply a piece of metal until value is placed upon it. While commodities have traditionally been viewed as material objects to be bought and sold, immaterial processes and phenomena have now also achieved commodity status in advanced or global capitalism. For example, knowledge itself or information technology is sold. Similarly, health care practices are also sold. Pharmaceutical drugs and health care technology are clearly commodities in capitalist society, but in a fully privatized system in can be argued that the service of health care, or the act of caring and the receiving of this care, becomes further commodified. Both health care treatments and services have been commodified to varying degrees, as represented by the profit-driven pharmaceutical industry, health care technologies and the profit-generating nature of privatized health care service providers. Marx's \"commodity fetishism' by which certain commodities attain great symbolic meaning, means that they take on a 'life of their own' independent of their production through human labour. This is evident in fashion or health food trends. In the context of the proposed Sunnybrook and Women's TCM clinic initiative, complementary medicines, in this case TCM, took on aspects of commodification and commodity fetishism. Specifically, in discourses about creating an integrative TCM clinic within a hospital, TCM was viewed by individuals at the senior level of fiscal 154 management as an 'untapped resource' with a potential for profit, as part of a business- oriented health care venture. This finding is consistent with the change of one aspect of CAM to be a priority target for business interests. As Collyer notes: It is now almost commonplace to find large national and multinational companies with business interests ranging fully across the health product spectrum: from the manufacture, distribution or sale of herbal remedies and Chinese medicine to high-tech, synthetic, designer drugs; from acupuncture needles and massage tables to high-technology diagnostic equipment; from the sale of health insurance to the provision of health services or practitioner training; and the ownership or management of retail outlets, hospitals, clinics and pathology laboratories. At the opening of the twenty-first century, CAM has finally become 'big business' (in Tovey et al., 2004, p. 82). My interview with a senior hospital financial manager at the hospital revealed a \"bottom line' philosophical orientation, with the main goal of commodifying TCM. Conceptualizing this initiative, the manager began by stating: I mean, to me, first and foremost, this is a business opportunity for the organization to get into business with a partner, a business which should be able to accomplish a number of objectives, one of which is to make a bottom-line profit, which can then be reinvested in other priorities from the hospital's perspective. So I think the driving factors are an unmet demand, potentially a marketing opportunity in terms of a unique sort of a position in the marketplace. As this financial advisor emphasized, health care, in his view, is a business opportunity that requires expert market knowledge outside of health care: For this to be successful, it needs more than just a health care provider. You don't just hang up your shingle and the flocks come to you. There's going to be required marketing savvy and those types of things, and so [there needs to be a} clear understanding [of] what those issues are. He saw traditional Chinese medicine as simply another revenue stream that could be used to support biomedical health care initiatives in the hospital, rather than as aids to patient care. This financial advisor further went on to state: \"So the goal out of this is to be able 155 to create a revenue stream that can help move us forward with the health care system, and I can use that money to reinvest in other health care initiatives\". The Canada Hospital Act requires that health care services including prescribed drugs be given to patients when under hospital care free of charge to patients. Such services are covered under the public health care system (Clarke, 2000). However, my research at the WPMC showed that tertiary care clinics, even within hospitals, offer private services not covered by public hospital funds. This leads to speculation about whether or not the Hospital Act is really being observed. Are we able to cope with new changes in health care services needed by patients? Clearly, globalization has set the stage for the new market-based health care philosophy emerging in the Canadian health care system. Similarly, when asked if he saw a problem with this situation, the manager at Sunnybrook and Women's Hospital replied: No problem. There is a business-oriented new development policy of the Ministry of Health which actually encourages such activities. This is no different than if we ran a retail pharmacy that is for profit on site. This is no different than if we provide for-profit services in other areas of the organization. So I don't see a problem in doing that [added emphasis]. By my assessment, where the Hospital Act fails to compensate for a global neoliberal agenda, it appears that the Ontario Ministry of Health may be overtly endorsing private health care services within hospitals. Elaborating on this trend, and on priority-setting for certain health services over others, the manager-informant stated: I doubt very much whether or not ultimately the Canada Health Act and service provisions are going to be broadened, because we've got a system right now that can't afford what it is currently doing. I think there's more chance that the system is going to look and say that there are things that we deem not to be medically necessary that will be taken out of our OHIP type coverage and which you will pay for. 156 Perhaps consistent with this 'bottom line' reasoning, this individual did not view TCM as necessarily effective for treating health care conditions. When asked why, then, would he be interested in including TCM in the hospital, he revealed that ultimately if patients believed in a certain health care product, he was prepared to sell it. As he stated: This is a public hospital, but it is a private corporation. It happens to have a board of directors. It's a not-for-profit organization, but that doesn't mean it doesn't need to make a profit in order to reinvest in itself. The Ministry of Health actually only funds 70 per cent of our total revenue stream. There are other things that we do that fund us and give us revenues beyond the Ministry's money, and this would be one of them. So I guess my view is, if there are customers who believe in this product and wish to buy this product, then we should be prepared to sell this product to those customers. [emphasis added] Not only was the intent to commodify traditional Chinese medicine in this setting, but also to use these profits to support dominant biomedical treatments, as TCM becomes more popular in the West. Commentary conveyed by the core organizational committee members of the proposed traditional Chinese medicine initiative that I studied supports the suggestion that TCM was being commodified in this way. One committee member even remarked that while Sunnybrook and Women's had a stated interest in complementary and alternative medicine, there was no overt stated interest in TCM per se, and that the proposed initiative largely resulted from a favourable opportunity, in this case, the solicitation by an international business interest: We have stated in a number of places that we support complementary __ health and will be looking for initiatives and ways to operationalize that intent or belief. So you're fundamentally looking at an organization [that] has an interest in complementary health, a stated interest through a fairly long process which was developed in a strategic plan. We didn't have a specific interest in traditional Chinese medicine. We were interested in exploring an academic endeavour that was a type of complementary health. We actually, as far as implementing our strategic plan, haven't gone down the road as to how we were going to do it. 157 Supporting the senior financial manager's views of the initiative, there was also information to suggest that the implementation of a revenue-generating CAM service, TCM or otherwise, would aid in the institution's deficit situation. When asked if the initiative would be a sanctioned form of private health care, this member of the task force responded: \"Well, we're not sure yet. It definitely has to be a part of our own public system, but there may be, you know, a private part of this as well that we have to explore\". When asked if, in their opinion, the initiative would help to lower the hospital's deficit, this committee member responded: Well, it might. It certainly might. I think in any health care business right now, we're always looking for other ways to increase our revenue and other ways to not always rely on our Ministry of Health for our dollars every day. We're looking for other ways to make money. [emphasis added} The preceding series of statements illustrate how new health care services, in terms of their potential for hospital revenue, are essentially in the same category as new retail initiatives in hospitals such as clothing or fast food chains. As Grinspun (2000, p. 25) argues, management in North American hospitals has shifted over the last decade from a cure-care paradigm to a business paradigm. Hospitals have been reconceptualized as 'financially competitive enterprises' by using a number of management and marketing discourses from the corporate world, such as those weighing cost versus health outcomes. The marketing of potential services in the private sector, such as acupuncture, reflects the post-Fordist concept of 'program management', where hospitals are managed as a portfolio of a business (also called Strategic Business Units), and where each 'unit' produces a product or service for a particular group of patients (Grinspun, 2000, pp. 30\u2014 31). 158 Although she was philosophically opposed, there was a sense from another committee member that the primarily financial motive for establishing a private form of health care deepened as the project developed. She stated: I think that some of the physicians would be much more resistant than I think we would, but I think the biggest concern was that it sounded like it was evolving into a little bit more of a storefront store as opposed to, you know, an opportunity to collaborate on some science and to help educate women about what the role is, where do these things fit in, you know, what are the benefits? What are the risks? Giving a physician's perspective on why she thought the hospital would be interested in traditional Chinese medicine per se, she suggested: It's trying to fill a niche, a need in the community. We know people want this, and so I think they feel that the administration of the hospital, the big hospital sees this as a bit of a cash cow, and that's not really\u2014none of us care about that. That's not why we're here. We're not here to make money for the hospital, we're here to take care of people. So I think there's probably a little bit of skepticism there. What's the real story behind this? Is it just really bringing people in the door and giving the hospital a reputation for being open-minded? Do you know what I mean? But this isn't going to make up for 30 million dollars, but all these little things put together, you know, ultimately they will. This particular committee member further went on to reflect on the progression of the organizational committee meetings in terms of how the negotiation with the for-profit partner from Shanghai was establishing a clear profit motive. She stated: I got the impression from the most recent meeting that this was a little bit of a flip. I think that most of the conversation up until then had been integrating this kind of medicine and integrating and providing further value to the interdisciplinary care that already happens, and a research programme. That was what we've been talking about. And then it sounded like at the meeting they told us that the company behind these herbs specifically wanted to be able to make money doing this, and that they really only were interested in investing if they were going to be able to sell a large amount of products, which is why the whole discussion with the clinicians in the building centred around whether they would be willing to send their patients there, to refer them there, because I guess they're concerned that if they don't get referrals, people won't buy. 159 There was a sense from a different committee member, however, that profit was not the primary motive of Sunnybrook and Women's. As he stated: This is not the only purpose, and certainly that's not the main purpose. Even Sunnybrook and Women's are interested in this mainly because of the research opportunities. This joint project, or this clinic, is going to provide the opportunity for research for both Sunnybrook and Women's and the pharmaceutical company, and as such, for the Health Bureau in China. When pressed, however, about the specific goal of the pharmaceutical company expanding its market into Canada and North America, this member first presented an idealized view of Chinese medicine in terms of promoting it as a national policy. Later he admitted that ultimately the company did not just want to expand its international market, it wanted to improve its image in order to do this: The goal is very simple. The promotion of Chinese traditional medicine is a national policy. It has been made public over four years ago. So to promote Chinese traditional medicine is a target that all health professionals and health officials embrace. So this is why they took the initiative to try to establish a Chinese clinic in Toronto, for example, because Canada has always had a very strong historic tradition of co- operating with China. And so the Chinese want to promote traditional Chinese medicine in the world at large, not only for their own sort of interest or prestige, but they really genuinely feel that Chinese traditional medicine can benefit a lot of people, and for various reasons it would also probably be less costly than many other methods or systems. The committee member concluded: The pharmaceutical company has the goals that I've described. The promotion of traditional Chinese medicine as such and also to the world at large. But because they are a company, they also want to market their product. In order to promote traditional Chinese medicine, they also have to promote the use of Chinese traditional medicine or pharmaceuticals and drugs and so on. It would increase and extend their market overseas. For the clinic itself, it's a very small business for them. This company is huge. This company probably is the largest in Shanghai, and Shanghai has 30 million people. And in China as such, it probably is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies as well. So they're not looking to sell, you 160 know, their products through a clinic, but they're looking to, I guess, among other things, enhance their image, because if the clinic is known to be promoted and sponsored by Canada, it will enhance their image and also it will help to sell their products both in China and overseas. Because if the Chinese know that this pharmaceutical company has gone global, it will definitely help their prestige. [emphasis added] 6.5 Summary In summary, my observations suggest that the side-by-side availability of biomedical and CAM care has led to decreased patient access to both new biomedical and ongoing CAM services in IHC settings, and to the premature termination of integrative care plans. Patients of a lower socioeconomic status could not afford private treatments for a significant length of time, unless they were fortunate to receive private insurance through legal health claims, or participated in drug trials. The relationship between illness and low socio-economic status, which persists even in spite of health care insurance, led particular patients to struggle with payments for private services due to their inability to work as a result of their chronic illness. Health care insurance in Canada, by relegating CAM practitioners to the private sector, also disrupted integrative clinical care by restricting activities of CAM practitioners, and restricting their patient flow in IHC sites. Lastly, the increased commodification of health care is now being extended by biomedical institutions to CAM practices, which are being viewed by these biomedical institutions as revenue-generating devices. As Kaptchuk and Miller state: the integration movement appears motivated to a large extent by economic considerations. Hospital medicine has been squeezed by reimbursement constraints from government and managed care. The seeming growth of interest in CAM is both a threat and an opportunity. Integration can be seen as an effort to maintain a loyal pool of patients, expand market share in competitive environments, and receive out-of-pocket payments that are not constrained by insurers. CAM practitioners benefit from a larger patient pool, as well as status 161 enhancement via affiliation with the medical establishment. Economics can easily obscure incompatibility on the level of the philosophy, practice, or ethics of medicine (2005, p. 290). [emphasis added] The next chapter examines in more detail the problematic patterns of professional interaction among biomedical and CAM practitioners in IHC settings that were identified in this research. 162 Chapter 7 PATTERNS OF PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION IN INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS The previous chapter illustrated how the continuing exclusion of CAM from state funding and commodification of health care services in Canada, both biomedical and CAM, has disrupted health care settings attempting to integrate biomedical and CAM services. Specifically, the maintenance of particular biomedical and CAM therapies and practices as private services reinforced the class-based nature of health care by preventing patients with limited financial resources from receiving much needed privatized treatments for a continuous length of time. The economic domination of one therapeutic paradigm over others\u2014in this case the public financing of biomedical health care services and therapies to the exclusion of CAM services/ therapies\u2014can be viewed both through patient accounts and practitioner accounts of clinical interaction. Similar to other studies of solo CAM practitioners working in publicly-funded (but not integrated) hospital units (e.g., Shuval et al., 2002), CAM practitioners working in health care settings attempting integration in my research did not receive a guaranteed financial income compared to other biomedical and paramedical health care practitioners. Thus the CAM practitioners I observed were essentially private entrepreneurs working in a public health care system. This led to a very limited style of clinical interaction between CAM and biomedical practitioners (which was essentially reduced to 'hallway rounds'), even when CAM practitioners were invited to group rounds or meetings. The economic marginality of CAM practitioners also left them with very limited patient flow. Further, while commodification is the norm for biomedical drugs, certain forms of CAM, such as traditional Chinese medicine, were 163 also being commodified and sought after as a potentially 'untapped resource', which could then be used to generate private revenue for other biomedical services, lower deficits, and ultimately provide an avenue for CAM to enter the global market through international investment companies. As reviewed earlier, the commodification of CAM can be viewed as a symptom of 'global capitalism', in which national trade boundaries are slated for dismantling and are succumbing to the whims of global capital interests, which, in turn, are ultimately dismantling the Keynesian welfare state. As part of a CSSP, a neo-Marxist theoretical approach to IHC settings has proven useful in the last chapter by illuminating economic and class-based relations in the health care division of labour. A neo-Marxist perspective, however, one could argue, does not fully account for the everyday interprofessional processes or strategies through which professionally dominant groups secure and maintain their privileged position in the labour market by excluding rival groups. It is here that a popular microsociological approach to the study of processes of professionalization, called social closure or closure theory, becomes useful. Closure theory does not have its origins in critical perspectives, though I will argue that it can be adapted for this purpose. Thus this chapter will draw from closure theory to 'unpack' how medical dominance continues in the micro- interaction of professional practice in IHC. As Mizrachi and Shuval note: The ability of a profession to secure its position, to maintain its autonomy, and to defend its jurisdiction changes over time and across cultural and geographic borders. Professional boundaries constantly change their contours, forcing professions to make jurisdictional claims in various social forms and in different social arenas (2005, p. 1649). 164 71 Critical Aspects of Closure Theory Parkin (1974) proposes four types of closure strategies that form the basic model of contemporary closure theory: 'exclusionary'; 'demarcationary'; 'inclusionary'; and 'dual' closure. Exclusionary closure is defined as the downward exercise of power through the subordination of other social groups by closing off their access to opportunities and resources. It is envisaged as an intra- and interprofessional strategy, such as with the creation of specific skill sets and entry credentials, that serves to create 'exclusionary shelters' and to secure a privileged access to the labour market (Parkin, 1974; Witz, 1992). Related to, but distinct from exclusionary closure, demarcationary closure refers to interprofessional control, where certain occupations monitor and regulate the labour of other related occupations, and create and control boundaries between them (Witz, 1992). Whereas exclusion is seen as 'vertical', demarcation is 'horizontal' (Shuval et al., 2002). Using demarcationary strategies, certain groups place others in an encircled and specific 'sphere of competence' in the health care division of labour. Inclusionary closure is defined as the upward exercise of power by subordinate groups attempting to 'bite into' the advantages of higher social groups, and is thought of as a 'usurpationary' strategy. That is, developing professions are seen as seeking inclusion within the occupation attempting to exclude them. Finally, dual closure, also a usurpationary tactic, involves a complex strategy whereby groups experiencing demarcation simultaneously resist demarcation, while establishing a new sphere of competence based on their own exclusionary strategies. 165 Murphy (1988) extends Parkin's four main types of closure by focussing on the different 'rules', 'forms' and 'structures' of closure. According to Murphy, exclusion can be either 'principal', 'derivative', or 'contingent'. Principal exclusion refers to the main societal structures used to subordinate other groups (e.g., legal or state structures). Derivative exclusion refers to rules for the monopolization of opportunities and resources in society, derived and yet distinct from principal exclusion. Third, contingent forms of exclusion are not directly derived from principal exclusion, but determine their existence as a result of the principal form, and are often directly backed by the state (e.g., professional credentials or licences). Further, Murphy suggests that there are also 'rules of exclusion' which can also be either derivative or contingent.\u00b0 Finally, Murphy proposes different forms of usurpation: 'inclusionary' and 'revolutionary'. The former refers to excluded groups attempting to become included in the present structure of closure with the aim of changing the criteria of exclusion to one of group membership. For example, an ethno-racial or religious group might strive for inclusion in a favoured group. The process could also be based on individual merit, for example, on credentials. The latter form refers to a direct attempt to change the structure of positions in society, as illustrated by the feminist movement. Murphy, in envisioning his 'Weberian dialectic', also conceptualizes closure as an interplay between material and ideal interests, where creative resistance to domination is realized through the agency of usurpation. \u00ae Murphy also proposes three structures of exclusionary closure: \"tandem\", \"paired\" or \"polar\". Tandem closure consists of derivative and contingent sets of exclusionary rules derived from one dominant and principal form of exclusion, for example, property ownership. Paired closure refers to principal sets of exclusionary rules that reinforce each other, for example, property ownership and social exclusion. Polar exclusion refers to two principal yet opposing sets of exclusionary rules that provokes usurpation by the other, for example, property ownership and Communism. 166 A few critical theorists have attempted to adapt closure theory to a more critical perspective by linking closure practices to labour and capital. For example, Larson (1980) argues that the status and power of professions depends upon their ability to maintain a market situation and access to appropriate clients. A market strategy, in turn, in industrialized societies, depends on university education as the basis for credentialism. Larson proposes that professionalization is a process by which the producers of services have attempted to constitute and manage a market for their expertise. The collective attempt to maintain status requires state backing for the establishment of a monopoly of knowledge and skill. The process of professionalization, facilitated by social closure, has an effect on the distribution of wealth and status, thereby contributing to social inequality, especially between labour and capital. In order to maintain this power, professions must continually exercise their dominance over allied and competing occupations. Drawing on Larson, Turner (1995) envisages social closure as having three important dimensions. First, Turner argues that professions must produce and maintain a | 'body of esoteric knowledge' which requires considerable interpretation in its application. Citing Larson, he emphasizes that \"in order to sustain this body of knowledge, an occupation will require a formal educational basis and systematic entry requirements; these, in turn, will require a university system of education\" (Turner, 1995, p. 138). Second, Turner suggests that a profession will attempt to maintain and cultivate an extensive clientele for its services, and this will involve various exclusionary practices whereby competing occupations are subordinated or removed from the marketplace. This access to clients may well require legislation and therefore we can see the importance of the state in maintaining professional monopolies (1995, p. 138). 167 Third and last, Turner suggests that a professional group will seek to maintain certain privileges at the point of work and at the delivery of a service, mainly to maintain autonomy over the delivery skills and the relationship with the client. Professions will resist the de-skilling which is involved in managerial strategies at the workplace which fragment and routinize the work relationship between expert and client (1995, p. 138). Summarizing the importance of these three points and informed by Lockwood (1958), Turner proposes that: [I}n class terms, a profession will be first to secure its means of production through the educational system in such a way as to reproduce the systematic inequalities between social classes, which are to some extent manifest in the inequalities between expert and client.... [A] profession will be forced into market conflicts where it will struggle against competing occupations in terms of maintaining its privileged access to knowledge and to educational systems.... [I]n terms of status relations, a profession will seek, in terms of job autonomy and control over services, to ensure the continuing ignorance of its clients and thereby their need for a professional service (1995, p. 141). I will argue in this chapter that various closure strategies are exercised by biomedicine in the IHC clinical setting, based on support from the state (just as the state supports educational closure). 7.2. Exclusionary Closure by Biomedicine in IHC Settings There were various ways in which professional interaction and attempts at collaboration and integration in IHC settings reflected the various forms, structures, and rules of social closure in the three sites studied. Principal, derivative and contingent closure are visible in the processes through which CAM practitioners were excluded in IHC settings. Soon after I entered the first IHC site, for example, it became apparent that the most readily observable process through which CAM practitioners were excluded was in the act of patient charting. 168 7.2.1 Patient Charting Patient charting involves the process of entering diagnostic, prescriptive, progress or other notes regarding the patient, which are then kept in the main patient file. When a variety of practitioners see the patient, the file may have separate sections for each practitioner and may also contain other relevant patient summaries or surveys. In this specific example of closure, CAM practitioners were excluded in various ways from charting in the main or global patient file, which was shared and charted in by all and only biomedical practitioners in the IHC setting. For example, at the Centre for Integrated Healing (CIH), associate (CAM) practitioners were unable to chart patients on a form used by physicians and had no formally designated or specific space in the patient file. This restriction was explained by one doctor as the result of legislation set out by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons which restricts all but legally licensed medical doctors from using the physicians' chart forms for patients. Associate practitioners at the CIH were further restricted from viewing the medical doctor's chart unless consent was first granted by patients on the intake form. Instead of using the biomedical chart, associate practitioners were given their own informal 'pink sheet' on which to enter progress or other notes concerning patients and, if they wished, this form could be placed alongside the doctor's chart in the main patient file. As noted in Chapter Five, it is important to note that CAM practitioners, such as at the CIH and WPMC, did have their own independent chart forms, however, which were kept separate from the main patient file. This exclusionary strategy is interprofessional, and can be seen as derivative of the state's sanctioning of biomedical autonomy and attempts, as Larson had argued, to maintain control over one's clientele as major 169 biomedical health care providers. At the CIH, this fragmented style of charting had several consequences detrimental to an integrative model and to the integrity of CAM modalities. First, not all associate practitioners used the pink sheet, preferring instead to rely upon their own chart. Second, associate practitioners' personal charts for the patient were seldom shared with or requested by medical doctors. Third, those associate practitioners using the pink sheet often simplified their notes for doctors' understanding. Fourth, associate practitioners did not uniformly read doctors' charts prior to consultation unless they had a particular concern about the patient. Ultimately, this exclusionary style of patient charting led to a situation of 'two solitudes', or, at the very least, a minimal understanding by both medical doctors and CAM practitioners of their respective assessment of mutual patients. Just as at the CIH, at the WPMC, the traditional Chinese medical practitioners did not have a formally designated space in the main patient's file in which to chart patients. As at the CIH, they had their own extensive charts that were kept separate from the main patient file. As compared to the CIH, however, charting was even more mutually exclusive: traditional Chinese medical practitioners at the WPMC did not even have a separate sheet that they could insert into the main patient file. In a truly integrative practice, it could be argued, there should have been an attempt to address these exclusionary biomedical/state-sanctioned processes. 7.2.2 Patient Referrals A second way in which CAM practitioners were excluded in IHC settings was through the process of patient referrals. As Cant and Sharma argue: \"If GPs are still the 170 gate keepers so far as the majority of patients are concerned, then their knowledge and perception of what complementary therapies can do (and which one is appropriate for a particular case) will be crucial\" (Cant & Sharma, 1999, p. 165). Physicians could refer to CAM practitioners and other paramedical practitioners (for example, physiotherapists). CAM practitioners, however, could not consult with physicians to maintain their patients. In the CIH, for example, patients were often directly referred from a physician to an associate practitioner while associate practitioners could not refer patients back to physicians at all. Physicians also regulated and dominated referral patterns at the WPMC, where patients were first seen by the physician, at which time the resulting treatment protocol involving referrals to other practitioners, including paramedical practitioners, was determined. While this process often did involve extensive consultations with patients, ultimately patients were directed only by the physician to certain practitioners and modalities over others. This style of physician-dominated referral pattern was occurring at both the CIH and the WPMC. At the proposed Sunnybrook and Women's site, it was also anticipated that patients would first be seen by a biomedical physician. As noted earlier, this type of physician-led triage appears to be common in other clinical IHC settings in North America, and is also a key aspect of biomedically-oriented IHC models in the literature. The process of biomedically- dominant medical triage appears to be endemic to any biomedical setting where CAM is introduced. For example, Mizrachi and Shuval found that: In all biomedical settings where alternative practitioners work together with their biomedical colleagues their subordination to the biomedical practitioners was evident. Upon arrival to the ambulatory clinics patients were examined by an MD who determined which of the alternative forms of practice was appropriate. After a specified series of treatments, each case was reviewed at a full staff meeting 171 headed by an MD and including the non-physician alternative practitioners (2005, p. 1656). In another study examining the integration of CAM practitioners into a biomedical primary health care team, Paterson and Peacock found a \"... large inter-doctor variation in the number of patients referred to complementary practitioners with some saying they often overlooked the complementary option, while others felt it had become a part of their approach to health care\" (1995, p. 257). Yet, when interviewing CAM practitioners, they also found that \"[a]ll the complementary practitioners would have liked more referrals and felt this would come about by the doctors gaining deeper understanding of the therapies and 'incorporating the knowledge into decision making'\" (Paterson & Peacock, 1995, p. 157). This type of referral pattern helped to maintain biomedical dominance as sanctioned by the state. It had two main exclusionary consequences for CAM practitioners. First, CAM practitioners were consistently excluded from referrals, resulting in low patient flow. For example, traditional Chinese medical practitioners were rarely the first choice of patients at the WPMC. Second, CAM practitioners could not refer back to physicians, thus limiting their therapeutic scope of practice and professional power in the clinic. Thus, as suggested by Larson, the dominant biomedical practitioners, sanctioned and funded by the state, maintained the lion's share of the services. One even might argue that a certain degree of appropriation of CAM services was involved to the extent that patients desired CAM services but had to settle for biomedical services that were funded by the state. But further, access and use of CAM knowledge is also controlled by these strategies. 172 7.2.3 Access to Biomedical Tests A third way in which CAM practitioners were excluded was in access or rights to biomedical diagnostic tests involving laboratory work. As Mizrachi and Shuval note, the use of such activities as laboratory experiments may be viewed as \"... boundary markers for biomedicine defining unambiguously who is in and who is out\" (2005, p. 1652). Further, they found that: Consistent with the hierarchy expressed in the formal arena, there was a well- maintained hierarchical order by which the patient passes through the biomedical \"filter\" to be referred to alternative treatment. Physicians must first rule out the possibility of a \"real disease\" before any other consideration. Alternative medicine has never been found in a gate-keeping position of diagnosis (Mizrachi & Shuval, 2005, p. 1657). In the IHC sites in this study, only medical doctors have the legal right to order biomedical diagnostic or confirmatory tests for their patients involving blood work, specimen analysis, or other diagnostic technology. This type of restriction for non- physician practitioners was a particular point of tension for those practitioners who had received both CAM and biomedical training and who also required the use of diagnostic information derived from biomedical tests. One associate practitioner indicated how physicians controlled her use of biomedical tests in her patient practice. This practitioner stated: Sometimes I do get my hands tied because I don't have access to, you know, laboratory testing, and so I have to rely on the medical doctors here to get certain testing done. But the exclusionary control went beyond simple limitation of autonomy to interfere with the way she treated patients. Specifically, this practitioner described how sometimes physicians would not always order tests she thought were important for her patients. This required her ordering additional tests from the United States. This meant additional costs 173 for the patient, as the practitioner had no legal right to order tests in Canada. Describing this practice, this practitioner complained: Just for a simple blood test sometimes, if the GP won't do it, I have to take the blood and send it to the US for testing, and then I get the result back in about 10 days. So, there's an extra 10 days of waiting and more money going out to the U.S. when it can be kept in [Canada]. This exclusionary practice can be seen to both support biomedical control as well as to disadvantage poorer patients who choose CAM services (as discussed in the previous chapter). Other studies of 'integrative' physicians even point to GPs' awareness of their control of biomedical technology (Adams, in Tovey et al., 2004, p. 150). The three examples above document Murphy's form of 'derivative exclusion' and can be traced to the principal form of exclusion. In this case, the principal form is the legal right of only biomedically- and state-licensed practitioners to practice biomedicine. In these three examples, the specific types of derivative exclusion are the exclusive legal right of biomedical doctors: (a) to chart in the patient's file; (b) to refer patients to other physicians, biomedical and CAM health care providers; and (c) to order and access biomedical tests and diagnostic technology. Each of these are dependent upon the state- regulated licence of medical doctor. As one frustrated CAM practitioner commented: Some doctors just ignore your comment, and so I tend to fax something over to the doctor, so at least there's a formal record that I asked a question, and that will have to be put into their chart. So in that way, you know, to protect the process, Ill often fax something over to the GP's office. But it's not a very formal system, it's just a little note and I just ask politely if they could check something. But I don't get much of a response usually. This suggests that patient care is only 'integrated' to the extent that biomedical practitioners allow, resulting in a continuing dominance of biomedicine over practice. 174 7.3 Demarcationary Closure Parkin's (1974) concept of 'demarcationary' closure, by which specific groups are given or granted a specific sphere of competence by a dominant group in the division of labour, is also applicable in IHC settings. In this form of exclusion, biomedical doctors remained the dominant professional group in each JHC setting, as each setting was located in the biomedically-supportive Canadian health care funding system. Demarcation was enacted overall in the historic sense by which each CAM practitioner, as a representative of his or her respective profession, was granted a specific domain or province of practice by biomedical doctors, backed by the state and class relations. More specifically, CAM practitioners were only allowed to perform therapeutic duties associated with their profession and none of those associated with biomedicine. The reverse was not the case. For example, in IHC settings, only biomedical physicians are legally able to medically diagnose, prescribe pharmaceutical drugs and perform surgeries, while non-physician practitioners cannot, and are only allowed to practice their profession-specific duties (e.g., physical mobilization; massage; insertion of acupuncture needles; nutritional/dietary counselling). There were, however, overlapping areas of practice between medical doctors and other CAM practitioners, suggesting that demarcation boundaries are shifting and are able to shift. For example, several CAM practitioners, most notably the traditional Chinese medical practitioners, homeopathic practitioners, and nutritionists, prescribed therapeutic and material substances to patients not classed as pharmaceutical drugs. While not called drugs, many of these substances are pharmacologically active (e.g., traditional Chinese medical herbs and supplements). 175 In this sense, the 'prescriptions' did not fall into the sphere of demarcation, since they lay outside of biomedicine's sphere of control. 7.4 The Significance of Biomedical Appropriation of CAM Skills and Esoteric Knowledge These findings from the IHC sites underline the significance of the 'changing boundaries' between CAM and biomedicine. That is, they reveal appropriation of CAM therapeutic skills and spheres of competence by biomedical practitioners while the reverse is not legally allowed. As Saks notes, \"growing numbers of doctors and other orthodox health professionals are practicing therapies such as acupuncture and homoeopathy\" (2002, p. 9). As Coulter also notes, \"[w]ithin a very short period of time, medicine has moved from outright hostility to CAM to acknowledging its existence and finally co-operating with, and embracing, CAM\" (2004, p. 103). The incorporation of CAM into medical practice, however, can be seen as the attempt of the biomedical profession in rich countries to capitalize on popular support for alternative medicine. As Saks further notes, when the biomedical profession failed to convince the public not to use CAM, its best defence was to absorb them in selected and emaciated form within orthodox medicine itself. This was particularly true of therapies based on philosophies such as traditional Chinese medicine that fundamentally contradicted the basic principles of biomedicine\u2014and thereby most strongly challenged the income, status and power of the medical profession (2002, p. 11). Shuval et al. (2002) argue that the adoption of, or 'credentialing in' CAM is a deliberate strategy whereby \"[c]redentialling as a biomedical practitioner provides a legitimate entry to hospital practice for those who have undertaken additional training in one of the 176 alternative specialties\" (2002, p. 1751). As Frank and Stollberg (2004) further note in their study of the rise of physicians practicing medical acupuncture, acupuncture, an appropriated technique, is often separated from the context of Chinese medical theory by physicians. As opposed to a sanitized form of 'co-optation' found in the profession's literature, this appropriating tactic can be seen to fragment and distort the holistic knowledge of which acupuncture is a part, incorporating it instead into Eurocentric biomedical practice. There were many examples of this trend in the IHC sites. Biomedical physicians and other paramedical practitioners such as physiotherapists were consistently practicing therapeutic skills derived from less powerful groups such as acupuncturists and nutritionists. Here the biomedical profession cultivated patients who would have otherwise consulted acupuncturists and nutritionists. They in effect used their state- sanctioned privilege to clientele to extend their sphere of competence to compete with CAM for its market. For example, physicians at the CIH were practicing well outside of traditional biomedical practice, as demonstrated by their clinical use of nutrition advice, supplements, acupuncture, meditation, and spiritual and psychological counselling. At the WPMC, physical therapists were also practicing medical acupuncture. In this instance, physicians and physiotherapists, already in a dominant, state-supported position with respect to CAM practitioners in IHC settings, were simultaneously expanding their therapeutic sphere of competence and their clientele at the expense of these less powerful professions. Worrying about the development of a biomedically-dominant form of 'integrative medicine' and the successful competition with CAM practitioners for patients, one CAM practitioner commented: 177 So there's going to be green MDs doing all the integrative work in the future... [But] to incorporate those who've been practicing alternative or complementary medicine [who have] not gone to a medical school here, I don't think that's possible. Despite technical adoption of CAM skills, the majority of biomedical practitioners practicing CAM at both the CIH and WPMC indicated that they did not have good grasp of the theoretical paradigms that accompanied the practice they were appropriating. This was particularly applicable to TCM and naturopathy. As one physician explained: We don't know everything there is to know about naturopathic medicine or Chinese herbal medicine. We have an overview, so we have some knowledge, enough to perhaps provide some guidance. And if there are any detailed questions that patients have about those specific [CAM] areas, we would suggest that they talk to the [CAM] practitioner to ask those questions. Another physician commented \"Well, I would say that from my experience I have a very limited understanding of traditional Chinese medicine. I wouldn't really understand a diagnosis or necessarily the treatment\". The significance of these admissions is that they point to the practice of appropriation without true integration of CAM theories. In addition to ongoing exclusionary practices in IHC settings based on derivative and demarcationary forms, there were other more subtle levels of exclusion which involved the area of knowledge construction. Freidson (1970), and later Turner (1995, p. 138), as discussed briefly above, have argued that dominant professions maintain an occupational monopoly partially through the production and maintenance of a body of esoteric knowledge that requires extensive interpretation and study for its application. Turner suggests that professions construct a 'barrier' between themselves and other clients and institutions, created by a powerful knowledge 'mystique'. Turner mainly 178 discusses this mystique as an attempt by professions to resist state bureaucratization and rationalization, and to maintain social distance between practitioners and clients. It is possible, however, to extend Turner's argument and propose that in the context of inter- professional interaction, dominant professions also use their exclusive right to knowledge to maintain boundaries between themselves and other subordinated professions. One can further suggest that the creation of esoteric knowledge is used by dominant professions as a final exclusionary/demarcationary technique alongside other more overt exclusionary closure tactics. Additionally, this technique could also be used by subordinated professions in the attempt to maintain their identity and professional boundaries amongst each other. Where the latter occurs, the situation is called 'dual closure' (Witz, 1992). The dynamics of this situation will be discussed below. The point to be noted here is that the creation of esoteric knowledge is a major technique of closure used by professions. In the IHC sites in this study, the medical profession's maintenance of esoteric biomedical knowledge had a significant exclusionary effect on CAM practitioners in two principal clinical activities: group rounds or meetings, and patient charting. As discussed in the previous chapter, CAM practitioners identified that they were excluded from group rounds and meetings for economic reasons (such as that they were not salaried, and were also further excluded because they had to take care of their private practice in order to maintain their incomes). CAM practitioners were also excluded, however, to the extent that they could not always understand the biomedical language and terminology that dominated the rounds. Consistent with biomedical dominance even in IHC settings, biomedicine was the primary therapeutic language of communication. This observation supports the findings of one of the few empirical studies of a virtual IHC 179 setting conducted by Anderson (1999). As discussed earlier, Anderson has concluded that biomedical language dominates IHC settings. Anderson further noted that CAM practitioners communicated in biomedical !anguage rather than their own therapeutic language (e.g., TCM). During my study at the CIH, medical doctors' meetings were conducted in biomedical language. The majority of CAM practitioners, however, did not have much training in or knowledge of biomedical language or terminology. The dominance of biomedical language further deterred CAM practitioners, already torn by economic considerations, from attending medical doctors' meetings, as they felt that they could not contribute. For example, one CAM practitioner at the CIH felt that she was 'slowing down' doctors' meetings due to her inability to follow the biomedical language. She further did not feel satisfied about the information she received. Describing this experience, this practitioner stated: I just found that it kind of got very clinical at times and it was really\u2014it would just take away from their meeting if I was always checking in to see what was going on, what can I get out of this. And it just felt like it would slow down their meetings too much if I was doing that. And so I'd walk away sometimes feeling like I didn't quite get satisfied in gathering [information] that I would feel I would need. In general, there was little will expressed to address this problem. One physician at the CIH was indeed aware that doctors' meetings were conducted in biomedical language and that this had a negative effect on associate practitioners' interaction in the meetings\u2014though surprisingly this was not seen as interfering with integration of biomedical and CAM paradigms. Presumably these biomedical practitioners are not aware of the extent to which CAM knowledges are subjugated in their practice. This physician further indicated that there were also different priorities at the meetings. He felt that whereas associate practitioners were more interested in the effects of biomedical 180 treatments and their potential contra-indications, the physicians were concerned with broader biomedical clinical issues. This physician's view of the situation was as follows: So sometimes what will happen is that the physicians are all speaking the same language and the alternative practitioner is asking questions around something that probably isn't actually [relevant] to the business at hand. They don't have the background. So that has taken time to explain to them. Whereas all they're trying to do is [find out] \"Should we use this or not?\" So sometimes that's a problem because that's not the issue. As can be seen, this biomedical practitioner implicitly assumes that the CAM practitioner is deficient, rather than acknowledging the possibility that he or she might have something useful to contribute or that there would be value on 'being on the same page'. At the WPMC, the three traditional Chinese medical practitioners also reported that they found it difficult to communicate with biomedical doctors, even when they were able to attend the rounds. In the words of one TCM practitioner: I found it's a bit difficult to communicate our practice to Western physicians because we're not speaking the same language. For example, we use chi, a term that a Western doctor may not understand. So it's a [challenge] how to communicate [between] physicians and TCM practitioners [and] use the same language that both can understand. There was also a style of communication while using biomedical language that certain CAM practitioners identified they were not comfortable with or able to access. This communication style was primarily a concern expressed by the traditional Chinese medical practitioners at the WPMC. In addition to struggling with English as a second language to Chinese, these practitioners felt uncomfortable about modes of communication in medical rounds. From the perspective of the traditional Chinese medical practitioners, these biomedical rounds were characterized by an aggressive conversational style punctuated by interruptions, and vocally dominated by one speaker over another. This was perceived as grossly impolite by the TCM practitioners. It was 181 also experienced as exclusionary, as it did not provide space for their input. Thus the TCM practitioners felt that they could not communicate in this aggressive style. Neither were they overtly asked to contribute, showing, at the very least, disrespect. As one TCM practitioner explained: When they talk and one person is not finished yet and the other person just interrupts, I was going to say something, but there is no space and no room for me to speak up, and I didn't want to interrupt others. I didn't want to stop others when I talk. That's not polite. Mizrachi, Shuval and Gross (2005, p. 35), in their analysis of solo CAM practitioners in hospitals, also observed that: Alternative practitioners regularly joined biomedical doctors' routine case presentations during their shifts. But they appeared voiceless, compliant and accepting of their marginalized position. In addition to communication problems in rounds and meetings, the majority of CAM practitioners in the IHC sites indicated that they could not fully understand the biomedical terminology in the patient's chart. For example, when asked if she could understand the chart notes made by medical doctors, one CAM practitioner at the CIH commented: \"Not everything. I don't understand all the medical information that's there. But like I say, if I have questions around it, I'l certainly go and check in with them\". Another CAM practitioner at the CIH, when asked the same question, responded: Yes, there might be something that I don't know. I think that sometimes I can hear something and it's really helpful, but I think sometimes I don't really know what it is. It's some new medication for, say, prostate cancer, and I don't really get that much because I have so [many] other things going on in my mind, [that] I cannot keep up with all the new information. This last comment suggests that in addition to mutually exclusive language and perceptions of disrespectful interaction, it is also just difficult to think in two paradigms at the same time. 182 7.5 Biomedical Closure and Interprofessional Communication I have argued so far that in IHC settings, biomedicine enacts various patterns of closure in relation to CAM professions. These include restricting CAM practitioners from using common patient charts and participating in group rounds, as well as by consolidating professional boundaries by using inaccessible knowledge and language. As part and parcel of these professional closure tactics, I suggest that breakdowns in communication further disrupt integrative care. Such power relations seem to occur largely outside the consciousness of dominant professionals' perceptions of their effect on the less powerful professionals in IHC settings. That is, biomedical practitioners displayed such biomedically-centred attitudes that they were unable to appreciate that CAM practitioners might not understand their practices. For example, at the WPMC, the TCM practitioners did not seem to know if they were allowed to chart in the main patient file and whether or not they were consistently required to send patient progress notes to referring physicians. Physicians and other health professional practitioners at the WPMC, however, said that they simply could not understand why there were no chart notes for TCM practitioners in the main patient chart, and why they seldom received progress notes from the TCM practitioners. As one physician complained: \"Although I did talk to the acupuncturists, I never got a note back from them; there's no note in our chart\". This physician further went on to state: So the acupuncturists have not got the hang of writing even a brief report, and that makes me wonder. I mean I've mentioned this several times but it makes me wonder why that doesn't happen. Why can't they write four lines of hand-written[notes] or send me a letter? They don't do that.... They couldn't figure it out that they had to send us a note or something so there was something written in the record. [emphasis added] 183 Frustrated about not having information about CAM interventions, he worried, \"What kind of impact do they have? How do we know what's going on?\" At the WPMC, no investigation had yet been undertaken to address why TCM practitioners were not entering chart notes in the patient's main file or why TCM practitioners were not consistently sending progress notes to physicians. My interviews suggested some simple obstacles: a) there was no space provided; b) TCM practitioners were not informed that this was standard biomedical practice; and c) TCM practitioners did not always have the English language skills necessary to write progress reports. In addition to meetings, communication also occurred directly between practitioners on a one-to-one direct and interpersonal level, and was largely concerned with the direct clinical care of the patient. In at least one IHC site (WPMC), direct interpersonal communication was much more frequent among biomedical and other health professional practitioners than among biomedical and CAM practitioners. This was primarily as a result of CAM practitioners' restricted schedules due to their working in the private sector. The frequent interaction of biomedical and other health professional practitioners was also due to there being more biomedical and other health professional practitioners than CAM practitioners. For example, one WPMC paramedical practitioner commented on how the availability of a few biomedical practitioners limited the potential for in-depth communication, while increasing availability improved communication: It depends on accessibility of the person. Because some of the doctors are here only one day of the week, you can't have as much of an in-depth discussion with them. But I think other doctors have a lot of other patients that are shared and they will have discussion on those patients because they're [doctors] here three to four days of the week. 184 In general, a more constant and informal style of interaction was reported among biomedical and other health professional practitioners that was not the norm among biomedical and CAM practitioners. Group rounds were viewed by biomedical and other health professional practitioners as the primary formal vehicle for communication regarding patients, and they also talked about a number of informal and interpersonal discussions that occurred prior to the rounds. Informal discussions between biomedical and other health professional practitioners also occurred prior to patient referrals from physicians. Prior to group rounds, these informal discussions solidified patient treatment decisions between biomedical practitioners. This allowed an agreement to be reached before the practitioners presented their decisions to the larger group for consensus. As the non-physician health practitioner cited above explained: So Dr. M and I meet informally to say, \"Okay, the patient is expressing concerns to me\", because you don't need a whole group to say this to. You know, you don't need to say it in a formal round, right? You can say to Dr. M, \"P. has come to me and she's concerned, she's wondering about Botox, [whether] to use it; what are your thoughts on this?\" And I will say to Dr. M, \"I don't think it's appropriate right now. I think we should hold off at least six weeks because she's involved in acupuncture and physio and she's doing alright without it\". And so he will [give] feedback and say, \"I disagree with you, I think that we should go ahead with the Botox\". But in this situation we both agreed [to] just hold off on it. And I think Dr. G had seen her, actually, on the consultation for the Botox, and he probably wasn't aware of how well she was doing or what was really going on. So in formal rounds, then, we meet with him and say, \"Dr. M and I talked and we think that we should probably stick with this form of treatment\". So then this, again, is a formal way [to announce] collectively deciding that we think that this patient should probably hold off. And you hear from the other team members then too. Do they think that she should have the Botox or do they think that we should hold off? So they get reinforcement from the team. 185 Another health professional practitioner explained: I usually just go knocking on the [physicians'] doors and say I just want to talk about a certain patient.... It's more of a time issue, right? Because you're busy and we are here till six, seven, eight every night just charting. After you do a full caseload and then you stay here and chart.... You don't have really the time to spend that much time talking. Describing her experience in detail, one health professional practitioner commented on how well biomedical coordination can work: Dr. A will usually come through the back office and he will say to me \"I have this patient presenting with this, and I really want this person seen\". In terms of this other patient, we have a very co-ordinated approach with him because he has a very unique diagnosis. So, that has happened because J talked to Dr. G about him informally, and I've talked to Dr. A informally about him because there are so many investigations going on. Physician-health professional consultation was also reported to occur prior to formal patient referrals, suggesting that allied biomedical practitioners, probably unwittingly, blocked potential referrals to CAM practitioners by not approaching them informally in the same way. A physiotherapist explained: Dr. G will often approach me about a patient that he's unsure about, to refer to me. Oftentimes if he's unsure about the diagnosis, a lot of times we meet. Informal stuff will happen before the patients are referred.... And sometimes, it is decided that physiotherapy is appropriate, or other times like Dr. G will say, \"Well I think this person should see me probably before we get too many people involved\". I find those discussions very helpful. At the WPMC, although doctors and physiotherapists often reported consulting with each other, again biomedical/other health professional and TCM practitioners indicated that they rarely had informal discussions with each other. This lack of communication was observed by a patient receiving acupuncture: They [acupuncturists and biomedical/other health professional practitioners] have to communicate better among themselves...and I've said many, many times, there's not enough communication on a regular 186 basis.... I think the two most important things from the point of view of the pain clinic is there should be more communication among them on a regular basis, not just once in a while at meetings. \"Cause if one isn't available, then the meeting doesn't transpire about this patient. In this patient's opinion, she experienced the direct consequence of a lack of communication between the TCM practitioner and the physiotherapist, when the symptomatic connection between her jaw and neck pain was delayed in being made: When the acupuncturist first felt, I think, that the neck problem had been disguised by the jaw and we're going to get to the bottom of this\u2014the neck is going to be proven to be what's causing the jaw problem\u2014they should have been communicating together about that. They don't have their meetings often enough, I guess, is my sense. In this specific example, effective communication was probably prevented by practitioners' schedules. The patient describes the TCM practitioner's consistent attempts to locate her referring physician in the clinic: \"Quite a few times Dr. L actually would leave me on the table and say, 'I'm going to see if 1 could go find Dr. M'\". Summarizing her overall experience and opinion of this clinical encounter, this patient stated: Sometimes when somebody really comes to an unusual conclusion, like say, for instance, you know, maybe this isn't a jaw problem, maybe this is a neck problem and it seems to be more leaning towards that [I assume], they get together with the patient... [but in my case] I felt Dr. L was having trouble getting ahold of people. Noting the difference in informal communication between biomedical and paramedical practitioners versus biomedical/other health professional and TCM practitioners, one WPMC physician commented: I talk to [other health practitioners] all the time because we do rounds together and also we pass in the corridor. Or they'll come up to me. They'll come in after they've done treatment and tell me what's going on, yes. So we always have feedback from physiotherapists. But we just don't have any feedback from the acupuncturists. 187 No one in the setting made the link between these communication patterns and the fact that physicians and physiotherapists worked similar schedules and thought in the same paradigm. There is also a shared view of the hierarchical relationship between these two professions. Instead of identifying the problematic nature of these particular patterns of communication, responsibility for the failure to communicate seemed to be laid at the doorstep of the CAM practitioners. 7.6 Usurpationary Strategies Among CAM Practitioners CAM practitioners in IHC settings also demonstrated various 'usurpationary strategies' which involved the processes of 'cutting into' the jurisdiction of the more powerful group and simultaneously establishing exclusionary boundaries. As Saks (2002) notes, 'alternative' therapists, just as doctors, \"pursue their own interests in terms of income, status and power in the political game that is being played out\" (2002, p. 13). For example, one of the most significant ways in which CAM professionals established their own exclusionary boundaries was through the construction of their own esoteric and 'expert' knowledge, often reinforced through credentialism. They also, however, reported appropriating biomedical knowledge. 7.6.1 Dual Closure and Esoteric Knowledge As part of 'dual closure' (a form of usurpationary strategy) and the use of esoteric knowledge, CAM professionals employed their own esoteric knowledge, just as physicians did, to establish professional boundaries between themselves and others. For example, one CAM practitioner, while commenting on problems of interprofessional 188 communication in IHC settings, articulated the observation that Western medical doctors do not receive enough training to understand the theoretical notes she might make. She Stated: It's difficult to communicate because although I do get some Western medical training\u2014just an overview\u2014that's not necessarily true the other way. In British Columbia they actually have five weeks of alternative medicine training, but that doesn't mean that they're going to understand the kind of notes that I might make. So they'! know that they're in a programme with me, but any details, they would have to come and speak to me. This practitioner also indicated that her profession did not usually work in therapeutic co- ordination with other CAM professions due to their philosophical and practical differences. Attempts were being made, she noted, at collaboration with other CAM practitioners, but only in the spirit of 'integration'. The majority of CAM practitioners indicated that, similar to medical doctors, only CAM practitioners have the extensive skills and training to practice their particular profession. Thus, while physicians such as those at the CIH were perhaps inadvertently cultivating clientele by appropriating certain technical aspects of CAM professions, physicians were not able to fully understand the theories of CAM practices, thereby maintaining the boundaries between them via the theoretical and esoteric knowledge of CAM practitioners. 7.6.2 Appropriating Biomedical Knowledge In addition to CAM professionals using esoteric knowledge in processes of professional exclusion and dual closure, two other methods of usurpation were identified. First, a minority of CAM professionals in the IHC sites pursued knowledge and training in the basics of biomedicine. This included areas such as anatomy, physiology, 189 pathology, knowledge of Western pharmaceuticals, and other biomedical terminology/technology. As already noted, the majority of CAM practitioners were not in a good position to acquire biomedical practices due to the legally-supported and funded exclusionary and demarcationary nature of biomedical education. Yet, among the minority of CAM practitioners who could understand biomedicine, most notably those in the naturopathic profession, the absorption of biomedical knowledge could be viewed as a significant usurpationary threat to biomedical dominance in IHC settings. For example, one naturopathic doctor commented that her profession was the closest equivalent to a family physician and that if allowed by law, she could conduct nearly all GP medical duties. Yet another CAM practitioner indicated her increasing fluency with biomedicine. She stated: We're given an overview of Western medicine and we recognize the common symptoms of common diseases. For instance, we know when to red-flag. Anything that's not extremely exotic we will be able to say, \"Okay, there is a problem here; this could be diabetes, this could be this, this could be that\". So we know most of the terminology. And if I don't know it, I just look it up to see what is that disease or what is that. One might argue that usurpation of family medicine by naturopathy, at least as far as the middle class is concerned, is already under way, given the already high use of CAM. 7.6.3 Inclusionary Usurpation Murphy's (1988) 'inclusionary usurpation' was also illustrated in these IHC settings to the extent that CAM practitioners gained increasing income and professional status by working in and being associated with biomedical institutions or settings. The majority of CAM practitioners in this study had private practices both within and outside 190 the IHC setting. While CAM practitioners were paid somewhat less in these IHC settings than in private practice, they were, nonetheless, still able to expand their income through their work in the IHC setting. This increase in salary was associated with an increase in referrals. Although the numbers of referrals were lower than in their private practice, they were nevertheless an advantage of being associated with mainstream biomedicine. This process was also noted by Shuval et al. (2002) in their study of solo CAM practitioners working in hospital units in Israel. Although the CAM practitioners in my study did not benefit from access to medical technology as access was legally restricted, in the case of Chiropractic, Coulter notes that \"[t]his type of integration may have financial benefits for the chiropractors (particularly in getting plan coverage) but also may greatly expand the resources they can get access to (X-Ray facilities, scans, laboratory tests, etc.)\" (2004, p. 107). Perhaps related, several CAM practitioners expressed the view that their professional status had risen through their work in a biomedical setting. They felt they had achieved wider recognition and an appearance that Western medicine had given them their 'stamp of approval'. As one CAM practitioner commented: \"It's exciting, you know, working in a setting of a Western hospital\". 7.7 Increasing Patient Activity Finally, perhaps reinforcing professional boundaries around themselves, and resisting exclusionary referral patterns by physicians, CAM practitioners also referred patients amongst each other and increased patient flow. Thus, while CAM practitioners reported being marginalized by the inconsistency of physician referrals and their inability 191 to refer to bio- and paramedical practitioners, at the same time they had developed an informal style of referring amongst themselves. Further, one associate practitioner at the CIH indicated that CAM practitioners had organized impromptu meetings among themselves in order to discuss mutual patients and to provide a form of moral support. This practitioner stated: Right now it's more like we have sort of impromptu meetings ourselves, you know, where [other associate practitioners] next door [will] wind up in my room for tea and will be discussing a session and wanting a little support around something or asking sort of the input of the other. So that's sort of how it happens, and we support each other a lot that way. Thus, a detailed examination of professional closure strategies yields a snapshot of substantial professional rivalry similar to that occurring outside so- called integrative settings. While these practices may be not identified by the practitioners as exclusion or rivalry, social closure theory predicts and explains these practices. 7.8 Summary Closure strategies can clearly be seen to be linked to funding by the state and competition for patients driven by financial interest. Thus closure theory, in this instance, is a useful microsociological approach for examining professional practice in advanced capitalism. Biomedicine, through the actions of physicians, can be seen to be attempting to maintain its dominance in the health care division of labour through a variety of exclusionary closure techniques and demarcationary strategies. As it did historically, it also maintains biomedical esoteric knowledge guarded by credentialism. Ina related process, physicians can be seen to be further absorbing the technical sphere of 192 competence of less powerful CAM practitioners, a strategy that was successful historically. CAM professionals, though incapacitated by exclusionary legislation and lack of funding in IHC settings, nevertheless also enact usurpationary strategies by constructing their own esoteric knowledge guarded by credentialism. They also absorb and employ biomedical terminology; increase their status, prestige and income through association with biomedical institutions; and protect the boundaries of their practices by referring patients amongst themselves. From one angle, these practices might be viewed as 'integrative', however, they are not, in that they are constructed along the fault lines of differing paradigms of health (biomedical and CAM). A critical approach to these observations suggests that biomedicine continues to maintain its dominance in IHC settings despite the struggle for professional power between biomedical and CAM professions. Each is attempting to encroach upon the other and simultaneously to protect its own interests. In a biomedically-dominant Canadian health care system, however, biomedicine is privileged in protecting its exclusive right to practice medicine. CAM professions, by some accounts, appear to be gaining a slow but nevertheless significant change in status as compared to biomedicine. My microanalysis, however, shows how biomedicine maintains its monopoly in everyday practice. Using closure theory reveals the outlines of the strategies through which biomedical practitioners maintain their privileged position in the division of labour. 193 Chapter 8 FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES TO INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE The previous two chapters illustrate, by using specific examples from three IHC sites, how exclusive government funding for biomedical services and interprofessional closure strategies among the biomedical and CAM professions affect patients, practitioners and continuity of care models in IHC settings. It reveals how 'good intentions' may be 'overruled' (Townsend, 1998) even when biomedical practitioners declare commitment to integration of subjugated paradigms of health (Cant & Sharma, 1999, p. 167; Reason, 1991). As Mizrachi et al. state: Exclusion of alternative practitioners from remuneration, recruitment and accreditation enables the biomedical discourse to avoid placing alternative knowledge and practice within the professional field of the hospital (2005, p. 34). One theme that emerges from this microsociological examination of the power relations in the clinical life of IHC settings is the difficulty that practitioners have of thinking in each others' paradigms. For example, I found that biomedical practitioners, despite their commitment to 'green' medicine, do not have a good grounding in theories of holistic health. Indeed, when they 'see' that CAM practitioners have difficulty participating in biomedically-oriented rounds, they tend to attribute the \"paradigm problem' to some deficiency in the CAM mindset. I suggest that these power relations and paradigm differences operate largely outside the consciousness of these practitioners. These processes are so important, however, that I have devoted this chapter to a consideration of addressing the problem, which is the dominance of Eurocentric knowledges over subjugated knowledges. 194 CAM paradigms in IHC settings represent subjugated knowledges, as anti- colonial scholars such as Shiva (1997) and Dei and colleagues (2000) speak of them. To demonstrate this point, I use examples both from IHC practice and from the IHC literature, framed within a CSSP, specifically, an anti-colonial perspective (see Loomba, 1998). As discussed in Chapter Three, an anti-colonial perspective is one that begins from the standpoint of marginalized peoples, perspectives and/or knowledges, with the main goal of providing different and often invisible externalist viewpoints on previously accepted, normalized, dominant and often internalist perspectives and knowledges. In this chapter, I argue that the primary and fundamental challenge to IHC is the dominance of one orientation to health, specifically biomedicine. That is, the \"biomedical paradigm' (BMP), historically and currently, has a hegemonic influence in IHC settings. As briefly touched upon in Chapter Two, the BMP is a situated body of knowledge that is an extension of reductionistic science, based on a set of principles and axioms that are reductionistic. It is a flexible and ever-morphing body of knowledge that has acquired an ideological hegemony over other knowledges. Its technical specialization is now acknowledged worldwide (e.g., advances in surgical and diagnostic techniques; and life-saving drugs). As have many anti-colonial scholars, I am arguing that three significant processes are part and parcel of the dominance of the BMP. These three processes are: (a) the devaluation of 'healing knowledges' that are not biomedical, with the overall effect of this subjugation resulting in what has been called a (biomedical) 'flatland'; (b) the creation of a particular epistemology that accepts only a narrow definition of what counts as 'evidence'; and (c) the creation of a 'monolithic worldview' and its subsequent 'culture clash' with others. Two additional related and important 195 processes are 'paradigm appropriation' and 'paradigm assimilation'. As will be discussed below, all of the above can be seen on both the IHC floor and in the literature. These social processes supporting the dominance of the BMP are discussed and highlighted in this chapter with specific examples observed in the IHC sites I studied. Part of the context for these consequences and processes, that of the nature of paradigms and the rise of the Euroscientific biomedical paradigm, has already been reviewed in Chapter Two. Here I am suggesting that the ideological 'shift' in the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries, further represents a conceptual 'flatland' that continues to have an impact today. This flatland, or Eurocentrism, in anti-colonial terms, I argue, is at the root of the majority of problems and challenges facing IHC. 8.1 'Flatland', 'Nonparticipating Consciousness' and the 'Non-Revolution of Science' conceptualizes 'shift'? as moving from a 'participating' to 'non- participating' consciousness. The latter refers to knowledge acquired by distancing oneself from nature, while the former refers to an 'original participation' through an emotional identification with nature. Participating consciousness was also a form of 'Hermetic wisdom', dedicated to the notion that real knowledge occurred only via the union of subject and object, in a psychic-emotional identification with images rather than a purely intellectual examination of concepts. As indicated, this outlook had been the essential consciousness of Homeric and pre- Homeric Greece.... [P]remodern consciousness was located, mentally speaking, somewhere between pre-Homeric consciousness and the objective outlook of seventeenth-century Europe. With the Scientific Revolution, the considerable remnants of original participation were finally ousted, and this process constituted a significant episode in the history of Western consciousness (1981, p. 71). 196 In Berman's account, participating consciousness was intimately connected to alchemy, in that matter was envisaged as possessing consciousness, and there were no distinctions between mental and material events. In his words, it was \"no more difficult to visualize the earth as a living organism than...to see it as a dead, mechanical object\" (1981, p. 71). Wilber (1998, p. 56) refers to the mechanical paradigm as a 'flatland' (also used as an important critical term and concept by feminist Margaret Eichler) constituted only of the dominant scientific and biomedical paradigm. This concept of biomedicine as Eurocentrism expands previous theories of medical dominance (discussed in Chapter Two) which focus on biomedicine's fit with a capitalist ideology, and the role of the state in supporting allopathic biomedicine versus other nineteenth century healing systems. The 'disaster of modernity' described by Wilber refers to the colonization, domination, invasion and devaluation of other spheres of knowledge by reductionist Eurocentric science. Other spheres of knowledge include art, morals, spirituality and religion, and the already established fields of non-allopathic forms of healing such as homeopathy. The disaster of modernity, in Wilber's view, marks a shift in Western thought from an early modernity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (that still valued the differentiation of art, morals and science in mutually respectful and interactive boundaries) or what Wilber calls the 'dignity' of modernity\u2014to a later modernity. In Wilber's view, this later modemity became 'cancerous' in its relations to others. In effect, empirical science became 'scientism', the belief that there is no reality save that revealed by science, and no truth save that which science delivers. Using the powerful metaphor of an intellectual 'flatland', Wilber (1998, p. 56) describes the subjective and interior domains or 'spheres of knowledge' of indigenous 197 thought being flattened by science into objective, exterior, empirical processes, whereby all non-objective knowledge is dismissed and all valid knowledge becomes 'one- dimensional'. The concept of 'spheres of knowledge', as Brier (1997) notes, implies that other types of knowledge outside of Eurocentric science can and do exist. In 'flatland', what becomes real is any objectifiable entity or process that can be described in valueless, empirical language, using the five senses or extensions of the senses embodied by physical instruments. In scientific orthodoxy, any phenomenon, process or experience that one literally can not 'put their fingers on', simply does not exist. As Newton argued, phenomena that cannot be measured have no place in philosophy (Berman, 1981, p. 43). This orthodoxy leaves no room for other modes of knowing that disclose other constructed realities. Instead, what became real was the world of matter and energy, the world of scientific materialism. As Wilber states: We can also call this disaster \"the collapse of the Kosmos\", because the three great domains \u2014 art, science, and morals \u2014 after their heroic differentiation, were rudely collapsed into only one \"real\" domain, that of empirical and monological science, a world of nothing but meaningless ITs roaming one-dimensional flatland. The scientific worldview was of a universe composed entirely of objective processes. ..with no consequences, no interiors, no values, no meaning, no depth (1998, p. 56). Harding (1998), feminist critic of what she refers to as 'Euroscience', focusses on the colonization of non-European (viewed as 'other') knowledges by an emerging new science in the seventeenth century. Among her many arguments, she points out that: 1) many different 'sciences' exist (both European and non-European) and each contains unique local knowledges; 2) the emergence of the Euroscience of the Enlightenment was a slow, contested and gradual process (as opposed to how it is traditionally presented in history texts); 3) science as we know it today is in fact 'multicultural', having heavily 198 appropriated (and also altered) technologies and other sciences from non-European cultures such as from India, China, and the Islamic worlds (as briefly noted in Chapter Two). Ultimately, Harding suggests that the scientific revolution may not have been a revolution at all, in that it co-opted, absorbed, and changed previously-existing non- European knowledges. Differing from Berman, Harding argues that: Thus, the purportedly purely Greek legacy that Europeans retrieved from the Alexandrian libraries had been created not only by Greeks some millennium and a half earlier, but also by all the intervening cultures in Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean that had revised and enriched it. Once historians began exploring seriously the positive and constitutive effects on the growth of modern science that Egyptian mystical elements and indigenous European alchemy and astrology had proved, it became clear that modern notions of rationality could no longer be said to have played the lead role in birthing modern sciences.... The emergence of modern sciences and technologies in Europe was a slow and gradual process. Moreover, medieval Europeans, like their early modern descendants, were in continual contact and exchange with other cultures in India, China, and other parts of the world (1998, p. 29). From Harding's perspective, physicians appropriating CAM practices would be part of a long history of appropriation. For example, herbal knowledge has been appropriated, and its Aboriginal source is not acknowledged (Tripp & Muzzin, 2005). European appropriation of indigenous knowledges led to their subjugation. As Harding states: Most obviously since 1492 and the beginnings of five centuries of European Voyages of Discovery, the growth of modern sciences and technologies in Europe and the relative decline of other cultures' knowledge systems have been causally related (1998, pp. 126-127). As will be noted below, colonial processes of local knowledge devaluation, and colonial appropriation and assimilation of these knowledges are interwoven. Non-European knowledges (e.g., non-biomedical) historically have been devalued in the pursuit of one 'true' account of nature (Harding, 1998, p. 165). The harshest critique is that these 199 processes have led to \"the production of systematic ignorance\" (Harding, 1998, pp. 168- 169). Following this line of logic, it is no longer acceptable to argue that European cultures produced culturally neutral, universally valid knowledge, while other cultures did not. What can be called the 'universality thesis' (Harding, 1998, p. 185) of Euroscience and biomedicine conversely decreases valuable forms of cognitive knowledge diversity. What 'counts' as valid science largely depends on the interests of different cultures. As Harding states: The dream of a unity of nature that justified the positivist unity of science programs in the early twentieth century is only a delusion since nature itself is heterogeneously organized such that there can be no one uniquely valid representation of it.... [A]ll knowledge, no matter how universally valid it is regarded to be, is local knowledge.... [T]here can be many culturally distinctive and yet scientifically valuable ways of organizing the production of knowledge about the natural world (1998, pp. 67, 72). In the conceptual flatland, by which the Western world denied substantial reality to multiple ways of knowing, evolved 'integrative' health care. Brier concludes: This science and technology belief, where science becomes a \"great story\", has a lot in common with traditional societies' myths and dogma- based cultures. The myth defines among other things, what true knowledge, true values and real beauty are. Instead of becoming a real liberating knowledge, science is to a certain degree raising its limited viewpoint to a dogma called \"the scientific world view\", which now through the \"Big Bang\" theory, the theory of a \"genetic program\" governing life, and through \"cognitive science\" and \"artificial intelligence\" promises of finding the algorithms behind language and intelligence, and implementing them in the computer, attempts to control our whole view of reality.... Knowledge of natural science has a very high authority in today's society, to a certain degree at the cost of other forms of knowledge (1997, pp. 114, 116). 200 8.2 Maintaining Biomedical Dominance in IHC Settings 8.2.1 Biomedical Flatland: Devaluing CAM Knowledge The overt devaluation of CAM knowledge clearly occurred in IHC settings in this study. The devaluation of CAM knowledge was primarily apparent at the WPMC, where the theoretical paradigm and practice of traditional Chinese medicine was repeatedly devalued in favour of biomedical knowledge. One of many examples was a clinical and professional interaction between a biomedical physician and a TCM practitioner at the WPMC, when they were treating a mutually-shared patient. This interaction was recounted by the patient, who observed the interaction between the two practitioners in the patient's room, as they were discussing her case. The patient sets the stage by summarizing how the interaction first took place: The acupuncturist called the doctor in one day and the acupuncturist felt that there was some tear in my tissue. He felt that in my spine I had a malfunction. He felt that there was something going on that hadn't yet been [biomedically] diagnosed. Well, the doctor came into the room and I thought indirectly they kind of had words. You know, I felt that maybe the doctor didn't appreciate the fact that [the acupuncturist] was sort of becoming too strong and saying, you know, \"There is just too much going on here in this young lady for her to be coping with this\". And the acupuncturist went down my spine with his hands, and as you know, they can get into that spine and they know every little part of it, and he came up with three points in my spinal tissue that he felt were damaged, and the doctor didn't feel that that was the case. Describing how the interchange ended, this patient said: Well, how it ended was that the acupuncturist became a little agitated. He became agitated because he was very concerned. He knew that I was in pain, and I think he felt that the physician could have done more. So because I sensed the situation, I then came out and asked the receptionist if I could speak with the doctor, and I then had an MRI done. 201 Further reflecting on the professional interchange between her acupuncturist and her doctor, this patient commented: I think that the doctor felt stronger and felt more of an authority and [that] it was his clinic. And the doctor had been here for x number of years and he had brought these people into his clinic, his room, his home, and that he felt that he was still the expert.... He's trained as a medical doctor and the acupuncturist is trained as a different type. Yes, I didn't think it was appropriate. Ultimately, the patient received an MRI, which she reported confirmed the physician's diagnosis in the biomedical paradigm. This did not, however, rule out the interpretation of the TCM practitioner of a problem with 'Qi' (pronounced 'chee'), which when blocked is associated with illness in the TCM paradigm. From a biomedical perspective, however, the existence of Qi has yet to be confirmed by biomedical scientific tests. While the patient's account could be interpreted from the perspective of professional closure theory such as discussed in the previous chapter, I suggest that the significant observations here from the perspective of subjugated knowledges theorizing are: a) the tension between the two diagnostic paradigms of biomedicine and TCM; and b) the ultimate discounting of one paradigm in favour of another (biomedical over TCM). Based on my observations in IHC settings and analysis of the literature, I suspect that the above type of knowledge devaluation is also widespread throughout the biomedical and paramedical professions (e.g., with differing opinions between specialists; or in the discounting of diagnostic categories and/or treatment regimes by professionally dominant physicians over less-powerful paramedical professions such as nurses or physiotherapists). What is different in IHC settings, however, is that where the biomedical and paramedical professions exist in relatively autonomous occupational groups governed by professional associations, the majority of CAM practitioners such as 202 acupuncturists are, as yet, not formally organized. Mizrachi et al. summarize this concept by stating: While other sub-medical fields and para-medical professionals such as nurses, technicians, physiotherapists and others might differ in the nature of their practice, the length of their training, the degree of abstraction of their knowledge and the level of academic education, they are all inherently related to the scientific biomedical system of knowledge (2005, p. 34). As demonstrated by the example, acupuncturists have much less professional power to contest biomedical diagnoses. Even if acupuncturists could command more respect, the interaction would be challenged by the lack of understanding by biomedical practitioners of TCM diagnostic categories (e.g., 'BI' syndrome, discussed below). Making these knowledges invisible is part and parcel of biomedical hegemony. As detailed in the previous chapter, debates between biomedical and paramedical practitioners are usually held in one main language\u2014biomedicine\u2014with a predictable outcome. The main point here is that biomedical knowledge is viewed as superior to TCM. 8.2.2 Biomedical 'Evidence' Part of the devaluation of non-biomedical health knowledge involves emphasizing the importance of bioscientific evidence of efficacy. One can argue that knowledge devaluation is quickly followed by 'choosing' biomedical evidence over others. Decisions about evidence\u2014what constitutes healing, the efficacy of a given therapy, or proof\u2014are an important part of the disputes in the literature about IHC today. The traditional argument or stance of biomedicine, based upon reductionist or positivistic science, is that health and disease can be understood and explained using reductionist or positivistic principles. In biomedicine, part of reductionist science contemporary 203 discourses hold that the effectiveness of health and healing and its therapies and processes can be proven or disproven using the biomedical gold standard, the randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). This methodology is part and parcel of the pharmaceutical industry's drug approval system. While it is now conceded by many scientists that one cannot simply sum up, describe and explain the world as it is directly observed or seen (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Harding, 1998; Wilber, 1998), paradoxically, an increasing reliance on RCTs has led to the support of 'evidence-based' medicine (EBM) as the new arbitrator of health and healing, as a form of 'post-positivism'. This biomedical worldview of restricted evidence types has been normalized through such comments as: \"\"There is no alternative medicine. There is only scientifically proven, evidence-based medicine supported by solid data or unproven medicine, for which scientific evidence is lacking'\" (Fontanarosa & Lundberg, 1998, p. 1618). As Coulter counters: \"To claim that CAM must become evidence-based, however, is to make an epistemological claim, a preference for one form of knowledge over another. It is also a claim for the primacy of the epistemological basis of orthodox medicine\" (2004, p. 109). Harding (1998, pp. 2-3) notes that Euroscience and biomedicine operates from an internalist versus externalist epistemology, reflecting a 'unity of science' approach where there is only one 'true' nature, and one pure science that can reveal this reality. The perceived unity of science is based on a less visible exercise of ideological power through such aspects as research priorities and language (Harding, 1998, p. 131). As Harding States: Objectivism defends and legitimates the institutions and practices through which the distortions and their often exploitative consequences are generated. It certifies as value neutral, normal, natural, and therefore not political at all the policies and practices through which powerful groups can gain the information and 204 explanations that they need to advance only their priorities\u2014ones that usually conflict with others'.... Truth claims are a way of closing down discussion, of ending critical dialogue, of invoking authoritarian standards. They deny the possibility of continuing processes of gaining knowledge in the future (1998, pp. 132, 145). As Willis and White point out, \"EBM as a methodology, privileges certain types of evidence over others and arranges these in a hierarchy with randomised controlled trials (preferably of the double-blind crossover variety) at the apex\" (2004, p. 50). In contrast to CAM, Kaptchuk and Miller further point out that medical science is suspicious of \"anecdotal\" or simple empirical experience. What is observed in everyday circumstances cannot be trusted as much as what is observed (and preferably measured and replicated) under controlled conditions. Bias and extraneous factors (such as spontaneous remission, natural history, or placebo effects) constantly threaten genuine knowledge claims about treatment efficacy in mainstream medicine (2005, p. 287). In contrast, in the CAM paradigms, however, [iJmmediate and personal experiences are positively valued, while objective detachment and analytic methods are not. CAM does not rely on evaluations of treatments by experimental controls, blind assessment, placebo comparisons, and statistical inferences, even though such methods are considered essential for adherents of mainstream medicine who want to evaluate CAM therapies (Kaptchuk & Miller, 2005, p. 288). Even a minority of MDs recognize that [i]t is through the experience of multiple single-case studies that one develops judgment. This accumulation of knowledge helps create wisdom that allows the experienced clinician to make better decisions. For this reason, clinical guidelines will never be followed universally because they ignore the wisdom of the clinician in matching the therapy to the unique individual. Research should help us to follow and improve our judgment. The assimilation of the information should be global whereas the implementation should be local (Rakel & Weil, 2003, p. 5). and that [l]istening to our gut or having a \"hunch\" is involved in the everyday practice of medicine. It reaches beyond what we can currently explain and accesses a subtle energy than we can only feel. Many lives have been saved by the astute clinician 205 who admits the patients with atypical chest pain when diagnostic studies are negative and risk factors few (Rakel & Weil, 2003, p. 5). Where does this leave IHC in the debate about evidence? A minority of members of the biomedical community recognize the relativity of reductionist science and acknowledge that 'good medicine' must always be based in 'good science' that is inquiry-driven and open to new paradigms (e.g., Bell et al., 2002). Yet, they also recognize that the medical establishment does not necessarily always show openness to new paradigms. This suggests that cultural values that ultimately can be seen as. originating with European colonialism continue to reinforce the dominance of the biomedical paradigm, rather than what is presented in sanitized form as 'good medicine'. The end result is that biomedical forms of evidence or 'proof' about the nature of reality, health and healing are chosen to be valued over and above others, resting on a Eurocentrically-reinforced worldview. As Anthony (1987, p. 762) notes, \"the double- blind randomized controlled trial, in its standard form, is often not applicable to trials in complementary medicine\". Further, he argues that: \"Blind\" designs are rarely possible with respect either to the therapist or the patient. Most complementary therapies involve some physical treatment, instruction or training which cannot be disguised, and although placebo 'treatments' have been devised for some of these (for example, the use of false acupuncture points), their validity has been questioned. Complementary therapies recognize the effects of the therapist as an integral part of treatment and, although they appreciate the need for evaluation of the safety and efficacy of individual components of therapy, they would expect that the overall effectiveness of management be judged from assessment of the whole therapeutic encounter (Anthony, 1987, p. 762) (original emphasis). Connected to the devaluing of CAM knowledge in the sites I studied was commitment among biomedical practitioners that favoured biomedical evidence over other forms. There was a certain skepticism expressed both by WPMC biomedical and 206 paramedical practitioners concerning CAM modalities, and this skepticism was framed within the evidence-based medicine (EBM) debate concerning what constitutes 'evidence', 'efficacy', and 'proof' that a given therapy works. Reflecting on this debate, one health professional practitioner in my study commented: Under the medical model, the gold standard is randomized controlled trials. Let's blind the patients, put them in two groups, allow them to have different forms of treatment, figure out what's the best. And so with medicine that's easy to do under a pharmacology model; but when it comes to certain treatments, you can't blind the patients and tell them one thing when it is not. I mean, they sort of know, and it's difficult with acupuncture too. So if the acceptance of evidence-based medicine is just this gold standard randomized controlled trial, that's why I think there's a lot of hesitancy for people to use that [CAM], because it's not a medical model. It's not proven that way. Another physician actually cautioned on the potential risks to patients of using CAM, reflecting rejection of CAM in the biomedical literature: Now, what this is all leading up to, is [that] there are methods out there, alternative methods which are potentially harmful to patients, and therefore shouldn't be used. The thing to consider is that you divert a patient from an accepted form of treatment to an alternative treatment which is not proven. Again, I think you have to look at this situation case by case. If the patient has cancer, and somebody offers an alternative treatment versus a known treatment that has a high chance of curing them, I think it's malpractice to push them to the alternative. In fact, our job is to try to convince them to take the proven form of treatment. [emphasis added] Ultimately, this physician indicated that, in his opinion, the majority of WPMC physicians and other health professional practitioners remained skeptical of CAM, and acupuncture in particular. This view he traced to his immersion in the reductionist biomedical paradigm: All of us are a little skeptical. I mean, I've done a Ph.D. [and] two fellowships. If I can't prove it in a test tube, it ain't real. Well, that's bullshit of course. We all know that. But I'm still of that mind that I need 207 a scientific explanation for something or it isn't right. So it's a deep-down ingrained training I've got. Mizrachi et al., in their study of solo CAM practitioners in hospital settings, also found that when biomedical practitioners were confronted with CAM, the general view was \"unless alternative knowledge is scientifically validated, its nature and logic remain unknown\" (Mizrachi et al., 2005, p. 31). Drawing on Foucault, this reflects what they refer to as \"what type of knowledge does one want to disqualify when one asks: 'Is ita science'\" (Mizrachi & Shuval, 2005, p. 1650)? As they argue: \"In other words, controlling knowledge in a professional field involves monitoring, regulating, differentiating and restricting actors who carry different forms of knowledge\" (2005, p. 1650). In their study, Mizrachi and Shuval also found that \"[aJJl biomedical practitioners in the field perceived science as the ultimate reference point for medical truth\" (2005, p. 1652). They further argue: The ethos of evidence-based medicine provides the organizing principle of boundary demarcation between the two medical systems, granting the biomedical practitioners the ultimate epistemological authority to differentiate between legitimate and non-legitimate medical care. The notion of \"evidence\" is restricted to the realm of visible and biological signs, which can be explored by laboratory and experimental scientific work. In the biomedical form of boundary-work, scientific knowledge is often marked by a direct reference to visible signs necessary for biomedical diagnosis (2005, p. 1653). The above two examples in this research further represent what Harding (1998, p. 13) refers to as 'overt' and 'covert' ethnocentrism. In the first example, the goal of the physician is to divert the patient from the biomedically-unproven to the biomedically- proven treatment, based on the covert belief that non-European health practices (CAM) are inferior. In the second example, overt Eurocentrism is indicated by this physician's declared preference for Western scientific/biomedical proof for CAM to be 'real'. 208 Despite the fact that biomedical and paramedical practitioners insisted that they supported CAM at both the CIH and the WPMC, CAM practices were spoken of by biomedical practitioners as only to be used if they were proven without a doubt to be completely safe. This finding is consistent with other studies of GPs' opinions of CAM (see Adams, in Tovey et al., 2004). Similar warnings were not made about biomedical therapies. As Mizrachi and Shuval also found, it was inconceivable for patients to have said \"I don't believe in biomedical treatment\": There is an unstated assumption that dangers and risks do not occur within the territorial boundaries of biomedicine. By calling attention to risks and dangers in the use of alternative medicine, the biomedical discourse places alternative practitioners outside the legitimate biomedical zone (2005, p. 1657). It was important to these biomedical practitioners that even if they didn't help a patient, CAM therapies be completely benign. This view of CAM modalities is in contrast to how biomedical techniques used in the sites are viewed, with accepted levels of iatrogenesis or side effects. I have referred to this accepted risk-benefit ratio elsewhere as the 'paradox of do no harm' (Hollenberg, 2000). On the other hand, CAM practitioners critiqued how RCTs distort the practice of TCM. One TCM practitioner in my study explained: If you bring in 100 cancer patients and you give them all the same formula, our scientific medical community will brand us as almost murderers. Because if half those people die, you know, they didn't get the proper diagnosis. They didn't get the differential diagnosis. That's the core of Chinese medicine, which means that every person gets treated for the reasons they got cancer, and the reason they have their symptoms might be completely different than the guy next to them. So it will never be practiced that way. So you can't give the same formula to 200 people, you cannot. Now you've broken Chinese medicine. It's not Chinese medicine any more, it's a Western study using Chinese herbs or using acupuncture, but it's not Chinese medicine any more. 209 Thus a fair and equitable understanding of subjugated paradigms by dominant groups requires a form of anthropological 'cultural relativism'. And a breakdown in understanding could be due to a form of 'culture clash': aspects of a world view (e.g., reductionism) that disable seemingly foreign concepts from being valued and/or understood (assuming that foreign concepts can even be translated for those outside of the 'culture' in question). As Brier (1997, p. 113) states: Science \u2014 and here especially natural science \u2014 has a double role in that it is both a technology developer and world-view producer. Faith in science as an instrument for obtaining knowledge of the world is an important part of the foundation of our faith in technology as the right means of developing society, and of \"the modern world view\". This is marked by an incoherent combination of empiricism and rationalism as epistemology and an ontology combining dualism with eliminative materialism in the form of physicalism imbedded in a theory of evolution believing in the 'self-organization' of matter. Further, as Capra notes: The biomedical model today is much more than a model. Among the medical profession it has acquired the status of a dogma, and for the general public it is inextricably linked to the common cultural belief system. To go beyond it will require nothing less than a profound cultural revolution. As such a revolution is necessary if we want to improve, or even maintain, our health. The shortcomings of our current health care system \u2014 in terms of health costs, effectiveness, and fulfillment of human needs \u2014 are becoming more and more conspicuous and are increasingly recognized as stemming from the restrictive nature of the conceptual model on which it is based (1982, p. 162). In short, I am arguing that the valuing of bioscientific evidence by de-valuing other forms is at the heart of problems that occur in IHC settings. It is important to emphasize that the domination of biomedicine does not occur only on the level of philosophical knowledge construction (i.e., interfering with the attempt to merge health paradigms). It occurs daily in the course of interaction between practitioners of diverse backgrounds and their patients in the wider institutional context. In other words, for the 210 CAM practitioner trying to practice, the 'everyday world becomes problematic' (Smith, 1987). As Patel notes, cultures can clash on the level of philosophy, part of which is embodied in taxomony: These methods of comparing alternatives cannot always be easily adapted to compare treatments originating from different schools of thought based on incompatible world views. In the latter case, not only may the effects sought be qualitatively different, but also the definition of the original problem, the diagnosis (1987, p. 172). Culture-clash at the level of everyday clinical practice led to the majority of biomedical practitioners in my research not fully understanding the terminology and diagnosis/etiology of CAM modalities. For example, at the CTH, although physicians had clearly expanded their 'therapeutic world view' towards a deeper appreciation of CAM; were suggesting and prescribing CAM to their patients; and had even apprenticed in several CAM techniques (e.g., medical acupuncture), they indicated that they did not fully understand certain forms of CAM. The lack of understanding by biomedical practitioners and stakeholders of CAM, and their varying perceptions of its effectiveness, could be seen to have far-reaching effects on the possibility of establishing collaborative practice. At the WPMC, for example, perhaps due to a lack of understanding of the way in which traditional Chinese medicine is meant to be practiced, acupuncturists were unable to realize the full spectrum of traditional Chinese medicine. In contrast to the CIH, in the hospital environment, WPMC acupuncturists were unable to prescribe traditional Chinese herbal preparations or practice the technique of 'moxibustion' (the burning of the herb 'mugwort' over the surface of an acupoint to stimulate the flow of Qi along the meridian). This example represents Harding's concept of 'institutional' eurocentrism, where highly trained 211 acupuncturists are institutionally restricted from practicing in their full scope of practice in Western hospitals (1998, p. 13). Kailin (2001, p. 46) has also termed this process as a 'dominating integration pattern', which 'distorts' and diminishes the clinical benefits of CAM, and may lead to patient harm. Not only did this limitation have a negative effect on the practices of WPMC practitioners who had received full traditional Chinese medicine training, but it also limited their therapeutic use of acupuncture, which traditionally is meant to be practiced alongside other TCM modalities. As the majority of biomedical practitioners at the WPMC were not entirely convinced of the effectiveness of acupuncture, their skepticism limited the referral of patients by biomedical practitioners to the acupuncture service. An anti-colonial critique of the subjugation of non-dominant knowledges gives a new view of the domination of referral patterns by biomedical practitioners in the WPMC described in the previous chapter. Biomedical practitioners were simply skeptical of acupuncture, and so why would they refer patients to the acupuncture service? As Hui, Zylowska, Hui,. Yu and Li state: \"Because conventional Western medicine and complementary medicine have evolved in different cultural and philosophical contexts, CM [complementary medicine] concepts are foreign to the allopathically trained mind and may appear counterintuitive\" (2002, p. 510). For example, when one patient's physician was asked why he did not suggest acupuncture to his patient, the physician responded: I don't tend to think of acupuncture as a diagnostic technique, although I do recognize that there is a diagnostic paradigm or a copy of a diagnostic paradigm. So, at least initially I was looking at what was the cause of her condition, and so I think that's perhaps why I didn't suggest acupuncture at the beginning. 212 What was the clinical significance of this failure to see the value of acupuncture? Several patients indicated that they were able to lower their intake of pain medications through receiving acupuncture treatments. These important clinical observations, however, were not closely followed by their attending physician and perhaps not even known by them. 8.2.3 Paradigm Appropriation and Assimilation In paradigm appropriation, one healing system appropriates or takes on certain aspects of other healing systems or traditions without fully acknowledging the 'paradigmatic worldview' from which the particular treatment aspect is taken. CAM researchers and theorists have recognized this phenomenon, describing it as a situation where \"clinicians and researchers...break off parts of these CAM or other systems from their original context to fit a few of these smaller pieces into the dominant model of conventional care and medical research\" (Bell et al., 2002, p. 134). Indeed, \"The increasing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients in the last decade has prompted the medical profession to take a closer look at therapies outside the conventional medical system\" (Hui et al., 2002, p. 507). For example, medical acupuncture is now widely practiced by many biomedical practitioners such as nurses, doctors and physiotherapists in North America and Europe. Medical acupuncture, however, as noted above, is practiced well outside of the traditional Chinese medicine paradigm, which is sometimes viewed as redundant or not necessary for the practice of acupuncture itself. This distinction is reflected in the proposed regulation of TCM and acupuncture in Ontario (2005), which separates the 213 two. As with any case of appropriation, particular aspects of the phenomenon that is appropriated are always subjugated and lost. A particular healing system only appropriates certain aspects of other healing traditions, and inevitably loses key theoretical aspects. That theoretical knowledge was lost in these so-called integrated settings is supported by the observation that practitioners of medical acupuncture, such as these at the WPMC, do not fully 'understand' the theory of TCM. As mentioned earlier, similar observations were made in a recent study of medical acupuncture practiced by physicians in Germany (Frank & Stollberg, 2004). Similarly, Mizrachi et al. found that: Physicians who favour collaboration with alternative practitioners express cautious recognition of the possible positive effects of alternative treatment, but always exclude the knowledge base from their discussion. They regard the knowledge base of alternative medicine as an unknown or a matter of personal belief (2005, p. 32). As noted above, the five physicians at the CIH had incorporated diverse CAM modalities into their clinical practices, including medical acupuncture, but did not necessarily fully understand the accompanying theoretical paradigms. Discussed in the previous chapter as examples of the use of closure strategies, these examples can here be seen as paradigm appropriation 'in action'. In paradigm appropriation, there appears to be a careful, yet purposeful, separation of appropriated technique from the legitimate CAM healing paradigm. This purposeful separation of technique from healing paradigm could be said to be rampant throughout biomedical physicians' appropriation of CAM. CAM is viewed as 'complementing' biomedicine, versus as a legitimate alternative. As Adams (in Tovey et al., 2004) found in his analysis of GPs practicing CAM, GPs would 214 always use the biomedical diagnostic paradigm first, versus a CAM diagnosis. Adams states: While many of the GPs note that there are alternative diagnostic systems associated with certain unconventional medicines (for example, in the case of acupuncture and homeopathy, these are often used to contrast a GP approach to the therapies with the approach of the non-medically qualified (in Tovey et al., 2004, p. 146). As outlined above, the concept and 'act' of paradigm appropriation is not new, tracing its lineage to European colonial expansion. It is also enmeshed with knowledge devaluation and notions of superior scientific knowledge as compared to 'less superior' non-European knowledges, where other knowledges only become 'acceptable' when absorbed and employed by Euroscience. As Harding puts it (1998, p. 179), European sciences 'foraged' in other cultures for elements of indigenous sciences that were deemed useful for colonial expansion. Harding states: Native informants taught Europeans about the local flora and fauna and how to use them, minerals and ores and how to extract them, climates and how to survive them, diseases and other threats to health and how to avoid them, pharmacological remedies, agricultural, fishing and engineering practices, land and sea routes, and much of the rest of the knowledge traditions developed and stored in local cultures. Incorporated into the European sciences were those parts of this local knowledge that fit into the prevailing European conceptual frameworks. Those parts that did not fit were ignored or rejected. As the historians point out, not all the resources for modern sciences that the Europeans encountered in other cultures' knowledge traditions were initially perceived to be such, however. Europeans encountered mathematical notions they could not use till decades and even centuries later, and pharmacological knowledge that only now are the northern pharmaceutical companies systematically interested in gathering. A history of \"unborrowed knowledge\" can provide an illuminating accompaniment to the histories of borrowed knowledge (1998, p. 179-180). [emphasis added] Further, indigenous knowledges from around the globe were synthesized for the colonial goal of expansion. As already mentioned, local non-European knowledge systems were destroyed in this process (e.g., the widespread use of traditional medicines was 215 eventually replaced by synthesized drugs in colonized areas, or were driven underground). Paradigm appropriation was crucial to the success of European sciences. As Harding argues: Indeed, it was precisely the use of local resources that enabled modern sciences to emerge in Europe according to postcolonial accounts. European expansion and the growth of modern sciences in Europe were causally linked in that each contributed important resources to the success of the other. Without the knowledge of those daunting aspects of nature's order that Europeans encountered in the \"voyages of discovery\", knowledge provided by the emerging modern sciences, Europe could not have successfully developed the imperial and colonial relations that permitted it to achieve global leadership. Modern sciences helped Europe shift from being just one of a number of cultures around the globe that were living through the beginning of the end of feudalism in the late Middle Ages to becoming the single most important center of the early or proto-capitalist global economic and political relations that it would spread around the globe. Moreover, without the diverse resources provided by European expansion, modern sciences would have had a far more difficult time emerging\u2014perhaps they would not have emerged in Europe (1998, p. 177). The parallels between historically-situated European conquests, and the present day appropriation of CAM by biomedicine, is clearly seen when CAM modalities are \"technically adopted\" (Yoshida, 2002) while leaving their theoretical knowledge behind, and simultaneously rejecting their origin. As Harding illustrates: To take another example, now acupuncture has been integrated into European medical practices for the control of chronic pain. Of course what has been extracted from the Asian systems of thought and practice from which it has been borrowed is just those elements that will fit into modern biomedicine. Discarded are the rest of the Asian beliefs about bodies that get in or out of \"balance\", and how to keep them in balance, that do not coherently fit into modern biomedicine's ontology and epistemology. Yet we can ask: if these elements of other cultures' knowledge systems have become scientific once they have been adopted into the culturally distinctive ontology, epistemology, psychic structures, and political economy of European sciences, why weren't they just as scientific before, when they were embedded in different culturally distinctive interests, discourses, and ways of organizaing the production of knowledge? After all, zero and acupuncture \"worked\" both theoretically and practically in those contexts no less than they do in this one. And why should we regard those larger bodies of culturally distinctive beliefs of other cultures as only containing obstacles to the growth of knowledge about the natural world when those cultural values and 216 interests produced the thinking and practices of zero and acupuncture that have proved so valuable far beyond their cultures of origin?... It no longer appears reasonable to argue that while some cultures manage to stumble upon empirically adequate claims, only modern science's claims are produced by culturally neutral, and thus universally valid, methods.... No matter how effective other cultures' (including \"women's cultures\") knowledge traditions are, were, or might have been for enabling effective interaction with natural worlds, they are not counted as real sciences. No matter how much modern sciences might have incorporated elements of other cultures' concepts and theories about nature, their mathematical and empirical techniques, and even whole bodies of their accumulated navigational, medical, pharmacological, climatological, agricultural, manufacturing, or other effective knowledge enabling prediction, and control of nature, these other bodies of knowledge are not counted as \"real science\" until incorporated into European knowledge systems (1998, pp. 174, 166). I distinguish paradigm appropriation from assimilation, referring to paradigm assimilation as an instance where one paradigm assimilates or takes over another entire healing paradigm or system, rather than just a part. The attributes and characteristics of the assimilated paradigm are eliminated, redefined, or given new names and meanings by the assimilating paradigm, just as the villages of colonized territories were given new names by European settlers. As Mizrachi et al. found: The logic of alternative medicine appears to be reduced to the terms of the hegemonic epistemology of biomedicine (2005, p. 30). Paradigm assimilation can have effects both external to biomedicine (as an overt practice), and internal to CAM modalities, similar to a 'pan-optican' type of internal regulation. As Mizrachi and Shuval note: \"In the field, alternative specialties may have gained legitimacy by the extent to which their logic of practice appeared to be similar to biomedicine or reducible to the biomedical logic and epistemology\" (2005, p. 1655). For example, acupuncture, understood in traditional Chinese medicine as stimulating the flow of Qi along body meridians to resolve chi obstruction and to promote healing, becomes instead in biomedicine the stimulation of cells to release pain-relieving 217 endorphins. Indigenous herbs with synergistic spiritual, psychoactive and healing properties are reduced to having 'pharmacologically active' ingredients. The healing and social relationship between patient arid healer\u2014the powerful effects of homeopathy, spiritual healing, Reiki and therapeutic touch\u2014-become mere 'placebo'. In anti-colonial terms, paradigm assimilation can further be viewed as part and parcel of a \"predatory conceptual framework\" (Harding, 1998, p. 181) that substitutes foreign, abstract and ahistorical concepts for previously coherent local (indigenous) knowledges. This predatory framework can also be seen at work in the devaluation of CAM knowledge, the creation of Eurocentric worldviews and in the construction of 'universally valid' scientific evidence. The re-interpretation of previously self-contained knowledge forms, however, is related but different. Aligned to appropriation with a predatory conceptual framework is a notion of 'value neutrality' that, as some have expressed, is a \"rude and brutal cultural intrusion\" (Harding, 1998, p. 61). Further, as Shiva argues (1997, pp. 15\u201416), the process of 'forgetting' also occurs here, where certain knowledge areas are neglected for pieces of other knowledge forms, which are then over-emphasized. Paradigm assimilation occurred to some extent in all three IHC settings in this study. One example found at both the WPMC and Sunnybrook and Women's sites was the general view among biomedical practitioners that acupuncture was 'effective' only for certain physiological conditions (e.g., muscle pain). This view was largely based on reviewed scientific studies of acupuncture that demonstrated physiological effects instead of the readily available explanations based in TCM theory itself. Paradigm assimilation occurs throughout biomedical attempts to understand, and ultimately 218 integrate, CAM into biomedicine. Recent attempts by medical schools to graduate so- called 'integrative' physicians that appropriate CAM modalities and ultimately marginalize CAM practitioners can also be seen as illustrative of these attempts at appropriation. The concepts of paradigm appropriation and assimilation throw the ideal of transdisciplinarity promoted by systems theorists in IHC into question. The ideal of transdisciplinarity suggests that practitioners should apprentice in and take at will, skill sets from other established disciplines, such as one might choose a tool for building construction. From a critical perspective, however, transdisciplinarity is a naive assumption in health care settings that are always enmeshed in power relations and where exclusionary tactics amongst disciplines and practitioners are everyday occurrences. For example, in recent analyses of physicians practicing medical acupuncture, as noted above, Yoshida (2002) argues that one way physicians accept acupuncture is through what she calls 'technical adoption', or using acupuncture merely for its technical versus theoretical value. The euphemistic term 'technical adoption' seems harmless from a biomedical perspective. However, when viewed through an anti-colonial perspective as 'paradigm appropriation' and 'paradigm assimiliation', they are of much more serious consequence for so-called 'integrative' health care than at first glance. Both strategies ultimately exclude practitioners and healing systems from outside the appropriating or assimilating paradigm professionally, economically and ideologically. Second, both strategies, particularly assimilation, foster the reduction of multiple ways of understanding health and healing to one dominant Eurocentric viewpoint (e.g., evidence-based medicine)\u2014thus facilitating 'devaluing spheres of 219 knowledge' (biomedical flatland). At the heart of the ideals of IHC is the inter- /transdisciplinary combination of diverse healing practices, practiced while respecting and incorporating the knowledge, terminology and traditions from whence they came. While it is fair to expect that healing traditions outside of biomedicine also enact paradigm appropriation or assimilation to varying degrees (for example, the practice of medical acupuncture by naturopathic doctors, and of biomedical terminology), as Shiva argues (1997), biomedicine and the biomedical paradigm upon which it is based is arguably the most widespread and powerful appropriative and assimilative force in the world's health care systems today. Harding (1998) points out that it is common for many professions, including biomedicine, to 'borrow' unacknowledged concepts from other professions and traditions. She states, however, that What is at issue here is only the eurocentric failure to acknowledge the origins and importance to modern sciences and technologies of these borrowings from non-European cultures, and also thereby to trivialize the achievements of their scientific and technological traditions (1998, p. 36). Biomedical paradigm appropriation and assimilation go even further than non- acknowledgement by using and changing CAM practices for its own use. As already noted by anti-colonial scholars and historians of science, these practices are not uncommon to early colonial biomedical exploits, such as the male-physician takeover of midwifery, previously practiced exclusively by female midwives in the mid-nineteenth century (Mitchinson, 1991). There is a largely unacknowledged danger in the development of IHC, not only for CAM in Western industrialized countries, but also for indigenous healing knowledges in other non-Western countries such as India and China. For example, despite the enactment of IHC policies and a pluralistic health care system in 220 these countries, Western medicine has gained a strong foothold and increasing social status over indigenous healing systems and practices (Unschuld, 1998). 8.3 Summary To summarize, in this chapter I have argued that major challenges exist to realizing IHC in practice, stemming from the dominance of the biomedical paradigm. Biomedicine is part of a Eurocentric conceptual flatland that has a historical and philosophical link to a profound sixteenth century shift in the way the universe was viewed\u2014from organic to 'machine-like'. I have argued that even with the spectacular advances made by biomedicine today, the devaluing of other knowledges, for example, by accepting only positivistic forms of evidence, is a serious threat to IHC. The observation that biomedical physicians continue to adopt piecemeal and/or re-explain CAM modalities in their practices\u2014aspects of what I have called paradigm appropriation and assimilation\u2014with disregard for CAM theoretical paradigms, only confirms the conceptual power of biomedical flatland. The power of biomedicine, however, is not monolithic. In the next chapter I will suggest that certain 'healthy' aspects of IHC appear to co-exist in this flatland, suggesting that both subjugation and resistance exist simultaneously in IHC settings. 221 Chapter 9 HOPE FOR INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE: IDEAL OR MULTIPLE HEALTH CARE PRACTICES? In the previous chapters I have presented a critical view of IHC settings by illustrating that many challenges exist to establishing the perfect 'ideal' of integrative care, as envisaged in conservative biomedical literature. The privatization and commodification of biomedical and CAM services has detrimental effects on patients, CAM practitioners and collaborative patterns of care. Biomedically dominant patterns of professional interaction, through a variety of occupational closure strategies, restrict and delineate CAM practitioners to a specific 'sphere of competence' in the health care division of labour. While CAM practitioners may resist biomedical closure strategies to a certain degree, biomedical dominance is also maintained through its historic relations with the state and capitalism. In recent years, the state has reduced some of medicine's control over other health professionals, but at the same time, has further entrenched the biomedical paradigm as the dominant form of health care delivery. I have argued further that the entrenchment of the biomedical paradigm, both as a historical and on-going process, represents a fundamental challenge to IHC by creating a so-called 'flatland' through the devaluation of non-reductionistic knowledge. Central to its dominance is the process of validating certain forms of 'evidence'. The 'culture-clash' that occurs when physicians encounter non-biomedical knowledge is often solved through paradigm 'appropriation' and 'assimilation'. I have thus portrayed a largely pessimistic view of THC, and without further analysis, it would appear that IHC care models are doomed to failure. 222 Yet, at the same time, it must be acknowledged that there are hopeful movements to overcome inequities within attempts to combine biomedicine and CAM into IHC. There was evidence in the settings of consciousness-raising and an expanded worldview among biomedical and CAM practitioners and institutions, and a new commitment to patient-centred care. The analysis in previous chapters suggests that the 'perfect ideal' of IHC, as it appears in the literature, does not exist. The literature often portrays a system of care where patients are free to choose from any therapy they wish without financial concern; where this process is honored, respected and facilitated by the patient/practitioner bond; where health care professions from diverse healing paradigms mutually understand and respect each other and interact in non-hierarchical ways; where each healing system is valued as having an intrinsic worth of its own; and where health/illness/disease models are expanded to embrace multiple meanings. If the above description of IHC represents an 'equitable' form, then the challenges outlined in the previous chapters represent 'inequitable' forms of IHC. Thus, I am suggesting that many forms of IHC exist, but that they are inequitable in many aspects. The main purpose of the first part of this discussion then is to consider whether or not 'inequitable' forms of IHC could be made 'more' equitable \u2014 in other words, is there any hope for 'decolonizing' IHC? 9.1 Making IHC More Equitable? In addressing the problems of unfunded CAM alongside funded biomedical therapies, one obvious potential solution that could be suggested is the public funding of these modalities, which would thereby address inequities caused by this public/private 223 mix. If such financial support were possible, patients would not be financially restricted in their choice of modalities and could choose 'freely' among biomedicine and CAM. This would also address the problem of an integrative form of care from being fragmented due to the patient's inability to afford certain therapies over others. Further, CAM practitioners currently working in the private sector, if publicly funded, would receive a guaranteed form of salary either through the ability to bill directly for patient fees, or by receiving a negotiated salary from the institution in which they were working. By receiving a guaranteed form of salary, CAM practitioners would therefore be able to attend group rounds and/or meetings, and also to negotiate their other responsibilities if they were still pursuing employment in the private sector, such as teaching or seeing private patients. By attending group rounds, it is possible that CAM practitioners would work to address levels of collaborative care and communication. If CAM modalities were publicly funded and accepted as an integral part of our health care system, it is possible that large-scale biomedical health care institutions would be less inclined to target CAM modalities purely as commodities with disregard for their therapeutic benefit. How to address professional biomedical closure strategies? Potential solutions could lie in challenging biomedicine's complete control over patient charting, referrals and diagnostic tests, and in further regulating CAM practitioners within their specific 'sphere of competence' in the health care division of labour. Assisted by new forms of educational requirements and credentialism, both biomedical and CAM professions could both be allowed to use patient charts, conduct patient referrals amongst each other and perform biomedical diagnostic tests. In this vision, although each profession would have their related therapeutic strengths, neither biomedical nor CAM professionals would 224 necessarily be rigidly restricted to a specific sphere of competence or province of practice. In this case, both biomedical and CAM professions could adopt techniques from each other, such as ordering tests, prescribing Western pharmaceuticals and conducting biomedical or CAM diagnoses. Overall, the primary language of communication might move from the uni-lingual or biomedical language, to the multi- lingual languages of CAM and biomedicine. There are several significant reasons why these solutions are unlikely to occur. As noted above, calls for funding of CAM therapies in our publicly-funded biomedical health care system would fly in the face of current austerity. Expenses for publicly- funded biomedical health care services are increasing at an exponential rate and as already discussed, biomedical services are being de-listed for the private sector, thus leaving very little funds for additional biomedical services. This is not a good scenario for finding funds for any non-biomedical or CAM therapy or service. 'Scientific' evidence for CAM therapies has not been amassed, and in combination with the historic and contemporary scientific/biomedical bias against CAM therapies, this would almost certainly preclude large-scale funding of CAM therapies in a publicly-funded biomedical health care system. For decades, it has been an advantage for government and biomedical health care institutions to maintain CAM therapies in the private sector, as this prevents them from demanding public funds. In addition, as I have suggested, they may even provide revenue streams for biomedical institutions such as hospitals. Dominant biomedical closure strategies in IHC settings are also unlikely to change dramatically, as it is these very strategies that partially maintain biomedicine's control over the health care division of labour. It is hard to imagine that biomedicine 225 would relinquish its dominance of patient charting, referrals and biomedical tests and diagnoses, that simultaneously define and protect both the physician as 'medical doctor' and the institution of medicine as a whole. CAM practitioners are purposely relegated by medicine to a different sphere of competence. Furthermore, it is in the primary interest of biomedicine to continue to appropriate/assimilate CAM modalities and to maintain biomedical language as the primary mode of communication with patients, in order to protect access to them and its control over the health care division of labour. It is also difficult to imagine that the 'public' and the state would be able to stage a 'coup' without the approval of biomedicine and the corporations associated with it. State austerity and biomedically-dominant closure strategies in IHC settings ensure that recent calls for a 'expansion' of medicine into a 'new' health care paradigm is unlikely to occur. Perhaps at the heart of biomedical conceptions of IHC is that biomedicine will somehow undergo a radical Kuhnian 'paradigm shift', thereby surpassing biomedicine's own limitations connected to its foundation on the Newtonian- Cartesian worldview. In this vision, biomedicine as an institution would become 'integrative medicine or health care', by expanding traditional biomedical illness/disease models, employing multiple numbers of non-biomedical therapies, and expanding notions of healing on multiple levels. Medical schools and their curricula would be radically re- configured globally to train new 'integrated doctors'. CAM practitioners would no longer exist, replaced by 'integrative physicians'. Can biomedicine undergo such a radical transformation to 'true' 'integrative medicine or health care'? Here the fundamental problem is obvious: biomedicine is non- integrative without appropriation. That is, it is based on a Newtonian-Cartesian 226 worldview. According to its own discourses, biomedical successes have been achieved primarily because of biomedicine's reductionistic nature. In essence, biomedicine is 'good' at what it does. When its practitioners attempt to go outside of the reductionist paradigm, such as in the case of chronic illness (that primarily responds to non- biomedical treatments), it falls short. Thus, despite the technical adoption of CAM by biomedical practitioners, due to 'biomedical flatland', biomedicine is at a loss to fully integrate subjugated therapies within their respective non-biomedical paradigms. This leads to the conclusion that within current power relations, biomedical schools will remain largely unchanged (with the exception, perhaps, of an increase in the number of CAM descriptive courses); that 'true' 'integrative physicians' will remain a minority and never fully transform their biomedical world view; and that CAM practitioners will continue to exist and flourish as supported by public demand. Where, then, does this leave the possibility of integrative health care? Will IHC exist only as an ideal? 9.2. Valuing Multiple Knowledges I have hinted that 'solutions' could be imagined to establish equitable IHC settings. Yet, the obvious solutions discussed so far remain unrealistic and seem unlikely to occur. JHC settings that I studied, while they may be called 'integrative', are, in fact, inequitable. They are inequitable because, for example, patients are unable to continue treatment plans to completion; CAM practitioners remain marginalized; and CAM modalities are exploited for purely a profit motive. Admittedly, CAM practitioners in THC settings also compete with biomedicine, albeit not on a level playing field. 227 It is this current 'form of care', however, that I would like to focus upon in the second half of this chapter. As I have stated earlier, some hopeful signs appear in IHC settings, for despite inequitable forms of IHC, there is evidence of non-hierarchical integration in everyday IHC interactions. Rather than being realist pragmatic 'solutions', these provide hope that IHC, as a 'more positive' or progressive form of health care, is possible. Following more closely Kincheloe and McLaren's concept of a 'modified' emancipation (1994, p. 146), my argument here is that one aspect of IHC that could be considered as most reflective of its many promises occurs when IHC practitioners and/or institutions value and validate multiple concepts of, and paths to, health, illness and healing. While not all biomedical practitioners transform in this way, I nevertheless observed such movement in each of the three sites in this study. The very existence of valuing multiple ways of knowing indicates hope for IHC. Hope in fact permeated the sites, where biomedicine and CAM had gone beyond collaborating and integrating just on the surface. For example, each had partially developed a) an 'integrative' philosophy or set of discourses defined by an expanded concept of health and illness that recognized aspects of biomedical and CAM paradigms; b) a person-centered 'empowering' approach to health care; c) the offering of a multiplicity of health care modalities (biomedical and CAM) and attempts to blend them into a continuum of care; and d) aspects of inter- and/or transdisciplinary practice, through working at the mutual valuing of biomedicine and CAM worldviews, and by practitioners learning therapeutic techniques from other disciplines. In keeping with my previous argument, I am not suggesting that physicians were necessarily practicing pure integrative medicine or health care, but that they were 228 sometimes able to surpass 'biomedical flatland' to embrace a worldview that values multiple standpoints. This is in keeping with arguments that it is possible to understand standpoints other than our own (Maunheim, 1936; Stoetzler & Yuval-Davis, 2002). 9.2.1 Developing an Integrative Philosophy Philosophies recognizing very different concepts of health and wellness were found throughout the three sites. For example, at the institutional/organizational level of the CIH, participants repeated many times that illness is viewed as involving self, mind and body, a key aspect of the 'holistic paradigm' in which CAM is generally located. The CIH mission recognizes that how one feels is a crucially important element in the healing process. In expanding the traditional biomedical model, as noted, CIH documents describe biomedicine as just 'one spoke in the wheel' of an integrated approach to healing. Conventional biomedical therapies are only one spoke in a group of 13 others that includes: the will to live; spiritual and emotional connection with others; healthful diet and water; exercise; and adequate sleep and relaxation. This metaphor suggests 'different but equal'. Even though the CIH mission does not directly address issues of subjugated knowledges, all spokes are described as interrelated and contributing to the overall healing of the patient, in that the sum total of these spokes is greater than the sum of individual therapies. Further, CIH texts picture healing as a journey that is unique to each individual, so that what is of great benefit to one person may not necessarily be of benefit to another. This suggests that, at least theoretically, the emphasis is put on the local construction of knowledge. At the practitioner level, physicians at the CIH were unanimous in rejecting 229 biomedical treatment towards cancer as curative. In addition, they critiqued it as not supporting the immune system. In contrast, physicians viewed complementary and alternative medicine as supporting the immune system and the patient's quality of life; reducing stress, improving nutrition and overall, improving the individual's chances for remission. As one physician commented: I believe that a broader perspective that takes into account mind, body and spirit and all the factors that contribute to the development of an illness and all the factors that can contribute to the treatment of an illness, are very valuable. I believe that the cure for cancer, if we can think of it in those terms, is a multi-tiered approach. I think that biomedicine has been in stasis for the last 60 or 70 years. The idea of finding a silver bullet cure for cancer, | think, is a misplaced illusion based on the biomedical model. I think that the cure for cancer has many factors in its development. So there will be many factors involved with its treatment. Physicians at the CIH also focussed on the integration of body, mind and spirit in the healing process. For instance, one doctor indicated that she spent considerable time talking to her patients about the nature of 'spirit'. She indicated that she took a spiritual history and inquired about what practices patients were undertaking, in addition to asking about what inspired patients about spirituality in particular. As part of what she calls taking a 'spiritual history', she also indicated that she asked what the patients had done over the course of their lives to help them feel 'spiritual'. She said she also tried to connect with what had inspired them. Complementary or associate practitioners at the CIH, of course, viewed health and healing well outside of the biomedical paradigm. For example, comparing complementary/alternative and biomedicine and reflecting on her own complementary modality, one practitioner commented: Well, my feeling is that no single medical system has all the answers for all the diseases, and Western medicine has some very powerful 230 medications and has some very accurate testing, and has a real broad support service for people who develop diseases like cancer. However, there are areas that Western medicine doesn't cope with well, and long- term chronic diseases and very strange diseases that don't fall into a particular category, and strange diseases, things that develop out of the blue. And I think that that's where complementary practices can fill in the blanks a little bit. And so Western medicine is a very powerful anti-cancer medicine, but they don't have very powerful therapies to protect the body during that phase, for instance. The side effects can sometimes be devastating, and it's difficult, I feel, for Western medicine to differentiate between different layers of the body. In my own practice, we have different layers of the body, so it's not very \"scientific\", but it's a theoretical model that's more like body function as viewed from the outside of the body rather than viewed at the cellular level. So my practice sort of looks like a complete picture of the body as opposed to just attacking cancer cells. Another associate practitioner rejected the curative model and emphasized: What I'm trying to do here is just to improve their quality of life, and my goal is not to eliminate the cancer or anything like that; it's just helping them cope with everyday living. A third associate practitioner agreed: I support the whole body rather than just looking at the one problem. So this involves body/mind communication, and hopefully we're encouraging the body to do what it naturally does, or remember how to do what it naturally does. Summarizing this 'multiple knowledges' concept of health and wellness at the CIH, one physician explained: We want to take patients deeper rather than simply focussing on the body and focussing on a physical magical bullet or magic pill. We want to take them down so that they understand the effect of the mind and the body, and they learn a lot about that in the introductory programme, so they're starting out with some knowledge even before they may not have been aware of it before. The strength of Western medicine is to target the tumour. The strength of complementary medicine is to improve quality of life, support the immune system, and perhaps improve the individual chances for remission, doing well, improving the quality of life, improving their outcome. 231 Comparatively, at the WPMC, philosophical ideals relating to an expanded concept of health and wellness were apparent, but less so than at the CIH, consistent with a much more established biomedical orientation in their hospital-based institutional/organizational structure. Nevertheless, an expanded concept of health and wellness at the WPMC was immediately apparent at the organizational level, indicated by the multiplicity of health care services and modalities that the WPMC offered, such as acupuncture, physiotherapy, hypnosis, biofeedback, and psychiatric counselling, in addition to the use of pain medications. At the practitioner level, WPMC practitioners clearly recognized the multi- dimensional nature of health and healing, and that the treatment of pain is a complex phenomenon requiring multiple techniques and modalities. For example, one biomedical practitioner commented: There are different kinds of pain but it's quite clear in the kind of pain which we are talking about, which is chronic pain, that it's not simple; that you have sort of many aspects of it and there's no one simple solution; there's no one simple cause of it, and that you need to probably key into it by different techniques and different modalities. Another biomedical practitioner suggested: We have to think differently about pain\u2014to distract ourselves, to use psychological approaches, to use other forms, whatever [they are]. Medication for certain people is definitely a viable option. They need to be on some form of pain medication to improve function. Maybe eventually they want to come off the medication. I think the whole goal of it is quality of life and to improve someone's function, return them to work if you can, and so everything should complement that. And so, if someone can take a drug and it helps them to achieve that goal, that's really what it's about. If acupuncture can do that, that's what it's about, you know. But really it has to be multi-modal. For the proposed Sunnybrook and Women's traditional Chinese medicine initiative, philosophical ideals relating to multiple concepts of health were primarily 232 reflected at the institutional level, as practitioners were not yet practicing at the site. For example, part of the Sunnybrook and Women's mandate reflects an ongoing interest in complementary and alternative medicine, many forms of which support concepts of health and healing that are multiple and not necessarily overlapping. This focus on CAM was stated in the strategic plan of the Sunnybrook and Women's Ambulatory Care Centre. Furthermore, the focus on women's health at Sunnybrook and Women's, and the existence of a pelvic pain centre; an environmental health clinic; and a practicing naturopath, all point to a move away from a narrow biomedical concept of health and illness. In addition, in a separate internal review of stakeholders' views towards complementary and alternative medicines, key respondents indicated that an attempt to combine CAM and conventional medical care was entirely consistent with their organizational values (Vohra et al., 2003). Further, the intent of Sunnybrook and Women's Hospital to incorporate traditional Chinese medicine, by definition, expands the concept of health and well-being on multiple dimensions. The challenge will be to respect the TCM paradigm. 9.2.2 Patient-Centred and Multi-Modal Care The philosophical ideal of a person-centred 'empowering approach to health care' within which the patient becomes involved in choosing, under the guidance of practitioners, various health care modalities, was also promoted at the three sites. For example, at the institutional/organizational level of the CIH, patients are encouraged to 'reclaim their own inner wisdom'. They are urged to take control over their own healing recovery plan with some professional guidance. As stated in Chapter Five, the CIH 233 replaced the conventional biomedical tumour-based model of cancer to create a new person-based model. Although still individually-based, rather than focussing, for example, on social determinants of health, this model involves attempting to support and honour personal patient empowerment in a three-way patient/doctor/associate practitioner relationship. For example, reflecting on her commitment to patient choice in health care, one associate practitioner at CIH commented: What I believe is that there are different modalities and it is for [all] individual[s] to choose what he or she feels what they are most drawn to, but I think that it must be an individual choice. Of course, as shown in Chapter Six, social class limits this 'choice'. However, the existence of the commitment provides an opportunity for awareness of how far short this neo-liberal concept falls. In addition, in the everyday life of the clinic, practitioners struggle to 'live out' these ideals. For example, at the WPMC, one practitioner explained how she validated the patient's illness experience: In the first interview I do explain to patient[s] that we're not here to judge them. We're not here to ask them to prove their pain. It is what they come here and tell us about their pain and they teach us, and that's where we get our information about how it affects them. Because pain is so subjective. There are very few ways that we can actually measure it. I accept that pain is very real, and that although it's interpreted in your head and in your brain, it doesn't mean that the pain is all in your head. You never believe that. It's interpreted there, but the pain is very real. I think that patients want to be understood. Their pain is to be validated, and it's not just a yes/no diagnosis; it takes time to develop that trust and relationship with the patient. Multi-modal care, in the parlance of IHC, refers to the multidisciplinary nature of the IHC setting, such as the multiplicity of health care modalities and approaches; it also refers to a collaborative 'blending' of these approaches into a continuum of care. In this regard, each JHC site had, or endeavoured to have, a diverse range of therapeutic 234 modalities. For example, at the time of research, as noted, the CIH had five biomedical practitioners and eight complementary practitioners; the WPMC had 10 biomedical practitioners, nine paramedical practitioners (including two registered nurses, three physiotherapists, and four dentists), and three traditional Chinese medicine practitioners; and the Sunnybrook and Women's proposed TCM initiative intended to have five traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and several biomedical practitioners, with the possibility of other CAM practitioners on the team. All were identified as being part of the institutional structure, setting the stage for awareness of each other's paradigms. If made aware of power relations identified in this research, commitment to learning each others' approaches to health might be renewed. 9.2.3 Creating Inter-/Transdisciplinary Practice on the Clinic Floor The establishment of an inter- and/or transdisciplinary practice among health care practitioners, however, must involve moving beyond mere discourses of multidisciplinarity where multiple techniques are used without professional interaction or collaboration. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches are different. For example, reflecting on these differences, one physician explained: You need to have both a interdisciplinary approach, which means different disciplines, different training to look at it, a multi-modality approach meaning that you may have to use different techniques on it, and you also have to have what I call a transdisciplinary approach, meaning that even though you trained in one discipline, you have to go beyond the discipline and actually apply or certainly have knowledge of other disciplines. Despite problems of paradigm clash discussed above, communication did occur in such a way at the CIH that did enable the practical (i.e., clinical) understanding of many CAM practices and practitioners by biomedical doctors and other associate practitioners. These 235 forms of 'cross-cultural'? communication included shared meditation and Tai Qi/Qi Gong classes; and 'experiential' treatments gifted by one practitioner to another. Concerning transdisciplinarity, within the broad field of biomedicine, one physician explained how, as his patient practice expanded, he was required to learn other biomedical knowledge and techniques outside of his home discipline. As he explained: Certainly in facial pain, I have to know more than the average neurologist about facial pain. I'm not a dentist, but I have to know the science of dentistry and the facial muscle. So I really have to learn about how to examine the mouth and how to examine the jaw. I was forced to. When I developed an interest in pelvic pain, I'm not a gynaecologist, but I had to learn far more about the pelvis than I really thought I would have to learn, because I couldn't get a gynaecologist who understood about pain. And similarly, I could not find a gynaecologist to learn more about pain. It is a very short step from intrabiomedical curiosity to learning more about CAM already practiced in the setting. As has been described in the previous chapter, biomedical practitioners (perhaps unconsciously but still inequitably) have been apprenticing in and learning certain CAM modalities, and to a much lesser extent, certain CAM practitioners have been learning biomedical terminology and diagnostic techniques. The potential is always present in the everyday clinic, as practitioners from different health care professions collaborate with each other, that a transdisciplinary style of practice can occur. A CSSP would caution vigilance, but a perspective emphasizing agency would predict that as practitioners learn skills from other disciplines, a multi- disciplinary practice based on mutual respect is being created. When I asked one CIH physician how he had learned the CAM knowledge and modalities he was practicing, he explained: Well, as you guessed, I didn't learn it in medical school. I think in medical school I don't even remember the subject of nutrition coming up; and it's my belief that nutrition can play a really foundational role in 236 recovery and [be] valuable for really any illness and particularly for the treatment of cancer. So my understanding of complementary nutrition has come from my own reading and my own personal exploration around that. In books that I've read and from working with Dr. R. who has a 40-year experience with complementary nutrition, routinely we prescribe eight to 10 vitamins and supplements for most patients who come to see us, and they would be most of the vitamins and supplements that most people would be familiar with, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, betacarotene, those kinds of supplements. Thus just as Sch\u00e9n (1983) suggests, emancipatory practice might yield transformation. Another physician described the process of learning medical acupuncture from an association that trains biomedical and paramedical practitioners, in addition to learning other CAM modalities, before establishing her current practice. She stated: I looked into acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine and took some training in that; and then I even did a China trip as part of their programme. I did their whole programme, and after I did their programme I started to return into medicine but not to general practice. I just had a small private practice in acupuncture pain management. I became interested in mind/body medicine and hypnosis, and did a bit of training in that too. So I had a combination of a small private practice in acupuncture, medical counselling, hypnosis, plus sessional work in a chronic pain programme where I worked alongside psychologists. A third physician explained how she began to learn complementary modalities. She stated: A lot of patients [who] came to me were referred from naturopaths and from alternative practitioners, so I just learned from my patients, and I was sort of looking at it on my own already at that time. This physician went on to emphasize her increasing immersion in non-biomedical conceptions of health: I've always integrated [modalities and] so I have some training in clinical hypnosis and counselling. I consult in vitamins and supplements and diet, and my biggest emphasis ends up being mind/body symptoms using sort of tenets from different philosophies such as Taoism and Buddhism. 237 In conducting interviews with physicians at the CIH, I became particularly interested in their ability to philosophize, endorse, and work within multiple healing traditions, sometimes marrying opposing ideas and paradigms marked by reductionism versus non-reductionism. In spite of the 'two solitudes' at the WPMC, here was a demonstration that mutual respect between paradigms was possible. For example, one physician indicated her concept of what I have called the 'multi-dimensional body'. In the multi-dimensional body, biomedicine provides one dimension by examining physiology. If one adds traditional Chinese medicine followed by homeopathy, the representation of the human body takes on multiple views or dimensions, in this case, a three-dimensional body. The dimensions become more complex based on the number of different paradigms that are drawn upon. This physician stated: From the Western point of view, we're very good at looking at the physiology and at dissecting things, so I think of that as a one-dimensional view of the human body. If you add Chinese medicine, they look at the body in a completely different way, as does homeopathy, and they look at healing, they look at everything. So my thought on it is that when you add this to this to this, it's all of a sudden you're looking at the body and a human being from three different angles, and all of a sudden you get a more complete view of what's going on. When I inquired about how this particular physician worked within different and sometimes opposing healing paradigms, she indicated that one is required to have a certain willingness not to view health and healing in only one way. In essence, one is 'required to have what she called a 'flexibility of mind' in order to be able to work with opposing ideas. Reflecting on this philosophy, the physician explained: Well, I think that what you need to have is curiosity and compassion. If you think the world is a certain way, you miss half the world or maybe more. The problem is that to be able to incorporate so many different paradigms and so many different approaches, it requires a certain willingness to view life as complex, that the world is not a cause and 238 effect world that we live in. And so the way that I incorporate all these things is recognizing that some things work better in some situations than in others. I think it requires a certain flexibility of mind to be able to hold a whole lot of opposing ideas in one place and let them be. Thus, physicians at the CIH were establishing clear patterns of a transdisciplinary practice by working with, both philosophically and pragmatically, multiple healing traditions and paradigms well outside of the biomedical paradigm in which they were trained. At the WPMC, while physicians were not establishing transdisciplinary practices per se by practicing CAM, a minority of physicians were trying to establish transdisciplinary practices within the scope of biomedicine, such as described earlier. WPMC physicians, however, largely remained within their traditional scope of practice as compared to CIH physicians. Certain paramedical practitioners at the WPMC were also indicating signs of developing transdisciplinarity. For example, one physiotherapist was training in and practicing medical acupuncture. Curiously, however, this practitioner did not fully understand TCM theory. This is consistent with my previous argument that suggests that the understanding of CAM paradigms does not accompany the mere technical adoption of CAM skill sets. The understanding and appreciation of CAM theoretical paradigms by CIH physicians could be viewed as a rare but hopeful occurrence of 'equitable' IHC. On the whole, then, an interdisciplinary rather than transdisciplinary style of practice was much more evident at the WPMC. Perhaps the separation of the CIH from biomedical teaching hospitals is a crucial aspect of this difference. For the proposed traditional Chinese medicine initiative of Sunnybrook and Women's Hospitals, an internal stakeholder review of practitioners throughout the two 239 hospitals' institutional structures indicated that several biomedical doctors routinely recommended natural health products such as glucosamine sulphate, St. John's Wort, and aromatherapy (Vohra, 2003). Several physicians also indicated that they practiced acupuncture, a macrobiotic diet, and Qi Gong with their patients. Further, other health professional practitioners indicated experience with CAM therapies and also reported practicing them to varying degrees within the hospital setting. These CAM practices included botanical medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and hydrotherapy. Thus even at the centre of biomedicine in Canada, non-biomedical ways of thinking about health are available. Perhaps the multiplicity of CAM clinics in the community will eventually crack through biomedicine, fuelled by the growing multiculturalism of Toronto and Vancouver and the health care practitioners practicing in those cities. Among biomedical and paramedical practitioners, respondents in the Sunnybrook and Women's stakeholder survey identified a wide variety of members in their multidisciplinary teams including dieticians, pharmacists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychotherapists and athletic therapists. Outside of biomedicine, the stakeholder survey and the current research indicated that, similar to Shuval et al.'s study (2002), CAM practitioners were practicing as solo practitioners throughout hospital structures. These practitioners included one osteopath, one naturopath, several massage therapists, and one traditional Korean practitioner. Thus, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary practices were found to be present throughout Sunnybrook and Women's institutional structure. At the time of writing, it was unknown how these skills would be established and transferred to the new 240 IHC setting, though the potential for mutual respect and practice at the level of other clinics was certainly present. 9.3. Summary While the fundamental challenges to integrative health care have been emphasized in previous chapters, here I have foregrounded how IHC settings in this study were able to expand their discourses and practices of health and illness to recognize biomedical and CAM paradigms; offer a wide breadth of biomedical and CAM modalities; and create, to a limited degree, multi- and transdisciplinary practice. As noted in the introduction to this chapter, in IHC settings, both appropriation and resistance are present at the same time. These contrasting practices suggest that tensions co-exist in IHC settings, and that different forms of IHC occur simultaneously. Here I suggest that the ideals of integrative health care are being nurtured in IHC settings, although there is a long way to go for CAM healing systems to be equally valued on their own terms, and each recognized for its inherent strengths. Western medicine is currently struggling to treat the chronic diseases that non-biomedical paradigms are already able to treat and address. Recognizing the importance of multiple knowledges does not necessitate the blending or merging of paradigms into each other. That, in many cases, is ontologically impossible, and also poses a threat of creating and/or maintaining exploitive relations and inequities amongst different healing systems. One major concern is that this viewpoint is not widely accepted and/or recognized by proponents of integrative health care. My research reveals how biomedicine continues to marginalize and colonize CAM modalities in various ways. As I have argued earlier, such practices are supported by atheoretical and naive models of integrative health care 241 that continue to be developed by scholars unsympathetic and/or ignorant of other knowledges than Eurocentric. I suggest that while these challenges may seem at present insurmountable, it is possible that more equitable forms of health care could be developed in the future. As Capra advocates: The achievements of modern medical science will by no means be abandoned, but in the future holistic approach biomedical techniques will play a much more restricted role. They will be used to deal with the physical and biological aspects of illness, especially in emergencies, but always very judiciously and in conjunction with psychological counselling, stress-reduction techniques, and other methods of holistic patient care. The transition to the new system will have to be made slowly and carefully because of the tremendous symbolic power of biomedical therapy in our culture. The reductionist approach to illness, with its strong emphasis on drugs and surgery, will be supplemented and eventually replaced by the new holistic therapies in a gradual process, as our collective views of health and illness change and evolve (1982, p. 349). 242 Chapter 10 DISCUSSION AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO RESEARCH: THE FUTURE OF THC? This discussion and closing chapter of the thesis will consider two important aspects of my research: the substantive and theoretical contributions that I suggest this research brings to the analysis of IHC; and various possibilities for the future course of THC in light of the above research findings and ongoing developments in North American health care systems. I suggest that the significant contributions this research brings to the study of IHC are the following. As noted early on in the Introduction, few sociological studies to date have analyzed IHC settings from a sociological and critically-informed point of view. This study has begun to address this gap by describing IHC settings ethnographically, and detailing the ways in which biomedical and CAM practitioners interact on the clinic floor. By drawing on various examples, I have further illuminated how patients fare in these new settings; and whether or not biomedicine maintains dominance, and if so, how. For example, as already noted, the combination of unfunded CAM therapies in IHC settings with subsidized biomedicine regularly prevents patients from establishing and completing an IHC care plan involving CAM. CAM practitioners, who cannot compete with publicly-financed biomedical physicians, either as an aspect of patient flow or financial income, are marginalized. Biomedical and paramedical practitioners in IHC settings also consistently enact various types of demarcationary and exclusionary occupational closure strategies. In the health care division of labour, these strategies ensure that biomedical and other health professional practitioners dominate in relation to the CAM professions. The biomedical and paramedical professions have even created 243 new types of occupational closure strategies (the use of esoteric knowledge, and the technical adoption of CAM skill sets), thus illustrating the tendency to maintain professional dominance in new and changing IHC settings. Even though the CAM professions are resisting to some degree, biomedical occupational competition in IHC settings represents a type of non-integrative 'regulated model' that maintains the dichotomy between biomedicine and CAM (Leckridge, 2004, p. 415). As discussed above, ideological and ethnocentric challenges to IHC also exist. In spite of the minority of physicians who appear to 'expand their worldview', various processes work against equitable IHC. These include the biomedical devaluation of CAM knowledges; an exclusive reliance on positivistic types of evidence; and an inherent inability to let go ofa Eurocentric worldview in the IHC encounter. Thus practitioners of biomedicine are disadvantaged in their attempts to partner with IHC, at least at the institutional level. Although I have argued that 'hope' exists for a 'more equitable' form of IHC (as discussed in the last chapter), I suggest that one significant contribution from this study is the realization that, despite claims to the contrary, IHC settings with biomedicine to date are fundamentally non-integrative. IHC sites in this study still provide a form of care that may be of benefit to their patients, but these sites simply do not reflect current 'ideal' models of IHC that proliferate throughout the CAM and biomedical literature. It will be important for IHC theorists to take note of these critical findings. While some of the above findings are illustrated through modified neo-Marxist and neo-Weberian theoretical frameworks, as noted, the findings relating to ethnocentric ideological challenges to IHC are best seen using an anti-colonial framework. As I have suggested earlier, an anti-colonial perspective has rarely if ever been applied to the 244 sociological study of the CAM and biomedical professions together, as a part of the study of the health professions. This, I argue, is also a significant contribution to the study of CAM, biomedicine, and IHC. By drawing on an anti-colonial perspective, I suggest that the fundamental challenges to IHC become clear. The inherent reasons biomedicine devalues CAM knowledge; focusses exclusively on positivistic evidence; cannot holistically and is only interested in CAM's 'technical value', among other examples, can be traced directly to Western science and medicine's role in European colonial exploits in the 'new' world. As Shiva argues: The rise of reductionist science was linked with the commercialization of science, and resulted in the domination of women and non-Western peoples. Their diverse knowledge systems were not treated as legitimate ways of knowing. With commercialization as the objective, reductionism became the criterion of scientific validity. Nonreductionist and ecological ways of knowing, and nonreductionist and ecological systems of knowledge, were pushed out and marginalized (1997, p. 24). An anti-colonial perspective is essential and equally important to an understanding of IHC, as CAM represents the 'other' multiple and marginalized sciences, containing some surviving and flourishing colonized indigenous traditional knowledges (e.g., TCM) (Harding, 1998). An anti-colonial perspective is important to IHC as it begins from the 'standpoint' of the marginalized CAM professions, and thus illuminates the 'ruling apparatus' (as Dorothy Smith calls it) of biomedicine. This ruling apparatus includes the philosophy, ideology, professions, institutions and textual discourses of biomedicine that attempt to place CAM into dominant and ruling laws and conceptual practices (Smith, 1987, p. 108). This conceptual turn, beginning with the marginalized rather than dominant voices, as Harding emphasizes, broadens awareness of multiple possible knowledges each with unique (but not necessarily equal) value and legitimacy. 245 The possibility for inequitable relations to become 'more equitable' can be imagined. Marginalized CAM knowledges may be rightfully viewed as particular sciences of their own that do not need to be altered or 'proven' to foreign groups using foreign standards (Harding, 1998), each with unique histories, strengths and weaknesses, and which must now be treated with as much respect and dignity as have been dominant knowledges. As Shiva states: I see science as a pluralistic enterprise that refers to different \"ways of knowing\". For me, it is not restricted to modern Western science, but includes the knowledge systems of diverse cultures in different periods of history (1997, p. 8). The main purpose of the latter part of this concluding discussion is to consider the 'future' of integrative health care, by reviewing current developments relating to the field, and what is added by this research to the understanding of the possibilities for IHC. One of the main issues to consider is what 'type' of IHC is currently favoured and which type, if any, is likely to become 'more' common or indeed dominant. There appears to be an exponential increase in attempts to create IHC settings. But, as I have already summarized and discussed in earlier sections, the 'pure' type of THC, as envisioned in the normative literature, does not exist in the 'real life' clinic. I have argued that in order for equitable relations to exist between CAM and biomedicine, there would have to be an expansion of biomedical illness/disease models; support for the patient/practitioner relationship; provision of a wide-breadth of biomedical and CAM therapies; creation of inter- and trans-disciplinary practice and seamless clinical care, including establishing trust and respect amongst diverse biomedical and CAM health care providers; and an expansion of the biomedical concept of outcomes to include different notions of 'healing'. As my research findings have illustrated, most aspects of the 'pure' 246 type of IHC did not occur, while there were some hopeful signs (e.g., an expanded worldview for some biomedical practitioners). Significant structural, interprofessional, philosophical and ideological practices appear to be solid barriers against establishing the 'pure' model of IHC. As I have argued earlier, one conclusion that could be drawn from my research is that these power relations will prevent the realization of pure IHC. Put differently, Coulter asks: The question therefore is more rightly whether two quite distinct paradigms, biomedicine and CAM, having quite distinct philosophical foundations, distinct a priori assumptions and distinct metaphysical beliefs, can be unified within a single paradigm without doing great violence to at least one of the paradigms or totally transforming the other (2004, p. 110). If IHC as advocated by systems theorists is an attractive but unattainable ideal, then what type or types of IHC are currently the norm? Baer, for example, has extensively discussed and demonstrated (1989, 2001, 2004) how biomedicine has consistently and historically co-opted CAM. Through the process of paradigm appropriation (also called technical adoption), the majority of institutions providing integrative health care, such as free-standing clinics, hospitals and even some academic medical schools, consist of biomedical physicians adopting piecemeal from CAM practices (although a minority of physicians do undertake full training). As Baer states: While some holistic M.D.s and D.O.s [doctors of osteopathy] subscribe to the philosophical underpinnings of various CAM therapies, others adopt their techniques without wholeheartedly subscribing to the ideology of the holistic health movement.... Biomedicine historically has often incorporated alternative therapies rather than losing patients en masse to heterodox practitioners... Biomedical calls for complementary and alternative therapies or integrative medicine may in reality serve the purpose of preserving the hegemony of medicine by co-opting the most attractive components of holism.... Cross- cultural research has repeatedly indicated that the integration of biomedical and alternative medical systems tends to preserve rather than eradicate biomedical hegemony.... Despite the best efforts on the part of proponents of holistic health to develop an alternative to biomedicine, what in reality has occurred has been in 247 large part the co-optation of alternative medicine under the rubrics of CAM and integrative medicine or integrative health care (2004, pp. 114, 149). The dominant form of IHC, as noted by this research and by other IHC initiatives in North America, in short, appears to be one dominated by biomedicine. Even the leading 'gurus' of integrative health care, as noted by Baer (2004) and others, are biomedical physicians (e.g., Deepak Chopra and Andrew Weil). For example, Andrew Weil, Director of the Program in Integrative Medicine of the College of Medicine, University of Arizona, where biomedical physicians train to become 'integrative' physicians practicing CAM modalities, admits that while his program has no overt intent to 'take over' CAM, the exclusion of CAM practitioners in this process is an undesirable 'side-effect' (personal communication, 2005). The majority of conferences focussed on IHC invite keynote speakers with exclusively biomedical credentials. Academic journals devoted to integrative health care also have editorial committees consisting almost entirely of biomedical doctors. The CAM professions that are invited to participate in academic IHC conferences or journals (e.g., naturopaths, osteopaths and chiropractors) usually have the highest level of professionalization, in addition to including a large proportion of biomedical sciences in their practice. This development among the CAM professions has been called the 'scientization' of professions (Sch\u00e9n, 1983). Other types of CAM practitioners whose practices are not so easy to appropriate into biomedicine such as herbalists, homeopathic doctors, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, Ayurvedic practitioners, spiritual healers and Reiki and therapeutic-touch masters are a tiny minority in biomedical academic contexts, or not included at all. In biomedically- _ controlled IHC, as noted in Chapter Eight, biomedical evidence reigns supreme in the IHC enterprise (Harding, 1998; Shiva, 1997). 248 As noted earlier, in the United States, the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA), and in Canada the Canadian Complementary Medical Association (CCMA) were created as professional societies to train and protect biomedical physicians who have the main goal of practicing, or are currently practicing, complementary medicine. These professional associations are also annually increasing their clientele of \"green MDs' (again, not necessarily 'true' integrative physicians) and are known for hosting biomedical-IHC conferences. Paradigm assimilation also continues in biomedical-IHC journals and conferences. CAM therapies that can be 'proven' and understood using EBM's randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are included as 'acceptable' integrative health care modalities (such as the majority of physically-based CAM practices, e.g., administration of herbs). As Willis and White argue: In other words, it appears that it is hoped by some that EBM will provide a stick with which to beat CAM, thus providing a new tool for orthodoxy in the ongoing historical struggle to undermine and marginalise CAM at one level while, at another, selectively co-opting and incorporating aspects of CAM treatment into orthodox practice (2004, p. 53). At the same time, other types of CAM practices, such as spiritual or energetic therapies (e.g., prayer and homeopathy) are either not included as legitimate healing practices, or are discarded entirely. These knowledges can be viewed as subjugated knowledges from an anti-colonial theoretical perspective. | As noted in Chapter Six, biomedical institutions, such as hospitals, are vulnerable | to pressures to commodify CAM for capitalist profit. Baer currently observes that in the United States over half of American health maintenance organizations (HMOs) offer at least one type of CAM, primarily due to market demand (2004, p. 146). Likewise, similar to their Canadian counterparts, an increasing number of American hospitals have 249 begun to incorporate CAM to increase their profit (Baer, 2004, p. 146). The commodification of CAM by biomedical institutions, versus the funding of these therapies as legitimate healing practices, ultimately supports the dominance of biomedicine, and is an integral aspect of biomedical-integrative health care. Willis and White note that \"in an era of withdrawal of state funding which has impacted particularly upon biomedical research, governments have been reluctant to fund such research on CAM\" (2004, p. 56). As Easthope (2003, p. 2) further argues, the development of IHC is also a reflection of \"global corporate interests\" that have \"pushed\" biomedicine (for better and worse) to capitalize on CAM as an aspect of \"global corporate capital's move into [integrative] health care\". Based on my research findings, and analysis of recent trends in integrative health care in both Canada and the United States, one prediction for the future is that IHC will primarily be created and controlled by and for all aspects of biomedicine\u2014from the practitioner to academic centre to large-scale institution\u2014while the ideal models of biomedical-CAM IHC will remain as discourses or ideologies. There is a normative assumption in biomedical communities that CAM, again, will simply be 'absorbed' into biomedicine. Easthope (2003, p. 3) concludes that \"the most unlikely is a [true] merging of the two traditions\". As Leckridge (2004, p. 415) further suggests, this \"THC future\" can be called \"the assimilated model\" where \"CAM products and services are increasingly used by biomedical practitioners\" who \"expand their skills by learning to provide some CAM services\". Other theorists agree, stating: \"Orthodox medicine will take over those CAM treatments that are found to be effective according to EBM methodology and then will argue that only those with medical training should administer 250 them\" (Willis & White, 2004, p. 238). Yet, this IHC future ultimately marginalizes the CAM professions and is, therefore, fundamentally non-integrative. Kaptchuk and Miller conclude: There is no common medical language for diagnosing conditions and prescribing treatment that integrates mainstream medicine and the different forms of CAM as equal partners. ... The integration model promises that patients are offered the best of both medical worlds; but it seems more likely that patients are being denied the \"integrity\" of either world (2005, p. 289). A second future for integrative health care can also be constructed. This second view involves the consciousness that there could be many types and forms of integrative health care. As noted in Chapter Eight, the processes of paradigm appropriation and assimilation that facilitate the biomedical-type of IHC follow closely the biomedical and Western-colonial scientific paradigm, based on structural-functional and atheoretical metaphors of a series of interrelated parts. Yet, as I have suggested in Chapter Nine, other types and forms of integrative health care already co-exist with the biomedically- controlled type of IHC, both within and outside biomedical-IHC settings. At the patient level, as some authors have shown, IHC can involve practitioners and patients merging different systems of healing while, at the same time, respecting the inherent theoretical paradigm from which each healing system derives, e.g., the combination of traditional Chinese medicine with meditation and yoga (see Tataryn and Verhoef's [2001] 'IHC pyramid'). As I have pointed out, there are literally hundreds of 'holistic' clinics in various cities in Canada and the United States that involve a variety of CAM practitioners, without including a biomedical physician or biomedically-oriented paramedical practitioner. It is entirely possible that these types of holistic clinics are simply mirroring 251 biomedically-controlled IHC initiatives based on a 'market model' (Leckridge, 2004, p. 414), such as with the exclusive focus on capitalist profit, and a cut-and-paste approach to the combination of various health care practices. If this is the case, they would not inherently respect CAM theoretical paradigms. Yet, it is also possible that holistic integrative health care clinics that combine multiple CAM practices, each within their respective healing paradigm, exist alongside biomedical-IHC clinics. Research is required to investigate this possibility. Although these types of CAM-IHC initiatives may be labelled as 'collaborative' instead of 'integrative', I suggest that they could still be viewed as forms of IHC, in that the clinics offer a series of interconnected yet distinct healing paradigms. That is, even the term IHC implies that biomedicine must be involved for 'integration' to occur. While biomedical types of THC initiatives may dominate the media and also the financial markets, it is entirely possible that holistic CAM-IHC clinics will continue to proliferate in the future and outnumber the biomedically-based IHC clinics. It is possible that a proportion of CAM professionals will prefer to work collectively on their own 'turf', yet still providing 'integrative' care. These 'alternative' IHC clinics may also help to support a 'patient-centred' model of IHC, by providing guidance as patients choose from different healing paradigms (Leckridge, 2004, p. 415). As Kailin suggests, multiple patterns of IHC or what could be called 'postmodern multiplicities' exist, and attention could focus instead on which IHC pattern is 'right' for each different health care institution (2001, p. 46). An examination of health care systems with established 'traditional' (indigenous) systems of healing may also provide some 'clues' as to the future of integrative health care in North America. In countries such as China, India, Korea and Vietnam, traditional 252 medicine occurs from the grass-roots-to-governmental-health-policy levels, providing care for up to 80 per cent of citizens in these countries (Bodeker, 2001; WHO, 2002). Although biomedicine has increasingly replaced and even de-legitimized many traditional medical practices in these poorer countries, even at the institutional and governmental levels, systems of traditional medicine still co-exist with biomedicine. For example, the above countries each have traditional and biomedical hospitals, and related staff and pharmacopoeia. In countries such as China, there exist a number of 'combination' hospitals that offer traditional Chinese medicine and biomedicine in the treatment of a number of diverse illnesses and diseases. These may operate without necessarily changing each healing paradigm, or preserving competition among health professions. It remains to be seen whether or not North American biomedical-IHC settings could resolve the many challenges discussed earlier to reflect IHC settings in poorer countries. One of the leading issues in IHC today is, put bluntly, \"how is CAM to be evaluated?\" Although it was never the intent of this thesis to ascertain whether or not CAM 'should' be integrated with biomedicine, certain remarks can be made here. It is perhaps obvious that there are significant reasons why CAM should not be integrated with biomedicine, most notably because both CAM practices and their respective professions become marginalized in the 'integrating process'. 'Certain health theorists and historians such as Coburn, Baer, Willis, Tataryn and Verhoef, and organizations such as the WHO, recognize that health professions co-exist in states of subordination to dominant professions, facilitated through such processes as absorption, co-optation, 253 appropriation, assimilation and/or elimination by the dominant profession(s). The above processes are part-and-parcel of relations of biomedical dominance. Other reasons for not advocating integration include those related to economic issues. For example, when CAM is not funded but included alongside funded biomedicine, ultimately it is patients that suffer when they cannot afford an integrated care plan. Further, when CAM is targeted by large health organizations in Canada and the United States with disregard for any therapeutic benefit of CAM modalities, surely this is not respectful of the inherent therapeutic properties that CAM modalities such as TCM may possess. Finally, perhaps of most consequence is biomedicine's relation with other health professions, where biomedicine (both as a profession and ideology) appropriates and assimilates versions of IHC such that biomedicine maintains control on multiple levels and in a myriad of health contexts. Yet, it cannot be ignored that, as pointed out earlier, certain benefits exist to integrating CAM with biomedicine. As noted in Chapter Nine, physicians may \"expand their worldviews' with regard to learning about and practicing certain CAM modalities. IHC, at least in principle, supports patient-centred care; an expanded concept of health, illness and well-being; and a wide breadth of therapeutic options that typically would not be found 'under one roof'. While some may require reductionistic 'proof to state that CAM 'should' be integrated with biomedicine, the above reasons remain as 'positive' reasons for supporting forms of integration. After all, the main goal of integrative health care is to ameliorate the suffering of people. If IHC is able to help to address this need, or even just a part, then types of integration may be an advantage to all health care systems. 254 If biomedically-led IHC becomes dominant, research could begin to examine the various challenges identified in this research. How to resolve the issue of unfunded CAM therapies and practitioners? How to convey multiple types of evidence in biomedically-dominated health care systems? How to resolve professional closure tactics between professions? How to create and foster widespread mutual respect and understanding amongst multiple healing paradigms? These issues cannot be resolved easily, but these and many others will certainly need to be addressed for IHC to move in the direction of equity. This research, however, is not without hope for mutual respect among practitioners of culturally-diverse health practices, despite the history of colonization and subjugation of these knowledges in the past 500 years. As my research on the IHC settings in this study has illustrated, the closest approximation of 'pure' integrative health care is realized when diverse practitioners collaborate on the goal of healing the patient, while maintaining the respect and integrity of each practitioner and healing paradigm\u2014 both practically and philosophically. In the end, the ideal goal of integrative health care may really be to foster health collaboration versus the integration of actual modalities. While biomedically-led IHC endeavours may dominate without engaging this goal, currently existing 'alternative' types of IHC will likely continue to co-exist long into the future. 255 APPENDIX A HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGIES Chronology of the Establishment of 'Irregular Healing Professions' in Nineteenth Century North America 1813 'Thomsonianism' developed by Samuel Thomson 1820 Eclecticism founded by Wooster Beach 1828 Homeopathy first introduced in New York 1844 Establishment of the American Institute for Homeopathy (ATH) 1859 Canadian Bill recognizing legal rights of homeopaths in Ontario 1861 Canadian Bill recognizing legal rights of eclectics in Ontario 1865 Homeopaths achieve legal recognition in Canada East; Creation of the Montreal Homeopathic Association and the Canadian Institute for Homeopathy 1866 Development of Christian Science by Mary Baker Eddy 1869 Ontario Medical Act incorporates homeopathic and eclectic representation on the Canada Medical Council 1870 The American Medical Association (AMA) includes homeopaths and eclectics on medical examining boards 1874 Development of osteopathy by Andrew Taylor Still 1895 Development of chiropractic therapy by Daniel David Palmer 256 Chronology of the Decline of Pluralism 1839 1840 1847 1865 1869 1872 1874 1900 1904 1906 1910 1912 1916-1920 Creation of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Upper Canada College of Physicians and Surgeons of Upper Canada disbands Establishment of the American Medical Association (AMA) in direct response to homeopaths and eclectics Medical Act establishes medical licensure and educational standards in Western Canada Establishment of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario reinstated; Eclectic and homeopathic representation in the College eliminated Eclecticism begins to disappear in Canada Upper Canada Act establishes strict regulation against unlicensed or 'irregular' medical practitioners Homeopathy and eclecticism disappear in Canada AMA establishes a national annual report to rank medical schools, to be conducted by Abraham Flexner AMA grants medical licensure exclusively to students enrolled in schools approved by the American Council of Medical Education Publishing of the Flexner Report Passage of the Canada Medical Act unifying allopathic medical education across Canada Closure of many allopathic schools in the United States; complete closure of non-allopathic schools in the United States; complete closure of homeopathic schools in the United States; homeopathy disappears in North America 257 Chronology of the 'Fall' of Medical Dominance in Canada 1962 1966 1967-1971 1971 1972 1982 1985 1986 1990 1996-1997 ' Saskatchewan doctors' strike opposing national health insurance fails National health insurance implemented Castonguay-Nepveu Commission criticizes the power of medicine to control health care National health insurance encompasses all provinces Hastings Report criticizes the power of medicine to control health care Commencement of the Ontario Health Legislation Review Bill 94 of the Canada Health Act bans extra billing by doctors Ontario doctors' strike opposing Bill 94 fails Ontario Health Legislation Review professionalizes the alternative therapies of midwifery, chiropractic and massage therapy, among other health professions Establishment of the Canadian Complementary Medicine Association (CCMA) to protect the rights of doctors practicing alternative therapies 258 APPENDIX B NINETEENTH CENTURY HEALING PRACTICES Thomsonianism Thomsonianism was developed in 1813 by a New Hampshire farmer named Samuel A. Thomson (1769-1843) (Rothstein, 1988, pp. 42-46). Thomsonian therapy completely rejected allopathic treatments, attacking mineral poisons, bleeding and blistering as \"instruments of death\" (Hamowy, 1984, p. 24; Rothstein, 1988). Thomsonianism became a popular alternative movement to orthodox medicine, and was formed by lay healers, herbal practitioners, artisans, farmers and working people (Coburn et al., 1983). Thomsonian therapy supported herbal remedies such as the botanical emetic lobelia, followed by steam baths, cayenne pepper, and various teas and tonics made from approximately fifty indigenous herbs (Rothstein, 1988, pp. 42-43). Ironically, these herbal treatments were often as damaging as the 'heroic' allopathic treatments Thomsonians sought to avoid. Nevertheless, Thomson soon came to be recognized as a medical botany pioneer of both nineteenth and twentieth century times (Crellin, Andersen, & Connor, 1997). Thomsonianism became quite popular, with the 1822 publication of Thomson's book, New Guide to Health, distributed by Friendly Societies throughout the United States (Hamowy, 1984, p. 24; Porter, 1997, p. 393; Rothstein, 1988, p. 43). The Thomsonians fought to remove legislation that provided for the elite status of allopathic physicians, and organized national conventions between 1832-1838 (Coburn et al., 1983; Rothstein, 1988, p. 46). Ultimately, however, Thomsonianism split into a number of fragmented movements and disappeared by 1840 (Rothstein, 1988, p. 46). Homeopathy ; Perhaps the most influential and direct threat to nineteenth-century allopathic medicine, homeopathy was developed in early nineteenth century Germany by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). Hahnemann had obtained a formal rigorous allopathic medical education, but soon became distrustful of allopathic treatments due to their harmful or 'iatrogenic' elements (Hamowy, 1984, p. 25). Hahnemann's research led him to the conclusion that the most efficacious remedy for any illness consisted of a substance that, when given to a healthy person, mirrored similar symptoms of the particular illness at hand. Further, when administered to a person exhibiting these _symptoms, the remedy thereby resolved the illness. This theoretical construct, similia similibus curantur, 'like treats like' or the foundation for homeopathic therapeutics (Hamowy, 1984, p. 25). Contrary to strong allopathic drugs, homeopathic remedies consisted of particular flora and fauna suspended in extremely dilute solutions through a process known as 'succussion' or violently shaking the solution. The more dilute solution was believed to have a stronger effect. Low dose solutions, for example, would consist of one drop of the compound from a 'mother tincture', and 99 drops of pure alcohol or water. This would give a ratio of 1/100, 0.01 or 1CH (Panos & Heimlich, 1980). Dilutions in Hahnemann's 259 time went up to 200 CH and more. Homeopathy further supported the recuperative powers of the organism itself, and advocated fresh air, proper diet, sunshine, bed rest and personal hygiene (Hamowy, 1984, p. 26). Hahnemann published his first book on homeopathy in Germany in 1810. Homeopathy became well known for treating Cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1849, when allopathic medicine had failed (Kaufman, 1988, p. 100). Homeopathy was brought to North America by a German physician in 1828, who settled in New York City (Hamowy, 1984, p. 26). Homeopathy was then imported to Canada in Ontario by Joseph J. Lancaster, who quickly developed a popular following (1984, p. 26). As Ontario was the most accessible province for American travellers and settlers, it became a major destination for irregular practitioners such as homeopaths (Connor, 1991, p. 59). In addition, Canadian practitioners residing in Ontario often attended American schools in the neighboring states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan (1991, p. 59). The Hahnemann Medical College was established in 1836 in Philadelphia, and the American Institute for Homeopathy was established in 1844 (Hamowy, 1984; Kaufman, 1988). Homeopathy soon found a niche in the competitive medical market-place, and was first popular among the working classes before it became popular with the wealthy. The main reason for homeopathy's popularity was that it was often the only form of care in physician-starved areas (Baer, 1989). Where elite physicians were available, they were far more expensive than homeopathic physicians (Baer, 1989). For example, in the mid-nineteenth century, the allopathic physician ratio in Canada was at times one physician for every 2,400 residents (Hamowy, 1984, pp. 15, 21). By 1859, homeopaths were recognized as legal medical practitioners in Ontario, and were legally recognized by the AMA in 1870 (Connor, 1991, p. 66; Connor, 1880s, homeopathic schools and dispensaries were established in most American and in some Canadian cities such as Montreal (Connor, 1998; Rogers, 1998). By the 1890s, Rogers (1998, pp. 31-64) contends that in the United States, despite restrictive consultation clauses, homeopaths had established hospitals attached to schools, had won support from local/state politicians, sat on newly revived state boards of health, and walked the wards of some city hospitals. Medical examining boards almost invariably involved examiners from regular, homeopathic and eclectic sects (Rogers, 1998). Homeopathy, a so-called 'irregular sect', was so influential that some historians such as Warner argue powerfully that homeopathy directly shaped and ultimately aided the cause of regular medicine by prompting regulars to form a rallying identity of orthodoxy against homeopathic medicine (see Warner, 1998, pp. 5-29). Warner also claims that homeopathy's main goal was to \"destroy and supplant regular medicine\", so determined homeopathy was in the nineteenth century. Eclecticism and Naturopathy A related 'irregular' form of medicine that emerged in the nineteenth century was called 'eclecticism' or eclectic medicine. The origins of eclecticism date to the 1820s, when Wooster Beach (1794-1868), a New York physician, founded the first series of eclectic colleges (Connor, 1991, p. 60; Rothstein, 1988, p. 47). As an exception to the total 260 exclusion of orthodox medical practices by other irregular sects, \"eclecticism borrowed therapeutic principles and practices from both regular medical groups and other sectarian ones in an attempt to use all that they thought to be beneficial while rejecting what they considered unsatisfactory\" (Connor, 1991, p. 60). For example, eclectics utilized Thomsonian botanical compounds, in addition to using the allopathic surgical, diagnostic procedures and non-mineral drugs of the day (Connor, 1991, p. 62). It is argued that naturopathy today, despite having its own origins in the later twentieth century, is merely a revised form of eclecticism, not including allopathic practices (Connor, 1991). The profession of naturopathy traced its origins to the healing power of nature identified in Greek and Roman times. Naturopathy had its own history of professionalization in North America, with as many as twenty-one U.S. schools totalling 1,400 students by the 1930s, including licensure in seven U.S. states and strong ties with Chiropractic (Gort & Coburn, 1988). Naturopathy ultimately declined after 1937, however, due to advances in scientific medicine and technology, and would have to wait until the later twentieth century to re-instate itself, as many historic 'irregular' sects have done. In 1861, eclecticism was legalized in Canada, and by 1870 was legal in the United States (Connor, 1991). The Eclectic Medical Institute was opened in 1842 in the United States, bolstered by John Kings' discovery of how to concentrate the resinous material of plants (Rothstein, 1988, p. 48). In 1848, the National Eclectic Medical Association was formed in the United States, and although it suspended its activities in 1857, was later revived in the 1870s by physician John M. Scudder, and by John Uri Lloyd, a renowned pharmacologist (Rothstein, 1988, p. 49). By the 1900s, more than thirty eclectic colleges had been founded, and over ninety medical journals catering to the needs of approximately 4,000 eclectic physicians in the United States (Connor, 1991; Rothstein, 1988, p. 50). Christian Science Christian Science was founded in 1866 by Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) (Baer, 1989; Schoepflin, 1988). This philosophy viewed material reality, including disease and illness, as illusory, and completely eliminated the use of drugs (Baer, 1989). Porter (1997) argues that it was the radical Protestant streak in many non-allopathic healing movements that was taken to its logical extreme in the Christian Science movement. Eddy, bedridden for most of her adolescence and early adult life, could not be helped by regular medicine. Finally relieved by homeopathy, the mesmeric treatments of Quimby, and divine revelation after reading the Bible in early adulthood, Eddy undertook a self- healing process whose success led her to develop her own Christian Science healing system (Porter, 1997, p. 395; Schoepflin, 1988, pp. 192-214). Christian Science denied the reality of bodily disease, viewing sickness as purely in the mind, to be dispelled by 'mind-healing' (Porter, 1997, p. 395). In addition, Baer argues that one of the main purposes of the Christian science movement was to protest the restrictive lifestyle that physicians imposed on upper and middle-class women. These practices led to what has been called the 'cult of invalidity' or the culture of sickness common in nineteenth- century women (Baer, 1989). In 1881, Eddy established the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, where she taught approximately 4,000 students, most of whom were women 261 excluded from regular medical education (Porter, 1997; Schoepflin, 1988, p. 200). Christian Science ultimately became more of a religious than healing movement in the early twentieth century. Osteopathy Founded by Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917), an allopathic physician disenchanted with the claims of allopathic medicine, osteopathy was created in 1874 on the principle that disease was due to faulty articulations or 'lesions' in various parts of the musculoskeletal system (Baer, 1989; Gevitz, 1988). Still asserted the philosophy, common among irregular practitioners, that the body contained an inherent capacity to resist disease and repair itself (Porter, 1997, p. 394). While concentrating on the spine for the cause of illness, Porter argues that Still's followers also extended manipulation to the entire skeletal structure, which later involved electric and water treatments, massage and eventually surgery (1997, p. 394). Osteopathy, similar to other irregular sects, oriented to those unable to secure an allopathic education or treatment, and welcomed patients from the uneducated classes (Baer, 1989). By the 1890s, osteopaths had attained limited practice rights, and Still had established an osteopathic college at Kirksville, Missouri (Gevitz, 1988, p. 129; Porter, 1997, p. 394). Osteopathy was one of the few irregular sects that survived well into the twentieth century. Chiropractic Chiropractic therapy was founded in 1895 by Canadian born and former schoolmaster Daniel David Palmer (1845-1913) (Wardwell, 1988). Palmer claimed to have discovered the chiropractic technique after treating a janitor for deafness and relieving another patient's heart trouble by realigning the spinal vertebrae (Coburn & Biggs, 1986; Wardwell, 1988, p. 158). Palmer developed chiropractic theory based on the principle that subtle adjustments of the spinal column could resolve disease, by resolving bodily imbalance caused by spinal pressure on nerves, tissue and blood vessels, ultimately restoring balance to the body's system (Coburn & Biggs, 1988; Wardwell, 1988). Similar to osteopathy, chiropractic welcomed thousands of students unable to access either allopathic medicine or medical schools (Baer, 1989). The Palmer School of Chiropractic was founded in Davenport, Iowa in 1899, and would also survive into the later twentieth century (Baer, 1989; Porter, 1997). 262 APPENDIX C INTERVIEW GUIDES Introduction: Thank you for meeting with me today.
