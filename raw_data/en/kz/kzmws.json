Science News of Yesteryear \"Construction of two rigid airships of approximately 6,000,000 cubic foot capacity at cost not over $8,000,000 for both [was] authorized by Congress but no funds appropriated.\" That item from 1926 led the first annual review of \"Scientific Events\" by Science News-Letter. In October of that year, Science Service began publishing a printed weekly newsletter in addition to the mimeographed packet of news stories that the organization had been providing primarily to newspapers. Every year since, the writers at Science News-Letter and later Science News have selected what they consider the current year's most compelling stories that they had covered. Since 1996, we've also put the list up on Science News Online, where it remains one of the most popular features through the following year. So, what else was hot in science 79 years ago? Some stories covered lines of research still recognized as valuable today. For example, anthropologists regarded the discovery of a Neandertal skull, reported in a story entitled \"Woman Finds New Cave Man Skull at Gibraltar,\" as an opportunity to learn more about the habits of these extinct \"people.\" Other items of note: \"Observable region of space was shown by Dr. Edwin Hubble of Mount Wilson Observatory to be a sphere of 140 million light years radius, including some 2,000,000 nebulae, all of them embryo or grown stellar systems.\" This was one of the measurements that led to proof that the universe extends far beyond the Milky Way and contains countless galaxies with their own star populations. \"The discovery that plants, as well as animals, have in their cells the special bits of living matter known as the sex chromosomes, was announced by Dr. Kathleen B. Blackburn, British botanist.\" \"Prof. A. A. Michelson of the University of Chicago announced his new determination of the speed of light as 299,786 km, or 186,284 miles per second.\" \"A machine for automatically coding cipher telegraphic messages was perfected.\" \"The valuable constituent of insulin was prepared in crystalline form by Dr. John J. Abel, of Johns Hopkins University. The first enzyme . . . was made in a crystallized form by Dr. James E. Sumner at Cornell University Medical School.\" \"Dr. W.D. Coolidge, of the General Electric Company, demonstrated a new cathode ray tube, with which these rays are for the first time obtained in quantity outside the tube.\" \"Tests made with 100 young children showed that a two year old child that can scarcely talk is already developed into a personality type, with characteristic emotional reactions, it was reported by Dr. Leslie Marston, of the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station.\" \"Two-way radio communication was established for considerable lengths of time between New York and London.\" \"Plans were completed . . . for the establishment of a chain of seismograph stations around San Francisco to detect microscopic earth tremors and so to more adequately warn of future quakes.\" \"Hydrogen was transmuted into helium by Prof. F. Paneth and Dr. Peters of Berlin University. Gold was claimed to have been transmuted to mercury by Dr. A. Gaschler, of the Berlin Technical High School.\" This research was part of a burst of activity triggered by the discoveries of the atomic nucleus and radioactivity earlier in the century. \"A great sun dial, built by astronomers of the Maya race over 1,500 years ago, was discovered at the ruins of the Maya city of Copan, Honduras, by archaeologists of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.\" Some of the 1926 entries now give us pause: \"Berlin established a matrimonial bureau where candidates for marriage can receive medical and genetical advice.\" \"Tetraethyl lead\" anti-knock gasoline was declared by the U.S. Public Health Service to be not unduly dangerous to health . . .\" \"Center of New Guinea, only place where white man has not yet roamed, penetrated by American-Dutch party.\" \"Lieut. Commander R. E. Byrd, U.S.N., reached the North Pole, May 9, by airplane from Spitsbergen, making first flight to pole. Amundsen crossed the North Pole, May 12, in the airship Norge, traversing 2,700 miles in 71 hours.\" There is now a debate about whether Byrd made it to the pole at all. \"The mind of a person is organized and important mental attitudes determined before birth, Dr. Stewart Paton of Princeton University declared.\" \"Mississippi enacted an anti-evolution law.\" This year, Science News echoed some of the items in that early news summary: \"Bacteriophage, the enemy of germs, discovered by Dr. F. d'Herelle, was declared by him to be a living parasite of parasites and not just a chemical factor.\" In the last few years, bacteriophages have been considered for various uses, including growing nerve tissue ( [SN: 5/28/05, p. 341](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-against-them)). \"By coating them with gold, Prof. H. Beehod, German scientist, made visible minute bacteria formerly beyond the power of any microscope.\" In 2005, bacteria were again gold coated, but this time with nanoparticles to build an electromechanical device ( [SN: 10/22/05, p. 259](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bionic-bacteria-gold-nanoparticles-make-gadgets-living-microbes)). \"The Health Organization of the League of Nations built up an epidemiological service to check the spread of infectious diseases between countries.\" This year, the World Health Organization monitored bird flu ( [SN: 9/10/05, p. 171](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-flu-flies-coop)), among other diseases. \"Intelligence tests given to 5,500 New England school children of foreign parents were found by Dr. Nathaniel Hirsch to show that there is no connection between high intelligence and any one particular racial type.\" In 2005, researchers reported tests indicated that Chinese children outscore Western kids in IQ because reading the pictorial symbols in Chinese writing fosters superior spatial abilities ( [SN: 2/12/05, p. 99](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-kids-iq-lift-reading-system-may-boost-chinese-scores)). \"Earthquake on west coast of Sumatra cost 400 lives.\" This quake occurred about 500 kilometers southeast of the temblor that started the December 2004 tsunami ( [SN: 1/8/05, p. 19](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tsunami-disaster-scientists-model-big-quake-and-its-consequences)). Some of the items are difficult to comprehend or the conclusions didn't stand the test of time: \"The theory that vitamins have opposites, \"toxamins,\" which occur in certain foods and prevent proper bone formation and cause serious nervous diseases, was advanced by Prof. Edward Mallanby, of Sheffield University, in England.\" \"Two Prague scientists discovered a way of using washed animal blood in human transfusions.\" \"Indications were found that trachoma, a disease of the eye for which immigrants have been barred from entering the U.S., is due to a deficient diet, by Dr. B. Frankline Royer, medical director of the national committee for the prevention of blindness.\" \"High steam pressure boilers promised to revolutionize future locomotives.\" \"Children whose characters become warped so that they steal and commit sex offenses as a result of sleeping sickness may be reeducated by training in good habits, according to results obtained by Helvi Haahti, Finnish psychiatrist at the Institute of Juvenile Research of Illinois.\" It's anyone's guess which of the items listed in the following pages will turn out in future decades to be important advances and which will have future readers scratching their heads. \u2014Julie Ann Miller, Editor in Chief, Science News The following review lists important science stories of 2005 reported in the pages of Science News.

A newly discovered extrasolar planet appeared to have the most massive core of any planet known ( [July 9, 168: 19](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/core-finding-latest-oddest-planet-hints-how-orbs-form)). A newfound, Jupiterlike extrasolar planet proved to be associated with a trio of stars, posing a puzzle: How can massive planets form in multiple-star systems ( [July 16, 168: 38*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/triple-play-planet-three-suns))? - Step aside, Pluto Astronomers discovered what may qualify as the 10th planet, a body larger and more distant than Pluto and possessing a moon ( [Aug. 6, 168: 83*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bigger-pluto-tenth-planet-or-icy-leftover); [Oct. 29, 168: 285](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/10th-planet-has-partner)). - slam NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft slammed into Comet Tempel 1 on July 4, producing some heavenly fireworks and excavating material that probably hadn't seen the light of day since the birth of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago ( [July 9, 168: 22*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grand-slam); [Sept. 10, 168: 168*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-impact)). - Pluto partners Pluto revealed two moons in addition to the one already observed there ( [Nov. 5, 168: 291*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-partners-hubble-finds-more-moons-around-pluto)). - Planet or not? A tiny dot of light showed up next to a young, sunlike star, but it could be either the glimmer of a brown dwarf or the long-sought image of an extrasolar planet ( [April 9, 167: 228*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stellar-question-extrasolar-planet-or-failed-star)). Astronomers also debated whether an image of an object orbiting a brown dwarf qualifies as the first image of an extrasolar planet ( [May 7, 167: 291](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planetary-picture-criteria-planethood-cloud-objects-identity)). - Young and near Youthful versions of massive galaxies like the Milky Way might be only a cosmic stone's throw away from Earth, astronomers speculated ( [Jan. 1, 167: 4](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-and-near-baby-galaxies-roam-our-backyard)). - Mars geology Images taken a few years apart by spacecraft revealed that Mars has had recent landslides, freshly carved gullies, and a crater gouged in its surface no earlier than 1980 ( [Sept. 24, 168: 196](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fresh-mars-craft-views-new-gullies-craters-and-landslides)). Images taken by two Mars spacecraft suggested that a volcano on the Red Planet erupted long ago at the confluence of two riverbeds, indicating that the region had water and heat, two prerequisites for life ( [April 23, 167: 269](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-haven-life)). A flat region near the Red Planet's equator yielded evidence of a recently frozen ocean that was once as deep and big as the North Sea ( [March 5, 167: 149*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-landscaping-spacecraft-eyes-evidence-frozen-sea)). - Lightweight world Astronomers for the first time discovered an asteroid with two moons ( [Aug. 13, 168: 101*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/threes-company-asteroid-87-sylvia-and-her-two-moons)). - Atmospheric moon Saturn's moon Enceladus proved to have an atmosphere containing water vapor ( [April 16, 167: 253](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-atmosphere)). The body continues to feed its atmosphere by undergoing icy eruptions ( [Aug. 27, 168: 141](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-small-feisty)). - Saturn says cheese Planetary scientists assembled the largest and most-detailed global portrait of Saturn ever made - Planet potential Recording radio waves from the region around a young star, astronomers for the first time documented a key step in the rocky road to planethood ( [July 2, 168: 5](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pebbles-heaven-tracking-planets-making)). Barely more massive than planets, some brown dwarfs were shown to be cloaked in disks of gas and dust from which planets may coalesce ( [Feb. 5, 167: 83](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/puny-parent-planets-may-form-around-tiny-orbs); [Dec. 24 & 31, 168: 416](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/puny-way-make-planets)). Warm dust seen surrounding a star only 41 light-years from Earth seemed analogous to the solar system's asteroid belt, an indication that a planet may also be present ( [April 23, 167: 259](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-dust-asteroid-belt-or-boiling-comet)). - Planetary territory The Hubble Space Telescope examined in unprecedented detail what may be one of the nearest and youngest homes yet discovered for extrasolar planets ( [Jan. 8, 167: 30](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dwarf-disk)).

The brightest flash of light ever recorded from beyond the solar system could provide information about a puzzling group of extremely short-lived gamma-ray bursts from distant galaxies ( [Feb. 26, 167: 132](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-flash-record-breaking-explosion-outer-space)). Another short-lived gamma-ray burst may have given astronomers their first glimpse of two neutron stars colliding to forge a black hole ( [May 14, 167: 308*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fleeting-flash-pinpointing-short-gamma-ray-burst)). Astronomers found the most-distant, and oldest, gamma-ray burst ever, hailing from just 900 million years after the Big Bang ( [Sept. 17, 168: 179*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/farthest-bang-burst-goes-distance)). - Influential monsters Supermassive black holes showed effects on galaxies far beyond the black holes' gravitational grasp ( [Jan. 22, 167: 52](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-bonanza-10000-objects-near-our-galaxys-center); [March 5, 167: 158](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hole-power)). - Ancient echoes Astronomers for the first time detected the surviving notes of a cosmic symphony created just after the Big Bang ( [Jan. 15, 167: 35*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultimate-retro-modern-echoes-early-universe)). - Big neighbor Estimates tripled for the diameter of the disk of the Andromeda galaxy, the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way ( [June 18, 167: 398](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-gets-bigger)). - Some like it hot A new theory of planet formation suggested that sizzling-hot, Earthlike planets might be abundant throughout the Milky Way and will soon be detected ( [March 26, 167: 203*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/too-darn-hot)). - Oldster Astronomers found one of the most chemically primitive stars known, dating to just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang ( [April 16, 167: 244](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-primitive-old-star-sheds-light-early-stellar-formation)). - Bowled over New simulations proposed that the solar system's four biggest planets were once bunched together, suggesting that a planetary bowling game rapidly rearranged the structure of the outer solar system and tossed chunks of debris toward the sun ( [May 28, 167: 340](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roaming-giants-did-migrating-planets-shape-solar-system)). - Speedstar Astronomers discovered a star moving so fast that it will eventually exit the Milky Way ( [Feb. 26, 167: 142](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/speedstar)). - Ice in the rock Hubble Space Telescope observations suggested that as much as one-fourth of the mass of Ceres, the largest known asteroid, might be frozen water ( [Sept. 24, 168: 206](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/icy-world-found-inside-asteroid)). - Cosmic crisis? Baby galaxies that hail from the early cosmos but appear mature and nearly as massive as the Milky Way suggested a challenge to the standard theory of galaxy formation ( [Oct. 8, 168: 235](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crisis-cosmos)). | | Swooping above and below the plane of Saturn's rings, the Cassini spacecraft revealed how the gravity of Saturn's moons sculpts waves, kinks, and knots in the ring system ( X-ray telescopes captured the earliest and clearest view of the core of a gas cloud about to transform into a star ( [Behavior] - Mental ills A national study found that half of all adults develop a mental disorder at some time in their lives, although most cases are mild ( [June 11, 167: 372](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disorderly-conduct-us-survey-finds-high-rates-mental-illness)). - Scripted genes Two genes influencing brain development showed signs of contributing to the learning disorder known as dyslexia ( [Nov. 5, 168: 292](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bad-readout-dna-genes-act-brain-may-promote-dyslexia)).
