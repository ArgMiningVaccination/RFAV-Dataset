Hi John, is your business focused on helping the community? If so, how? Before the pandemic, people have been struggling with mental health, trauma, and feelings of disconnection. During and after the pandemic, things got exponentially worse. For nearly 2 decades, I was involved in the healing arts, but grew frustrated by treating symptoms instead of creating permanent relief by addressing the root causes of disease expression. I spent many years in trauma bays, seeing and treating the symptoms of trauma, but it wasn't until I started Soul Surgeon by Moos MD that started to heal it before it happens. Through wisdom both learned and earned, I have been able to offer care that sees people as human and offers them a path towards healing that is rooted in integrity. Integrity to me means a state of wholeness, such as the integrity of an airplane or ship. When the integrity of those vessels is compromised, they crash or sink. The same is true for the human vessel; we need to be whole to thrive in this world. We offer the potential gain access to those root traumas and create meaningful and substantial change in peoples lives so they can thrive in their own bodies. We treat and heal all aspects of human: physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual. We do this by taking them through 3 lenses of integration: cognitive (thought), somatic (felt), and embodiment (known). The hardest commute many of us have is the distance from our head to our heart. We make that easier. So much of our suffering is rooted in our mind, so by dropping down into the felt and known areas of our lives, can we truly start to move the needle. Our communities and our world have been suffering, because we are only as strong as our sickest people. We need to lift everyone up if we expect to rise together. What should our readers know about your business?At Soul Surgeon by Moos MD, our vision is to uncomplicate transformative healing experiences. We aim to do this through psychedelic and somatic healing modalities. We believe that it is time to birth a new paradigm of healing and love, and we strongly believe that psychedelics will be at the forefront of pushing this evolution. Conventional medicine wants you to live longer. We want you to live fully. We have witnessed medication and talk-therapy fail to keep up with the meteoric rise in mental illness, languishing, and suffering. We need new tools, new skills, and new perspectives. My therapeutic practice focuses on a connection-based, emotionally-attuned, trauma-informed, value-driven approach to care. We believe healing happens by \"creating the conditions for your love and light to shine.\" Before healing can happen, we ensure a sense of safety, transparency and trust is established. The conditions: integrity, nurturance, play, stillness, and connection are the bedrock from which the seed of change grows outward. Love is the outward expression that first starts with the connection to self, then other, and ultimately all creation. Your Light is the manifestation of your true purpose and meaning. We are a healing sanctuary in Los Angeles. Our unique healing framework lies at the intersection of mysticism and medicine and is informed by both clinical and spiritual practices. After becoming increasingly disenfranchised with most KAP medical models, I wanted to create a better container for healing to occur. I chose to make personal transformation safe, comfortable and accessible. As a Western-trained, allopathic medical doctor, I saw too many people impacted by the consequences of trauma. Frustrated and discouraged, I turned my focus from trauma surgery to trauma healing. It was time to heal it before it happens. Relying on my deep experience in all aspects of trauma, I was able to apply the wisdom learned and earned from both professional and personal experiences to support every client's healing journey. We are here to create the space, the safety and the opportunity to heal. Leveraging new medicines, precise skills, and a pragmatic healing framework, we offer guidance an support through every clients process of self-discovery and personal transformation. We offer comprehensive and custom treatment programs for individuals, couples, and groups, adolescent care, and welcome all races and ethnicities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and disabilities, and ages. We welcome all humans! If you had a friend visiting you, what are some of the local spots you'd want to take them around to? I would start the day going to either JFM Boxing Club or Studio MDR. After a morning class, I would walk down to the beach and grab a Chai at The Cow's End or Groundwork and walk out to the lifeguard stand at Driftwood with my love. After walking the Marina Del Rey peninsula and Venice beach, I would make my way to Holey Grail donuts for some vegan donuts and then up to Abbot Kinney to have breakfast at The Butcher's Daughter. Afterwards, I would grab some groceries and snacks at Rainbow Acres followed by lunch at Wabi on Rose or the Rose Cafe. Dinner would be tough, but a few of my favorites are Cobi's on Main, Sushi Enya on Washington, Planta Cocina in the Marina, Southend in Venice, or Double Zero on Lincoln. After dinner, we may take in some music at The Venice West or Winston House. If there is time, I'd try and grab a late nice ice cream from Salt & Straw before heading to bed. It's hard to leave the westside bubble with so many great options! The Shoutout series is all about recognizing that our success and where we are in life is at least somewhat thanks to the efforts, support, mentorship, love and encouragement of others. So is there someone that you want to dedicate your shoutout to? My biggest source of inspiration comes from Tami Pardee (Pardee Properties), my love, my spiritual partner, and the most amazing woman I have ever met. Together, we have co-created a relationship that has taught me more about life, love, and healing than any form of education or experience. Right along with her is our kids, a modern day Brady Bunch: Taylor (Bella Venice), Bailey, Delilah, Tanner, Jack, and Kai. Our family continually inspires me to be the best version of myself possible. To my parents for the gift of life and supporting me through the best of times and worst of times. A huge thank you for the published works and words of Gabor Mate, Brene Brown, Esther Perel, Dan Siegel and Lisa Damour - there work has informed my healing, my practice, my parenting, and my relationships. To Rich Roll and Julie Piatt of the Rich Roll Podcast which felt like both family and community to me when I was at my lowest. To the UC Davis School of Medicine, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Memorial Medical Center of Modesto, the Psychedelic Research And Training Institute (PRATI), the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), and Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) for providing education and opportunity to support my growth and expansion as and shoutouts from the community; it's how we uncover hidden gems, so if you or someone you know deserves recognition please let us "}
