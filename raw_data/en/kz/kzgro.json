This is exactly what we do when introducing the Autoimmune Paleo Protocol into a treatment plan. Nutrition can be one of the most powerful tools in healing and disease management, yet so often we are quick to turn to supplements in search of an immediate fix and overlook the basic principles. It's often only when we return to our roots and start to look at health holistically that we begin to thrive again. Understanding Autoimmune Conditions To initially understand how best to support autoimmune conditions, it helps to develop a deeper knowledge of what they actually are. Despite being varied in presentation, ranging from Rheumatoid arthritis to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and even including Coeliac disease, these conditions all have one thing in common; they're triggered by the body launching a misguided attack on itself. Our immune system exists as our body's natural method of protection against infection and disease. This system relies on information and pre-prepared responses to deal with any foreign invaders, which is perfect for when we encounter the common cold or flu. However, in certain circumstances with the right conditions, the immune system may become dysfunctional and launch an attack on a specific part of the body. It's difficult to estimate the number of people globally living with an autoimmune condition at any one time; partly because many conditions can often go hand in hand, like Coeliac and thyroid disease, and partly because so many of these conditions go undetected or years without a proper diagnosis. And too often when patients are eventually diagnosed with an autoimmune condition, the standard treatment protocol is developed on a reductionist approach - where medical professionals solely attempt to treat the site of disease rather than the person as a whole. A Holistic Approach After much trial, error and lived experience, the Autoimmune Paleo (AIP) Protocol was developed as a holistic and complimentary way to manage these chronic conditions. The elimination approach was specifically designed to help those suffering from autoimmune disease eliminate food triggers, reverse nutrient deficiencies, balance gut flora, and support their bodies over the long-term. The protocol has two components, dietary and lifestyle, which dovetail to create a healthy, thriving environment by de-escalating the immune assault on the body and encouraging periods of remission from symptoms*. For many, this may be the first time since diagnosis where symptoms begin to reduce. Dietary shifts include removing food-driven sources of inflammation and immune hyperactivity, and restoring nutrient density, while lifestyle shifts are concerned with sleep, stress management, movement, and connection (both with humans and nature). The process can be challenging for many, especially if trying to do it alone, but it's one of the most individualised ways to manage autoimmune disease, and the benefits speak for themselves when implemented correctly. So how does it work? The AIP protocol is a two-stage plan (elimination and reintroduction), that is implemented in a three-stage process (transition, maintenance and reintroduction). This initially sounds simple and easy to jump into, but here's what it looks like in practice... Stage 1: Transition (Elimination) - here clients will move from their 'normal' lifestyle into the AIP. It can be either slow and gentle or cold turkey, but focuses on providing the body with nutrient-dense foods to ensure good health, and eliminates all potential food groups that can trigger an immune response. This can be daunting at first but with the right guidance, support and preparation, it can be a smooth transition. While the list of foods that is ultimately removed is too big to focus on in detail, it can be easy to summarise it in groups for clarity's sake. These include: Nightshade vegetables (including tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant). All nuts and seeds, legumes and beans and grains(including oats, wheat and rice). Eggs and all dairy (including butter and ghee). Most oils (coconut, olive and avocado are allowed). All sugars (including natural alternatives). Seed-derived herbs (such as cumin, nutmeg and paprika). Food additives and processed foods, including chocolate. Alcohol. Stage 2: Maintenance (Elimination) - this stage is primarily concerned with ensuring the body is nourished while continuing to avoid these potentially triggering foods. Typically, this lasts from 30-90 days, depending on the severity of the autoimmune disease and how long it takes to begin to get relief from symptoms. Stage 3: Reintroduction - this stage is the most delicate, where one-by-one, foods are reintroduced into the diet, with careful observations and monitoring for symptoms. If a food elicits a response then it is removed again. If there is no reaction then the food can stay. This ensures the diet has as much variety without triggering the immune system. By the time of completion, a client's diet will be individually tailored to their needs and made up of the foods that serve them. It's also important to note that foods that did cause a reaction can, after some further support, be re-challenged at a later date. When approaching the lifestyle part of the AIP protocol, processes have a little more room to move, as elements like stress and sleep management, alongside environmental factors, are more individualised. However, as with the dietary element, many people have the opportunity to gently ease their way into these new shifts. Why is the AIP protocol so effective? Unlike many trends and fad diets, the Autoimmune Paleo Protocol was developed from key clinical findings alongside lived experiences of those with widespread autoimmune conditions and has been through preliminary clinical trials to prove it's efficacy for certain autoimmune diseases. Ultimately this process is not about adhering to the most-restrictive diet forever, but rather finding the unique nutrition plan that will lead the individual to live the most liberating lifestyle with minimal symptoms of autoimmune disease. How do I know if this approach is the right one for me? Your current practitioner will have likely confirmed if this protocol is the right fit for you, but there's still a chance this information may be totally new. When undergoing the AIP Protocol it's always best to work with a Nutritionist or Naturopathic practitioner who can guide you through the different elements that need to be considered, while supporting you through the potentially challenging times. However, if this approach to managing autoimmune disease does spark interest but hasn't been suggested as part of your current treatment plan, or if you're lacking certainty around any conditions that may be affecting you, [reach out to book a free 15-minute consultation with me and we can talk over the next steps.](https://www.elixirnaturopathy.com.au/consultations) *Disclaimer: The AIP protocol is not designed to replace conventional medical advice or treatment.
