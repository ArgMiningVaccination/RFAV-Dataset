However, it is important to acknowledge that pain - physical and beyond - has roots that transcend corporal suffering. We are all guilty of disregarding our [spiritual health](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-spiritual-health-definition-examples.html). We think that only the body can get wounded, as the soul is intangible to us. Spiritual healing pulls us back from this belief. When we embark on a journey of [spiritual cleansing](https://individualogist.com/spiritual-cleansing), we realize that the reason why we cannot attain the highest form of wellbeing is because we are disconnected from the Divine. The Divine is our main source of life. Severing your ties with the Divine means depriving yourself of the chance to be [fully actualized](https://individualogist.com/individuation). Spiritual healing is all about reconnecting with the Divine. This means reconnecting with nature, with people, and with our own selves. This is a holistic approach where we treat the body and soul as one and complementary. Although you can feel a certain wound in a targeted area, spiritual healing teaches us that pain is never isolated. The pain of the foot is the pain of the body, and of course, the soul. There are two main categories of spiritual healing. One is pure emotional healing, while the other is combined physical and mental healing. A person can determine their preferred modality by doing a deep assessment of their current struggles. Are you experiencing anxiety? Is it accompanied by migraine, fatigue, or loss of appetite? If you feel like your body is suffering from a wound from within, a combined approach might be what you need. If you want to focus on healing your heart and mind, then you can go for emotional healing. Spiritual healing comes in 5 different forms, with each serving a distinctive purpose, to create a specific outcome. Restoring our physical health is a part of spiritual healing. Most of our chronic illnesses are attributed to an unbalanced vibration or [energy frequency](https://individualogist.com/the-complete-chakra-energy-guide) within us. Because of this low [energy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/real-healing/201107/energy-healing) level, our body is more prone to succumb to a negative state. The lower our vibration, the faster our body deteriorates. One popular approach to physical healing is vibrational healing. This method is all about channeling higher frequencies to our bodies through external assistance. It can come in the form of a machine, a music therapy or with the [spiritual guidance](https://individualogist.com/spiritual-guidance) of an energy healer. The ultimate goal of [vibrational healing](https://individualogist.com/chakra-frequencies-and-solfeggio-frequencies) is to restore the equilibrium of our spiritual energy. Once you attain a healthy, balanced vibration, you will start to feel your body improve day by day. Your muscles will naturally release tension and you will feel lighter and brighter. Emotional healing is the restoring of the heart. This approach requires a lot of work. First, you need to become in tune with your feelings. Reassess your past struggles. How did you process your emotions before? Do you validate your feelings or do you tend to turn away from them? Knowing your emotional patterns can help you reach maximum emotional healing. Next, take the time to rest. Recalling negative past experiences can be quite draining. So now that you've already identified your struggles, it's time to take a short break. Breathe and make space for the third step: determining your course of action. Shifting your focus from negativity to actual solutions will help you restore your emotional health. Performing [shadow work](https://individualogist.com/shadow-work) can work wonders in this regard. An issue unaddressed is an issue that will keep resurfacing. You can only truly move on once you have already confronted a certain situation. Remember, your emotional healing will greatly depend on your ability to acknowledge your feelings. Mental healing is focused on eliminating all deep-seated thoughts that make us ill. When we are psychologically distressed, our bodies will surely manifest through restlessness, fatigue and even serious diseases. This is why we put emphasis on the importance of mind cleansing. Healing your minds does not simply mean thinking positively. It goes beyond just shifting your thoughts. Mental healing is all about creating healthy thinking patterns that you will follow every single day. It's claiming back the power over your mind and controlling it to your advantage. One simple way of programming your mind is through self-talk. Incorporating the habit of affirming yourself to your everyday routine works wonders for your overall mental healing. Know that the way you talk to yourself shapes the way you perceive yourself. It's bridging the gap between your external [sense of self](https://individualogist.com/sense-of-self) and your core. So make sure to train yourself to speak to your mind in a kind, nurturing language. Everything you feel is rooted at the Soul level. If your soul is not taken care of, your whole psyche will feel the effects of it. Soul healing focuses on nurturing your spiritual health by \"feeding\" it. This could mean by engaging in spiritual activities, praying to the Divine, or consuming materials like spiritual books or podcasts. If you have the opportunity, you can also schedule regular appointments with a spiritual counsellor such as a priest or a pastor. Your soul is your core. This is one of the reasons why you may feel that sometimes, it can be out of reach. It takes a special, guided approach to be able to speak to your soul, as it houses your deepest feelings, . This is where meditational healing comes into picture. [Meditation](https://individualogist.com/meditation-for-the-beginner), when done properly, creates a gateway between our external selves and our soul. When we meditate, the direct [spiritual connection](https://individualogist.com/spiritual-connection) that we create allows us to get a hold of our soul and heal it faster. Holistic healing is the amalgamation of all types of spiritual healing. Founded in the philosophy of a unified being, this treatment considers the body, the mind, the heart and the soul. This means that we cannot achieve the highest form of healing if we just focus on treating one part of our being. Another overarching principle of holistic healing is that we are the ultimate healers of ourselves. We need to be at the forefront of supporting ourselves because all external help is just secondary. Some of the popular types of holistic treatments are acupuncture, psychotherapy, massage, and chiropractic services. Notice that all of these approaches target not just a certain area of the body but the entire psyche. Just like the other types of spiritual healing, holistic healing aims to restore the balance of our overall health. As a final note, spiritual healing is not a shortcut you can take to change your life overnight. It is still a process, a gruelling one at that. Authentic spiritual healing challenges everyone to face his/her problems headstrong. If you turn a blind eye to the main cause of your struggles, it means that your attempt in spiritual healing has failed. To deny, to suppress and to ignore our problems is not healing. True spiritual healing comes from acknowledging your issues in life. No matter how many sessions of acupuncture or yoga you attend, all of these treatments will fall futile in the hands of a pretending person. It's like letting a doctor operate on you in blindfolds. Do not try to escape. Try to overcome. This is the only way to authentic spiritual healing. Are you practicing spiritual healing? Share your experience with us in the comments below!
