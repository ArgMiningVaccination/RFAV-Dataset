Kane MD, MPHA lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. Mark TwainBlood Hepatitis B immunization born into safety concerns in 1982 Plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine was a blood product AIDS discovered but cause not identified: bloodborne virus suspected Prominent doctors warned causative agent of AIDS may be in vaccine When HIV virus discovered it was quickly proven not to be in vaccine but damage was done until advent of DNA recombinant vaccine 1986 When DNA recombinant vaccine came onto market manufacturer used fear of contamination as marketing strategy vs competitorsSex, drugs, and a failed immunization strategy Hepatitis B is a sexually transmitted virus and most acute cases in industrial countries were transmitted by sex or needle sharing Initial recommendations for use of HBV \"high risk \" group strategy recommended immunization of sex workers, gay men, STI patients, and people with \"multiple partners \" (more than you) plus IVDU and other groups This strategy protected some individuals but failed to impact rates of disease and led to globally recommended strategy of universal infant immunization Many aspects of delivering vaccine to sexually active and drug using populations failed \"high risk \" strategy still primary strategy in Scandinavia and UKImmunizing older children and adolescents All countries National Immunization Programs good at reaching infants but reaching older children, adolescents, and adults is difficult Many countries tried to reach adolescents with HBV either as a primary target or parallel to infant immunization to speed immunity Adolescent programs saw similar issues to HPV issues we face now from the anti -vaccine community Giving adolescents \"permission to have sex \" Adolescents fainted especially in group immunization settings France stopped school based adolescent HBV immunization after a \"very bad morning \" of multiple psychogenic fainting episodes0 1,750 3,500 875 Kilometers Countries using Hepatitis B vaccine in national immunization schedule, 2012 No (6 countries [of which 3 given at adolescence] or 3%)Yes (181 countries or 93%) Yes (Risk groups) (7 countries or 4%)Not available Not applicable Source: WHO/UNICEF coverage estimates 2012 revision, July 2013 . 194 WHO Member States.

Picked up by anti -vaccine groups Political pressure led to Government suspension of the Adolescent Vaccination program and severe damage to infant program WHO and VHPB quickly convened an \"expert meeting \" to examine the evidence and issue it 's findings in the WHO WER Multiple studies done subsequently showed no association between MS and Hep B vaccine The damage to the French program persists to this day with very low rates of both infant and adolescent coverage. Infant coverage up with Hexavalent vaccine To this day French courts are awarding damages for MS caused by Hep B vaccine World Health Organization. Expanded programme on immunization.

Each child should be uniquely assessed for individual vaccine needs. Some children need delayed immunization or viral but not bacterial vaccines, or no vaccines at all, etc. Could not clearly explain criteria for making above decisionsAlternative Medicine and vaccine hesitancy What I learned (cont.) Diseases were going away anyway before immunization Good nutrition protects children against severe childhood infections Wild type infection is best vaccine Government and corporations (Big Pharma) lie to the public daily. Why believe them about vaccine safety, efficacy, and need? Giving parents permission to not vaccinate children is an important component of their business model and there is demand for this service Some young Naturopaths are concerned that their anti -vaccine position is hurting chances at being licensed in many states Seem most vulnerable to argument that they are not good citizens and taking advantage of parents who get their children immunized to protect children who are not One Naturopathic professional society has issued pro -vaccine recommendationsBaxter's Eight Factors in opposition to immunization (paraphrased) \"primum non nocera \" AEFI in healthy people especially children without consent less tolerated Rapid dissemination of information and misinformation in media, exacerbated in modern social media Willingness of respected doctors to give credence to AEFI hypotheses. Even if few, publicity is disproportionate Public perception of damaged children and emotional, media savvy, and often highly organized parents vs \"cold \" health officials spouting data Politicians joining forces with anti -vaccination groups Unavailability of scientific data to refute AEFI claims and theories at the time of the controversy. It may take months or years to conduct definitive research Complexity of arguments surrounding immunization cannot be explained in a three minute news slot (balance of risk and benefit, direct vs herd immunity, etc) Balance of media reporting does not reflect actual weight of data or opinion of professional community Baxter D ( 2014 ) Opposition to Vaccination and Immunisation the UK Experience -from economicus is a mythical consumer who makes absolutely rational decisions about his or her economic and medical care decisions Economists have realized that models based on this mythical creature are incorrect and that humans often do not make rational choices The recent US election is a good case in point Health education models such as KAP that assume that consumers are rational actors that just need proper information to change health behaviors are equally na\u00efve \"vaccine hesitancy \" behavior in many/most cases will not change when the individual is given what we believe to be \"correct information \" How do we navigate in a \"post -factual \" world? The Media Vaccine issues often covered by inexperienced reporters or reporters with an agenda Anti-vaccine groups very media savvy, often more so than health officials The sin of false equivalence. If someone claims the earth is flat the media gives both sides equal coverage. We have a new US president thanks partly to that. What we need to do Governments need to train immunization workers in how to respond to vaccine safety concerns to the public and the media Know the data. Explain AEFI data to media and public. Most AEFI concerns are not new and have been thoroughly disproved. Rapid response to alleged side effects Bold government defense of immunization programs. Be able to show benefits of immunization and costs of damaging program Workshops with key media before events occur.

Most allegations of AEFI are diseases of unknown or complex causes (MS, Guillian Barre, autism, chronic fatigue, pain syndromes, weakness) often neurologic, auto immune, or some combination. AEFI claims may severely damage programs before there is time to do research to disprove the claims Respected scientists making claims get disproportionate coverage from media and are used by anti -vaccine groups Thomas theorem: \"Ifmen define situations as real, they are real in their consequences \" \"Lifecan only be understood backwards ; but it must be lived forwards.\" -Soren Kierkegaard Public health is the art of making good decisions with incomplete informationMartin\u00f3n - Torres, GENVIP 2014 02000400060008000100001200014000160001800020000220002400026000280003000032000340003600038000400004200044000460004800050000520005400056000580006000062000640006600068000700007200074000760007800080000820008400086000880009000092000940009600098000100000 Ene Feb Mar Abr May Jun Jul Ago Sep Oct Nov Dic 50 - 60 adolescent s ( 9 - 18 years) per each 100.000 are yearly Ene Feb Mar Abr May Jun Jul Ago Sep nd dose 3 rd dose Gardasil\u00ae 50 - 60 adolescent s ( 9 - 18 years) per each 100.000 are yearly admitted with diabetes deb\u00fatThank You "}
