This includes universal laws and the fundamental principles of spiritual energy. You can't have energy healing and the wisdom that accompanies without the recognition of spirit, or subtle spiritual energy. This is because attaining self-realization, or any type of knowledge about metaphysics and energy, inherently involves the awareness of a 'higher' reality and power. When one engages in energy healing, they do so with the purpose of balancing the whole self, which means achieving unity and harmony between mind, body, emotions, spirit, and soul. The physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental planes are all designed to function as a unity- as an interconnected system. Spiritual energy, universal energy, divine energy, Source energy, subtle energy, or superconsciousness; they are all different words to describe and understand the same energy. To heal is to 'make whole', and this is something you need to know. Thus, energy healing is all about balancing, harmonizing, and integrating the different aspects of your being, so that you can become the best version of yourself. Self-mastery is the ultimate goal. Metaphysics signifies the abstraction of life and self. Everything abstract comes under the branch metaphysics, including concepts such as time, space, knowing, identity, being, and self-realization. Philosophy, in essence. The origins of creation and the universe are deemed metaphysics by many. But meta also translates as transcendence, we can transcend the perceived limitations of a 3-dimensional physical universe with the insights and philosophies of metaphysics. The key lies in the word 'perceived,' reality itself is an illusion; we are a range of thoughts, feelings, internal currents, emotions, beliefs, projections, and frequencies. Reality to one may be different to another. Metaphysics is intrinsic to energy healing (although not synonymous) as to heal oneself and transcend the limits of a purely physical reality, one must be prepared to look outside of it. One must 'go within to go without,' similar to the philosophy of 'as above so below.' Metaphysics is transcending the physical to reach heightened states of conscious, inner knowing and self-awareness. And a range of benefits, positive effects, and self-realizations can come about through this. Universal Laws This brings us onto the universal laws. The universal laws can be seen as fundamental focus points, or areas of insight and wisdom, for self-discovery and personal transformation. They're unchanging laws that are intuitively known and felt by many, regardless of race, sex/gender, sexuality, and other separating factors. \"Enlightenment,\" to find the light within and around- awaken to the divine purpose (in a nutshell!). The amount of universal laws there actually are is debatable, but the clue seems to lie in numerology and patterns found in natural cycles. Some say there are 7, a number associated with light and spirituality, whilst others suggest 12; the number of star signs, constellations in the sky, and main meridians in the body. In this book we will be looking at all 12 universal laws, and how each applies to energy healing. Let's do this now. 1. The Law of Divine Oneness This law is about the interconnectedness of all things. Everything is connected on some subtle level. You may call this subtlety the subconscious, angelic, spiritual, astral, ethereal, higher dimensional, or multidimensional plane, either way, subtle energy connects every living being on earth. It also connects the trees and non-human entities, both on and within planet earth and extending to the cosmos. If we look at a human or animal eye, for example, it will look like the universe or specific galaxy. The microcosm is the macrocosm. Every thought, feeling, emotion, action, and sensation is connected to- well, everything else! In terms of energy healing this implies that we can look to the divinity that connects us to ourselves, other humans, the planet and all sentient creatures, and both our inner world and outer world (the universe, macrocosm), for healing and growth. Self-awareness is key. Furthermore, if we're feeling disconnected, disempowered, or simply low and uninspired, reminding ourselves of the law of divine oneness will help us to reconnect to our true selves. 2. The Law of Vibration Vibration rules everything, all life on earth and the universe itself. The sound of creation, for example; 'Om,' is believed to be a unique and specific frequency that formed the universe. Sound and silence, being and emptiness, form and formlessness... everything exists as a vibratory frequency. This is why the human language has created a term which sounds familiar and resonates with us- vibes. We give off vibes just as we receive them. Thoughts, feelings, emotions, projections, and beliefs interact to create positive or negative experiences. Are we positively mirroring one another and treating everyone as a reflection? (Where growth, mutual respect and a sense of oneness are strong.) Or, are we projecting and allowing our unconscious fears and frustrations to ripple out and meet our mirrors, negatively? On a subatomic level, there is 99.9% empty space within each atom. This means the universe is essentially formless! It's our thoughts, emotions, and intentions that shape and create reality as we know it. 3. The Law of Correspondence This universal law states what was briefly shared above, that we're all mirrors of one another. But this doesn't just signify humans. It also relates to the way we mirror animals, plants, and the universe as a whole. Within is without, internal is external, and as above- so below. Patterns and cycles can be found in all of nature and within existence. In terms of energy healing, working with the various modes and channels for healing available will show you how life and being are cyclic. You may think you've learned a lesson, healed a pattern of thought or behavior, or transcended something contributing to your ill-health and imbalance, but then it will reshow itself in another time. The law of correspondence portrays the non-linear and cyclic nature of time. 4. The Law of Attraction The most well-known law, the law of attraction portrays the power of our thoughts and intentions. Manifestation, abundance, our ability to attract positive experiences in harmony with our higher self- and our best lives- and everything related to positive manifestation are associated here. Focus on what you want, and you shall receive! (In short.) This is the basis. But, there needs to be a level of self-mastery and control in order to receive what your heart desires. And this is the key- heart and higher self, spirit. Is what you're seeking in alignment with your heart, the space of unconditional love, self-love, and compassion, and your higher self and mind; the part of self that is connected to cosmic consciousness, spiritual awareness and the divine? Focusing every day on manifesting an expensive car or winning the lottery might not produce results, yet putting your energy and attention into manifesting perfect health, healing and recovery from addictions or limiting beliefs, may just change your life. 5. The Law of Inspired Action Actionable steps and conscious action are what's needed next to the law of attraction. It's not enough to simply think and attract, you need to take the steps towards success and achievement. Life involves dualities and polar opposites, 'yin and yang,' for example; passivity and action, feminine and masculine, and receptivity and assertiveness. Together they create unity, balance, and wholeness, yet without both there would be missing ingredients to creation. The law of inspired action implies we need to slow down, be in stillness and silence, and create a space internally for manifestation. 'Go within to go without,' but when the intentions have been set and the space created, we must take action. Linked to this is the ability to surrender, surrender to the flow and abundance of the universe. Releasing control is important, as this allows for new opportunities and inspiration we may not have previously foresaw. 6. The Law of Perpetual Transmutation Energy Evolution is constant. Everything is always evolving, shifting, and changing. Our own cells regenerate completely every 7 years while every aspect of creation goes through a perpetual and constant state of change. On an energetic level, things are transmuted all the time and some of it we don't even see. This law can help us understand the mind-body-spirit connection better. Every action is preceded by a thought and every thought has the power to create an action. If our physical health isn't up to par, our mental, emotional, and spiritual health will suffer too. If we have issues with the way we think, feel and attempt to connect to a spiritual reality our physical bodies will struggle to cope, which results in ill-health. Everything is interconnected and energy healers and practitioners recognize this, hence why they attempt to heal on the subtle and energetic (ethereal, astral, and spiritual) planes of being as well. 7. The Law of Cause and Effect Every action has a consequence, quite simply. Karma is linked here. What goes around comes around... We often hold onto things that we are completely unconscious of. Some examples of how this manifests in the healing journey is not realizing, not being conscious of the fact, how past actions and beliefs still affect us on an energetic level. Perhaps you were once in a position of power and misused that power? At a later stage in life, someone treats you in a less than favorable way and you feel disempowered, yet you ponder why this experience is happening. The event causes stress and anxiety, mild depression and potentially even health issues like insomnia or weight loss or gain, but you still can't put your finger on why this is happening. 'I don't deserve this.' 'I'm a kind and genuine person.' 'I've already healed my karma!' A lesson may present itself 6 months, 4 years, or 12 years down the line- time doesn't matter to karmic laws and the law of cause and effect. Every action has a ripple. Interconnectedness links here once more. Also, on an internal level this law relates to the feelings and emotions you experience, such as the vibration and frequency of anger or resentment. Feeling jealousy, rage or resentment at someone's successes or wins (someone who hasn't caused any harm to you!) ultimately manifests as you attracting that experience, and further closing yourself off to the same level of fame, prestige, abundance, or accomplishment. Treat others how you wish to be treated, in short. What you put or project out may not come back to you in the moment or instantly, but it will come back. 8. The Law of Compensation At this stage, it's important to know that all the universal laws are tied in closely to one another. We can see similarities and links or bridges between many of the individual laws. This one corresponds with the laws of attraction and correspondence. You reap what you sow! 9. The Law of Relativity Comparison is actually a man-made concept. In reality, the true reality of divine oneness, everything is neutral. Things exist with its polarity and opposite, yet the ultimate goal is always unity and harmony. Yang and yin, light and dark, masculine and feminine, good and bad/evil, shine and shadow, win and lose... there is a lesson and teaching in everything and a chance for unity. Relativity comes down to our perspective and perception- how we choose to perceive things and interact with our physical world. When we compare without specific intentions (such as to help us evolve or provide a framework for learning and transformation, self-betterment etc.) we create a polarity and divide within, we create the reality of lack, loss, or disappointment- never having enough or being content, or seeing the lesson and blessing in the situation. It disempowers us so we can't take control of our own lives, further leading to the disconnection from self. If you are always comparing yourself to others how are you able to connect to the law of divine oneness, vibration, or attraction? 10. The Law of Polarity This has already been covered. (Yin and yang etc.) 11. The Law of Rhythm Cycles and natural patterns found within our bodies, within the planet, and within the universe. Seasons are an example of this law and women have moon cycles, aka periods. Emotions and inner currents come under the law of rhythm. How we feel on a daily and cyclic basis, how we honor our emotions and need for rest, work and play; basically, balance on all levels. The earth has cycles too and everything that occurs on the microcosm can be reflected in the macrocosm, and vice versa. Music and sound are healing, so this is something you can incorporate in correspondence with this law. 12. The Law of Gender Finally, gender is referring to the masculine and feminine energy within everything, man and woman, the universe, subtle energy etc. Being a man or woman has nothing to do with masculine and feminine energy, although it is true that men are primarily masculine in nature and women are more feminine. In the 21st Century, we've seen a rise in people identify as non-binary, transgender, or actually having sex changes. Some people say it's society and all the confusion and mixed messages coming from a consumerist global economy and society. Others may suggest a more natural and evolution-compatible theory. In truth, both are true or at least have the potential to be true, and this is a paradox in itself. Duality and polarity run through all of life! If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration. ~Nikola Tesla Vibration & Frequency So, hopefully you already have a basic understanding on how energy healing works based on the 12 Universal Laws. Everything exists as vibration and frequency. Familiarizing yourself with the Universal Laws is a great way to start your journey to healing and wholeness. The etheric and astral bodies Energy healing involves working with your ethereal (etheric) and astral bodies. The etheric body is also known as the ether. It is an energetic replica or blueprint of the physical body and lies just above the physical body, a couple of inches extending outwards. It is in your etheric body where all illness and disease are said to arise. This is because it is through the ether where you are connected to your spiritual and astral bodies, and it is here, in the spiritual and subtle planes of existence, where distortion and imbalance arise. Your etheric body connects your physical body to the astral body and subsequently spiritual realm through a cord. Energy healing works primarily through the ether, your etheric body. Although subtle energy healing can be given as a hands-on treatment whereby the practitioner or master physically places their hands on the body, a lot of energy blockages are removed by working on the etheric plane. With regards to your astral body, the astral plane is closely linked to your subconscious and it is here where all of your thoughts, feelings, emotions, and beliefs originate and arise. The astral body can be seen as the gateway to the spiritual body, spiritual dimensions, subtle- energetic realms of being, and the etheric body closest to physical being. People who can sense things above and beyond the five physical senses, including those who are psychic and clairvoyant, are very connected to their astral body and the astral planes. Energy healing stimulates this connection and can make one more open to receiving wisdom, insight, and guidance through the astral and spiritual planes. The best and most simple way to visually present this is through the following diagram. Physical body: This is the very physical and tangible body you reside in. It is responsible for holding all sensory data and information and interacting with your emotional and mental bodies. During meditation, chi stimulates this process as does healing energy. Your physical body is essentially a transmitter and receiver of all information coming in from the mental, emotional, astral, and spiritual planes. Etheric body: Your etheric body is located just above and beyond your physical body and creates a cord between the physical and the astral. This body can be seen as an energetic blueprint for the physical, it is a subtle replica. It transmits data and sensory info including information about your health and the vibratory state of health of each of your subtle bodies. If you are suffering with physical ailments, healing can be given to your etheric body and the effects ripple downwards (into your physical). Astral body: This body is the plane to the subconscious and spiritual aspects and dimensions of being. Key insights into your beliefs, feelings and emotions, thoughts and deepest desires are transmitted through your astral body. It is also the plane and body where astral travel and astral projection are possible. Your astral body is a gateway to higher consciousness, spirit or the divine, and your spiritual body. Spiritual body: This is a direct link to soul, the great spirit, the divine, higher or cosmic (and the consciousness, and the angelic & light realms. Everything above and beyond Spiritual our 3-dimensional human reality can be experienced and accessed here. It is a planes...)bridge between the human and the divine. We can look at healing systems like Reiki to understand energy healing deeper. We dedicate a section to this later, but for now, Dr Mikau Usui received his healing gifts from spirit. He meditated and fasted to a point of transcendental awareness and evolved, heightened consciousness. Dr Mikau Usui spent 21 days on a mountain attempting to receive enlightenment, and his experience not only shows the power of subtle and spiritual energy but also how we can access it. Meditation and fasting are two powerful routes to cleansing and purification, purification of mind, body & spirit. His physical body and therefore mind were open to the subtle and energetic forces of the universe, so he became an open channel. Quite simply, his physical being was lighter- he was able to hold and embody more light. This is very important when learning about the etheric and astral planes and bodies. As mind, body, emotions, and spirit are all intrinsically connected, cleansing your physical body and engaging in acts of purification also cleanses and purifies your mental body, emotional body, and spiritual body. A fast or detox can lighten you and connect you (naturally) to the more subtle expressions of being. And it is here where all psychic and spiritual phenomena and the ability to perceive subtle energy arises. It may sound like the simplest and most child-like analogy, but simply picture a feather next to a stone. Of course, the feather will rise and be lifted more easily with a mildly forceful gush of wind. Nature's breeze will allow the feather to float and even move around, whilst the stone will remain still and stuck. Natural energy can be seen as nature's breeze! The Higher Self ('Higher Mind') The higher self or higher mind is the divine spark within us. It is connected in a high energy vibrational form- or a higher vibration- connected to and in tune with the universe, God, Spirit, or Source; the source of the universe. Through our own spiritual development, we can raise our vibrations to access a higher state of consciousness, bringing us closer to Source (the divine Spirit) and dissolving resistance to the flow of the Universal Laws. The Higher Self is sometimes called the Higher Mind and is opposite to the Lower Self and Mind. The most effective way to understand the Higher Self is through the table below. The Shadow Self is the part of human nature often considered as impure, dark, or undesirable. It is the things we repress, deny, or choose to prefer not to accept. Sexuality and lust usually come under the Shadow Self's domain, as do fame, power, wealth, and success (when abused and out of balance). Yet, the Shadow Self is a route to higher consciousness and the ability to know thyself. We are holistic, multi-dimensional, and primal beings, we are not just beings of light floating around on the astral or spiritual planes. We have basic needs, survival instincts, desires and a human body. We also have an ego and a psyche. In this respect, accepting and integrating elements of your Shadow Self can lead to the things you may originally think can only be attained by suppressing the Shadow, and focusing solely on the light. Just like yin and yang, one of the fundamental Universal Laws, we are governed by both day and night, sunshine and the moon's rays, and light and dark. Something may be seen as dark due to its feminine or yin- like nature, but it doesn't mean it is 'bad.' The same is true for the ego, the ego is essential as we wouldn't get anything done without it driving our everyday human existence. It just needs to be balanced. Another key point regarding the Higher Self and Universal Laws is the significance of resistance. If one thinks too hard about whether this action or that is going to create abundance in our lives, we may create resistance which actually hinders the flow of abundance. It is like a universal paradox which, again, is deeply connected to the energies of yin and yang- the power of yin being a receptive and feminine quality/force which magnetizes things to you. There is a wise saying, \"what we resist persists,\" this implies that there is an element of surrendering to the process needed in all manifesting and spiritual intentions, including healing. Furthermore, God/the universe/Source created us with free will, so we are free to make life choices and learn valuable life lessons in each incarnation on Earth. These choices may, in reality, make it harder or easier to slip into the effortless flow of abundance, but the key is to attune to and align with the Higher Self as best as possible. This way, we act, think, feel, and perceive from a space of spiritual awareness, divine guidance and intuition; logic, reason, and rationality; imaginative and creative thought, empathy, compassion, and morality. Also, being in tune with our higher selves allows us to transcend and evolve past any limiting beliefs, excessive primal desires and urges, and unhealthy or afflictive emotions (which come with a disconnection from the higher mind) and further raise our vibration. Finally, when a soul self chooses a body, it makes a conscious choice to experience life on earth with specific parents, family, and other members of a soul group. An individual soul agrees to experience certain life events in order to learn and develop spiritually, thus becoming closer to God/Spirit/Source. This can only occur when we are in tune with the Higher Self and Mind. The Higher Self and the Soul When this vast planetary exploration began, souls coming to Earth knew they were connected to Source. However, as lifetime after lifetime progressed, souls' vibrations lowered, and they became removed from their connection to Source. It became harder to retain and recall the connection with each re-incarnation and eventually souls forgot their connection soon after the point of incarnation. A new-born baby, for example, may sometimes appear to have a wise face, and look older than his or her years. This is because at the point of birth a new-born infant is closer to Source, therefore retains trace memories or echoes of a previous life. Essentially, the soul has just been existing and experiencing life on another plane, and most likely directly on or very close to the angelic, ascended masters or light deities/beings' planes. This is where the higher self is most strong- the higher self acts as a bridge to advanced and evolved portals of consciousness. As souls experiencing life on Earth forgot their connection to Source, we felt isolated and fearful. Energy healing can restore that connection so that we can again feel supported and secure in the knowledge that we are not alone. Learning to connect with both our higher selves and shadow selves is one step towards wholeness and overcoming blocks or fears. The Power of the Mind A common misinterpretation of the Law of Attraction and other universal laws, including how to utilize the Higher Self and all the magic it brings, is that we can simply think ourselves into perfect health, abundance, or success. Thinking alone is not enough, and neither is wishing (faith/hope). We need to both set our intentions and create the space, and then surrender and be receptive. Yin and yang are both necessary- feminine energy of surrender and receptivity, magnetism and passivity and masculine energy of action. In saying this, the mind is powerful, and this shouldn't go overlooked. There are yogis, self-mastered beings, and spiritual gurus or experts who can use their minds for instant manifestation. This is due to them operating (vibrating) at a much higher frequency, through years of self-development and healing, wisdom acquisition and self-mastery. Their consciousness is advanced; therefore, manifestation occurs at a rapid rate compared to non-evolved or self-mastered humans. They are closer to Source and Spirit, and one specific gift of this is the power of healing. Healing hands and healing presence, being able to heal themselves (and others) because life force energy flows through their hands and bodies effortlessly, strongly, and powerfully. In other words, they have done the 'inner work' and their minds are attuned to a divine and higher reality, where spiritual healing energy is strong and frequent. They're gifted with the power of thought. They're also at one with the universal energies within around. How does this relate to the mind and the higher self? Everything stems back to the mind and higher self; they are the source of consciousness and the root of creation. We can see the truth in this when we look at how much suffering and discord arises when we're disconnected from the higher self. Energy Healing with the Higher Self and Shadow Self An intrinsic part to energy healing, working with subtle energy, and getting in tune with all of your bodies; your emotions, mind, body, and spirit, is to reach a state of inner acceptance. Your shadow self is equally as important to embrace and heal as your higher self. As we explore in the next chapter, kundalini energy is the balance and harmony of all of the 7 main chakras, and the chakras need to have a free flow of energy, be unblocked and balanced and be 'healthy' for both the lower self and higher self. If there are blocks in your lower chakras there will be issues with your sexuality, creativity, and emotions. All aspects of sensuality and primality will be negatively affected. When there are blocks and problems in your higher chakras, you are less able to connect to your higher self and mind. When there is a free flow of energy through the chakra system, however, your kundalini is activated and awake, which leads to spiritual enlightenment, healing, and inner balance. One is more able to access their higher self and feel comfortable within their shadow self with an open kundalini. (More on kundalini and chakras soon!) The shadow self is also called one's shadow personality, it is the personality traits that are seen as dark, impure, or even dirty- undesirable, and something that should be repressed. Repression and suppression of desires, emotions, feelings, and basic human needs often come under the shadow self. This usually happens when one awakens to their spiritual self, so on a path of spiritual awakening or illumination. The opposite is of course true for most of us- with all of the illusions and conditionings within society we often stay disconnected from the higher self and mind. Society and the constant distractions aim to keep us in a state of separation. We actually go into detail about the various ways to connect with your higher self and third eye in 'Third Eye Awakening.' But, for now, let's look at the most significant factors keeping us separated from our higher selves and how we can overcome them. Higher Self disconnection, and how to overcome it 1. Processed and artificial foods Processed and artificial foods keep us stuck in a state of heaviness, taking away from our lightness. Divine light, spiritual illumination and being able to see clearly come with embodying more light, and therefore eat less dense and heavy foods. Artificial chemicals, preservatives, additives, and sweeteners are another major contributing factor to disconnection from the higher self and mind. They prevent us from accessing our full potential and self-awareness from the effect they have on the brain, body, and emotional body. It is true that the best diet is a mainly plant-based and organic diet- wholefoods, like nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, beans and pulses, legumes, brown rice, and wholewheat breads and pastas. Also, lean white meats, fish, and seafood over red meat and fatty bacon. Food choices are the number 1 thing that can connect or disconnect us from our higher selves. Diet influences everything, internally from the way we think and feel, to the way we project our inner mood and vibration externally onto others and into our relationships, career, and ability to manifest prosperity or success. The body is a holistic system and there are unfortunately so many artificial, chemical and preservative laden, and dense, fatty or sugar-ridden foods with little to no nutritional value. The higher mind needs to be an open channel. It needs to be pure and clean, clear with a healthy flow of chi (life force), and with its chakras and kundalini open or at least open to health and healing. Certain foods calcify and pollute our pineal glands, the pineal gland being a very important gland responsible for hormone regulation and the ability to connect to the third eye chakra; the seat of vision and awareness. If you want to make the necessary changes transition to a plant-based vegan or vegetarian diet. The other option is the Mediterranean diet for non-vegetarians. Follow these two options strictly and you will notice how much lighter you feel, thus enabling you to heal yourself and embody more light and spiritual awareness. 2. Calcified pineal gland Linked to diet is the calcification of the pineal gland. The pineal gland is literally shaped as a pinecone and it's responsible for the reception and transmission of light. Without light energy, aka 'life force energy' (remember the power of Sun-gazing, reduced technological interference, and natural sunlight for sleep which leads to melatonin production) we suffer in many ways- some of it more obvious and some less seen. The below the surface, unseen elements of a calcified pineal gland can lead to depression, mood swings, irrational thinking, chaotic emotions, spiritual disconnection, insomnia, a lack of melatonin, being uninspired creatively and imaginatively, and anxiety. These of course all manifest on the surface. The best way to decalcify (purify & cleanse) your pineal gland is through the diet tips shared above, and by getting regular exercise and sunlight. Sungazing is a powerful method too while engaging in psychic and intuition development exercises strengthen your third eye chakra, which in turn heals your pineal gland. 3. Too much television and technological interference Technological evolution is inevitable in this new age. It is man's nature to seek ways to 'better' ourselves and develop in the fields of intellect, technology, and science. Yet this simultaneously has some arguably catastrophic effects on our consciousness. Blue light is emitted from devices like smartphones, laptops and iPads. Blue light is incredibly harmful for our eyes and retinas. But blue light isn't all we have to be worried "}
