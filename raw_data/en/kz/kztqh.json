The belief of crystal healing is that these crystals and gemstones possess energy, which can help with healing and drawing out negative energy. They literally come from the Earth and have been heated and cooled inside the core of Earth. Each one of these crystals and gemstones carry their own properties which help with different things. While this can be healing, it can also be used for help in your personal life as well. A lot of people believe that these crystals don't put out energy and that they're just a placebo effect, but if you believe in something enough and it helps you, isn't it worth trying? You can even let the stone choose you by finding the one you seem most attracted to. When you first get your stone, make sure to cleanse your stone and then you speak your intentions into it. Below you will see the most widely used crystals and gemstones, along with what they are used for. Most Popular Crystals Amethyst Amethyst is so popular because it is the most useful all-purpose healing crystal. It can help with stress, irritability, mood & anxiety, and can help with anyone who is struggling with themselves. Many might even know Amethyst for its role in your party life. Amethyst helps prevent drunkenness and even can help cure your hangover. Amethyst provides you with a shield of Light around your body, keeping you from any negative energy. Amethyst also helps with enhancing one's creativity and passion, bringing focus and success. It's even been known to help strengthen your immune system. Rose Quartz Rose Quartz is known as the stone of love. This not only symbolizes romantic love, but also unconditional love and self-love. It can help guide you in the midst of an argument or a fight by helping you see the other person's perspective and truly deepening you and your partners connection. Back Story: It's believed that Rose Quartz received its color when Aphrodites, the Goddess of Love, tried to save her lover, Adonis, as he was dying. As they both bled over the clear quartz, it turned the color pink and the stain is meant to represent eternal love. Citrine Citrine is known as the Success Stone, bringing wealth and abundance to those who use it. Citrine can also be used for your creative process by activating your imagination. This would be a good stone for anyone who is trying to get pregnant, as the stone promotes sexual and creative fertility. You can place the citrine in your bedroom, office, or in a child's bedroom. Aquamarine Aquamarine is believed to have been the treasure of mermaids and it is meant to reconnect us to water. If you are feeling overwhelmed, this may be a good stone for you. It's best to wear aquamarine as a necklace, close to your heart. Some believe it even has anti-aging properties and can rejuvenate your complexion. Celebrities Who Swear by Their Crystals Adele \"I was so nervous about my comeback show and I was panicking. I was out of practice and I was busy being a Mum. But it was one of the best shows I've ever done and I had these bloody crystals in my hand ... Then the Grammys came and I lost my f****** crystals! I had a gig two or three days before them and I think I left them at this venue. It turned out to be the worst, most disastrous performance that I have ever done. Well, apart from one really early on when I was doing a gig in Angel and I got so drunk I fell off my chair. But I got some new crystals now and everything's been going well.\" \u2014 [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/tv/1094221/adele-believes-in-healing-crystals-and-blames-disastrous-grammys-performance-on-losing-them/), March 2016 Katy Perry \"I don't stay single for long. I carry a lot of rose quartz, which attracts the male. Maybe I need to calm it down with amethyst.\" \u2014 [Cosmopolitan](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a25879/katy-perry-july-2014-cosmo-cover/), July 2014 Miranda Kerr \"You may have read in some press articles that when I'm asked what's in my handbag ... I often mention a crystal wand or a Rose Quartz crystal. My crystal wand is incredibly special to me, and is one of my most cherished items. It's made of Clear Quartz and is studded with Rose Quartz. Clear Quartz is a great stone for gathering, directing and transmitting energy ... it can also transform negative energy into positive energy, and Rose Quartz is a wonderful stone to heal and protect the heart, balance emotions, release stress and tension, and encourage love and self-esteem. Crystals can be used in many different methods of healing. In addition to using on a specific area of the body, or on Chakras points to locate blockages to cleanse and heal them, they can also be used in massage. Massaging the body with a crystal helps to release tension from the body, while at the same time the stone's healing energy is transferred to the body. I hold my crystal during meditation, prayer, deep belly breathing, and use it to infuse my Luxurious Rosehip Body Oil with positive vibrations prior to a massage. I also sleep with it nearby so I'm constantly receiving its special healing energies.\" \u2014 [KORA Organics](http://www.koraorganics.com/us/blog/healing-energy/), February 2015 References: Palermo, E. 2017.
