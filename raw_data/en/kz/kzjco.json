The CDC says you should get a flu shot by the end of October, as it takes about two weeks after the vaccination for you to be protected through the coming flu season. However, it only protects against the 3 or 4 strains in the current vaccine. You may still be exposed to other flu strains or viruses that could result in you suffering from respiratory issues. For those of us with asthma, COPD, etc, who have weakened immune systems, additional effort has to be made to protect ourselves, as the flu can result in hospitalization or worse. Please remember that I am not a healthcare professional and that I am only sharing how I use essential oils for my personal use. This essential oil blend is a 25% dilution rate. It is intended for SHORT TERM USE ONLY for acute health conditions. If you are new to essential oil use, or have concerns about using that strong of a blend, use the 5% blend directions. This is also for SHORT TERM USE ONLY. DO NOT USE THIS BLEND ON CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 16. If your child is sick, here is an excellent post with information about what oils are safe for children.: [Essential Oils and Children](https://www.usingeossafely.com/essential-oils-and-children/) I made this blend up last fall two years ago and used it when needed for additional immunity support. I still developed colds and respiratory issues even after having a flu shot, but nothing serious enough to have to be hospitalized. I have included links to the essential oils and supplies I use at the end of this post so that you can see exactly what I use. There is additional information about each of the oils on that link, too. Essential Oil \"Flu Shot\" - 15 drops Thrive essential oil blend (On Guard or Thieves can be substituted) - 15 drops Lemon essential oil - 15 drops Oregano essential oil - 10 drops Tea Tree essential oil - 2 tsp Fractionated coconut oil TO USE Combine oils in a 10 ml glass roller bottle and roll a small amount onto the bottom of the feet daily. I like to roll a little on the middle of my chest for the additional aromatherapy benefit. If you are sick, apply this blend every 2 hrs. Essential Oil \"Flu Shot\" 5% Blend - 3 drops Thrive essential oil blend (On Guard or Thieves can be substituted) - 3 drops Lemon essential oil - 3 drops Oregano essential oil - 2 drops Tea Tree essential oil - 2 tsp Fractionated coconut oil Germ Prevention It's imperative during the cold and flu season to make sure to wash hands several times a day and avoid touching the face. Wipe shopping cart handles with sanitizing wipes. Eat healthy foods rich in vitamins and get plenty of rest! Supplementing with Vitamin C and D is helpful, too. I also diffuse different combinations of the oils that I talked about in [this](https://haphazardhomemaker.com/2018/09/18/essential-oil-diffuser-blends-for-colds-flu/) post.
