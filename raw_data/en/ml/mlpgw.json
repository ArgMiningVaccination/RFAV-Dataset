The permit holder is asking the State Board to approve a third permit renewal for this project. This project was approved November of 2017 to establish a 12-station ESRD facility at a cost of approximately $2.4 million. The project has been obligated, and the original completion date is December 2018. The permit holders are asking for an August 31st, 2021, completion date in order to receive CMS certification and prepare and submit the final cost report to the State Board. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Mike. Now, if we can have -- let's see. I don't think we ever swore in the participants from Provident Dialysis Center.

CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Paula. Okay. You guys can please proceed with your statement to the Board. MS. PATEL: Good morning. My name is Amee Patel. I'm CON counsel for Provident Hospital. I wanted to just first start out by thanking Mike and the staff for preparing the State Agency Report. And, Mike, just to reiterate that there was a discrepancy on the State Agency Report. It related to obligation date. We have obligated the project December 21st of 2019, and we are now asking for an eight-month renewal. So I will turn it over to Dr. Sumter to give you the details on the status of the project as it stands right now. DR. SUMTER: Thank you. And I want to thank everybody for letting us at Cook County Health to come before the Board to present for the extension of this project for the Provident Dialysis Center.

We are focusing on -- there are several things that we are focusing on, one which is social determinants of health for our community, transition from treatment of disease to prevention of diseases, healthcare education and transformation from medical care to health and wellness care for our patients in our community. As part of that to help present our transformation and all the things I just mentioned Provident Dialysis Center becomes a critical piece for us. We have many patients out there that are end-stage renal disease patients, and what we have done -- (Audio interruption.) CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. Please proceed. DR. SUMTER: What we want to do with the Provident Dialysis Center, which is a 12-chair dialysis center, we want to have an impact in the community. We are aware there are some things that came up in the project. We now have more of a project management involved in this. We're working on it to make sure we focus that thisTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 15 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 doesn't happen again with the overrun, making sure that we provide better estimates of what the true cost is going to be as we continue to move forward with the projects that we have, as we continue to focus on the community, again, the underserved and uninsured community that we serve. So currently before you is our request to extend this to August 31, 2021. Where we are in the project now, we're at the stage where the construction is completed. We're waiting on final completion of ADA requirements for the bathroom, and then we'll get our inspection from IDPH to come and take a look at it to make sure it's ADA compliant. What we have budgeted and what we have forecast is where we believe we're going to end up, you know, barring anything that comes from the inspector that comes out and sees anything else. Everything is in place; all the chairs are in there; everything else has been tested, ready to go. We just need to get past this hurdle with coming in for the ADA piece and then bring the first patient in so that we can make sure that we meet the requirements of CMS.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 16 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Subject to any questions that you may have.

MEMBER KAATZ: I'd like to ask, what's the reason behind the cost overrun? DR. SUMTER: Great question. What happened is -- there are a number of things. One, of course, we had some delays with the COVID coming in. The other thing is there are a few things that were not anticipated in it. This is long before I came here to take over the capital projects and working with Earl Manning, who is also on here. There are a few things that were oversight looking at the dialysis center, and it was the first to really set up a dialysis center that missed a few things from a clinical standpoint, and there are some things which we're making sure that is not the case going forward. MEMBER KAATZ: Thanks for your candor. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Any other questions by Board members or State Board staff?

So we're talking about 2 1/2 days -- years from -- so you're saying everything, all the construction is finished, and you're just waiting for IDPH inspection. Did I hear that correctly? DR. SUMTER: That is correct. We're waiting on -- they're finishing up, you know, putting tile in the bathroom to make sure it meets ADA-compliant, those type things, but then IDPH would come back out and inspect to make sure it's ADA-compliant, and that's what we're waiting on. MEMBER MURRAY: And have you been in communication with the State? Are they going to be able to do that in a reasonable time, or are they bogged down with other issues? DR. SUMTER: I have personally been in touch with the inspector that came out and took a look at that, and his response to me as soon as we get it complete, call him and he will come back out. So we believe that it will be in a reasonable time period. MEMBER MURRAY: Like regular calendar time, not government time? DR. SUMTER: I mean, yes. MS.

With the vaccine distribution, who knows. So I think we're kind of building a little bit of a cushion. We could potentially finish much earlier than eight months. DR. SUMTER: Absolutely correct. We want to make sure that we have enough time so we don't have to come back to the Board again. We want to make sure that everything is covered in that time period. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Very good. I do have a question. Could you please provide us updated information regarding any plans to establish a management or partnership agreement associated with the dialysis center? DR. SUMTER: Yes, I certainly can. What we're doing is with like any organization we get professional services to help us with new programs that we're bringing on board. We at Cook County Health remain in control of all that; we just bring in a professional service to help us with that, make sure we meet the requirements, compliance, and everything that goes through that.

Morris Hospital is requesting a declaratory ruling from the State Board regarding the alteration of Permit No. 18-033. A declaratory motion allows the State Board to make determinations on various matters relating to permits and the applicability of the statute and regulations. State Board declaratory rulings relate to the issue at hand only and are not applicable to any other projectsTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 22 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 or permits of the State Board. Permit No. 18-033 approved the modernization of Morris Hospital at a cost of approximately $36 million. The hospital is now asking the Board to decrease the approved total gross square footage of the permit by approximately 29 percent from 56,000 gross square feet to 40,000 gross square feet and reduce the cost by approximately 17 percent from 36 million to 30 million. The Hospital has stated the financial impact of COVID-19 has resulted in the need to scale back this permit. The issue at hand for the State Board, the State Board rules do not allow a decrease in the total gross square foot by more than 5 percent. The hospital is asking the State Board to waive that requirement in this instance. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Mike. Are there people here from Morris Hospital & Healthcare Center? Oh, one moment. Okay.

The hospital has stated the financial impact of COVID-19 has resulted in the need to scale back this permit. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Mike. Okay.

PATEL: Okay. Well, again, I wanted to thank Mike, the staff for preparing this report. We came in on two items. One is the declaratory ruling which really detailed the history of -- I guess the rules history on the decrease over -- of gross square footage over the 5 percent. And, you know, I appreciate you-all reading that and taking the time to kind of work your way through that. With this alteration there are two issues. One is the scope of the project has changed substantially in regard to more of the nonclinical space. And they had originally started this project in a few phases. They've completed certain phases, which I'll allow Jim to speak to, and thereby there has also been a qualitative decrease in gross square footage, and that puts us really into the question of what needs to be decided. It is definitely over the 5 percent. I think the State Agency Report has 29 percent, but cost is also on track of a decrease. Jim, do you want to give us the specifics of what phases we've completed and the other items that we may at some point modify?Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 31 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MR. YOUNG: Yes. I just wanted to start with kind of the history. 10 years ago we were offered land to build a replacement, considered it, it was $240 million, and that would hurt our financial ability to continue to provide healthcare. So then we looked at a $180 million addition with the same result. So finally we decided on a $106 million renovation, and we submitted that which met our pre-COVID financial constraints. So we're asking you today to -- (audio distortion) THE COURT REPORTER: Mr. Young, I can't hear you right now. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Hold on. Whoever was just speaking, we really need -- the interference is coming Tom Dohm's phone or whatever he's on because there's all that background noise. So can you try to mute yourself?

MARK: If you would, I can present some of Tom's information. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: That would be excellent. MR. MARK: Okay. And first, let me apologize that you can't see me. I'm not hiding; I just can't figure out how to turn on the video. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: That's okay. MR. MARK: And this is information that the hospital has provided to us. The primary reason for the reduction in the scope of work is due to the impact of the COVID pandemic on Morris Hospital and by implication, by carryover on the project itself. Since February 2020, the hospital has experienced an 11 percent reduction in net patient revenue over 2019. Inpatient admission, surgery, outpatient visits were 23 to 25 percent below February through November 2020. The hospital -- and I've been working with this hospital for many years. They're a fiscally conservative institution to protect themselves as well as, you know, the residents of Grundy County. They are the only hospital in Grundy County. It is a community hospital, but they also have 25 remoteTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 33 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 healthcare centers. So it's quite an important entity to the residents of that county. And in order to protect the health of the hospital, the financial health, they are asking the Board, they have determined that it would be responsible to limit the scope of work, and they're asking the Board to approve this alteration. It's important to note that in this original project that the highest priority items, those major clinical service items have been completed to date, and those include the relocation, expansion, modernization of the emergency department, relocation/expansion of cardiodiagnostics, modernization of cath lab, a new nonsurgical prep recovery area, renovation/expansion of diagnostic imaging, development of a dedicated women's diagnostic center, relocation and expansion of an infusion therapy center, the modernization of its lobby, and major infrastructure improvements. Now, those have all been completed. What we are now asking the Board to approve is the elimination from the CON project of specific other components of the project, and these include OR support areas which have been defined as limitedTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 34 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 renovation of staff support, renovation of nuclear medicine. Those services are already in place, and they will remain in place, so the elimination of that as part of the project does not affect clinical service. And the other key components we're asking to eliminate at this point in time are the hospital administrative office space and staff education and conference space. So a vast majority of the space, the scope of work we're asking to eliminate at this point in time is what the Board defines as nonreviewable space, nonclinical service areas, and those two clinical service areas that are being affected are -- will not affect the ongoing clinical services of those areas. And I'll respond to any questions as well as I can, as well as I'm able. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Jeff. Does the Board or the State Board staff have any questions? (No response.)

CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Did anyone think of any other questions? MEMBER LeGRAND: I do.

CONSTANTINO: Thank you, Madam Chair. DaVita is asking the State Board to approve a 12-station ESRD facility in approximately 7,000 gross square feet of leased space at a cost of approximately $4 and a half million. The expected completion date is December 31st, 2022, and DaVita is before you today asking for an extension of the review period until the May 4th, 2021, State Board meeting. This deferral requires a Board deferral because an applicant may not defer initial consideration of an application to a meeting that is scheduled more than six months from the date the application was deemed complete. This application was deemed complete on July 31st, 2020. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Mike. Okay. Anne, if you would like to proceed with your statement. MS. COOPER: My name is Anne Cooper, and I'm counsel for DaVita. On behalf of DaVita we're asking the Board to defer consideration of Sauganash Dialysis so it can analyze the December 31, 2020, ESRD utilization that was received from Board staffTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 40 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 last week. Since this application was filed last summer, utilization at Sauganash geographic service area has flattened, so they'd like additional time to analyze this new data to see if that trend is continuing. I would also like to note the reason we're asking to defer to May is because of the upcoming Mercy Hospital & Medical Center discontinuation application that will be heard in February, and we understand that that Board meeting is probably going to be very full with that project, so we just out of courtesy to the Board would like to go to May just to not clog that agenda up even further with this project. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you, Anne. Do the Board members or the State Board staff have any questions for this applicant? MEMBER KAATZ: I do, Madam Chairman. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. MEMBER KAATZ: I don't understand why, number one, you don't just consider filing a new certificate of need for the May meeting. Your data, your numbers are going to be probably not asTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 41 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 accurate as you would want them to be. And unless I'm missing something, the Board has already ruled on the discontinuation of Mercy Hospital, so that should have -- that should have nothing to do with your volume estimates. MS. COOPER: No, no, I meant just because Mercy will probably take three to four hours like it did in December. No, it won't have any effect on the discontinuation. I don't believe that given that this is a substantive application we could actually refile it and be considered in May. We're actually -- they're willing to move forward in March. It was just that we thought that the agenda was going to be full in March with the reconsideration of Mercy. MEMBER KAATZ: Okay. Thank you for clearing that up. MS. COOPER: Sure. MR. CONSTANTINO: Mr. Kaatz, this is Mike Constantino. We would request from Anne new information before the May 4th meeting to address your concerns about the information could be stale in the original application. MEMBER KAATZ: Right. Okay.

Thanks, Mike. MR. CONSTANTINO: Yes, sir. MEMBER KAATZ: Madam Chairman, am I missing something, but do we already -- do we already have more work in front of us with regard to Mercy and the distinction initiative? CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: We'll talk offline, Mr. Kaatz, but they had an intent to deny at our last meeting. MEMBER KAATZ: Okay. Thank you. MEMBER GRUNDY: I have a question just to follow up on Mr. Kaatz. Is there a reason why you don't want to submit a new certificate of need instead of continuing this application? MS. COOPER: Yes. I mean, like I said, we submitted this application last summer, and we were using the June 2020 quarterly ESRD data to project the utilization looking at historical and projected moving forward. When we saw the September numbers, they were flat, and we just want to look at the December numbers to see if that trend is continuing. And one of the issues really right now with dialysis is that they're having to cohort patientsTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 43 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 at different clinics because of COVID, because you do not want to have COVID-positive patients or suspected COVID-positive patients dialyzing next to negative-COVID patients. So they're having to move patients around to various clinics because of COVID, and so the data is kind of irregular because of that factor. We just want to take a look at the Board's data as of December 31st, compare it to DaVita's internal data that they're seeing to see if this clinic still makes sense, and we just haven't had an opportunity to do that. My understanding is DaVita is really focused right now on vaccinating its staff at these clinics, so it hasn't really had time to really take a deep dive into the data. MEMBER KAATZ: Thank you for that. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Are there any other questions? MR. CONSTANTINO: Madam Chair, this is Mike Constantino again. I want to tell Gary and Dr. Grundy that we do get quarterly utilization data from the facilities, so we will have March 2021 data for that application when it comes before the Board in May.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 44 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Very good.

I'm providing statements in support of the application for the Mercy Care Center as an advocate for the care of underserved populations.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 47 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 I'm a 30-year healthcare quality improvement professional with expertise in analytics and measurement and have served in leadership positions at an academic medical center, two community health centers, and a network of health centers in Chicago, and I currently consult with health centers nationally on how to best use data to improve patient outcomes and efficiency of care. I've seen community health challenges multiply this past year amid the COVID pandemic which has made it difficult for them to maintain the same level of care for their vulnerable residents and reduce gaps in care. They've struggled with basic financial stability, integrating telehealth into services, and with navigating towards value-based payment models that require much higher collaboration with other healthcare providers and payors. I believe the proposed Mercy Care Center will help the Bronzeville community and community health providers in that region address these challenges and help them make a significant impact on measures of health disparity for chronic disease, cancer mortality, preventive care andTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 48 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 wellness that they have struggled with even well prior to the pandemic. The urgent care services plan for the center not only improved measures of access to care but can also help improve measures of health system efficiency and effectiveness such as ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions which every care provider, health centers, and hospitals are focused on improving in this value- based care environment. The diagnostic testing services plan, such as the CT/ultrasound/mammography will create new capacities for patients in that community with shorter wait times and less complexity compared to getting them in a hospital. Every center I've worked with wants their patients to get the testing they need as soon as possible so they can make better and faster decisions with their care. And lastly, the care coordination services proposed for this center demonstrate the commitment to coordinating and collaborating with all health partners in the community to improve measures of care effectiveness and efficiency which I believe will significantly bend the curveTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 49 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 on health disparities in the Bronzeville community.

I'm the chairperson for the NAACP South Side Chapter. The NAACP South Side Chapter is opposed to the Mercy Hospital outpatient center because by virtue of the Mercy Hospital application for closure, the hospital has shown itself unwilling to continue caring for the community. The proposal ignores the true healthcare needs of the community, which is a comprehensive hospital, not an outpatient center. For these reasons the NAACP Chicago South Side Chapter urges the governor and mayor to seek healthcare solutions that keep Mercy Hospital open and solutions that begin to reverse the health inequities in these communities.

LASSA: Patrice, P-a-t-r-i-c-e; Lassa, L-a-s-s-a. Dear Chairwoman and honorable members, I write to you as an advocate for the care of the underserved population in support for the Mercy Care Center. I have been a practitioner for years on several care teams in various healthcare settings in private, public, and academic medical centers and am in physical therapy in private practice in the community of the proposed Mercy Care location. I've experienced incredible changes in the healthcare industry through payment reform, technology, and data advancement and care delivery changes, some that have improved the coordination of care and outcomes and others that just have added additional frustrations for the care team or the patients, resulting in delays orTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 52 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 gaps in care. The pandemic unmasked underlying health disparities and highlighted the inequalities in care and access, delays in care due to confusion of the healthcare system, long wait times for diagnostic tests, and referrals to specialist just to name a few examples. In my opinion, the proposed facility will strive to be the bridge between this at-risk community and the health partners serving these communities by assisting in the creation of better utilization by getting the right patient to the right specialist at the right time and moving healthcare to health. Hopefully it will not only grow the critical market share but also harness a team of professionals by embracing a unified and action-oriented mindset. I support and am excited to see the unlimited potential of transforming healthcare on the south side by providing this delivery model to meet the unmet needs of the community by improving coordination, effectiveness, and efficiency of care. Thank you for the opportunity to share these comments in support of the Mercy Care Center.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 53 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MS. SIMMONS: Thank you. Ben -- I'm going to spell the last name -- S-a-i-y-a-s-o-m-b-a-t. DR. SAIYASOMBAT: Good morning. Can you hear me? MS. SIMMONS: Yes. You have a little bit of feedback. DR. SAIYASOMBAT: Oh, interesting. Sorry about that. My name is Dr. Ben Saiyasombat. I'm one of the doctors who works in the ER at Mercy Hospital. That's B-e-n S-a-i-y-a-s-o-m-b-a-t. So the first thing I'd like to say is I'm all for having an additional outpatient care center. I think for Mercy's population better disease prevention and increased outpatient access would be great. My problems are with this specific application. The first issue is that as it stands in its initial application the Mercy Care Center is not enough even for outpatient care and prevention. When we talk about prevention, prevention means having a regular doctor who can take care of your lifetime medical problems, the doctors who can actually prevent your disease because they've beenTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 54 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 taking care of you for years, they know your medical problems, and they're the ones who can get you the resources and specialized care you need. However, the proposed care center only offers care coordination. So they can refer you a number to call for a doctor somewhere else, but the actual doctors are not stationed at the facility. And this place is supposed to replace a hospital that's a main center where everyone goes when they're sick or need medicine. So the fact that these doctors aren't there is crazy to me, which brings me to my second issue with the proposal, which is that the care center is meant to replace the hospital. Trinity is saying that by closing Mercy Hospital it's not abandoning the community because they're going to transform the healthcare system by replacing it with this care center. Their main motivation behind applying for this care center is to use it as justification for closing the hospital. And like I said, I agree that good outpatient care is important, but it's only part of a complete healthcare system. As an example, the care center has CTTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 55 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 scanners which can diagnose appendicitis, but you still need a hospital that can do surgery and give antibiotics and monitor the patient. A complete healthcare system ideally would have your outpatient doctors who can take care of your chronic medical problems like high blood pressure and diabetes and focus on prevention, but when there are emergencies you still need a hospital you can send your patients to. You still need that second part. So I stand opposed to this application today because its true aim is to take a safety net hospital that already offers comprehensive inpatient and outpatient services and replace it with an urgent care referral center that doesn't even adequately address the primary care needs of its patient population. Thank you very much for your time. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you. Next is Scott Mechanic. If you give me a second, I think I saw you on the list. MR.

I'm an emergency room nurse at University of Chicago Hospital. I oppose Mercy Hospital's proposed urgent care center. I often staff a part of our ER that's designed to operate as an urgent care center which gives me some insight into the limitations of that model to service the healthcare needs of south side residents. Part of that work is very rewarding. People come in with problems that are causing significant distress, we fix them, and they're relieved, wounds, strep throat, STIs, butTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 57 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 most of what we do is a lot less rewarding. We tell people they're not having an emergency, and they need follow-up care with a primary care provider or specialist that they don't have access to. At least at University of Chicago we can transition them into those services in-house. The proposed Mercy urgent care center would have none of that available. And as far as the proposed care transitions clinic, I don't think that the problem with the healthcare system on the south side of Chicago is that there's a lack of people sitting at a desk trying to find where people can get care. The problem is that there's not enough care available. There's much more to say, but I think I'm running out of time. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you, Mr. Mechanic. Next I believe is Alderman Sophia King.

And I have watched some be fooled by the spin. Please do your due diligence and do not be fooled by them dressing this decimation up as transformation.

I have heard them say they have met with other hospitals about their plans for a smooth transformation, but after follow-up with those hospitals I have come to find what I already knew, that they were introductory conversations, nothing substantive. Perhaps they had these fake conversations ultimately to sit here to the Board and to say that they tried and that \"Don't worry because we have a plan,\" but they have not really talked to electeds or other hospitals that know this community or the community in earnest about what they are doing. Trinity was handed Mercy in great financial condition. In fact, at the time they said it was a great bargain. They were given Trinity with a $140 million balance, and they took that great bargain and great hospital -- MR. ROATE: Two minutes. ALDERMAN KING: -- and have effectively run it into the ground.

I understand that this hearing is about the clinic, but I want to push back against that this is some separate issue when the closure of -- you know, these two issues are inseparable. The closure of the clinic -- or the closure of the hospital is dependent on the opening of this clinic, and this clinic only makes sense in the context of Mercy Hospital closing, which is unacceptable. Any benefit that this clinic would bring has to be balanced against the devastation of Mercy Hospital closing. And Trinity Health has just been very disingenuous throughout this entire process. They've lied about transforming healthcare when they're actually committed to exacerbating the current inequities that we already have and further reducing healthcare on the south side. They've lied about meeting with community and community groups. They've made absolutely no effort to reach out to the community groups thatTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 63 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 are fighting to save Mercy. Trinity Health has shown that they're not committed to healthcare in black and brown communities, and at this point we don't think they can be trusted to open up new healthcare facilities to undermine the current facility they already run at Bronzeville. I'd also just like -- I think it's worth thinking like why do we have to be here right now. You know, other communities don't have to show up before obscure government boards on weekday mornings to beg for something that most people take for granted. I'm glad the Board here is a check against Trinity's greed, but communities like Bronzeville shouldn't have to scrape and claw for basic necessities like hospitals. Trinity is out here arguing that black communities don't need hospitals, that outpatient clinics will serve just fine. They are doing that here but also around the country as they're closing facilities in black and brown and low- income neighborhoods.

We have to get a new owner who is actually committed to black communities. We don't need a new healthcare facility from Trinity in Bronzeville, and Mercy has to say stay open.

Their announcement to close Mercy Hospital in the middle of a pandemic is not only inhumane but effectively killing the hospital and their professional services building because doctors are leaving. They are dismantling the lives of the hundreds of thousands of patients they see annually all in the name of transformative care. What they are calling transformative care is little more than imaging machines and urgent care visits with no doctors. I hate to even call it urgent care because it brings to mind a setting that would stop unnecessary emergency visits, but these rooms would not be staffed with doctors like most urgent cares. No, here you would ultimately get some images and then be sent on your way to a facility with doctors and emergency rooms that's not connected to them. Ultimately, there would be no connectivity of care or hospital affiliation. How is this transformative? Not only are they doing all of this, but they are doing so while trying to make it seem like they are doing what's best for our communityTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 66 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 as if they know what's best for our community and have the nerve to call it transformative. What they are doing and proposing is and will decimate already existing comprehensive care in the very place that they are proposing to put the center. They do not mention in their application they are decimating these preventive and specialty care offices that already exist with internal medicine, and pediatrics, and gynecology and that see thousands of patients a year to replace it with imaging and urgent care with no doctors. I'm surprised they can even legally call it urgent care because it will not have doctors or connection to doctors or hospitals for follow-up. Mercy could and should do what is right, which is make sure there is a smooth transition like they were handed with $140 million in assets. MS. AVERY: Alderman King, can you conclude your comments.

HARGREAVES: My name is Diane Hargreaves, and I'm the chief HR officer at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center where I've worked for nearly five years. I've spent most of my life in Chicago, and as a teen I grew up in the Auburn Gresham community on the city's south side which remains home to many of my familiar members. My son lives in Bronzeville just a few short blocks from where I work every day at the hospital. I spent the last 29 years as an HR administrator in healthcare, including at the University of Chicago Medical Center and now Mercy. My experience tells me the kind of healthcare that both our patients and the south side community members need, and I want to be clear that my colleagues and I are fully focused on doing what is best for our patients. That's why I'm here today to ask you to support the application of the Mercy Care Center. Our staff and patients are best served by an outpatient model of care that better meets the needs of all of our community.

We all know we need a better health network, and one of the best ways we can do that is to create more outpatient care so local residents don't end up in the emergency room. As I've listened to other comments that have been made about the Mercy Care Center, frankly, I've been taken aback how anyone could argue against providing more care for patients on the south side. Our communities need -- MR. ROATE: Two minutes. MS. HARGREAVES: Our communities need more detection and diagnosis of illness and diseases. Better treatment of chronic diseases is needed and better care coordination. As a hospital leader I understand how it is important to make arrangements for patients to have continuity of care from providers in the community, and opening the Mercy Care Center is another step that would ensure the continuity of care. I urge the Board to support the access to care our community needs and deserves and approve the Mercy Care Center. Thank you. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you.

I'm here today to ask this Board to approve the Mercy Care Center's application. Through this new center I seek to continue my personal commitment to providing care to those in underserved communities. For the past several years I've served as the corporate director of operations at Trinity Health where one of the hospitals I've supported has been Mercy. It is through this lens I have been able to understand the needs of the community. Trinity is making a commitment to build and operate the center for the benefit of the community, although it will not be profitable. Rather, it will require a $3 million annualTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 70 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 investment. We do so in keeping with our mission in providing care to all those in need. Here are some very important facts we all needle to consider. A study by the University of Illinois Chicago found that racial and ethnic disparities of breast cancer deaths are due to delays in diagnosis. The women in the study, mainly African-American and Latino women in Chicago have an average diagnostic delay of 60 days. African-American residents in Chicago represent 50 percent of all lung cancer deaths in Chicago. 65 percent of all deaths in Chicago are due to chronic illnesses. People living on the north side of Chicago live an average of 30 years longer than those on the south side, 30 years. This urgent care center goes further than many offerings, offering urgent and preventive care diagnostic imaging, including mammograms, X-rays, CT scans and MR tests, and the care coordination that patients need. It will strengthen access to care for patients but also strengthen the healthcare network, working in close collaboration with FQHCs, local physician specialists, and helping in keeping patients outTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 71 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 of the emergency room. With the Mercy Care Center we can deliver care that is urgently needed on the south side. We can create a positive and lasting outcome for the community we serve. I urge the Board to approve this application to help create a new service on the south side that will meet the needs of patients while recognizing the realities of healthcare financing today. I thank you all so very much for listening. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you. Juwana Jackson. MS. JACKSON: Hello. Can you hear me? MS. SIMMONS: Yes, we can. Please proceed. MS. JACKSON: Thank you. Good morning. My name is Juwana Jackson, and I am proud to serve as a board member on the Mercy Care Center board. As those of you on this Board know, outpatient care has truly transformed healthcare in this country over the last decade and has become a standard, efficient, and more costly effective way to deliver care close to home. But access to this type of healthcare is still not asTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 72 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 available to people of color in underserved communities as it is in affluent communities. For too many traveling long distances and long waits in ER to seek care or simply not getting care at all is a fact of life. I personally believe it is time for us to solve this issue for black and brown communities. In the immediate area surrounding the Mercy Care Center 35 percent of the residents are black, and 35 percent of the residents are Latinx. Therefore, it is critical that we offer more types of care available to this underserved population. A recent community needs health assessment on the south side made it clear that what is lacking on the south side is access to outpatient preventive and diagnostic care that patients need to better manage chronic illness and keep them from needing hospitalization in the first place. The Mercy Care Center could help meet that need head on by providing quality and life-saving care to support up to 55,000 patient visits on the south side every year and by coordinating care with FQHCs, primary care physicians, and specialists serving these patients.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 73 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 We know that black women represent 50 percent of breast cancer deaths in Chicago. Imagine what a difference early diagnoses of diseases and a mammogram test could do if conveniently located in Bronzeville for the members of the black community. Supporting this center means providing preventive care, early intervention, and care in a community that desperately needs to reduce its death rate due to chronic and preventable illnesses. Please allow us to continue to execute our plans that were initiated over a year ago to prepare for the Mercy Care Center opening in 2021. Any delays in approvals also extend our timeline to begin serving community. I urge this board to approve the Mercy Care Center's application, and thank you for this time. MS. SIMMONS: Next I have Joe Novak. I don't see him on the list. I'm guessing he's one of the call-in users. So, Mike, do I just go ahead and unmute the call-ins?

CHANG: My name is Betty Chang, B-e-t-t-y C-h-a-n-g. I'm a first-year medical student at UIC, and I'm on this call today to oppose Trinity's opening of this clinic. I think the problem is is that we can't view that proposal in a vacuum. It's not just whether an outpatient care clinic is good. Of course it's good, but not when it comes with the caveat that the community will lose a hospital. What are you going to do when your outpatient clinic with all these imaging machines finds a mass in a patient's breast? What will you do then? When a patient's needs have to be addressed with a hospital, an outpatient clinic is not sufficient. A clinic like this is great in addition to a well-run hospital system that can support the number of patients who require inpatient and longer term care. The community of Bronzeville is a low-income community. Patients who come and seek medical care are often doing that at a great investment. They have to take time off of work; they have to coordinate child care, and they can't come to a clinic that is just coordinating theirTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 75 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 care. For them being referred to another hospital, to another clinic somewhere else requires a larger time investment. They have to take more time out of their schedules. And Trinity knows this. They know what they're doing because they've been in this community, And what this is is taking advantage of black and brown communities who have nowhere else to turn. You can't remove a community's dependence on an emergency department and emergency department visits by just removing the emergency department. That's just not -- that's cruel. So I'm asking you today to think of the community that you're going to be affecting, and I'm asking you to oppose this proposal. Thank you, so much. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you. Next is Mary Cobb.

Listening to the rates that people are listing off of breast cancer in African-American women and Latinas, it's clear that we need more diagnostic services. However, we would be remiss to ignore the fact that this outpatient center will only happen if Mercy closes. I know that this hearing is for the outpatient center, but they go hand in hand.

I've heard administrators on this call and others wholeheartedly support this urgent care center, but none of the medical staff has. I cannot help but see that support as strategic moves to secure positions with the new center and not as true belief that it serves the community. So to be clear, I oppose the center as an entity separate or in lieu of the hospital. Thank you for your time. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you. I'm going down and looking at the hands that are raised.

Although more outpatient care centers are of benefit, Trinity's proposal is not simply adding a care center. Instead their proposal requires shutting down a full-service hospital, replacingTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 78 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 it with less services, and building it away from the current community Mercy serves, a few 2 miles away. They have branded robbing a community access to a full-service hospital at the exact current location Mercy stands as a transformation project. Calling this push to cut services a transformation project that puts the community first is akin to trying to brand a noose as a poorly disguised bow. It fools no one; it helps no one; it is a death sentence. Who better to listen to regarding the impact of this decision than community leaders, doctors, nurses, and patients who have the best -- hello? Oh, shoot. MS. SIMMONS: Please proceed.

This community relies on access to emergency services of which an outpatient care center will not provide, making it insufficient to serve the community. Trinity has not provided any contingencies nor presented a plan to mitigate these consequences, making it clear that their interests do not align with what's best for patients and their families. The incessant push for this closure of a hospital in an underserved community in the middle of a pandemic and branding it as a benefit is appalling. Allowing this haphazard Trojan horse proposal to pass will condemn an entire community for generations to come. Hospitals in underserved areas deserve protection, and they serve patients who are disenfranchised and far too often remain unprioritized. The bottom line is this. Trinity has options. They can sell. Patients on the other hand only have one viable option, to keep Mercy Hospital open. Today's decision also echos beyond our time.

When the County closed Oak Forest Hospital, at least 9 or 10 ventilator-dependent patients died when they were transferred to a nursing home -- or when they were transferred to nursing homes. No doubt the same would happen if Mercy is closed. This would also increase travel time to get to Stroger or University of Chicago Hospital. During a pandemic health services should be increased, not decreased.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 81 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The corporation that wants to close Mercy is worth $10 billion and has shown their systematic racism by wanting to deprive mostly black, Latin, and many white patients of hospital care on the south side of Chicago.

I'm opposed to the Mercy Care Center project because it does not meet the needs of the community it would purport to serve. This proposed care center would lack critical services like primary care, specialist care, and more. As these medical professionals who previously commented pointed out, these services are of critical importance to black and brown communities in healthcare deserts on the south side of the city. A walk-in urgent care center such as the one proposed is clearly and obviously a step down, and to pursue this plan in opposition to such strident outcry from the community shows a clear desire to put profit over patients' health and safety, which is unacceptable at any time but especially now in the midst of this pandemic. I urge you to reject this application and to center the needs and voices of the surrounding area who are calling for Mercy to keep providing comprehensive services. Thank you.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 83 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MS.

The Cottage Grove site that we're talking about was a primary care center where primary care physicians took care of their patients in a continuous care manner. It's being replaced by something without physicians which has nothing to do with continual care, and at the same time other Mercy outpatient centers where primary care was available will probably be gone, too, 85th and State, 45th and Pulaski, 55th and Archer, 35th and Wallace, and at Dearborn Station, and, of course, the site that we're talking about today, which is going to be turned in from a primary care center where patients faithfully came in close coordinationTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 84 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 to their homes to their primary care physicians who followed them through their cases and their history and their new developments, and there was a bond there that created high-level care. Those physicians have been discharged, and their clientele have no primary care physicians left. That's the advancement at this site? No way. This should not be approved.

Everyone needs to listen about it. Also, the issue of diversity, there are many people who come to Mercy for service. By moving the place you exclude certain people that would have received care. Community outreach is not mentioned. I am a living witness of how Mercy used to work with the community especially in the schools where they brought nurses in the clinics to help students. We need to focus on primary care, health promotion, disease prevention, and the whole holistic care. Also, what is not mentioned is spiritual care. There are many churches, specifically St. James Church on Wabash where holistic care -- where spiritual care is offered to patients who are inbound inside the hospital. Where are we going to do that? Nobody mentions anything. As such, I oppose the new project strongly. It serves no one, anybody but the people who are in charge. Thank you. MS. SIMMONS: Thank you.

I thank you for the opportunity to speak. I am representing the Chicago Metropolitan Association of the Illinois Conference of the United Church of Christ in opposing the care center. We have several south side churches with members who will be impacted if the care center replaces the inpatient hospital. I'm a general pediatrician. After 37 years in clinical practice, I retired in 2018 but remain involved in a number of community service groups. Replacing Mercy Hospital with a care center will further decimate inpatient medical care to the surrounding communities. Over the years the south side has suffered from ongoing losses of inpatient beds, particularly for maternity care and mental health care. After the closing of Michael Rees Hospital, MetroSouth Hospital in Blue Island, and many smaller hospital programs, there are very few options for pregnantTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 87 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 persons who are not able to travel far away. This is truly a crisis particularly for south side black women who already have a higher rate of complications during pregnancy and delivery than their white counterparts. They deserve better. Similarly, there's a need for inpatient psychiatric care. How many options for quality inpatient care will remain for south siders if the hospital is closed? Mercy Hospital is a bedrock community asset. I ask that the Health Facilities and Services Review Board work with parties involved to keep Mercy Hospital an inpatient hospital, not a care center. Thank you. MS. AVERY: Thank you for your comments. Sally Nuamah, N-u-a-h-a-m -- I'm sorry -- m-a-h. DR. NUAMAH: Yeah, that's me, hi. Good morning, members of the Board. My name is Dr. Sally Nuamah. I was born and raised in Chicago. Currently I'm a professor of human development and social policy at Northwestern University. My primary research is on the social and political consequences of institutional closure, particularly on social safety netTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 88 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 institutions. As you know, the closure of Mercy Hospital is preceded by the closure of affordable housing, the shuttering of close to 50 public schools, and the shuttering of previous hospitals. The majority of these closures took place in the same community that are now experiencing the threat of closure of current hospitals in the middle of a pandemic. Ultimately, I oppose the development of a shadow Mercy Care Center, as it is clear that it will only deepen the disadvantages felt by communities already affected by previous school and hospital closures. There's not a lot of time, but there are multiple reasons an outpatient facility as opposed to a full-service hospital would deprive the community of the timely care they need. Perhaps the most important one is that the diagnostic testing center services that are the essential service of the outpatient center that is being proposed will reveal the disparities we already know without providing a sustainable structural solution to these disparities. I think it cut out, but essentially theTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 89 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 essential services, which are diagnostic testing services that are being proposed will reveal the disparities we already know without providing sustainable structural solutions to these disparities. The question then is how does the care center improve the healthcare needs of the community. Mercy Hospital in its current form is a high-patient-volume safety net hospital that remains desired by this community. As was said already, they include admissions from the emergency department and maternity care services that will not be replaced by the alternative care center. And the community, most importantly, does not propose the alternative idea; there's no evidence that they do. So even if the diagnostic services are being touted as the holy grail that can be provided as a replacement, it does not actually need to exist separately from the full hospital services. Those same services can be provided in a full hospital setting. There's no need to separate them, and it's unclear why they are separating them.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 90 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Mercy Hospital leaders know that this care center is not an improvement. They also know that these services don't have to be provided as a replacement of a full-service hospital, and yet they are unrelenting in their pursuit anyway. But, again, this work -- the proposed project is not transformative; it's not even clear that it's better. It's also unclear that the community wants it, and for these reasons I think it follows that the care center is not a sufficient replacement for this community and should not be approved. Thank you.

Trinity Health has not met the needs or interests of the community. I understand that this proposal is for an outpatient clinic separate from the hospital, but I do not want the Board to be bamboozled when Trinity continues to cut service lines and to try to close the full-service Mercy Hospital under the justification that it opens a smaller care center. I urge the Board to listen to the community when that community expresses their needs and to please not let a multibillion dollar Michigan-based corporation talk over these community members. Trinity paternalistically and in bad faith tries to argue that it knows what is best for people who are already speaking for themselves.

Trinity Health seems to have cherry-picked a couple of possibly revenue generating services to offer the community. There are 40,000 patients who come to the emergency room each year who need emergency care, not urgent care. The hospital already offers 90,000 imaging visits each year, and the Mercy Care Center will offer about a third of that. So this is not an addition of services; this is a cutting of services. I would just like to say as a Catholic that it is an embarrassment for a health organization that calls itself Catholic to be cutting services. They are dishonoring the tradition, the legacy of The Sisters of Mercy who built Mercy Hospital, who chose to keep Mercy Hospital in Bronzeville back in the '60s when they built their building. They could have moved their hospital to Skokie, but they said, \"We will not abandon this community; we will serve the people in Bronzeville,\" and it is absolutely disgusting that a Catholic institution is offering a completely inadequate set of services to the community and abandoning all the people who need hospital care.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 94 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 I ask the Board to oppose the Mercy Care Center.

So just the fact that, you know, it's being represented as a transformation to it's more preventative, it's just such a gross misrepresentation that I think speaks to whether Trinity Health is fit to provide healthcare services in this community, which I don't believe that they are. So I'm just speaking to oppose this urgent care clinic because, you know, ultimately, what it does is it just refers people to either hospitals or primary care providers, and it doesn't actually provide any healthcare for the issues that we're diagnosing or, you know, unless they're very superficial issues that can receive quick diagnoses. Also, I just want to say that with, you know, the new variant of COVID-19 we're going to be seeing another mass wave of cases right now, so we're still very much in a health emergency.

I am also a member of the Lugenia Burns Hope Center. But I am also a patient of Mercy Hospital, where the doctors, nurses, and the entire medical staff work hard to serve the poor and underprivileged, of which I am one. I am here today because I'm saddened and I'm truly appalled that not once but twice during this pandemic where the majority of people who are dying are black and brown people. The Trinity corporation has appealed to this Board to close Mercy Hospital under the guise that they want to build this great critical care clinic for us. Well, we're not blind nor are we stupid. What are we supposed to do after hours during a respiratory, cardiac, or other crisis? By the time an ambulance comes from across town, the person experiencing this crisis would probably be dead or die on the way to the hospital. Now, I know that in a business you want to make a profit, but when it comes to putting profit over human life, then we have a problem. We have over 216 seniors in the DearbornTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 99 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Homes besides the numerous disabled people who are on walkers, canes, or in wheelchairs. Some of us can't make it from month to month on our incomes, but the Trinity corporation says that we can catch a bus or an Uber to the hospital. I don't think so. The Trinity Corporation does not know or care about what's best for us. Because if they did, then they wouldn't be talking about closing Mercy Hospital during one of the worse pandemics in history. We may be poor and sick but we're not dumb. So let's call it what it really is. It's a lie; it's all about profits. I implore this Board to say no to this clinic and no to closing Mercy Hospital. Now that the COVID vaccine is being administered, and here again blacks are the last to receive it. With all of our underlying conditions we need Mercy Hospital. So, again, whatever has to be done needs to be done. We were already devastated when they closed Michael Rees Hospital, so please do not do this to us again and especially during this pandemic. We're fighting to save our lives.

Again, what do we do when the clinic closes during a crisis? Please save Mercy Hospital. Thank you. MS. AVERY: Thank you, ma'am. Okay. I don't see anyone else.

I represent the members that cannot come on this call because Trinity has frightened them. So I represent 236 members at the hospital. I do not oppose the transformation clinic, but we do not need a clinic in that area. There's over 40 clinics in that area. They need -- that transformation clinicTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 101 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 needs to not proceed for me. I think that the hospital needs to stand where it is because the community needs a hospital, not a clinic. I think it's time that -- Trinity said that they talked to the community. They did not talk to the community; they talked to aldermen and told them lies. Because I talked to some of the aldermen. So I think that Trinity needs to stop doing this triple effect on our backs of our people, black, Latino people and stop using them as numbers because numbers are profit. They are people that need help. A lot of people do not like going to clinics to schedule appointments, so they send them home, and they get sicker and sicker and go to the emergency room. That's what people do versus going to the clinic and scheduling appointments because they can't take time off of work. They can't because they don't have the time or their boss won't let them. So we need for them not to have this clinic. We need for Mercy Hospital to stay open. Thank you. MS. AVERY: Thank you.

MS. WILLS: Yes, thank you. My name Heather Wills, last name W-i-l-l-s. I'm calling to oppose the closing of the clinic. It is very obvious through the previous application put in by Trinity Health that the building of this clinic is solely to replace Mercy Hospital, and so we cannot consider those two separate. It is very clear through the testimony you have heard today that this clinic will be used as divestment in the Bronzeville community where I work. It is very clear that this clinic will give less care to the black and brown community of Bronzeville, and it is even more apparent that Trinity Health has the resources not only to keep Mercy Hospital open, but as many have asked, to add services to their existing facility of Mercy Hospital. It says in the report provided to the report they have over $10 million on cash in order to build a new facility. It is quite obvious that the community does not want this facility. The community does not trust Trinity Health to provide adequate care. The community does not want Trinity Health even atTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 103 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Mercy and has petitioned many folks to get involved in advocating the sale of Mercy Hospital so that a company can come in who wants to provide adequate care in the Bronzeville community. But most importantly, those who speak on behalf of Trinity don't live in Bronzeville. They don't walk the streets of 35th Street and of Cottage Grove and of King Drive. They don't know the struggles of black and brown folks. They go back in their nice cars to Orland Park and Tinley, and they don't know what we go through. We don't want them in our community. We want them to actually sell Mercy to someone who wants to provide care, and no, we do not want them to provide another facility in our community. They have to go because they do not care about us. It is not about dollars and cents; this is about our mortality and our fatality. This is not just a betting game on sports, or this is not just a joke to us. This is about whether or not black and brown people live or die, and allowing them to continue to provide services in our community is just another death in sentence for allowing rich, racist corporations to get into our community andTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 104 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 exploit us. So I speak with many fellow residents, many fellow community members, many fellow doctors and other healthcare providers who know and believe that Trinity Health cannot open another facility in our community, and we ask that you vote no.

I have worked all my life, and I just recently overcame cancer, and Mercy was one of the hospitals that had been treating me. I was devastated when I first found outTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 105 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 that I had cancer and Michael Rees Hospital closed because I had built a relationship with that hospital. Now I have built a relationship with Mercy Hospital, and I'm a very frequent visitor of the hospital. And I can't get around all the time, and like they talk about opening a clinic, and like the young lady spoke earlier, what am I going to do when I need to go to the emergency room or I need to go to the hospital and there's no hospital around for me to frequent or for me to visit? And I just became ill with a lot of different issues, and I feel that a clinic can't service me in the way that I may need to be serviced, and it's already hard enough to get around, and for me to have to leave outside of my community, and there's already a hospital right here. Bronzeville is a big community, and we do not have a major hospital close in our area and how difficult it would be to build a relationship and kind of go out of my neighborhood. I just don't feel like it's right for them to not consider all the residents in this community that need Mercy Hospital, and I justTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 106 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 want to oppose the opening of the clinic and trying to help fight to keep Mercy Hospital open.

I know earlier it was stated that we're not speaking on the closing of Mercy, but it's hard to discuss this transformation which I'm opposing without discussing the closing of Mercy. But I will say that I am also -- I also have PCP at the clinic on 37th at Oakwood Shores. And no one plans to be sick. I mean, everyone understands no one plans to be sick, no one plans to have to go to the hospital because of an illness or the way that they're feeling, and proposing that we transform funds, you know, at a clinic with no emergency room in case of anTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 107 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 emergency to basically save face or to take as -- to make it as a hospital, it's outrageous. I mean, at the rate that things have been going with a lot of people that I heard give testimony on this call, when something happened they can go straight to the emergency room. Whereas, if we -- if something happens to us after this transformation and we call our clinic, and they're not taking any walk-ins or no doctors available, then what is left for us to do besides travel further somewhere else so that we can see a doctor and who may not be in our network or work may not take our insurance, whereas we have a family-based hospital where we can go where people care for us. How about the older folks who have relationships with these doctors at Mercy Hospital, and they have to transfer somewhere else that have lifelong issues? They have to start all over again just so they can understand what's going on. I and my family oppose the transformation that has been presented to us. I am asking the Board to oppose those things, as well. Thank you. MS. AVERY: Thank you for your comments.

My name is Edward Green. I'm a capital partner at the law firm of Foley & Lardner here in Chicago. I am counsel to the applicants for this project. Specifically, I am counsel to Mercy Care Center, LLC, and Trinity Health Corporation. In terms of our presenters today we have Daisy Rodriguez. Ms. Rodriguez is the executive director of the Mercy Care Center. We also haveTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 113 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Anita Allen. Ms. Allen is on the board of directors for the Mercy Care Center. And finally, we have Mr. John Capasso, also on the board of directors for the Mercy Care Center and vice president at Trinity Health. As I said, the applicants today are Mercy Care Center, LLC, and Trinity Health Corporation. The sole member of Mercy Care Center, LLC, is Trinity Health Corporation. Neither Mercy Hospital nor Mercy Health System are applicants for this project. Neither Mercy Hospital nor Mercy Health System have an ownership interest in the Mercy Care Center. I thought it was important to note the specific applicants today and to note that the project today only concerns the Mercy Care Center. Project No. 20-039 and the proposed closure of Mercy Hospital is not before the Board today. Thus, any speakers at the public hearing two weeks ago or during the public testimony phase today who simply cited their opposition to the closure of Mercy Hospital have conflated the two projects. Thus, consistent with the Board's rules and regulations, I am hopeful that the Review Board will focus solely on the Mercy Care CenterTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 114 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 project today. And if we do, you would note that the State Agency Report only cited a single criteria as being out of compliance. That criteria concerned the cost per square foot. More specifically, the State Agency Report stated that the construction contracts and contingency costs of $416.82 per square foot exceeded the applicable state norm of $263.22 per square foot. As we stated in the application, the Mercy Care Center number is easily explainable. One, the applicable state norm applies to traditional medical office space. And, two, the care center is not traditional medical office space. The care center includes an imaging center which will require lead walls and additional support for the imaging equipment located in the imaging center. The care center will also be located in a Class A building that was completed in 2010, so the applicants are building up to the standards of that building. I should also note that we have been working our general contractor since the filing of the CON application, and we should be able to reduce the construction cost by at least anotherTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 115 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 million dollars through better phasing of the project. So instead of the construction proceeding over 12 phases, we have been able to reduce the construction down to four phases. We have also been able to structure the phasing in such a way that more of the construction can be completed during the day versus nighttime and weekends, which reduces the cost. If you run the new construction numbers through the metrics, the project will likely end up below the cost per square foot state norm cited by the State agency. But a few other things bear noting. The state norm cited by the State agency is merely a function of the zip code of where Mercy Care Center is located. Other zip codes have a far higher state norm. For example, in Project 19-13 for the University of Chicago Medical Center off-campus mammography suite in Orland Park the applicable state norm was $471.15 per square foot. That project was unanimously approved by the review Board. In addition, as we noted in our CON application, pursuant to the actual languageTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 116 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 of Section 1110, appendix B, and the actual language of Section 1120, appendix A, the cost-per-square-foot metric cited in the State Agency Report is not applicable to this project for four reasons. One, neither of the applicants are hospitals. Two, the services provided at the care center will not be billed by a hospital licensed pursuant to the Licensing Act. Three, neither of the applicants are owned by a long-term care facility, an ICF/DD facility, a surgical treatment center, a hemodialysis center, or a freestanding emergency center. And four, those same entities will not be billing for any of the services. Thus, the construction cost per square foot for the Mercy Care Center is actually not subject to a state norm, much like equipment costs or consulting costs. Indeed, we are only here today because the State Agency said they would apply the hospital metrics to the project and that the total costs of this project were close enough to the capital expenditure threshold of $14,176,369 for hospitals. So we filed the CON to be fullyTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 117 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 transparent and to prevent any compliance issues in the future. Of course, as filed, the total costs of this project were below the capital expenditure thresholds for hospitals by more than $1 million, and since the filing of this application we now believe that this project will likely end up below the capital expenditure threshold by more than $2 million. So that is a long-winded way of saying the only negative finding in the State Agency Report is not negative, and this project is in full compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. Thus, this project should be and must be approved. With that as a backdrop I will hand the microphone over to Ms. Rodriguez. MR. CONSTANTINO: Courtney, can I interrupt you for a minute?

Chairwoman Savage and to the rest of the Board, my name is Daisy Rodriguez, and I will be the executive director of Mercy Care when it is approved. I began my career as a nurse and have spent many years as an administrator in hospitals caring for patients in underserved areas, including Norwegian American Hospital, Loyola University Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, as well as working for Erie Family Health Center, a federally qualified health center in Chicago. I earned my Master's in Public Health from Loyola University Chicago and have over 25 years of healthcare experience in nursing, healthcare administration, and community health. Throughout my career, I've managed some of the busiest emergency rooms, including a Level 1 trauma center that served one of the lowest income areas of Chicago. At Erie Family Health Center,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 119 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 an FQHC, I was Vice President for Health Center Operations and Quality for its 13 facilities serving more than 82,000 patients each year, many of whom were low income, uninsured and underinsured. From this experience, one thing I can say for certain is that our system of health needs to do more to keep patients from needing to visit the emergency room in the first place. Too often, patients come in with ailments that, had they been diagnosed earlier, could have been handled at a routine doctor visit something that would produce better outcomes for patients and be less expensive for the state. It perplexes me why, though much has been done over the years to address this urgent need for better preventive care that we still experience the disparities we do. But it underscores the need for this Board to approve the Mercy Care Center. Personally, for me it's about getting people treated quickly, efficiently, and with the right level of care at the right time in the right setting. Let me repeat that. Delivering the right care at the right time is how we save lives.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 120 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 It's helped avoid several illnesses from becoming emergencies. It's how we treat chronic illnesses like COPD, diabetes, and heart conditions and timely identify evolving conditions like cancer, musculoskeletal, and neurological issues to avoid more deaths in our community. As a nurse, I have watched patients come in and out of hospitals for my entire career. Each time someone with a severe illness walks in, I know that if they could have been diagnosed and treated earlier, if they could've seen a specialist before their condition became severe, we would never have had to treat them in the emergency room. As a community health administrator, I also witnessed the challenges of scheduling patients for diagnostic services further delaying care and diagnosis impacting the stage in which their disease is discovered. And as a daughter I also experienced the impact of both my parents diagnosed too late with cancer and lung disease leading to premature deaths in both of them. Ultimately, change needs to happen on the south side of Chicago in delivering healthcare. As a Latina woman myself, born and raised in anTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 121 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 underserved community in Chicago, I want black and brown people in our community to get better care sooner, faster, and closer to home. Without it, we will not be able to turn the troubling trends we see with higher incidence of chronic disease that plagues our community and leads to things like dramatically lower life expectancy rates. This community desperately needs more early detection and diagnosis of illnesses and diseases, better care coordination to better treat chronic diseases, and more cost effective and accessible urgent care and other outpatient services. Let's look at the background for this project and the purpose of the project. Mercy Care Center will be an outpatient clinic, an outpatient entity, separate entity located in the heart of Bronzeville on Chicago's South Side at Oakwood Shores. The center will have the capacity to provide care for up to 65,000 patients each year, offering diagnostic services, urgent care, and care coordination to residents in the community. The location is densely populated, it's close to existing federally qualified health centers that generally do not offer after-hour orTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 122 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 urgent care services. The location is very accessible to public transportation, and opening an outpatient clinic in this community is an important step toward transforming healthcare on the South Side at a pivotal moment in time. And when I say transforming healthcare, the use of transformation is about making something better. It's what we're hoping to do is make something better. The health disparities and inequities in the Chicago area have served as a catalyst for the development of the Mercy Care Center. There is a radical difference in life expectancy within the Chicago communities within the city compared -- when we're looking at the neighborhoods on the north side of Chicago compared to the south side of Chicago. We know that the life expectancy in these communities is only 60 years according to the NYU School of Medicine. That's a 30-year gap. The prevalence of chronic health conditions is a key driver of this disparity. When we look at the Community Health Needs Assessment compiled by the Alliance for Health Equity, 65 percent of all deaths in Chicago and Suburban Cook County wereTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 123 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 attributable to chronic diseases. The primary focus of communities to be served by Mercy Care Center disproportionately suffer from these chronic conditions and desperately need access to early detection and diagnosis of illness and disease. They need better coordination among a multitude of providers to better treat these diseases and a more cost effective and accessible urgent care in a community setting. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted these disparities, as many diagnostic services are currently offered in hospitals or adjacent settings. The proposed facility reduces risk to patients and the fear associated with entering hospital settings and therefore delaying needed screening since COVID-19. We've seen this across the healthcare industry. Public health data also for these communities clearly demonstrates the need for such a center in the community. We look at a recent study by University of Illinois Chicago, their data from their breast cancer in Chicago research showed that delays in diagnosis were one of the indicators, and that really accounted for mostTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 124 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 racial and ethnic disparities in timely breast cancer diagnoses. Worse yet is these patients experience a diagnostic delay of over 60 days. When I spoke to our community health partners, our FQHCs from near north, they're experiencing a four-month delay in trying to get diagnostic screening mammograms for their patients at a current FQHC that's right in this neighborhood. Additionally, we looked at the latest data from the City of Chicago Health Atlas from 2017, the most recent data. The data on breast cancer deaths in the city of Chicago revealed a rate of 25 for 100,000. Yet for African-American women, they experienced a rate 32 per 100,000. They represented more than 50 percent of the deaths. In the communities identified served we also looked at lung cancer mortality rates. Again, can be screened. When we looked at the disparities in that same data set from the Chicago Atlas 2017, data on lung cancer deaths revealed the city of Chicago's rate of 40 per 100,000, yet for African-American 53 per 100,000. And we've looked at -- again, it's 50 percent of the mortality rate within the African-AmericanTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 125 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 population. And when we looked at the communities that we propose to serve, these rates were highest, 50 to 105 per 100,000. And finally, when we review all cancer deaths in the Chicago Atlas study, the mortality rate for all cancer deaths in the city of Chicago was 179 per 100,000. Yet for African-Americans, they experienced a rate of 223. Again, 50 percent of deaths, 50 percent mortality city of Chicago for all cancer deaths is represented by the African-American community. These are examples of mortality disproportionately impacting these communities which can be mitigated by early diagnostic identification of disease and care coordination and navigate the next steps in care continuum for patients. Mercy Care strives to be that conduit, that in-between that really between the at-risk community, our health center partners serving these communities, and our acute care hospitals to create a better resource utilization by getting the patient -- the right patient to the right specialist at the right time. Creating a regional model of care willTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 126 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 focus on collaborating with healthcare partners by facilitating access to early detection of disease, by advocating for patients, by finding provider partners such as hospitals, Federally qualified health centers, and specialty providers to better manage these chronic diseases and early detection. We also know that 30 percent of emergency patients are often better cared for in an urgent care setting for faster care. It's convenient; it's done in the neighborhood. This center will accommodate those patients with access to care that they need without the need to go to a hospital emergency department, will offer cost efficient walk-in service for healthcare needs such as colds, coughs, earaches, all of the nonemergency needed ER-avoidable visits and will be equipped with point of care testing to care for those patients. We know that urgent care centers play a role in the continuum of care, providing services for a wide array of patients who may be unable to see a primary care physician for various reasons, including simply just not yet affiliating with one, and provide easy access to on-demand, timely,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 127 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 affordable care. Urgent care centers do serve as the front door, often connecting these patients with a medical home or specialist. Urgent care centers also provide a community-based alternative to utilizing overcrowded emergency departments for care that is nonurgent or primary care treatable. City of Chicago Health Atlas showed that city of Chicago had a rate of 542 for every 10,000 visits, emergency room visits that could have been managed at a lower level of care such as an urgent care or primary care office. In Mercy Care Center's primary service area, 71 percent of the zip codes had a higher rate than the city of Chicago in avoidable ER visits, and 50 percent of the zip code communities had avoidable ED visits, almost double the citywide rate. In the 14 zip codes in the proposed service area they represented almost 40 percent of all of the avoidable emergency room visits of the city of Chicago. A critical component of the outpatient center will be diagnostic testing. The Mercy Care Center will offer imaging services to identify diseases before they become severe or chronic andTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 128 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 provide patients the right level of diagnostic care through early detection, early intervention, and navigation to appropriate services. Timely access to imaging services and ensuring that imaging reports are promptly returned to primary care providers and that proper patient follow-up is provided for abnormal studies is a challenge in underserved communities. This is further compounded when patients have imaging studies during episodic care visits to an emergency department. Mercy Care Center will provide diagnostic imaging but also through care coordination be able to ensure results and a warm handoff is facilitated back to the patient's primary care or specialty provider. Tests that'll be performed at Mercy Care include CTs, which aid in diagnosis of many disease processes and provide screening and early diagnosis of lung cancer as recommended by the United States Preventive Task Force. In addition, coronary artery screening is another test which can identify early buildup plaque. We can help identify and prevent heart attacks, myocardial infarction, and sudden deathTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 129 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 by early identification. Ultrasound services will be available and are pivotal during pregnancy in identification of internal anomalies such as tumors, cysts, structural problems. Ultrasounds are also important in the early detection and diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. The center will have two types of mammography equipment, a Tomosynthesis unit and a 3-D mammography unit. It's state-of-the-art technology for the detection of early breast cancers. We will be able to accommodate between 35 and 45 mammograms per day. These are women that currently are waiting four months or greater to have a mammogram. MRI technology we'll have will aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal problems. And yes, multiple sclerosis is sorely underidentified and treated in the African-American and Hispanic communities because we present differently; it presents differently when we look at the different ethnic groups. We'll also bring diagnostic screening to the community and technology when we look atTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 130 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 patients for presurgical and we're looking at orthopedics, neurology, general surgery. So the MRI technology will help expedite. Our X-ray services will offer easier access to radiologic scans to provide diagnostic imaging. We'll have a DEXA bone densitometer. And I heard earlier and I wanted to respond to this, yes, we will have physicians. We will have radiologists on stand in our diagnostic treatment center. We will have physicians in our urgent care center and also our midlevel providers, nurse practitioners. Perhaps most unique at Mercy Care Center that I feel is really the glue for all of this is the care coordination services to connect with a primary care provider, specialty providers, and connect patients currently unattached to primary care through the established primary care landscape that currently exist in the community. Currently there's 75 community health centers within 5 miles of the proposed site. Care coordination with these 75 sources of care in the community will focus on transitions of care, patient engagement and advocacy and by assisting patients navigate and connect to needed services.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 131 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 We'll ensure safe and effective transitions of care across settings to prevent poor health outcomes via a warm handoff. We'll use technology, telemedicine. We'll direct patients to mental health services when needed. We'll be directing patients for substance abuse treatment when needed. We'll ensure referrals to the right specialist. We'll accommodate ambulance drop-off as needed for nonemergency care. We'll leverage technology to link patients to needed services and referrals to specialty care. We'll assist with the preauthorization services. The care coordination team will include nurses, social workers, case managers, substance abuse coordinators, and authorization specialists to help patients coordinate and navigate between our healthcare systems. Lastly, I'd like to share our mission statement. We at Trinity Health serve together in the spirit of the Gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our community. As patient needs change and require more access to outpatient care, we remain focused on living this mission and providing the careTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 132 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 patients need. We'll live this mission out by opening the Mercy Care Center. Opening this outpatient center is the right thing to do. Up to 65 percent of patients a year can be cared for in this facility offering the preventive diagnostic care needed earlier to save lives. I spent my entire life in Chicago. I started my career, I would say, as a lifeguard in the city of Chicago. I was a lifeguard in the inner city and on Chicago's lakefront. My hope is really as I continue in my career and as I focus my entire life is to save lives, and I'm hoping that my role as the executive director of Mercy Care Center is to continue to save lives and prevent unnecessary deaths. I urge this Board to stand up for the care of uninsured patients in our community that need the support of Mercy Care Center. I thank you for your consideration. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. Does that conclude your presentation, Mr. Green? MR. GREEN: No, up next I think we have Anita Allen who will have a short statement.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 133 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MS. ALLEN: Good morning. My name is Anita Allen. I've had the pleasure of serving as the director of perinatal services at Mercy Hospital. I am now honored to serve as a board member of the Mercy Care Center board. I appear before this body to support the application. I've spent my career in women's health, and I am so proud to see Trinity investing in an outpatient clinic that will provide women the access to care they need, whether it's breast cancer screening, CT scans, MRI tests, or even flu or stress tests. For those who oppose the greater access to care in our community, I'd like to know why they think women here don't deserve a closer, better approach to treat and diagnose disease. Are they aware that 60 percent of the patients on the south side leave the south side for outpatient care they need? That is certainly not the case on the north side. Do they not think women have every right to access the same level of care? What about men who may know they have prostate cancer, one of the most treatable forms of cancer if diagnosed early? What about children who need vaccinations in orderTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 134 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 to be accepted at their school? When they argue we should protect the status quo, are they aware that nearly 50 percent of all hospital beds on the south side remain empty and that patient that is in the community suffering from high incidence of chronic disease or far lower life expectancy? As President Barrack Obama would say, \"Change is hard but worth the fight.\" I have to agree. I know change is hard but for the patients we serve it is worth the fight. Mercy has served an important role in delivering healthcare on the south side. A vote in the support of the Mercy Care Center is a vote to support the role Mercy can continue to play well into the future and, more importantly, for women, men, and children being able to get more access to the care they need. I hope you will not disappoint us. Please vote to approve this new Mercy Care Center. Thank you for your time. MR. GREEN: And then finally -- thank you, Anita. Finally, John Capasso, last opening statement and then we'll be ready for questions.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 135 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MR. CAPASSO: Good afternoon. My name is John Capasso, and I serve as executive vice president at Trinity Health. I want to thank the staff for reviewing our project, and I also want to thank the Board for reviewing and considering our application. I'm here today to reiterate and emphasize our commitment to open the Mercy Care Center to increase the availability of outpatient urgent care and diagnostic care to residents on the south side. All of us together, policy makers, healthcare leaders, community leaders and patients must find new pathways that protect access to care in the community that allows each of us to contribute toward a solution equally. The Mercy Care Center will be a step in that direction. Trinity Health is a Catholic not-for-profit system that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in providing care for uninsured and government-insured patients. Rather than investing in inpatient care, we intend to invest in outpatient care, more efficient, better for the patient, and more convenient for residents in our communities. It's also the best route to reduceTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 136 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 the disparate outcomes in health that continue to plague the south side community. We've taken time to listen to the needs of the community in devising this plan which will offer preventive and diagnostic care along with care coordination, all of which we know is important and needed on the south side. In fact, 62 percent of residents -- let me say that again -- 62 percent of residents within 3 miles of the clinic say they are likely to use the new outpatient center based on findings of a community poll by ALG Research we commissioned this month. Also, 82 percent of those surveyed said they had a primary care physician, and 79 percent said they have a car or use a bus for transportation. Our Mercy Care Center is on the Chicago Transit Authority's No. 4 bus line that runs along Cottage Grove Avenue. We believe this convenient outpatient center offering urgent care and diagnostic services will significantly increase access to healthcare for local residents. Mercy has maintained a presence in the community for over 100 years providing care for patients in need. We hope this Board will allowTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 137 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 us to continue this presence and our commitment to caring for the underserved. With your support of this project today we can begin construction tomorrow to build an outpatient center on Chicago's south side. Thank you. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you so much. Mr. Kaatz, you have some questions? MEMBER KAATZ: I do, I do. First of all, I'd like to kind of emphasize to you guys that you should put in your application something close to a guarantee to the extent that you can between your diagnostic time and your treatment time. There's an awful lot of material in your narrative of services, demand, proximity, the market, and the importance of continuity of care. But as a Board member, I want to be assured that you are going to do a better job of managing the time between diagnosis and treatments. Am I missing something? Was it in your presentation? Is it something that you could come back and guarantee to us? Is it something you can emphasize? Help me better understand that because I think that that's really the key to your entire project initiative.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 138 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MR. CAPASSO: Thanks, Mr. Kaatz, for that question. This is John Capasso and just for Madam Chair, I'm going to facilitate the conversation on behalf of Trinity, and I would call on Daisy Rodriguez to talk a little bit more about our approach to care coordination, which, as you know, is really the key, timely follow-up. And, you know, it is essential to make sure -- I mean, that really is embodied in the whole approach to being able to provide quicker and more efficient care on an outpatient basis, getting patients to the next level of care based on their diagnosis and based on the follow-up services that they need. So let me just ask Daisy if she might want to comment on that approach that Mr. Kaatz is asking about and essentially asking us to ensure to the Board that the follow-up will be very timely. Daisy. MS. RODRIGUEZ: Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Kaatz, for the question. Really the goal of care coordination is truly to establish those relationships to really be -- to provide the niche and be the glue that hands off.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 139 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 So it would be through established relationships. We currently have our Illinois Breast and Cervical Cancer program. It is one of our largest programs that we currently expedite and hand off care. So we would be working with our hospital partners and through our care coordination kind of a warm handoff expediting and getting these patients -- helping them get to that next level of care, specialty care, really back to their primary care physician. Also, those would be metrics we would be tracking. So absolutely diagnosis, to care, to handoff are metrics in which should be reporting. MEMBER KAATZ: Let me be more specific. Can you give me a 24-hour turnaround on a mammogram? Can you get me scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram within three days? If I come in and I have occlusion, can I get to the cath lab within 90 minutes? I mean, what do you guys really think you're going to be able to accomplish? MS. RODRIGUEZ: So as far as access, absolutely having access measures in place, as I said, we'll be able to manage anywhere from, you know, 30 to 35-plus mammograms per day. We wouldTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 140 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 allow for capacity in a modified open access model so that we could do same-day. As far as connecting patients to that next level of care of getting them to diagnostic, again, requires relationships. And yes, those would be the metrics that we would be striving for and measuring against. MEMBER KAATZ: Would that be a priority at this project? MS. RODRIGUEZ: I'm sorry? MEMBER KAATZ: Would that be a priority of this project? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely. MEMBER GRUNDY: I have a question. Mr. Kaatz, are you finished with your questions? MEMBER KAATZ: I am. I am. MEMBER GRUNDY: I have a question because I'm just trying to understand the care coordination process that you-all would be doing. I'm kind of curious on how you decided on this model. Usually, you know, like the research shows that for care coordination, like facilitators to that process are like colocation of services or integrated services. So since you will be referring peopleTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 141 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 out, will you also be speaking to those social determinants of health as far as transportation, and how will you ensure that those referrals are met? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely. Thank you for the question. As we look at the reason for why this model worked, it's really looking at we have Federally qualified health centers that have care coordinators, they have a care coordination model. We have hospitals and emergency departments that have potentially discharge planners. However, we anticipate patients coming into our system within two different pathways. One would be through the urgent care. So an episodic visit in which you need urgent care. Maybe you can't get ahold of your primary care physician, maybe you don't have established primary care. So that would be one entry, that portal of entry into our system in which we would provide urgent care, we would assess who is currently their managed -- do they have a managed care plan, do they have a care coordinator, are they already part of a system or a group. Well,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 142 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 then we could connect -- again, working with the patient and connecting to that group, to that FQHC, to that perhaps primary care standalone physician in the community and say, your patient is here, this is what we found, we'd like to give you verbal handoff, we're recommending come back to you, or we'd like to work together with you to determine where we'd like to send this patient, where you'd like to refer them to that's a higher level of care if they need a higher level of care. The other process in which a patient may come in is through our diagnostic testing. And diagnostic testing would be through a referral status. So it could be coming from the community, could be coming from our Federally qualified healthcare center partners. I've spoken to a few of them as recently as last week that feel this is a great model for diagnostic testing, gives them alternatives, allows them to keep the patient in the community. However, that conversation, again, care coordinator back to that FQHC to their care coordination partners to say this is what we found, this is how -- do we want to work togetherTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 143 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 to proceed, these are the partners that we have that maybe the FQHC may have or we have together as a system, as a regional system providing care as far as where that next level of care goes. So it's really through care coordination. A lot of the organizations use a referral registry. I think we would want to pride in being more of the verbal or telemedicine handoff where this is a warm handoff and a timely one. MEMBER GRUNDY: So -- also, will your center assist with like transportation and other needs? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, we would have a social worker, care coordination, authorization specialist, which again, when you're looking at what's that next level of care, it is going back to the patient's managed care entity and saying, hey, we're calling to alert you they're going to need preauth for this, but also transportation, whatever the needs are in getting them to that next level of care. MEMBER GRUNDY: Is it just an alert, or will you all be setting it up for the patient? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Again, working with our partners. So for some care coordinations, someTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 144 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 FQHCs prefer to do that themselves. So that is part of this partnership of, would you like us to set it up? We can set it up. Or would you rather? I would prefer if we're handing someone off to do it ourselves. Again, that's part of the ownership and really investing in our patients and the outcomes. MEMBER GRUNDY: Thank you. MEMBER LeGRAND: I also have a question. What hours do you plan to run the urgent care center, and how will you staff it? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Currently hours of operation -- and Mr. Capasso can help me; he may need to jump in and help me because I've only been on board for about four days. But 8:00 to 8:00 for the urgent care center Monday through Friday, and 8:00 to 6:00 on the weekend. John, if you can correct me if -- MR. CAPASSO: Daisy, you're correct. Those are the hours. That's in the business plan so you're right. MEMBER LeGRAND: And then how will you staff it -- oh, I'm sorry. And then staffing, howTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 145 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 will you staff it like NPs, PAs, or physicians, or all of the above? How will you plan to staff that? MS. RODRIGUEZ: So staffing will be all of the above. There's physician FTEs located, medical assistant, nurse practitioner, PA, receptionist. So really the urgent care staff per regulatory guidelines. MEMBER LeGRAND: Will care coordination, the care coordinators be working those same hours, the 8:00 to 8:00 or 8:00 to 6:00 so that if someone comes in at 7:59 in the evening and is seen at that time, will they be able to recommend where to go from there or get all that set up since many physicians' offices close at 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, and that's actually one of the things that is an advantage to us, the social worker, the care coordination department, care managers, case managers, social workers, and that was one of my most pivotal keys in managing the two departments, having social workers and case managers to be able to really fill these needs and connect patients back into the community and the needs that they have that perhaps just aTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 146 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 physician nurse practitioner may not have the skill set nor the relationships established. MEMBER LeGRAND: Okay. Thank you. MR. CAPASSO: Ms. LeGrand, I might just comment that we begin in year one with four FTEs of care managers and by year five growing to six. So we're planning to increase that level of staffing, you know, as the number of patient encounters increases. So we have made accommodation for that. MEMBER LeGRAND: Okay, thank you. MR. CAPASSO: They actually represent 20 percent of the FTEs that are in the business plan. So it's a significant amount. MEMBER LeGRAND: Okay. Thank you. MEMBER MURRAY: I have a number of questions. I want just clarification. Did I hear right that you-all are planning to do diagnostic mammograms at this site? Somebody else asked that question earlier, and I got confused on the answer. MR. CAPASSO: We are planning to do mammograms, yes. MEMBER MURRAY: No, no. The question was -- it was a follow-up question from one of myTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 147 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 colleagues about diagnostic mammograms as opposed to screening mammograms. I was confused with the answer is what I'm saying. MR. CAPASSO: Daisy, do you want to take that? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, so it would be screening mammograms. MEMBER MURRAY: I wanted to be clear about that. All right. So -- (Audio distortion.) MS. AVERY: Mr. Kaatz, can you clarify your question again? MEMBER KAATZ: The question was I asked them how -- how they will affect the time involved in getting a diagnostic mammogram after a screening indicated a mass. MS. AVERY: Okay. Thank you. MEMBER MURRAY: All right. So I am perturbed over this particular application, so let me back up and try to do some context because I don't want to waste time just parsing semantics here. First, let me note that the this is an independent application for what I would not normally call anything, which is one of the thingsTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 148 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 that concerns me. This particular stew of services doesn't make much sense to me, but I'll leave that alone for a minute and say that in the application itself it refers to the closure of Mercy Hospital, which I think makes sense because it's a narrative arc that's going on here. Certainly, were Trinity to decide to continue Mercy Hospital, I doubt very seriously they would be opening up this care center with this particular range of services. So I appreciate that real-world grounding. And so one of my other questions is in terms of the corporation, was a mission discernment done for all of these transformations, and what was the conclusion of the mission discernment if one was done? MR. CAPASSO: Well, Dr. Murray, the creation of this Mercy Care Center, we didn't do a discernment for it, but, you know, as we've talked before, we have done -- you know, recently we did a survey and we've done other work in the past to identify the services that are needed, and it was approved by the Mercy Health System board. So they approved the project. This is a not-for-profit board, of course, as you know, and they approvedTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 149 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 the project. So they're a representative of the community, so they felt this was a service that was needed. So, you know, the process of going through various levels of governance -- Trinity Health, by the way, also their board approved it. So although there was not what I would describe as a typical discernment, it has gone through a lot of board review and review of others to validate that the service is needed and that it will better improve the kind of care that we can provide to the community more quickly than the current services that are being provided. MEMBER MURRAY: So -- so then let me say my concerns. I think there's absolutely no evidence in the literature that diagnostic tests randomly done in an urban setting like this markedly makes a difference. There are plenty of places on the south side of Chicago where CAT scans and mammograms, et cetera, can be done and certainly, especially if one has insurance of any type. The primary care providers that are in the setting already take care of their patients, which means they are able to provide diagnostic testing,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 150 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 though it's becoming increasingly hard to do it close to home hospitalization where needed. So I would argue that the major need in this community is a need for culturally competent, linguistically specific primary care services, which is not one of these three areas that you're talking about. You're talking about a relatively disconnected imaging center; you're talking about a few people to call and try to refer folks elsewhere, otherwise known as coordination of care, and then you're talking about a relatively short-run urgent care center. I was really surprised to hear that it was only going to be open 12 hours a day during the day. Again, every office is not open until 8:00 at night, but many of these practices, certainly the community health centers in the area, as well as sites and even some of the Walgreen's are often open until 6:00 or 8:00 at night, so this doesn't even extend that hour past the 8:00 p.m. mark. So I don't think it adds significantly for urgent care. So if I have a doctor on the south side, and I have a problem at 9:00 or 10:00 at nightTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 151 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 that I'm nervous about, my normal course is to go to the emergency room if my doctor's place of work is not open, and I still have to do that with this. So 8:00 to 8:00 doesn't significantly change the urgent care perspective. So I don't really understand how this adds anything. I think it's an illogical grouping of three kinds of services, first of all. You're really just talking about an urgent care, and the way you talked about the staffing, it's going to be smally staffed just a little bit larger than the typical Walgreen's walk-in clinic, which is usually a staff of one person at a time. So I just -- I don't understand how this -- how the board you all think this actually materially improves care. It's clear to me that the three services by themselves don't do anything for the care. If everybody switched to this model, we'd see more deaths and more chronic disease, so let me put it to you that way. But certainly, as a replacement for a full-service hospital doesn't make sense, but even by itself, even if the hospital were to remain open forever, this particular constellation of services makes absolutely noTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 152 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 sense to me as a physician. And I just -- I don't understand -- I don't even understand why I would choose to use this diagnostic center as opposed to the diagnostic centers I'm using now if I'm practicing on the south side, and I did practice on the south side for a number of decades. So it makes no sense to me, as my colleague said, and it just seems -- MEMBER KAATZ: Can I -- MEMBER MURRAY: Yes. Yes, go ahead. MR. CAPASSO: Can I respond to some of the items that you just mentioned? MEMBER MURRAY: Sure. MR. CAPASSO: Thank you. Well, I guess my first comment is that you said that these services are -- I think; I don't want to misquote you -- are being randomly done. Well, I don't believe that's quite true because this will be -- for the IDTF it will be a referral center. So primary care physicians will refer patients for diagnostic outpatient care. So they're not random; they're the focus of referrals from primary care physicians. And among those primary care physicians are the primary care physicians who operate at FQHCs, andTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 153 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 FQHCs have told us -- you also commented that we're not even going to have primary care there. The FQHCs have told us that we should not provide primary care in this site which will then compete with them. So we're trying to complement them. We're trying to serve their patients in a way that they have said they have difficulties getting services for those patients. So we don't want to compete with them, which is why we won't have primary care on the site. You know, your other comment about this is a model of care that, you know, is kind of random, well, you know, I'm sure you saw recently that Northwestern University announced that they were going to open up a 70,000-square-foot facility to ours on the south side. So quite honestly, we feel like we're in pretty good company if Northwestern is prepared to open up a similar kind of service. The other point I want to make is, you know, the urgent care -- FQHCs are not open for urgent care. They're scheduled visits and so they're visits that, you know, are done based on -- based on scheduling. So this urgent care would beTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 154 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 walk-in and could be able to serve patients who have not scheduled a visit. The other comment, final comment I want to make is that 78 percent -- I'm sorry -- 87 percent of the people in our payor mix will be either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the majority of them, 64 percent are Medicaid. So this is a clinic for people who either are underinsured or not insured. So it is truly a mission to the community that we're trying to address. MEMBER MURRAY: Okay. First, I want to assure you that some FQHCs in our area do take walk-in patients, so I want to assure you of that. So that's one thing. I won't speak to the issue of Northwestern. They're not usually experts in providing primary care, either, so I'll leave that alone, but let's come back to this particular project. So what I hear you offering -- let me put it in the best way I can -- is a diagnostic center for which physicians, primary care physicians can refer their patients. Do you have agreements with any of our FQHCs in this area where they say in writing thatTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 155 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 they are willing to refer some patients to your site as opposed to other places where they refer -- not as opposed to. So they have agreements now is my point; they're referring their patients now. So have you entered into agreements with any other -- MR. CAPASSO: I'll -- I know that -- we don't have any -- the project hasn't been approved yet, so we don't have contracts with commercial insurers; we don't have formal agreements with FQHCs. You know, we first come to the approval, and then all of the rest comes after that. I know that we have been in conversation, in contact with a number of FQHCs in the community, and they have supported this effort. And I know recently Daisy, who is very well connected with our FQHC community has been having those conversations. So, Daisy, do you want to just comment on your conversations that you've had? MS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Thank you. And thank you, Dr. Murray for the question. Yes, absolutely, in speaking with some of our FQHC partners, they shared the delay in getting screening, in getting diagnostic X-rays, MRIs, CT,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 156 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 mammogram, and to have something in the community that can expedite getting the care, they're willing to refer. I'd also like to just discuss a little bit of what we are, and who we are, and why we're choosing to exist. And we're looking at -- I'd like to talk a little bit about maybe a three-tiered level healthcare system in which Tier 1 is those primary care clinics, the FQHCs, the primary care that is done in the community, and then Tier 3 level being your acute care hospitals where you're admitted, where we provide inpatient comprehensive care, where we provide comprehensive emergency care, trauma services, stroke. And then there's this gap, and this is the gap that currently exists between that primary care and what happens when they land in a hospital. And what we're really hoping to do is meet that need, meet that need by if we have our primary care providers that need to get their patients to a screening, to a diagnostic service that we can provide that. If we have a patient in the community that their physician office is closed, they can't get in, or they don't -- they've never been there,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 157 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 that we could be a portal of entry and help navigate them through and connect them with our primary care providers. So we're not hoping to replace either a hospital entity or an FQHC or primary care entity. What we really hope to do and we strive to do is be that camaraderie partner and that assistance in patients flowing through the continuum of care. I see that Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, and I consider us Tier 2 as a continuum of care, and I see us as being a facilitator of continuum of care with our partners. MEMBER MURRAY: I just want to make the note that there is no letter of support from many of our fine FQHCs that service this population. Not a contract, that's simply a letter of support. But let me ask another question. So if I have a patient, and they don't have insurance, and they need some diagnostic service, is this something your center is going to provide free of charge? MR. CAPASSO: Yes. MEMBER MURRAY: So then if you do actually do that, you may be able to get some letters ofTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 158 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 support. I'm just saying this concerns me that there aren't any letters of support from the FQHCs. MR. GREEN: On that point, Dr. Murray, I think Daisy can actually tell you about some letters of support we do have. They just started coming in. I'm looking at a letter of support from Mile Square Health Center, which is, as you know, part of UIC, and the letter is addressed as of today, and it's going to you and all the other Board members. It's from Henry Taylor, chief executive officer. I think Daisy worked with Mr. Taylor, and I think we have two other ones, but I would turn that over to Daisy. MS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, Dr. Murray, so I'm new coming into this project as of late last week, and I sat with Berneice Mills-Thomas and Stephanie Cox-Batson from Near North absolutely also providing a letter of support and will be partners in coordinating care, also. So we will be getting letters of support from them. Also, I'll be meeting with Emma Thompson next week. So, again, I just came on board as of late last week but was able to get support right away from Ms. Mills-Thomas and from Henry Thomas.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 159 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 MEMBER GRUNDY: Ms. Rodriguez, I want to kind of follow up. You mentioned, you know, when they're screened and when they land with a healthcare provider. I think that is the biggest concern that I have. How long will these care coordinators, how long will they follow a patient? Because that -- you know, that -- you know, that time in between until when you-all see them and you refer them out. You know, because you have the community health models, but they actually follow them and they work with them. So I want to know, how long will the care coordinators follow them, and also, how many care coordinators do you-all have on staff or you are expected to have? MS. RODRIGUEZ: The first answer to your question as to how many, we start out with four FTEs in that care coordination department as of year one and really expand up to six when we get to year five. But, again, it's dependent on the number of patients that we're serving and the need. As far as how long will we follow and what are the steps, that really is going to come from working with our FQHC partners. That's one of theTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 160 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 things that actually I sat down with Berneice Mills-Thomas and Stephanie Cox and Dr. Batson last week was really talking about where are the lines and ensuring that the coordination taking place at the community health center side and then our care coordination. In my opinion, the patient comes into our area. Once they step foot, they're part of the family, we're part of their team. So we would continue to follow them and, again, also to ensure that their primary care site is also forwarded the information, whether it's EMR, so that we're capturing some of the public health data, too. So we continue to follow them as long as our community partners feel that we need to. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: This is Deb -- Chairwoman Debby. So I have a question. This urgent care center is going to be about 2 miles from Mercy Hospital; is that correct? MR. CAPASSO: Yes, Madam Chair, yes, that's correct. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. So with the excessive cost, I think Mr. Green talked about the fact that it's the property perhaps that is theTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 161 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 issue and that in that area the costs are higher. Do we really think that is the only reason? Is it the X-ray equipment, diagnostic equipment that you're going to have that it would just be so much higher? If you could speak to that. MR. GREEN: I could speak to that first, and then we'll turn it over to Janeice. Actually, the only criteria, the only criteria that this application was out of compliance with was the construction cost per square foot, and I gave some other reasons why it actually wasn't, but it is the construction cost. So it did relate to the phasing of the project, how long it was going to take and because we were trying to work at nighttime and on the weekends, and it related to -- the building is -- you have to build up the building because of the imaging. The lead walls, you need more support. I know we also have Janeice on the phone who might be able to give you a little bit better insight into sort of some of the costs that we can save. Since we filed it we've actually been able to reduce the cost, and I think even using the State norm, which I don't think is accurate, ITranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 162 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 think we're actually now below the State norm. But I would turn it over to Janeice and if I've missed anything and how we're going to save a little bit money on the construction costs. MS. ARWADY: Thank you. Everything you said I completely agree with. In addition to that, I would also point out that since October when we submitted the CON business case, we have had the benefit of time to review and really value engineer the space, looking at keeping plumbing, and keeping electrical, and keeping things in walls especially where they are today as opposed to blowing out the whole space and starting from scratch. So we were definitely able to improve the bottom line on this project through those value engineering efforts over the last few months. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Thank you. Are there any other questions? MEMBER LeGRAND: I think I have one more question. You were talking about the staffing, and I know Dr. Murray mentioned about like after hours. So let's say I'm a patient who was there at 2:00 in the afternoon for asthma or a heartTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 163 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 problem or something like that, but now it's 9:00 in the evening and I have a question. Who does that patient call? Because I mean, are the physicians or the medical staff there going to be like my primary care physician where I would call an exchange number that they would call me back and answer my questions, or do I have to go to the hospital now that I have a question about something that they told me, or do I need to wait until the next day? MR. CAPASSO: Ms. LeGrand, this is John Capasso. Thanks for the question. Again, I guess, you know, the answer is it depends. I mean, does the patient have a primary care physician who would have gotten, you know, a note from us that the patient had been seen at 2:00 in the afternoon and had received care or had addressed their issue, and, you know, they then would contact their primary care physician. So, again, we're not providing primary care. However, we are providing urgent care. So if there was a patient who was already being seen, if they came from an FQHC, you know, they would be -- you know, their point of contact would beTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 164 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 back to their -- the individuals or the organization that is providing their care. MEMBER LeGRAND: But if they don't have any primary care physician? MR. CAPASSO: We would -- I think part of what you're hearing from Daisy with care coordination is part of our reason for coordinating care is to find them a primary care physician, as well. Now, that may take longer than an afternoon to do that, but that would be our intent. MEMBER LeGRAND: Okay. Thank you. MR. CAPASSO: Did that answer your question? MEMBER LeGRAND: Yep. I think so. MR. CAPASSO: Okay. Thank you. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Any other questions by Board members or State Board staff? (No response.) CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. Hearing none, George, would you please call the roll.

MR. ROATE: Thank you. Mr. Kaatz. MEMBER KAATZ: I implore the team from Trinity and Mercy to do a better job of connecting with your community here, and I think it would be in everyone's best interest if you could be a little more specific with regard to what the community benefits are, how you're measuring them, and how you're reporting them, and how you're educating the community. I'm really bothered by the distance between your organization and the local community, and that's even with the presence of the local board. I'm going to vote yes on this because I've seen this model work well, and if anyone can make this model work well it's the expertise of the likes of Trinity. I think this is an opportunity for you guys to mend some fences and establish a much better relationship with your local community, and I strongly view this, as Mike Constantino made aware a while ago, that this is an independent project, and this in no way interfaces or has anything to do with the issue of Mercy Hospital.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 166 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 So I vote yes. MR. ROATE: Thank you. Ms. LeGrand. MEMBER LeGRAND: I also have some concerns, mainly of the after-hours time, but I think as we have said, this is independent of the hospital. I do think you could make it work, and so I will vote yes. MR. ROATE: Thank you. Dr. Martell -- oh, no, I'm sorry, Dr. Martell is absent. Dr. Murray. MEMBER MURRAY: This is an application when considered independently depends very much on care coordination and coordination with other providers in the area, and I have not seen support from other providers in the area that would logically use these services, and so I'm voting no. MR. ROATE: Thank you, Dr. Murray. Chairwoman Savage. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: I, too, share that I have a lot of concerns based on the State Board staff report not such so much but the testimony and the questions that were asked and the responses,Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 167 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 but I think based on -- I think based on that I'm going to have to say no because I still have some significant concerns. MR. ROATE: Thank you, Madam Chair. That's 2 votes in the affirmative, 3 votes in the negative. CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: So the motion has failed. You have received an intent to deny, and you will be given an opportunity to reappear before the Board and present additional information relevant to the approval of the permit. Please notify Board staff in writing within 14 calendar days to indicate whether you intend to reappear and/or submit additional information. Thank you. MR.

MR. GREEN: Yeah, because I can't find any rules or regulations on diagnostic time and treatment care coordination, urgent care staffing rules, and staffing of PCPs and medical office buildings. Yes, I would definitely want to see the rules and regulations. MS. AVERY: Okay. We'll follow up with you. Give to me dates and times. We'll accommodate them. Okay? MR. GREEN: Thank you. MS.

So next on the agenda is a legislative update. Ann, if you would please proceed. Thank you. MS. AVERY: Hold on one second. Okay. Let's pause for one second while we get Ann's audio up. (An off-the-record discussion was held.) MS. GUILD: The first bill is a bill from the very end of the last General Assembly -- MEMBER MURRAY: I lost Ann so I can't hear her. THE COURT REPORTER: Me, too. (An off-the-record discussion was held.) MS. GUILD: I'll be quick. The first bill is from the tail end of the last General Assembly. It's Senate Bill 1510 and the amendment of interest to this board is House Amendment 3. Many of you will recall that there was a major piece of legislation several years ago that largely dealt with the hospital assessment. Part of that assessment in its last iteration provided money for hospital transformation grants. So this amendment does a couple of things.Transcript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 170 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 First, it establishes some criteria for these hospital transformation proposals, and it's sort of specifying safety nets, and critical access aspect hospitals, and things like focus on workforce, focus on specialty care, disparities, whatever, but there's a whole bunch of categories in there. When it awards these grants, the new legislation allows HFS to ask for the money back if there's no progress being made but not more than 50 percent of what was granted. And they have to ask for this money back before -- if it's a case of a closure of a service or a facility, money has to be requested prior to the Board's consideration of that. So for us it's just going to mean that we're going to have to make sure that before we consider a discontinuation that there's some staff contact that makes sure that we know the situation. The next two bills are identical as they affect the Health Facilities and Services Review Board. These are in the current -- new General Assembly and they are House Bill 158 and House Bill 159. They are both bills of RepresentativeTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 171 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Camille Lilly. One thing that they do is that they add two members to the Health Facilities and Services Review Board, one of which must have experience on the effect of discontinuations on the community. So that one member is also supposed to be appointed after all the other members of the Board are appointed, changes the quorum requirement to 6, no more than 6 in a single political party. In addition to that, the safety net impact statement provisions of our Act are being amended to include an impact on racial and ethnic disparities. So those bills are still in rules, so nothing has happened with them yet. We kind of have some concerns about adding members to the Board, but we will see what we can do to work with the sponsors. We also think that this Board does have some expertise in understanding the impact of closures, so we will be communicating with the sponsors or about that. MEMBER MURRAY: I'm a little confused here. These are still -- have these things passed? MS. GUILD: No, no. The first bill, the Senate Bill 1510, that did pass both chambers butTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 172 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 has not yet been signed by the governor. The other two, House Bill 158 and House Bill 159 has -- those two bills were just introduced. They are both in House rules committee, so they have not proceeded anywhere. That's kind of the first step once they're drafted is they go to rules committee, and then they get assigned to a substantive committee. MEMBER MURRAY: So, Madam Chair, we haven't set an agenda item for us to discuss this. At one point I wish we would. As we've talked about several times, we have a long Board whose mission has changed over the years a little bit with rules, some of which are outdated. I really do think there's a time to have a review of what we really want this Board to do and whether or not the planning aspects, which is what some of these newer things are really beginning to look at of this Board should be invested in. They've never been invested in; we've never really paid for planning. Otherwise, we're going to have these problems when we have a cacophony of rules and regulations that don't really do what the intention is, then we have legislators understandably tryingTranscript of Board Meeting Conducted on January 26, 2021 173 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM DRAFT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 to correct that, but they're again doing it in a patchwork fashion. So it seems to me that some more organized review would be appropriate. MS. GUILD: We are actually working on putting together an agenda for a meeting like that to discuss. I'm not so sure that at this point or even at any point that you're going to control any legislator who wants to introduce a bill. And actually, these two recent bills are very long bills, and there's only a small part that pertains to us. I think once we find out about a bill like this it's our job to go talk to the sponsors and see where they are. But yes, we are planning a, quote, planning session. MEMBER MURRAY: Okay. Thank you. MS. GUILD: Kind of where we've been, where we're going. MEMBER MURRAY: Thank you. MS. AVERY: Yeah. We have been working on that since your last feedback, Dr. Murray, so as soon as that is all put together we'll be running it by the Board.

Okay. So does anyone else have any other questions about the legislation for Ann? (No response.) CHAIRWOMAN SAVAGE: Okay. So please note that the next meeting is scheduled for March 16, 2021. And thank you to everyone for attending. Please continue to be safe, and may I have a motion to adjourn? MEMBER LeGRAND: Motion to adjourn. MEMBER MURRAY: Second.
