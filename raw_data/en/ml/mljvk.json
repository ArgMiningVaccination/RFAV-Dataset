His special interest is learning how to apply to practical healing Rudolf Steiner's invaluable and profound insights into the human being. Dr. Incao wrote two chapters and the concluding summary of the book, [The Vaccination Dilemma](https://lanternbooks.presswarehouse.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=61896), edited by Christine Murphy and published by Steiner Books. Dr Incao's article on vaccinations and the immune system, \"Supporting Children's Health\" in the September 1997 issue of Alternative Medicine Digest magazine, generated much interest and was reprinted in Asia, Norway, Canada and Australia. He has served as an expert witness in court of law in several trials concerning vaccinations and has submitted medical opinions in support of parents seeking compensation for their vaccine-damaged children. Dr. Incao studied liberal arts and life sciences at Wesleyan University, and then received his MD from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1966. He studied Anthroposophy and Anthroposophic Medicine in Forest Row, England and Arlesheim, Switzerland. Dr. Incao was the first president of the Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine (PAAM) in the US. He teaches in training programs for anthroposophic physicians and training programs for Waldorf teachers. [Dr. Philip Incao](http://philipincao.crestonecolorado.com/) was one of the first few practitioners of Anthroposophic Medicine in the U.S., and had a busy family practice in upstate New York in a Waldorf school-and biodynamic farming community for 23 years, until 1996. He then moved to Denver to help the growth of anthroposophic medicine in the west. He founded and practiced at the Gilpin Street Holistic Center in Denver until August 2006, when he moved to Crestone, Colorado where he continues to practice part-time in his home. My process of enlightenment on vaccines was gradual, but two of the most important early factors in my learning process in the 1980's were the book DPT: A Shot in the Dark by Barbara Loe Fisher and Harris Coulter, originally published by Warner books and the TV documentary, DPT: Vaccine Roulette, produced by Leah Thompson. Both of the above were so well conceived, well-done, and made such powerful, transparent cases against DPT that the establishment backlash was swift and severe. The book, which got good reviews and was selling well, was taken out of circulation and off the shelves by Warner books and they refused to release the copyright to another publisher. As for the TV documentary, after its initial airing in the DC area, the planned nationwide airing was cancelled and the producer Leah Thompson was blackballed from meaningful TV work for years. She was later honored by the National Vaccine Information Center for her courageous commitment to truth in her reporting. "}
