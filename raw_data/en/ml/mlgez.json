It is with pleasure that I also report on the many other achievements over the last year for ASCIA and thank allthe ASCIA members who have contributed to theseachievements. These achievements are consistent with the objectives, strategies and activities which were outlined in theASCIA STRATEGIC PLAN 2003-2008. A summary of progress is included at the end of this report. INVESTMENT OF ICACI 2000 PROCEEDS The proceeds from ICACI 2000 have now been investedwith Macquarie Bank for one year. The return oninvestment has been approximately 8%, which is arounddouble the return we would have received with only acash investment. Unfortunately ASCIA paidapproximately $8,000 in taxes, as ASCIA did not haveDeductible Gift Recipient (DGR) charity status at the time. I am pleased to report that ASCIA recently made successful applications to the Australian Taxation Office(ATO) for Tax Concession Charitable status (income taxexemption) and Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) Charitystatus. ASCIA is now confirmed as a Health Promotion Charity, that is, to promote the prevention or the control of allergic & immune diseases in human beings. It is thought that the key factors in ASCIA achieving this status are the provision of educational materials for the public on the ASCIA website and implementation of the ASCIA grant & scholarship programs in the 2004-2005 financial year. 1ascia annual report 2005 CONTENTS Page President's Report 1 Treasurer's Report 5 Executive Officer's Report 7Editor's Letter 8ASCIA Meetings 9Representative & Committee Reports 12Medical Student Grant Recipient Reports 19ASCIA Awards & Grants 25New ASCIA Members 4:24 PM Page 2ALLOCATION OF ICACI 2000 PROCEEDS This year a total of seven applications for ASCIA grants were received and the successful applicants wereannounced at the 2005 AGM. In the 2004-2005 financial year $48,000 was awarded for the following two projects (summaries are publishedin this annual report): $25,000 - to part fund human resources andinfrastructure for the ASCIA PID REGISTER $23,000 - to establish a diagnostic framework for the ANAPHYLAXIS TO NATIVE AUSTRALIAN VENOMSPROJECT. In 2004-2005 a total of $13,000 was awarded by ASCIA to four medical students for their elective studiesrelating to clinical immunology and allergy. Their reports are also published in this annual report. ASCIA received several applications for the 2005-2006 medical student scholarships and the successfulapplicants will be announced before the end of 2005.One of the criteria that has changed in 2005 is that theapplicants must now be citizens of Australia or NewZealand to be eligible for scholarships. During the 2004-2005 financial year seed funding of $10,000 was provided for the Professional Certificate of Allergy Nursing which is being run by the University of SA. Thank you to Deryn Thompson, Dr William Smith andall the ASCIA members involved in establishing this course. In summary ASCIA spent $176,000 on educational activities, including $71,000 on educational grants and $51,000 on ASCIA Education Resources brochures and the ASCIA website during the 2004-2005 financial year.ASCIA WEBSITE AND MEDIA COVERAGE There is a continuing increase in website visitors. Eachmonth there are around 1 million hits, 60,000 page views and 15,000 unique visitors. This is ten fold the number of visits compared to 2001. In 2005 this waslargely contributed to by the substantial media coverageof the World Allergy Day (a World Allergy Organisationinitiative) on 8 July, which continued months later. The latest updates to the ASCIA website include new home page graphics, which are consistent with ASCIA brochure images and a list of Allergists and Clinical Immunologists in Australia and New Zealand (who consented to be listed) on:http://www.allergy.org.au/allergists/Aust-NZ.htm ASCIA COMMITTEES, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND WORKING PARTIES These groups have continued to work on position papers and guidelines, many of which have been published.Major achievements of these groups are as follows: ASCIA Anaphylaxis Working PartyAnaphylaxis in schools guidelines published in Journalof Paediatrics & Child Health and Training Resourcesfor Educators & Allied Health Professionals. ASCIA Clinical Practice CommitteeSkin Prick Testing manual and workshop at the ASCIAASM 2005. ASCIA Education CommitteeUnorthodox test editorial published in the MedicalJournal of Australia and some new ASCIA EducationResources articles. Allergy Working PartyAustralian andsuccessful in attracting additional funding. ASCIA Laboratory Practice CommitteeTwo guidelines now published on the ASCIA website. ASCIA Paediatric Interest GroupAllergy prevention guidelines summary published in MJA ASCIA Primary Immune Deficiency (PID) committeeSignificant increase in registered patients andsuccessful in attracting additional funding. Congratulations to all members of these groups. ASCIA will endeavour to improve communications and wherenecessary fund some face to face meetings to facilitate greater efficiency and finalisation of key documents. 2ascia annual report 20056759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 3INTERACTIONS WITH GOVERNMENT AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS On Friday the 24th of February 2006 ASCIA is planning to hold an ASCIA Symposium on Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Canberra, which will be targeting government bodies such as the TGA, PBAC, HIC,Commonwealth government advisors and ministers. The aim of this symposium is to establish a format of a bi-annual meeting with the aim to create new lines ofdialogue with government agencies. In August 2005 ASCIA requested amendments to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)regarding the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing of EpiPen, as proposed (and voted on) at the ASCIA AGM 2004. If successful, patients of all ages willbe able to obtain two reimbursed EpiPens and continuingsupply of EpiPens will require regular reviews by anAllergist/Clinical Immunologist. The delay in this requestwas due to waiting for a resolution to the short expirydate problem CSL was having with the supply of EpiPensin Australia. Coinciding with the appointment of a new Queensland Health Minister, Director General and Deputy Director Generals, ASCIA sent letters (with Anaphylaxis and PIDDbrochures) to these officials, to acknowledge theirappointments and highlight the importance of having apublic hospital service, particularly for children withpotentially life threatening anaphylaxis or primaryimmune deficiencies. This has resulted in a meetingwith one of the Deputy Director Generals andsubsequent amendments to the proposal for a paediatricpublic allergy and immunology service in Queensland. ASCIA symposia at other professional meetings (ASI, ASMR) were supported in late 2004 and an ASCIA session was held at the 2005 RACP meeting. ASCIA would like to continue having an ASCIA session at theRACP meeting and an ASCIA session is confirmed for theTSANZ ASM in 2006. However with so many other commitments to meetings the involvement of ASCIA inASI and ASMR is being reviewed. 3ascia annual report 2005 ASCIA continues to be represented on national asthmaorganisations, the National Asthma Reference Group (NARG) and the National Asthma Council (NAC). ASCIA currently has three representatives on the World Allergy Organisation (WAO): Associate Professor Connie Katelaris (WAO Secretary-General) Dr Dominic Mallon (WAO House of Delegates) Dr Tiffany Hughes (WAO Editorial Board). Although ASCIA was unsuccessful (by only one vote) for the 2011 World Allergy Congress (WAC) another bidwill probably be made for the 2013 WAC in Perth,Western Australia. Thank you to all ASCIA members who were involved in the tremendous effort which was made for the bid, aswell as the bid partners, Perth Convention and ExhibitionCentre and the WA Government. IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY TRAINEES An ASCIA postcard was developed in 2005, which hasreplaced the larger brochure that was sent out in 2004 and 2003. The postcard briefly profiles ClinicalImmunology and Allergy training and is sent toapproximately 500 Physician trainees in Australia andNew Zealand each year. It directs potential trainees to the:Trainee and Allergists/Clinical Immunologists sections on the ASCIA website:http://www.allergy.org.au/trainees/index.htmhttp://www.allergy.org.au/allergists/index.htm We trust that these resources will assist in the recruitment of advanced trainees. Thank you to Dr Richard Wong and other ASCIA members who arerepresentatives on J SAC for their continuing efforts in the area of training.6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 44ascia annual report 2005 ASCIA STRATEGIC PLAN 2003-2008 AND PROGRESS MADE IN 2004-2005 STRATEGY: To improve profile with basic trainees, medical students and graduates to increaserecruitment of new trainees. PROGRESS: Activities in 2005 have included the production and distribution of the ASCIA traineepostcard, new trainee website links and medicalstudent scholarships.

PROGRESS: Activities in 2005 include the new Allergy & Clinical Immunology section on the ASCIA website,ASCIA sessions at other meetings, the Nurses allergycourse at Uni of SA and a Primary Care Allergy &Immunology Update day planned for the ASCIA ASM 2006. STRATEGY: To enhance profile with and understandingof relevant commonwealth and state governmentdepartments and processes (and vice versa). PROGRESS: Activities in 2005 include the planning of a special seminar fro government agencies in Canberrain February 2006. STRATEGY: To continue to build profile with the mediaand public. PROGRESS: Activities in 2005 include media awards and media releases to coincide with publishing ofposition papers and World Allergy Day. A publicseminar is planned (with Anaphylaxis Australia) tocoincide with a new Allergy Expo in November 2006. STRATEGY: To utilise the many facets and expertisewithin the discipline. PROGRESS: Several position papers and guidelines have been published by working parties, committeesand special interest groups.STRATEGY: To be more proactive vs reactive toemerging issues. PROGRESS: In 2005 three important position papers were published. STRATEGY: To use the funds generated from ICACI2000 for projects which benefit the disciplines ofclinical immunology and allergy. PROGRESS: In 2005 funds were allocated to the ASCIA PID Register and the Anaphylaxis to Australianinsects project. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Specific initiatives for 2006 include: Transforming our dialogue with relevant Commonwealth agencies through a symposium in Canberra prior tothe February Council meeting. Improved support for our committees and workingparties through sponsoring some face-to-facemeetings. Establishing a primary care education activity at annualscientific meetings. Managing the ASCIA ASM 2006 (and future ASMs) in-house. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to all the new ASCIA members who are listed later in this Annual Report. I wish all readers a safe, healthy, happy and prosperous 2006. 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 5 ASCIA Treasurer's Report A/PROF JO DOUGLASS The audit for the 2004-2005 was prepared by the accountants BHEdelstein & Co in time for the2005 ASCIA Annual GeneralMeeting. As you can appreciatethis is a very quick turnaroundtime for a full audit and the process involves obtaining detailed documentationregarding management and reporting procedures. Whilst examining the audit summary (financial position and operating statement) it is important to understandthat there was an extraordinary amount ofunprecedented expenditure by ASCIA in the 2004-2005financial year. EDUCATIONAL GRANTS AND PROJECTS As outlined in the President's report, ASCIA spent a total of $176,000 in the 2004-2005 financial year on educational activities relating to immunology and allergy.This represents around twice the amount spent in theprevious financial year. With the budget and funding processes for ASCIA educational grants/projects now established it is essentialthat anyrequests for funding are made using these processes. Application forms are available on the ASCIAwebsite: http://www.allergy.org.au/awards/index.htm LIQUIDATION OF PCO FOR ASCIA ASM 2004 Soon after receiving some proceeds from the professional conference organiser (PCO) of the ASCIAASM 2004 (Worldwide Conference Professionals) theASCIA accountants determined that there was a varianceof $17,475.50 when the profit and loss statement for the ASM was prepared. After several attempts torecover these funds, we were informed that WCP was under administration and is now in liquidation. We havecompleted the necessary documentation and haveparticipated in a creditors meeting. 5ascia annual report 2005 OTHER ANOMALIES Website support for the ASCIA PID Register was twice the amount it should have been, as Tax Invoices for both2003-2004 and 2004-2005 were received and paid inthe 2004-2005 financial year. Similarly the audit and accounting fees for both 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 were received and paid inthe 2004-2005 financial year. These variances account for $37,575.50 which is around the same amount as the deficit of $36,010. Hence although a deficit was recorded in 2004-2005, this is offset by the large surplus in 2003-2004 of $99,492. In October 2005 Jill Smith (ASCIA Executive Officer) and I met with BH Edelstein (accountants), to discuss howthe ASCIA accounting fees can be reduced in future.One of the outcomes of this meeting is that ASCIA willprovide some limited book-keeping, on a quarterly basis,which will save around $6,000 per year. This has nowbeen implemented and will affect the fees for 2005-2006 which will be paid in the 2006-2007 financial year. FINANCIAL ($ AU) POSITION 04-05 03-04 450,869 486,879 Total Revenues In 2004-2005 ASCIA spent $176,000 on educational grants and projects, including $71,000 on educationalgrants and $51,000 on ASCIA Education Resourcesbrochures and the ASCIA website. In 2005-2006 ASCIA expenditure on educational activities will increase to $255,000. To allow for this increased funding ASCIA has undertaken to make considerable cost savings by: organising the ASCIA Annual Scientific Meetings in-house preparing quarterly spreadsheets for the accountants successfully applying for DGR Charity status. It will be important that funding strategies for educational grants and projects are regularly reviewed byASCIA, to be consistent with changes in revenue andeducational opportunities. Note: The financial position and operating statements should be read in conjunction with the compilationfinancial reports, available from ASCIA. 6ascia annual report 2005 ASCIA BUDGET 2005 - 2006 As a result of information collated from the last threeaudits (which have become mandatory since the transferof ICACI 2000 proceeds) it is now possible for ASCIA tocompile the following budget for 2005-2006.

The main highlights from 2005 are as follows: Successful applications for ASCIA to be registered with the Australian Taxation Office as a Health Promotion Charity , that is to promote the prevention or the control of allergic & immune diseases in humanbeings and have Tax Concession Charity and Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status. Preliminary organisation of the ASCIA Annual ScientificMeeting (ASM) 2006, incorporating a primary careupdate day and development of processes for futureASCIA ASMs. Major updating of the ASCIA website including newimages on the homepage, information for Physiciantrainees and a list of Clinical Immunologists andAllergists in Australia and New Zealand. Involvement in the ASCIA bid for the 2011 WorldAllergy Congress. Management of ASCIA educational projects, awards,grants and scholarships. Review of management and financial practices forASCIA audit and development of an ASCIA budget for2005-2006. Regular communication with ASCIA members via the ASCIA e-newsletter (which aims to keep members informed of ASCIA issues and activities in a timely manner). MAIN MEDIA COVERAGE The main publicity in 2005 was generated by the ASCIAmedia release for World Allergy Day, the Sunday Programon Anaphylaxis and the subsequent coronial inquestinto the death from anaphylaxis of a NSW boy on aschool camp. A summary of the main media coverage is as follows: Channel 9 (Sunday Program - two part feature on Anaphylaxis). Channel 7 (Sunrise interview for World Allergy Day). Over 20 newspaper articles and 20 radio interviews for World Allergy Day. Several Pharmacy journal articles, particularlyregarding World Allergy Day. Several articles in magazines, including The Bulletin, Medical Observer, Australian Dr, New Zealand Dr andGood Medicine. Two major articles in The Weekend Australian in early Spring. SPONSORSHIP UPDATE As a relatively small professional society ASCIA isdependant on educational grants from sponsors toenable the ASCIA website and ASCIA EducationResources to continue to develop. We are extremelygrateful for the support provided by the followingorganisations over year. Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 8FUTURE DIRECTIONS A major challenge for ASCIA is to maintain the high level of sponsorship in future years. By organising theASCIA ASMs in-house we hope to be able to achieve this by offering flexible, attractive and appropriatesponsorship packages. The inclusion of a Primary Care Allergy & Immunology Update Day at the ASCIA ASM 2006 should serve as amodel for future ASMs, and thus help achieve one of thekey ASCIA strategies, of providing high quality educationfor General Practitioners in allergy and immunology. In 2006 ASCIA will also be involved, in conjunction with Anaphylaxis Australia, in public seminars on allergy, as part of a new Allergy Expo which will run from 11-12 November 2006 in Sydney. This isconsistent with the ASCIA strategy of increasing itsprofile with the media and the public. Editor's Letter DR SHERYL VAN NUNEN It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the ASCIA Annual Report 2005. This publication replaces the annual printed newsletter and its aim is to provide ASCIA members and supporterswith a hard copy of the highlights of each year, including: financial and other reports presented at the ASCIAAnnual General Meeting relevant information from the regular electronic newsletters \"ASCIA News Update\" which are sent outat least monthly to ASCIA members by our ExecutiveOfficer to ASCIA members. This Annual Report and the electronic newsletters are archived on the ASCIA website, under \"newsletters\". Information or reports you would like to submit to the ASCIA e-newsletters should be sent by email toeducation@allergy.org.au 20056759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 9 ASCIA Meetings 31 AUG - 4 SEPT 2005 QUEENSTOWN, NEW ZEALAND A/PROF ROHAN AMERATUNGA As ASCIA ASM 2005 attracted around 250 delegates and 6 Platinum Sponsors it was very successful. Informationcompiled for this meeting shouldbe helpful for planning futureASCIA meetings. We have tried to build relationships with the companies and provide them with an appropriate profile at themeeting. Unfortunately the venue was such that wehave had to limit the number of booths for sponsors. We would like to be able to use some of the proceeds from the meeting for training and education purposes inNew Zealand. (This has been discussed at an ASCIA Council meeting and ASCIA New Zealand members have been asked to submit applications for 2006 ASCIA grants.) The conference organising company we used gave us very good support, but at considerable expense. Infuture I believe future ASMs can successfully beorganised by ASCIA, with the organising committeesproviding the scientific input and the organisation of thevenue etc by a designated person. This would result inconsiderable cost savings and therefore increasedprofits, particularly with increasing numbers of delegatesand sponsoring companies. 9ascia annual report 2005 ASCIA 17TH ANNUAL ASM 7 - 10 SEPT 2006 MANLY BEACH DR KARL BAUMGART The themes for the first three days (7-9 Sept) are: \"immunity\" (Lupus and other autoimmune diseases, primary immune deficiencydiseases) \"sensitivity\" (Anaphylaxis, drug allergy, insect and food allergy) \"inspiration\" (Asthma and allergy, rhinitis and sinus disease).

On theother month we discussinteresting and informative casesand review recent literature. Queensland is undergoing major changes with the recent inquiries and changes in the Health Minister , DirectorGeneral of Health and also many senior QueenslandHealth personnel. We have taken this opportunity to contact Queensland Health and the Queensland Government again regardingthe need for public immunology and allergy services inQueensland. NEW SOUTH WALES REPORT DR LOUISE EVANS Three successful and well attended meetings have beenheld in Sydney this year: A dinner meeting in February with presentation by ProfAndrew Kemp Clinical Grand Rounds at Royal North Shore Hospital in October An end of year function in December featuring apresentation by a Forensic Pathologist on \"Food allergyand forensics\". We are very grateful for the support we receive from industry for these meetings. It seems that the mostsuccessful and easier to organise meetings aresponsored, with a dinner speaker selected by ASCIA,which has been the case over the past two years. VICTORIA REPORT DR JO SMART We have held three successful and well attended dinnermeetings this year. In additionallergy workshop meetings alsooccur 3-4 times per year. Victorian PID sites have rallied to improve our PID reporting rates and a PID transitionclinic has been established (from RCH to 2 adult sites). ASCIA continues to have ongoing representation at the bimonthly Victorian IVIG Users Group Meetings. WESTERN AUSTRALIA REPORT DR TIFFANY HUGHES WA members of ASCIA were kept very busy during the first half of2005, preparing and presentingthe bid for WAC 2011. Thank youto everyone who helped us to doas well as we did. Local meetings continue to be held monthly and are well attended. Plans for the ASCIA ASM in Fremantle are well underway. The dates are 13-17 November 2007. SOUTH AUSTRALIA REPORT DR PATRICK QUINN In SA we continue to have well attended monthly meetings. Anaphylaxis awareness week was launched in SA this year,coinciding with the establishmentof Anaphylaxis Australia in SA. They have gained some media coverage and as a resultof this some extra funding has been pledged. ascia 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 13ASSOCIATE REPRESENTATIVE REPORT DERYN THOMPSON It has been a busy year with the formation of the Professional Certificate of Allergy Nursing well underway. ASCIA has beeninstrumental in enabling Universityof South Australia to establish thecourse and it should be ready for first semester 2006. It will be an external course, delivered on-line to enable nurses from all states andoverseas to have equal access. Content is beingreviewed by those Council members who expressed an interest to do so. I thank them for their valuable inputand guidance. Encouragement for patients attending allergy/immunology services and clinics, medicalpractitioners and health professionals to access theASCIA patient educational resources has provensuccessful, as hits to the website have increaseddramatically over the past 12 months. Many associatemembers are involved with promoting access to theASCIA website and the available, informative resources More hospitals are establishing roles of a 'designate allergy /immunology nurse'. This is a very importantdevelopment, as the incidence of allergy is still risingand funding for most of the hospital allergy departmentsis still not of the highest priority to those with control ofthe purse strings. South Australia's group of allergy nurses, who meet bi- monthly, have continued their professional developmentand education program this year with education talksrelated to allergy and immunology, including Respiratory Medicine, Aspirin Sensitivity, the Eczema education studyconducted at Flinders Medical Centre andImmunotherapy. At the meeting this year in Queenstownwe have encouraged other states and New Zealand totake a similar stance and encourage meetings andsupport among nursing members. The nurses throughoutAustralasia keep in contact via email.One highlight of 2005 was the official Australian launch of Anaphylaxis Awareness Week in South Australia, inMay and the setting up of the South Australian branch ofAnaphylaxis Australia Inc. They are planning to increasepublic awareness in South Australia with several ideas inthe pipeline. Nurses and other associate members inother states are also working hard to raise the profile ofanaphylaxis within the general and medical community.Maria Said and her team's work continues indefatigably. We bid farewell to Carol Jones, who is no longer in immunology/allergy nursing in NSW. Her enthusiasmback at the inaugural Nurses' day at the AnnualScientific meeting in Adelaide in 2002 indirectly resultedin the formation of the South Australia Allergy Nurses'Group and was part of the catalyst for the developmentof the allergy nurses' course. We thank her and wish herall the best. Welcome to the new Associate members and I hope their association with ASCIA will be rewarding and valuableand encourage them to access the many resourcesavailable to them via the internet. 13ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 14GP LIAISON REPORT DR VICTORIA SMITH Most general practitioners are now aware of allergy, anaphylaxisand the action plans. Areas thatstill need to be addressed are: how to access an allergist in each state how to find the ASCIA website links between allergy and eczema, asthma, growthretardation and infant feeding problems an avenue of education towards childcare nurses. jack jumper ant and ant anaphylaxis - there is a growing swell of people who are aware that desensitisation withfunding could be available as a treatment foranaphylaxis to ants. The year in summary: I think ASCIA has to be given a huge pat on the back for the amount of literature andpublication that hits the general practitioners' desks andis probably read, used and referred on to patients.However, increasing awareness is still required through Government, child health and patient circles of allergic disease. I look forward to another exciting yearwith ASCIA. CLINICAL PRACTICE REPORT DR WILLIAM SMITH In 2005 the Clinical Practice committee has mainly been addressing the issue of skin prick testing. A manual for skin prick testing have been prepared and is in thefinal stages of review. Thank you to the ASCIA members who have provided valuable input to this document. The skin prick testingworkshop in Queenstown also presented an opportunityto receive feedback. Once finalised the manual is intended as basic information for specialists, as educational material fornon-specialists and as a resource for skin prick testingworkshops at future ASCIA Annual Scientific Meetings. 14ascia annual report 2005 6759 05 Final DR SEAN RIMINTON MS PHILIPPA KIRKPATRICK The 2004-2005 period has been a great year for the ASCIA Primary Immune Deficiencies (PID) Register. Therehave been many new developments arising, including: Improved data collection - We have over 1150 registered patients and this number has been rising rapidly. There have been 434 new registrations in the 2004/2005 financial year which is a record for theASCIA PID Register. SA has the most registrations perhead of population, followed by WA, NSW and ACT.Victoria has recently registered many patients and isbeginning to reach the reporting level of the stateslisted above. NZ are working hard to get their patientsregistered. There have been advances in QLD with a small amount of staff time being allocated toregistering patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital. Clinical Practice Guidelines - New clinical practice guidelines for IVIG use and supply are being developedby the National Blood Authority (NBA). We coordinatedthe ASCIA response to the discussion paper distributedby the NBA and thank all members who made acontribution. Dr Sean Riminton will be further contributingto the NBA IVIG working party and writing committee. IgG Subclass Deficiency - The NBA discussion paper has listed IgG subclass deficiency as one of tenconditions for which the effectiveness of IVIG therapyis under review. We request particular attention ofmembers to improving the quality of data for thisindication. We also plan to hold discussions withmembers of ASCIA and the ASCIA PID Committee todevelop Consensus statement on IgGsubclass deficiency.Sponsorship - CSL Bioplasma Pty Ltd are providing $20,000 per year and a new sponsor Octapharma hasprovided $15,000 for the 2005/2006 financial year. PID patient support initiatives - We have been involved in coordinating meetings between partiespreviously involved with PID patient support groups inAustralia and the chairman and general manager ofIDFNZ, a very successful NZ PID patient support group.We launched a discussion paper outlining ways in which an Australian group could be developed withassistance and support from the NZ group. A meetingof all interested parties was held at the ASCIA ASM2005. We have also been involved in coordination ofthe first meeting of 'IDF Australia', at RPA hospital inlate November 2005. ARCBS - Discussions have taken place with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) todetermine how we can work together to achieve thecommon goal of guiding the use of immunoglobulinreplacement resources. SE ASIA - Inquiries have been made about extending PID project collaboration with south-east Asia and China. RESEARCH - Interest has been expressed in research regarding links between the PID Register and cancer registries and the link between PID and autoimmune and allergic disease. We are also involved incollaboration between clinicians and scientists.However, we have been unsuccessful in our applicationfor an enabling grant from the NHMRC. PROMOTING THE ASCIA PID REGISTER - Information about the ASCIA PID Register has been published invarious places including; RACP News, ConcordConnections newsletter and the (AGSA) newsletter. Philippa wasawarded 'Highly Commended' at Concord HospitalClinical Week for her work on the ASCIA PID Register.The Register has also been promoted at both local andinternational meetings including the IUIS PIDConsensus working party in Hungary. ASCIA GRANT - The $25 000 grant provided by ASCIA in the last financial year has been essential in allowingus to move forward and work towards the objectives ofthis important project. 15ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 16The objectives over the coming year are to: 1.

The full version of the Position Statement is available on the ASCIA website http://www.allergy.org.au /pospapers/Allergy_prevention.htm and has generated a great deal of publicity for ASCIA since it was publishedin late 2004. Guidelines for food allergen challenges are in the process of being developed and guidelines forimmunotherapy still need to be developed. A database of research activities is being compiled by A/Prof Susan Prescott to help prevent duplication of efforts. LABORATORY PRACTICE REPORT A/PROF PETERHOLLINGSWORTH The following ASCIA Guidelines were published on the ASCIAwebsite earlier this year: Measurement of Uncertainty (inter-batch/lot precision)Guidelines Consensus Guidelines on Anti-Intrinsic Factor Antibody Testing The ASCIA list of rare tests and their providers is in the process of being updated for the ASCIA website. Regarding PSTC items, this committee is reviewing the item numbers for Tryptase and in vitro IgE testing. Weneed to propose appropriate panels of allergens. This committee is also requesting that suppliers write to their customers regarding inappropriate reporting ofresponse units for in vitro Specific IgE test reporting. 17ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 18INSECT ALLERGY WORKING PARTY REPORT A/PROF SIMON BROWN In February 2005, the ASCIA Insect Allergy Working Party(IAWP) completed and lodged acomprehensive \"Anaphylaxis native ant venoms;major allergens, cross-reactivity,diagnosis and risk assessment\". This has resulted in the securing of the following two grants: 1. A/Prof Simon Brown. Viertel Clinical Investigatorship- Laboratory assessment of venom immunotherapy:$60,000 single payment. 2. A/Prof Simon Brown, Dr Robert Heddle, Mr Michael Wiese, Dr Richard Loh, A/Prof Raymond Grant- Life-threatening allergy(anaphylaxis) to Australian ant venoms: $338,000over three years. Ethical approval has been obtained for the coordinating site and approvals at each participating site are nowbeing sought. Patient samples are now being collectedat approved sites. In addition to ASCIA and NHMRC funding, further infrastructure funding has been secured from theUniversity of Western Australia and the State Governmentof Western Australia. Collection of ant nests has begun and a laboratory has been set up for the extraction of venom from each species. The success of this project to date can be directly traced to the ASCIA start-up funds provided to the IAWP, anddemonstrates the importance of these ASCIA grants. ANAPHYLAXIS WORKING PARTY REPORT DR MIKE GOLD DR ROB LOBLAY ASCIA Training Resources for educators and allied health professionals have now been extensively reviewed andare available on the ASCIA website under \"Anaphylaxisresources\". It is intended that a training presentation be developed for Anaphylaxis, based on these resources. A letter was sent to the PBAC regarding the reimbursement of 2 EpiPens for >17yrs and we should have an outcome by the end of 2005. CSL have addressed the short expiry dates of EpiPens by having Dey laboratories package EpiPens withAustralian labeling and discouraging warehouses andpharmacies to stockpile EpiPens. Some members have been involved in supporting Anaphylaxis Australia at the Inquest into the death of aSydney schoolboy from Anaphylaxis at a school camp.The resulting recommendations have implications for allstates and New Zealand. One of the recommendations from the inquest was to establish a register of anaphylaxis cases and ASCIA hasprovided some seed funds to assist in development ofthis register. 18ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA AR 05 11/28/05 PM Medical Recipients IMMUNOLOGY & DERMATOLOGY ELECTIVES JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSPITAL AND WEATHERALL INSTITUTE FOR MOLECULARMEDICINE, UK. HSIEN CHAN BMedSci(Hons)MBBS/BArts - 6th YearUniversity of WesternAustralia Aim Clinical practice and medical research are areas in whichmedical students can satisfy their burning desire to helpand to discover. As such, my elective at the JohnRadcliffe Hospital aimed to fulfil both these roles. Aclinical attachment to the Immunology and DermatologyDepartments at the John Radcliffe Hospital wascombined with extensive time in the CutaneousImmunology lab at the Weatherall Institute for MolecularMedicine (WIMM). Maintaining clinical pertinence toresearch in the molecular sciences is of utmost importance. Accordingly, my research project at theWIMM involved characterising the T-cell phenotype ofatopic individuals and would often involve collectingblood samples from clinically atopic individuals in onemorning's clinic and processing these samples that veryafternoon. This stimulating course of study furtherclarified my interest in research and clinical immunology. Clinical Attachment My clinical attachment consisted of outpatient clinics atthe John Radcliffe Hospital Medical Specialties Clinics(Immunology) and the Churchill Hospital DermatologyClinics. Not surprisingly, the spectrum of medicine seenin these clinics was quite similar to that in Australia.Investigations, management and clinical reasoning were also akin to my education at the University ofWestern Australia.By chance, the Royal Society of Medicine - Section of Dermatology Clinicopathological Meeting coincided withmy stay in the UK and I was able to attend this meetingon 20th of January at the Royal Society of MedicineHead Office at 1 Wim pole Street in London. This was a most stimulating session and the rare opportunity arose of meeting a dermatologist with a syndrome named after him. Research Attachment Founded in 1989 at the John Radcliffe Hospital HealthCampus in Headington, the Institute of MolecularMedicine was established by Sir David Weatherall withthe aim of applying state of the art molecular and cellbiology research techniques to human disease. Fundingfor this institution mainly derived from the University ofOxford, Medical Research Council (UK), Cancer ResearchUK, Wellcome Trust and other medical charities. Bearing the same location as the main clinical teaching site for the University of Oxford Medical School, theWeatherall Institute provides a scientific environment that involves an approach to medical research thatcombines both the clinical and basic sciences. Severalinitiatives are currently in place to encourage medicalclinicians specifically to undertake research studies.Clinical Research Training Fellowships and Senior ClinicalFellowships are examples of such initiatives. Thisintegrated approach has resulted in a multitude ofsignificant discoveries at the Weatherall Institute. Forexample, the Human Immunology Unit section that I wasattached to is currently responsible for the studies in theMVA-HIVA (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara) vaccinationsthat are currently being implemented in clinical trials. The Cutaneous Immunology Lab that I was attached to is part of the Human Immunology Section of the WIMM andis headed by Dr Graham Ogg who is an MRC SeniorClinical Fellow and a Consultant Dermatologist. A majorfocus of this lab is to elucidate the immunological basisfor atopic conditions such as asthma, eczema andrhinitis. A current PhD project of the lab conducted by Dr Michael Arden-Jones is focused on characterizing theT cell response in clinical flare-ups of these conditionsby the use of molecular techniques such as tetramerscombined with Elispot assays. My short stay at the labinvolved helping out in some of these experiments. 19ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA PM Page 20of CTL may also bear considerable insight into specific cytological responses in atopicindividuals. 17 Future Directions Identifying the certain epitopes that atopic individualsare highly reactive to may provide a marker forimmunotherapy efficacy. In addition, identifying theepitopes responsible for the exaggerated immuneresponse in atopic individuals may provide specific targets for immunotherapy. Reflection Medical school has been a challenging but extremelyrewarding experience. As I have progressed from the pre-clinical to the clinical years, I have always maintainedan appreciation for the role of lab science in drivingcurrent clinical practice. Experience in research during aBMedSci Honours year in the US has beencomplemented through my clinical teachings at theUniversity of Western Australia. This elective has addedanother dimension to my medical experience. Theelective is frequently regarded as the highlight of amedical student's studies and my elective has certainlyallowed me to combine these two major interests ofclinical medicine and medical research. My experiencesin the UK have revealed to me a potential career in both,specifically in the field of Clinical Immunology. This experience has only been made possible through the devotion to teaching provided by my supervisors atthe Weatherall Institute, Dr Graham Ogg and Dr MichaelArden-Jones and the generosity of the AustralasianSociety of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. Please note that due to space constraints referencelists, figures and tables for the four medical studentreports could not be published. These are available from education@allergy.org.au On 25 November 2005 Hsien Chan graduated from UWA with an MBBS(Hons)/BA, BMedSci(Hons) and hasbeen awarded a Monash award to study for a DPhil atOxford from December 2006. 20ascia annual report 2005 Role of CD8+ T Cells in Atopy There is increasing evidence that CD8+ T cells play a rolein allergic disease in animals. 1-3 In humans, increasedfrequencies of cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigenCD8+ T cells producing type 2 cytokines have beenfound in the peripheral blood of individuals with atopicdermatitis. 4-7 Previous studies have indicated that upto 30% of the T cell infiltrate within atopic dermatitisskin samples are CD8+ T cells 8and in other atopicconditions such as asthma, similar evidence of activatedCD8+ T cell infiltrate has also been identified. 9 Tetramers and Elispot What is needed to examine this proposed relationship isa method of staining for CD8+ T-cells and measuringtheir functional activity in clinically atopic individuals.While it was known for some time that the T cell receptorcould only bind peptide only when it was presented byclass I or II major histocompatibility complexes, 10, 11initial attempts at identifying antigen-specific T cells bybinding T cell receptors with their corresponding antigen,peptide and MHC were unsuccessful. It was not until thesuccessful refolding of MHC complexes, peptide and fl2-microglobulin was achieved by Garboczi et al. that moresuccessful attempts could be made.12 The work of DrJohn Altman and Professor Mark Davis in collaborationwith the Oxford group that I spent my elective with(headed by Professor Andrew McMichael), usedtetramers of these complexes and were able to develop4 biotinylated complexes of antigenic peptide, MHCclass II complexes, fl2-microglobulin around astreptavidin core that achieved binding of significantavidity to be of laboratory and research use 13 (reviewedby Ogg et al.14). Tetramers largely determine the presence of antigen- specific T-cells (specific to the epitope incorporated intothe tetramer). To determine functional information suchas activation these T-cells, Elispot assays were usedto stain for cytokines from these cells. However, acaveat to this approach is that we cannot be absolutelycertain that the same T-cells identified by staining withtetramers are the source of the interleukins identified inthe separate Elispot assay. Recent advances may help with this problem such as combining tetramer technology and intracellular stainingtechniques. 15, 16 Functional information to indicateactivation, effector and apoptosis6759 ASCIA AR 05 4:24 PM Page 21LOOKING THE CAR KEYS: RESEARCH IN IMMUNOLOGY AT MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING CANCER CENTER, NEW YORK, USA. HARRIETT GEE University of Melbourne From January 3- 28, 2005, I undertook a rotation as a final-year medical student on theClinical Immunology Service atMemorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter, New York. Memorial Sloan-Kettering is the world's oldest and largest private institution devoted to patient care,education and research into cancer. The ClinicalImmunology service focuses on the development ofvaccines for melanoma treatment. The researchconducted in the immunology department is very broad,from basic science work conducted in the adjacentSloan-Kettering Institute building, to translationalresearch and clinical trials. Background At Monday clinic, which I attended with my supervisor DrPaul Chapman, I observed the treatment of patients withmetastatic melanoma. The treatment options arecurrently very limited. Only two drugs are approved forthe treatment of advanced-stage melanoma, each withless than 20% response rates. The median survival forstage IV melanoma is around seven months. Melanoma is felt to be susceptible to immune attack for several reasons: primary melanoma naevi. Thesefeatures of the cancer, along with the lack of responseto chemotherapy, have prompted research intoimmunological treatments. Currently, these include 12months of interferon-alpha, and various vaccines whichare in trial stage. Approaches include vaccine with undefined antigens such as allogeneic vaccines (cell extracts or whole cells),autologous vaccines (patient's own tumour cells, withadjuvant such as heat shock protein), or vaccines withdefined antigens such as gangliosides, peptides (eggp100) or DNA (to be presented by dendritic cells). The many approaches to vaccination reflect one of the majorcontroversies in tumour immunology - whether a T-cellbased or antibody-based approach is likely to be moreclinically effective. Antibody-based therapy for melanoma (targeting the antigen GD3 on melanoma) was first trialled 20 yearsago but since then the field has shifted to focus on T-cell-based therapy. It is likely, however, that successfultreatment will require both a T-cell and antibodyresponse. For example, the antitumour effects of trastuzumab (anti-HER2/neu for breast cancer) aredramatically reduced in mice lacking activating Fc(IIIreceptors and are enhanced by blocking inhibitory FcII receptors. This was a surprising result as until that point, antibodies like trastuzumab were thought to workpurely by blocking the function of their target (in thiscase the human epidermal growth factor receptor). To date, purely antibody-based therapies like anti-GD3 have shown response rates of about 10%, while T-cell-based therapies have shown even lower efficacy inpractice. For example, passive transfer of melanoma-specific T cells into patients has been largely ineffective,and near-complete responses are seen only whenvirtually every circulating T cell recognizes a tumourantigen. On the other hand, transfer of polyclonalcultures of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes into patientsafter nonmyeloablative chemotherapy has induced partialresponses in 50% of patients. The difference is felt to be due to the polyclonal nature of the T cell culture andpreparation which might enable activation of B-cells. Therapeutic approaches Patients were recruited for three trials while I was there -one chemotherapy (temazolamide) and two vaccine-based trials. On Tuesday and Friday afternoons themultidisciplinary team of dermatologists, surgeons,bench researchers, oncologists and nurses met todiscuss proposed trials or controversial areas (such asthe role of sunlight and vitamin D in melanoma). I learntabout the logistics of running a clinical trial, particularlydose-selection, patient characteristics, and getting bloodand tissue samples analysed in a centralised andmeaningful way. Clinicians were also attentive to theneeds of their patients, who often lived far away fromManhattan. 21ascia annual report 2005 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 22Phase one trials included injection of dendritic cells loaded with melanoma antigens, a multi-epitope peptidevaccine using GM-CSF DNA as an adjuvant, and injectionof the genes for human and mouse gp100 into patientswith melanoma. Gp100 is a protein found in melanomacells that is involved in melanin production, and injectionelicits both antibody and T-cell responses in mice. In theGp100 trial, patients received both human and mousegp100 DNA in a cross-over design, to assessimmunogenicity of the two types of DNA. An interesting phase two trial studied the MAPkinase signaling pathway. Activating mutations in this pathwayare found in the majority of melanomas. For example, B-RAF (a downstream protein in the pathway) is mutated in60% of melanoma. 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is an inhibitor This trial pathway in tumours by destablising thekey B-RAF protein involved in signaling. Data from thispromising study will be released in April. One of the most interesting parts of my experience was the constant debate that went on about thesetechniques, both between the researchers and clinicians,and the patients themselves. Many patients had read upon the various treatments and were trying to decidewhich to go with. For example, some hospitals offerinterferon-alpha treatment, which involves a year oftherapy with significant side-effects. Data is conflictingbut most agree that there is an increase in disease-freesurvival with treatment, but no increase in overallsurvival, especially over years. I was impressed with mysupervisor's patience in discussing the complex risk-benefit with his patients and their families. My supervisor's laboratory work currently revolves around CD1, a family of antigen-presenting moleculeswith the ability to present lipids and glycolipids to T cellsand to natural killer T cells. This molecule is postulated tobe involved in the recognition of tumour antigen (which issupported by Dr Chapman's finding that GD3, a gangliosideexpressed on human melanoma cells, is presented by CD1to Natural Killer cells). Promising as this work is, it is yetto be translated into humans and I was urged by mysupervisor to see the limitations of their current work as\"like the man under a street light trying to find his lost carkeys: when asked by the police officer why he was lookingthere, he said 'Because this is where the light is.\"Other activities The department of immunology's visiting speakers' topicsmost frequently included Toll-like receptors and Iparticularly enjoyed a talk by Chandrasheakr Pasare ofYale School of Medicine, who talked about TLR and control of adaptive immunity. Other talks included further TLRcommentary and discussion of T-cells such as 'Defectiveproximal TCR signaling in non-lytic CD8 tumour infiltratinglymphocytes' by Alan Frey from New York University. On Tuesday and Friday mornings I attended grand rounds. These enabled me to learn about other promisingtreatment options for cancer such as angiogenesisinhibitors. I enjoyed the opportunity to see the breadth ofresearch at the hospital, from imaging tumour hypoxia to angio- and neurogenesis as well as visiting speakerssuch as the Director of National Cancer Institute J CarlBarrett and even a motivational speaker, BenjaminZander, conductor of the Boston PhilharmmonicOrchestra, speak on his book the 'Art of Possibility'. I spent two weeks on the inpatient service where I observed the treatment of melanoma and autologousstem cell transplants. As well as scrupulous attention tohandwashing, masking and gloving, it was interesting tosee the implementation of new technology such asefficient mobile computer-based ordering system, andobserve American medical roles (such as the highly-valued nurse practitioner). While in New York City I took full advantage of the terrific music scene, attending several performances of theBeethoven string quartets at the Lincoln Centre, and awonderful Montiverdi concert at Columbia University. Mymid-morning toasted bagel with cr\u00e9me cheese was addictive! It was an inspiring experience to go to MSKCC at this stage of my career to see the extraordinary breadth ofresearch and translational focus. Even senior clinicians were friendly and approachable, and my supervisor inparticular was fantastically generous with his time andmentorship. During our many discussions, he took timeto respond to my questions and ideas seriously, and byengaging in real discussion with me, I have been shownnew ways of thinking about immunological questions. I sincerely appreciate the support of the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy in making thiselective possible. 22ascia annual report ASCIA AR 05 4:24 Page 2323ascia annual report 2005 FETO-MATERNAL HLA G GENOTYPE MISMATCH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES RISKFOR PRE-ECLAMPSIA BUT NOT GESTATIONALHYPERTENSION IN THE MALAY Gynecology, 3Biostatistics Unit, and 4Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore,Singapore. 5Obstetrics & Gynecology, Sultanah Aminah Hospital Johor, Malaysia. 6School of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Australia. Introduction HLA G is a MHC Class 1b gene and it is the main HLAgene being expressed at the materno-fetal interface(Figure 1). It has been suggested that HLA G may havean immunomodulatory role in the maternal tolerance ofthe semiallogenic fetus; failure of this role could be oneof the precipitating factors for the development ofpregnancy-related hypertensive disorders like gestationalhypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). PE is one ofthe leading causes of maternal and fetal mortality andmorbidity, but its aetiology remains undefined. Somepossible causative mechanisms are shown in Figure 2.Inparticular, a maternal immune maladaption to fetal antigensmay be involved in the pathogenesis of PE, as it maybring about the release of cytokines that causes maternalendothelial cell damage [1]. This immunological hypothesisis further supported by the following epidemiologicalfindings: the incidence of PE and GH is higher innulliparous women [2], and in women who are less exposedto their partners' antigens [3-8]. Although associationsbetween HLA G and risk for PE have been widelyinvestigated, the results have been conflictingthus far. In this study, we investigated the relationship between particular HLA G SNPs and risk for PE and GH in aSoutheast Asian Malay population. To our knowledge, theMalay population had not been studied previously. Wetested for associations between single SNPs as well asSNP haplotypes and risk for PE and GH, in order toincrease the likelihood of detecting positiveassociations. This effort will help to clarify the effect of variations in HLA G expression or structure on risk fordeveloping PE and GH, and contribute to the design ofmore accurate predictive tests and genetic screening forPE risk. Accurate predictive tests will in turn enableearlier management and thus better prognosis foraffected pregnancies. Materials and Methods We tested for association between HLA G and PE and/or GH using a case-control approach. DNA was extractedfrom venous blood of mothers and cord blood of babiesfrom 31 PE, 46 GH, and 164 normotensive Malaywomen. HLA G was amplified in 6 fragments in a single-tube multiplex PCR and genotyped for 19 SingleNucleotide Polymorphisms a multiplexminisequencing strategy (Figure 1). The genotypes wereanalyzed in the following ways. First, normal controlswere compared against PE or GH cases. Both individualSNP genotype as well as haplotype frequencies werecompared between case and control mothers. Inaddition, babies of case and control mothers were alsocompared to test for paternal contribution to diseasedevelopment. Finally, we examined if there were anydifferences in mother-child genotype pairs between caseand control groups to test for possible histo-incompatibility effects. These differences werestatistically examined using chi-square statistics, with aconfidence interval of 95%. The effect of a SNP orhaplotype allele in relation to disease risk orsusceptibility was expressed as a relative risk. Results and Discussion The risk for PE was not associated with maternal HLA Ggenotype, but was strongly associated with the presenceof fetal haplogroup E (p=0.007; RR=6.613,95%CI=1.827-23.939). In addition, heterozygotefrequency of non-synonymous SNP16, strongly between case and controlbabies (p=0.006; RR=6.013, 95%CI=1.88-23.256).These suggest that the presence of SNP 16 in the fetalHLA G gene could increase the risk for PE. It is possiblethat the SNP 16 polymorphism affects the expressionand/or function of fetal HLA G. Alternatively, thispolymorphism may be in linkage disequilibrium withanother locus that directly influences the alternatesplicing or stability of the HLA G gene transcript. 6759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 24Furthermore, mismatch between mother (homozygous wildtype) andchild (heterozygous) was increased in PEpregnancies compared (p=0.002,RR=21.2, 95%CI=2.45-183.03). This strongly impliesthat a materno-fetal genotype histo-incompatibility in theHLA G gene may be one of the contributing factors in thepathogenesis of PE, which supports the immunologicalcausative mechanism as mentioned earlier. The risk for GH was also found not to be associated with either maternal or fetal HLA G genotype. As such,although PE and GH share similar characteristics, theymay have quite difficult pathogeneses. Conclusion Polymorphisms in the HLA G gene that affect itsexpression and function may be one of the majorcontributing factors in the multifactorial pathogenesis ofPE. The contribution of paternal HLA G haplogroup E(defined by the variant allele of SNP16) in the fetussignificantly increases risk for PE, but not GH, in wildtypehaplogroup mothers. In addition, increased risk for PEmay be mediated by a maternal immune response to thevariant paternal histocompatibility antigen in the fetus.Further investigations on the impact of the SNP 16polymorphism on HLA G gene structure, function andexpression could help to shed light on this issue. DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDHOOD ALLERGY IN RELATION TO GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION SUMITHA BHASKARAN 1 Mah Ka Weng , Bengt Bjorksten, Lee Bee Wah, Hugo van Chua Kaw Yan, Shek Lynette 1University of Melbourne BackgroundThe prevalence of atopic dermatitis increasingover the recent years. The 'hygiene hypothesis' suggeststhat this is due factors associated with the Westernlifestyle and the consequential decrease in microbialstimulation. The microbes in the GIT are the largestsource of microbial pressure on the immune system.Therefore, differences in the patterns of colonization bygut microflora could affect immune development and asa result lead to atopic manifestation. Specific Aims The aims of this study were to describe the pattern ofgut microflora of children from Singapore with andwithout and eczema (Part 1), and that of a generalpopulation of children from a developed country withhigh prevalence of atopy (Singapore) and a developingcountry with low prevalence of atopy (Rural Thailand)(Part 2). Methods A case-controlled study with 21 AD and 15 healthychildren was conducted for part 1, while a cross-sectional study with 63 children from Singapore and 69children from Thailand was conducted for part 2. All thechildren (age = 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 years) were recruited using amodified ISAAC questionnaire given to parents. Stoolsamples were collected from these children, andconventional stool cultures and quantitative flowcytometry were carried out to quantify seven bacterialspecies. Results Children with eczema had significantly lower Clostridia (0.14% and0.28% vs. Enterococci 5.37 log vs. 4.57 log CFU/g, p< 0.05 thanhealthy children. Thai children had significantly highercounts of Staphylococci than Singaporean children (5.30vs. 3.97 log CFU/g, p< 0.01). Consumption of untreatedwater and increasing number of siblings were found tohave positive association with Staphylococcal counts. Conclusion We confirm that there are differences in the gut flora of healthy and AD children and that these differencesextend beyond infancy into early childhood. We alsofound significant differences in the gut flora of childrenfrom Singapore and Thailand and postulate that thesedifferences maybe due to water quality and family size. 24ascia annual report 20056759 ASCIA AR 05 Final 11/28/05 4:24 PM Page 25 ASCIA Awards & Grants DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARDS FOR PAST ASCIA PRESIDENTS Professor Tony Basten 1991-1992 Roger Gillis 2003-2004 CERTIFICATES APPRECIATION Ameratunga 1999-2005Ms Philippa KirkpatrickProject Coordinator of the ASCIA PID Register Dr William SmithState representative & CPC Chair 2000-2005Assoc Prof Mimi TangJSAC Paediatric Representative 1999-2005 PID AWARDS Dr Rob StirlingDr Marnie RobinsonDr Karl Bleasel MEDICAL STUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS Hsien Chan (WA) - $4,000 Harriett Gee (VIC) - $3,000 Sumitha Bhaskaran (VIC/Sing) - $3,000 MEDIA AWARDS Ann Buchner (producer) Helen Dalley (presenter) Sunday program, Nine Network Australia 'When food can be fatal - parts 1 and 2' Highly commended (Runner up) Jill Margo , Columnist, Aust Financial Review 'Self- medication is on the nose for suffering snifflers'.
