Rogier Hoenders, MD,1Martin T. T.V.M de Jong, PhD, MPH3 Abstract Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is subject to heated debates and prejudices. Studies show that CAM is widely used by psychiatric patients, usually without the guidance of a therapist and without the use of a solid working method, leading to potential health risks.Aim: The purpose of this study is to facilitate the judicious use of CAM alongside conventional psychiatry in an outpatient psychiatric clinic.Methods: A search was made through scientic and legal articles and discussion in focus groups. Results: In the Centre for Integrative Psychiatry (CIP) of Lentis in the Netherlands, some carefully selected CAM are offered under strict conditions, alongside conventional treatments. Because of the controversy and thepotential health risks, Lentis designed a protocol that is presented. Conclusions: The CIP hopes, by using this protocol, to better serve and respect the individual needs and preferences of the diversity of psychiatric patients in our Dutch multicultural society, and better protect themfrom harm. Introduction In2002, Silvia Millecam , a famous Dutch actress, died of breast cancer after refusing conventional medical treatment while trusting herself to practitioners treating her with com- plementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The Dutch Healthcare Inspection did an extensive inquiry into the mat-ter. Three doctors were put on trial for malpractice and wereconvicted by the Medical Disciplinary Tribunal. Two of them lost their medical license. In the years that followed, there were heated debates on the use of alternative medicine in theNetherlands. Supporters of CAM claim that conventional treatments have too many side-effects, lack effectiveness and room forpatients' wishes and needs. On the other hand, opponents state that CAM is quackery and that the effects are based on placebo and ''ridiculous principles.'' 1This reaction reminds us of earlier resistance to change in medicine; for instance, in1911 Herrick was almost laughed out of medicine for stating that atherosclerosis causes myocardial infarction.2 Previous and current bias against new developments is undesirable because both patients and doctors are uncertainabout safety and effectiveness of CAM. This is all the more important because about half of the population in a variety of Western countries 3and almost half of Dutch psychiatric outpatients use CAM annually.4 A majority of patients get information on CAM via the Internet, friends, or family. The quality of this informationvaries greatly, leading to potentially harmful and dangeroussituations. 5 In the Netherlands, many doctors do not inform their patients about CAM and they certainly avoid prescribing orreferring to CAM. Recently the Dutch Minister of Health has announced more severe punishment for practitioners who harm their patients either by applying unsafe therapies or bydelaying the start of conventional treatment. 6Therefore, in 1The Centre for Integrative Psychiatry, Haren, The Netherlands. 3The Open University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 17, Number 12, 2011, pp. 1197-1201\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/acm.2010.0762 1197 the Netherlands patients and doctors are informed about what cannot be done concerning CAM, while it remains un- clear what could or should be done. Despite calls from the World Health Organization (WHO)7and the European parliament,8until now the Dutch government did not for- mulate a policy on this matter. In an effort to ll this gap and inspired by the North American consortium of 44 academic health centers for in-tegrative medicine (CAHCIM) 9, Lentis (a community mental health facility in the North of the Netherlands) founded a Centre for Integrative Psychiatry (CIP) in 2006. It consists ofan outpatient clinic, a research department, an educational department, and organizes an annual conference (with ap- proximately 1000 attendees). 10Its main purpose is to provide safe and effective integrative mental health care. What Is Integrative Psychiatry? Integrative psychiatry is based on the principles of grative medicine'': reafrming the importance of the rela- tionship between practitioner and patient; focusing on the whole person; using all therapeutic approaches (conven-tional and CAM) based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM); and achieving optimal health and healing. The debate in the Netherlands focuses mainly on the principle of EBM (i.e., the use of CAM within conventional treatment centers, and the correct denition of EBM). In this regard, it is noteworthy that Sackett et al. 11dened EBM as (1) the best available evidence for effective and safe treat-ment options, (2) the preferences and needs of the patient, and (3) the clinical expertise of the professional. These threetogether should be decisive in making treatment choices. This denition is in contrast with the present-day more re- ductionist explanation of EBM in which the rst and third principles are emphasized without paying much attention tothe patient's preference. 12The original denition therefore accommodates therapies that still lack (sufcient) evidence-Table 1.Prejudices Against Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Prejudice Refutation 1.

It is also important to realize that according to some researchers, only about one third of culturally and professionally accepted interventions in Western medicine are proven effective by randomized controlled trials.13,14 Prejudices Some reasons why opponents feel doctors should not use CAM seem to be based on prejudices. Table 1 compares themost common prejudices against CAM with information from scientic studies.Similarly, those in favor of CAM also seem to have prejudices. Those are mentioned in Table 2. We therefore argue that CAM needs serious attention, both within conventional treatment centers and in the alternative eld(Table 2). The CAM Protocol One of the primary tasks of our center was to formulate a scientic model based on the requirements that it would (1)answer patients' needs and wishes; (2) respect their freedom FIG. 1. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) protocol for the Center for Integrative Psychiatry (CIP). CBT, cognitive assessment.DUTCH CAM PROTOCOL 1199 of choice; (3) would offer Western medicine and CAM that are safe and effective; (4) would protect against quackery and abuse; (5) should be based on Dutch law, the jurispru- dence of the Medical Disciplinary Tribunal, and the rules ofthe Dutch Association of Medical Practitioners; and (6) be based on scientic evidence. The authors reviewed documents, the scientic literature, and collected information with the help of focus groups. 15 This resulted in the CAM protocol.16In this protocol, we distinguish (between) complementary and alternative medi-cine. The rst is dened as ''approaches based on main-stream biomedical theory and supported by research evidence but not part of mainstream practice because of so- cial, political or ideological reasons.'' Examples are St. John'swort and massage. Alternative medicine is dened as ''ap- proaches that are based on concepts that are outside main- stream Western medicine.'' Examples include homeopathyand healing. 17Based on an analysis of the results, we pro- duced the algorithm shown in Figure 1. This is the working method of the CIP. The rst step of the algorithm claries that CAM can only be used after an ex-tensive and precise stepwise process. CAM can only be started if conventional treatments have been applied before or at least advised as suggested by guidelines and protocols.In addition, CAM is considered if there is no danger when a patient refused treatment (for instance: a patient with mania or psychosis with severe symptoms will be strongly advisedrst to accept conventional medication even when asking for CAM). After deciding to start CAM, the second step is based on the principles of EBM (i.e., alternative treatments with a lower level of evidence can be provided on a patient's re- quest when there is no contraindication). However, thesetreatments will not be offered within the CIP. Patients will bereferred to an external network that provides these treat- ments in conjunction with proven treatments provided by CIP and not instead of them. In addition, there are the fol-lowing required conditions: /C15The therapists are members of a (para)professional or- ganization with a formal procedure for complaints and malpractice. /C15The therapists base their treatments and way of working on the professional guidelines of the organization. /C15The therapists conform themselves to legal demands concerning patient les. /C15The clinic or ofce where patients are being treated meet privacy and hygiene demands, as common in conven- tional medicine. /C15The therapists have malpractice insurance. /C15There has to be at least monthly contact between the CIPand the alternative practitioner. /C15After nishing the alternative treatment, there will be at least one contact with the CIP to evaluate. /C15The alternative therapists agree to be included in sci- entic evaluation by routine outcome measurement (ROM) of the effect of the treatments and agrees with publication, regardless the results. Center for Integrative Psychiatry In the CIP of Lentis, only conventional and complemen- tary medicines that have been proven effective and safe arebeing practiced. That means that they have to be based on (reviews of ) several well-designed scientic studies. Ex- amples are St. John's for in- somnia,19relaxation for anxiety,20mindfulness-based stress reduction21,22and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression,23massage for stress, anxiety, and depression,24 exercise for depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders,25heart rate variability training for anxiety and stress-related and depressive symptoms,26,27single vitamins as a supplement to medication for depression (such as folic acid),28food supplements like such as for panic, and obsessive- compulsive disorder,31and dietary changes for depression.32 These treatments, integrated with conventional psychia- try, have been offered for 3 years to psychiatric outpatients in the CIP. Alternative medicine such as homeopathy, Reiki, or heal- ing are not being offered. However, patients can be referred to these treatments under strict conditions, which are ex-plained above. All treatments are evaluated by ROM. Inaddition, we study the outcome of innovative treatments with individual outcome measurements (IOM) such as '' Nof 1 design,'' ''single-subject experimental design,'' of six questionnaires: psy- chopathology, quality of life, resiliency, costs, satisfaction, and one self-report personalized outcome indicator, chosenby the patient. Patients ll out these forms before treatment starts, every half year, at the end of treatment, and half a year after their discharge. Patients with IOM ll out diaries con-cerning items that are most relevant to their treatment and symptoms to assess subjective improvement on core symp- toms and complaints. Conclusions Because of the increasing demand of patients for alterna- tive medicine and integrative treatments and because of so- cial, political, scientic, and ethical reasons, and inspired bythe CAHCIM, Lentis has founded a CIP. Here it offers se-lected complementary treatments alongside conventional ones under strict conditions. By doing so, the CIP responds to a call from the WHO and European Parliament, eventhough the Dutch government still has not made a policy on this subject. Because of the controversy surrounding CAM, because of the lack of clear information, and because weneed not only an open attitude but also a critical one, the CIP has formulated the CAM protocol. It believes that in this way CAM can be offered in a safe and effective way withinconventional treatment centers. The CIP hopes in this way to better serve and respect the individual needs and preferences of the diversity of patients who need mental health care inour Dutch multicultural society. It believes the protocol alsoprotects against quackery, abuse, and false hope. Acknowledgments The authors thank E.C.
