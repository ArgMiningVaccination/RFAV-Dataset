Cross- Setting Measures Development Work: An Introduction The Improving Medicare Post- Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act), enacted October 6, 2014, directs the Secretary of Health and Huma n Services to \"specify quality measures on which post-a cute care (PAC) providers are required under the applicable reporting provisions to submit standardized patient assessment data\" in several quality measure domains, including incidence of major falls, skin integrity and changes in skin integrity, medication reconciliation, functional status, transfer of health information and care preference s when an individual transitions , and resource use and other measures. The IMPACT Act requires the implementation of quality measures to address these measure domains in inpatient r ehabilitation f acilities (IRFs), Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Long -Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs), and Home Health Agencies (HHAs). The IMPACT Act also requires, to the extent possible, the submission of such quality measure data through the use of a PAC assessment instrument and the modification of the instrument as necessary to enable such use. This requirement refers to the collection of such data by means of the IRF Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF -PAI) for IRFs, the LTCH Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation Data Set (LTCH CARE Data Set or LCDS) for LTCHs, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 for SNFs, and the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS ) for HHAs. For more information on the statutory history of the IRF, LTCH, or SNF Q uality Reporting Program (QRP), please refer to the Fiscal Year (FY ) 2016 final rules , and for the HH QRP, please refer to the Calendar Year 2016 final rules. More information on the IMPACT Act is available at Govtrack Webpage on the IMPACT Act: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4994 . In this document, we present specifications for the standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) and two measures finalized for adoption for the HH QRP through the CY 2020 HH Prospective Payment System ( PPS) final rule. The Transfer of Health Information measure concept consists of two companion measures: 1. Transfer of Health Information to the Provider-Post -Acute Care Measur e 2. T ransfer of Health Information to the Patient-Post -Acute Care Measur e W e also provide updated specifications for the previously adopted Discharge to Community measure. 2 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: January 1, 2021 Section 2. Cross- Setting P roposed M easure: Transfer of Health Information to the Provider- Post-Acute Care Measure Measure Description The proposed measure, the Transfer of Health Information to the Provider, assesses the timel iness of the transfer of health information, specifically transfer of a reconciled medication list. This measure evaluates for the transfer of information when a patient is transferred or discharged from their c urrent setting to a subsequent provider. For this proposed measure, the subsequent provider is defined as a short- term general hospital, a SNF, intermediate care, home under care of an organized home health service organization or hospice, hospice in an institutional facility, an IRF, a n LTCH, a Medicaid nursing facility, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or a critical access hospital. This proposed measure, developed under the IMPACT Act, has been developed conceptually as a standardized measure for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This proposed measure is calculated by one standardized data element that asks at the time of transfer or discharge, \" did the agency/ facility provide the patient's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provi der?\" It also includes one data element that asks the route of transmission of the reconciled medication list (Appendix A). In order to track discharge to a subsequent provider, the OASIS will be used to track discharge location status. Guidance for what i s considered a reconciled medication list is discussed in greater detail in the section below. The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF-PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patien ts, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, and the OASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to t he standardized data element used to calculate this measure are described in Chapter 1, Section 1. The Reconciled Medication List This proposed measure evaluates whether a reconciled medication list was sent to the subsequent provider upon a PAC transfer or discharge. To guide data collection efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) outlines a general overview of what could be included in a reconciled medication list, but this is not exhaustive of all information that could be transferred. We would like to stress that this information is for guidance purposes only and is not a requirement for the types of information to be included in a PAC provider's reconciled medication list to meet the Transfer of Healt h Information to the Provider-Post -Acute Care measure criteria. Although the information for reconciled medication lists is guidance, we anticipate that the timely transfer of medication information should drive safer care coordination. For the purpose of providing guidance for this measure, a reconciled medication list is a list of the current prescribed and over-the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route to the patient/residen t at the time of discharge or transfer. Medications may also include but are not limited to total parenteral nutrition and oxygen. The current medications should include those that are (1) active, including those that will be discontinued after discharge, and (2) those held during the stay and planned to be continued/resumed after discharge. If deemed relevant to the patient's/resident's care by the subsequent provider, medications discontinued during the stay may be included. A reconciled medication list often includes important information about ( 1) the patient/resident - including their name, date of birth, information, active diagnoses, known medication and other allergies, and known drug sensitivities and reactions, and ( 2) each medication, including t he name ; strength ; dose ; route of medication administration; frequency or timing ; purpose/indication; any special instructions (e.g., crush medications); and, for any held medications, the reason for holding the medication and when medication should resume. This information can improve medication safety. Additional information may be applicable and important to include in the medication list such as the patient's/resident's weight and date taken, height and date taken, preferred language, and ability to self- administer medication ; when the last dose of the 3 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: January 1, 2021 medication was administered by the discharging/transferring provider; and whe n the final dose should be administered (e.g., end of treatment). Documentati on sources for reconcile d medication list informat ion include electronic a nd/or paper records ; Some exampl es of suc h records are di scharge summary records , a Medication Administration Recor d, an Intravenous Medication Administration Recor d, a hom e medication list, a nd physician orders. The guidance on w hat to include in a reconciled medication list is aligned to the provisions in the proposed Discharge Planning for Hospitals, Critical Access Hospital, and H HA regulation, which outlines dischar ge planning and the documentation of medications (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/03/2015-27840/medicare-and- medicaid -programs- revisions -to-requirements-for- discharge-planning-for-hospitals ). In addition, this guidance follows the requirements finalized in the Reform of Requirements for Long-T erm Care Facilities (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/04/2016-23503/medicare-and- medicaid -programs- reform -of-requirements-for-long- term-care-facilities ). Purpose/Rationale for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharged to home under the care of a hom e health agency (HHA) , and 9 percent who were discharged to SNFs.1 The proportion of patients being discharged from an acute care hospital to a PAC setting was greater among beneficiaries enrolled in fee -for-service (FFS) Medicare. Among FFS patients disch arged from an acute hospital, 42 percent went directly to PAC settings. Of those , 20 percent were discharged to a SNF, 18 percent were discharged to an HHA, 3 percent were discharged to an IRF, and 1 percent were discharged to an LTCH.2 Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with an HH episode in C Ys 2016 and 2017, an estimated 54 percent were discharged without an assistive device , 16 percent were discharged with an assistive device, and 1 percent were discharged to a non-institutional hospice service .3 The transfer and/or exchange of health information from one provider to another takes several forms including verbal (e.g. clinician to clinician communication by telephone or in-person), paper- based (e.g. faxed or printed copies of records) and electronic communication (e.g. via health information exchange network, using an electronic health/medical record, secure messaging). Health information, such as medication information, that is incomplete or missing increases the likelihood of a patient/resident safety risk, often life -threatening.4 5 6 7 8 9 Poor communication and coordination across health care settings contributes to patient complications, hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, and medication 1 Tian, W. \"An all -payer view of hospital discharge to postacute care,\" 3 Abt Associates analysis of Medicare fee for service data for index episodes in HHA 2016/2017. . 4 Kwan, J.

However , there is limited informatio n about the route or mode (for example , paper-based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers to transfer health informati on. PAC provider health information exchange supports the goals of: high quality, personalized, a nd efficient healthcare; care coordinatio n and person- centered c a nd real-time, da ta-driven, clinical decision m aking. PAC pa tients often have complicated m edication regimens and require efficient and effective communication and coordination of care between settings, including transfer of detailed medication 10 Barnsteiner, J.

Consequently, PAC providers regularly are in the position of starting complex new medicati on regimens with little knowledge of the patient or their medicati on history upon admission. Furthermore, inter-provider communication barriers delay r esolving medication discrepancies during transitions of c are.33 The transfer o f a medication list between providers i s necessary f or medication reconciliation interventions, whic h have been shown t o be a cost-effective way t o avoid ADEs by reducing errors,34 35 36 especially w hen m edications are r eviewed by a pharmacist and whe n it is done in conjunction with the use of electronic medical records.37 Denominator The target population is all patients discharged or transferred to a subsequent provider from a HHA.

Numerator HH Numerator: The numerator is the number of home health quality episodes for which the OASIS indicated that the following is true: At the time of discharge /transfer , the agency provided a current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider (A2121 A/B= [1]). Measure Time Window The measure will be calculated quarterly for public reporting . All eligible HH episodes during the quarter will be included in the denominator and are eligible for inclusion in the numerator. For patients with multiple episodes during the quarter, each episode is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Items Included in the Quality Measure One data element with two time point- specific versions will be included to calculate the measure. One data element will be collected to inform the measure consistency logic of the proposed measure.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 8 Quality Measure Calculation Steps The following steps are used to calculate the measure: Calculate the agency's observed score (steps 1 through 3). Step 1. Calculate the denominator count Calculate the total number of quality episodes with a discharge to a subsequent provider and the total number of quality episodes with a transfer to a subsequent provider based on the discharge/transfer location item s in Appendix A. Step 2. Calculate the numerator count Calculate the total number of stays where a reconciled medication list was transferred: A2121A/B = [1] Step 3: Calculate the agency's observed score. Divide the agency's numerator count by its denominator count to obtain the observed score; in other words, divide the results of Step 2 by the results of Step 1. Multiply by 100. Quality Measure Coding Steps The following steps are used to code the measure: 1.At discharge , identify discharge location with item M0100 RFA 9 and M2420 response 2 or 3. 2.At transfer , identify t ransfer to inpatient facility with item M0100 RFA 6 or 7. 3.At discharge, c ode for whether the agency provided the reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider with item A2121A . 4.A t transfer , code for if the agency provided the reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider with item A2121B . 5.At discharge/transfer , code for the route of transmission with item A2123, category 1. A valid response for item A2121A/B [A2121A/B = 1] would progress the coder into item A2123. This item is used for measure consistency logic. 9 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Section 3. Cross- Setting P roposed Measure: Transfer of Health Information to the Patient - Post-Acute Care Measure Measure Description This proposed measure assesses for and reports on the timely transfer of health information, i.e., a current reconciled medication list, to the patien t/resident when discharged from their current setting of PAC to a private home/apartment, board and care home, assisted living, group home, or transitional living This proposed measure, developed under the IMPACT Act, has been developed for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This proposed measure is calculated by one standard data element that asks at the time of discharge, \"D id the agency provide the patient's/resident's current reconciled medication list to the patient, family, and/or caregiver?\" It also includes one data element that asks how the reconciled medication list was transferred (Appendix A). The OASIS , which track s discharge location status , will be used to track discharge at home. The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF-PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patients, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, and the OASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to the standardized data element used to calculate this measure are in Appendix A. The Reconciled Medication List The guidance related to a reconciled medication list for purposes of this measure, as well as the information that may be included for the patient/resident and for each of the medications, is in Chapter 1, Section 2. It is recommended that a reconciled medication list that is transferred to t he patient, family, or caregiver using consumer-friendly terminology and plain language to ensure that the information given to patients and caregivers is clear and understandable, promoting transparent access to medical record information. 38 Purpose/Rationale for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharged to home under the care of an HHA.39 The proportion of patients being discharged from an acute care hospital to a PAC setting was greater among beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for- service (FFS) Medicare. Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with an HH episode in CYs 2016 and 2017, an estimated 54 percent were discharged without an assistive device, 16 percent were discharged with an assistive device, and one percent were discharged to a non-institutional hospice service.40 The communication of health information, such as a reconciled medication list , is critical to ensuring safe and effective patient transitions from health care settings to home and other community settings. Incomplete or missing health information, such as medication information, increases the likelihood of a patient safety risk, of ten life -threatening.41 42 43 44 45 Individuals who use PAC settings are particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes because of their higher likelihood of multiple comorbid chronic 38 For an examples of plain language resources for healthcare information see: https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/content- types/healthcare/ 39 Tian, 2016. 40 Abt Associates analysis of Medicare fee for service data for index episodes in HHA 2016/2017. . 41Kwan et al. , 2013. 42 Boockvar et al. , 2011. 43 Bell et al. , 2011. 44 Basey, Krska, Kennedy, & Mackridge, , 2014. 45 Desai, Williams, Hansen, , Final Specifications for HH e Date: Jan 1, 2021 conditions, polypharmacy, and complicated transitions between care setting s.46 47 Upon discharge to home, individuals in P AC s ettings may be faced w ith num erous medication changes a nd follow -up details.48 49 50 The efficient and effective communication and coordination of medicati on information may be critical to prevent potentially deadly adv erse effects. When care coordination activities enhance car e transitions, these activities can r educe duplication of care services and costs of care, r esolve conflicting care plans, and prevent medical e rrors.51 52 The transfer of a patient's medication informati on to the patient, family, or caregiver is common practice and supported by discharge planning requirements for participati on in Medicare and Medicaid programs.53 54 However, there is limited information about the route or mode (for example, paper-based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers t o transfer health information. PAC provider health information exchange with patients, f amili es and car egivers support s the goal s of: high quality, personalized, and efficient healthcare; care coordination and person- centered ca re; and real-time, da ta-driven clinical d ecision making. Some PAC el ectronic health record systems generate a di scharge medication list. Interventions to promote patient participation in medication m anagement have been show n to be acceptable and po tentially useful for improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.55 56 Furthermore, p rovision of a reconciled medication list to patients/residents and their ca regivers can improve transitional care.57 Some clinical practice guidelines state the importance of medication safety and communicating accurate m edication in formation to the patient. For example, The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals #4 and #5 for Home Care Accreditati on (NPSG.03.06.01) are as follows:58 4.

Update to Discharge to Community- Post Acute Ca re (PAC) Home Health ( HH) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) Measure Description Sections 1899B(d)(1)(B) and 1899B(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act require the Secretary to specify a measure to address the resource use and other measures domain of discharge to community by SNFs, LTCHs, an d IRFs by October 1, 2016, and HHAs by January 1, 2017. We are proposing to adopt the measure, Discharge to Community PAC Home Health (HH) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) for the HH QRP as a Medicare FFS claims - based measure to meet this requirement. This measure assesses successful discharge to the community from HHA, with successful discharge to the community including no unplanned hospitalizations and no death in the 31 days following discharge. Specifically, this measure reports a HHA's risk -standa rdized rate of Medicare FFS patients who are discharged to the community after a HH episode, do not have an unplanned admission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31 days following discharge to community, and remain alive during those 31 days. Community, for this measure, is defined as home/self -care without HH services, based on Patient Discharge Status Codes 01 and 81 on the Medicare FFS claim.60,61 We have developed a discharge to community measure for the home health ( HH) setting. This measures' definition s of the discharge to community outcome, approach es to risk adjustment, and measure calculation s are mostly the same across PAC settings. It is im portant to note, though, that each measure is specific to the particular PAC setting (i.e., HH, IRF, SNF, or LTCH); we do not pool PAC patients/residents across settings in the measure development and calculation. Purpose/Rationale for the Measure Discharg e to a community setting is an important health care outcome for many patients for whom the overall goals of post -acute care include optimizing functional improvement, returning to a previous level of independence, and avoiding institutionalization. Returning to the community is also an important outcome for many patients who are not expected to make functional improvement during their HH stay, and for patients who may be expected to decline functionally because of their medical condition. The discharge to community outcome offers a multidimensional view of preparation for community life, including the cognitive, physical, and psychosocial elements involved in a discharge to the community.62,63 60 Further description of patient discharge status codes can be found, for example, at the following Web page: https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jea/topics/claim -submission/patient -status -codes FH, Naughton BJ.

In contrast, payments associated with discharge to non- community settings were considerably higher, ranging from $7,981 to $35,192 for HHA discharges per episode of care.70 Measuring and comparing HH-level discharge to com munity r ates is expecte d to help differentiate among HHAs with varying performance in this important domain, and to hel p avoid disparities in care across patient groups . Variation i n discharge to community rates has been reported within and across PAC set tings; acr oss a variety of HH-level characteristics, such as geographic l ocation (for example, regional locati on, u rban or rural location) , ownership (for example , for-profit or nonprofit), and freestanding or hospital-based units; and across patient- level cha racteristics, s uch as race and gender.71,72,73,74,75,76 64 Dobrez, D., Heinemann, A.

The \"expected\" number of discharges to commu nity is the predicted number of risk- adjusted di scharges to com munity i f the same patient s wer e treated a t the averag e HHA appropriat e to t he measure.

Numerator The measure does not have a simple form f or the numerator a nd denominator \u2014that is, th e risk adjustment method does not make the observed number of community discharges the numerator, and a predicted number the denominator . The measure numerator is the risk-adjusted e stimate of the number of patients who are discharged to the community, do not have an unplanned admission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31-day post-discharge observation window, a nd remain alive during the post- discharge observation window. T his estimate starts with t he observed di scharges to com munity, and i s risk adjusted for patient characteristics and a statistical estimate of the HHA e ffect beyond case mix. The numerator uses a m odel es timated on full na tional dat a specifi c to the post- acute setting; it is applied to the HHA' s patient stays included in the measure, and includes the estimated effect o f that HHA. T he prediction equa tion is based o n a logisti c statistical m odel with a t wo-level hierarchical structure.

Table 1-1. Patient Discharge Status Codes Used to Determine Discharge to Community Code Discharge Status Codes Indicating Community Discharge 01 Discharged to home/self -care (routine discharge) 81 Discharged to home or self -care with a planned acute care hospital readmission N umerator Details: Unplanned Admissions in the 31-Day Post-Discharge Observation Window A patient who is discharged to the community is considered to have an unfavorable outcome if they have a subsequent unplanned admission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the post- discharge observation window, which includes the day of discharge and the 31 following days. We identify unplanned admissions based on the planned readmissions algorithm used in the following post- acute care readmission measures, endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF): (i) NQF #2510: Skilled Nursing Facility 30 -Day (SNFRM); (ii) NQF #2502: All -Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities; (iii) NQF #2512: All- Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Long Term Care Hospitals; and (iv) NQF #2380: Rehospitalization During the First 30 Days of Home Health. 103,104,105,106 These readmission measures are based on the Hospital -Wide All- Cause Readmission Measure (HWR) (CMS/Yale) (NQF #1789),107 with some additions made for PAC settings. The planned admission definition is based on the claim from the admission having a code for a procedure that is frequently planned; however, if a principal diagnosis in a specified list of acute diagnoses is present, the admission is reclassified as unplanned. Admissions to psy chiatric hospitals or units are classified as planned admissions. Please note that this measure has been developed with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9) procedure and diagnosis codes. The measure will be revised using the ICD -9 to ICD-10 cross- walk. 102 Further description of patient discharge status codes can be found, for example, at the following Web page: https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jea/topics/claim -submission/patient- status -codes. 103 NQF #2510: www.qualityforum.org/QPS/2510 104 NQF #2502: All -Cause Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities. www.qualityforum.org/QPS/2502 105 NQF #2512: All -Cause Unplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Lon g Term Care Hospitals . w ww.qualityforum.org/QPS/2512 106 NQF #2380: Rehospitalization During the First 30 Days of Home www.qualityforum.org/QPS/2380 107 NQF SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Numerator Details: Death in the 31-Day Post-Discharge Observation Window Patients who are discharged t o the community are also considere d to have an unfavorable outcome if they die in the post-discharge window , which i nclud es the day of discharge and the 31 following days. Death in the post-discharge window is identified using date of death f rom Med icare eligibility f iles. Target Population and Measure Exclusions The target population for the measure is the group of Medicare FFS p atients who are not excluded for the reasons listed below. Measur e exclusions Exclusions for the discharge to community measure are listed below, along with the rationale for each exclusi on. The measure exclusion criteria are determine d by processing Medi care claims and eligibility da ta to de termine whether t he individua l exclusion criteria a re met. A ll measure e xclusion criteria ar e based on administrative data. S tays ending in transfers to the same level of care are excluded. 1.Age under 18 years Rationale: There is limited literature on discharge destination outcomes in this age gr oup. P atients in this age group represent a different cohort, likely living with their parents, and may be expected to have higher discharge- to-community rates than the rest of the Medicare population . P atients in this age group represent a small proportion of the post-acute Medicare FFS population. 2.Discharges to a psychiatric hospital Rationale: Patients discharged to a psychiatric hospital are excluded from the measure becaus e co mmunity living at the time of discharge may be potentially inappropriate or unsafe for them because of their mental health or psychiatric condition. 3.Discharges against me dical advice Rationale: Patients who discharge themselves against medical advice are excluded becau se t heir care plan may not have been fully implemented, and the discharge destination may not reflect the agency's discharge recommendation. Additionally, pa tients discharged against medical advice may be at higher risk of post- discharge admissions or death, depending on t heir medical condition, or because of potential non -adherence or non -compliance with car e r ecommendations. 4. D ischarges to disaster alter native care sites or federal hospitals Rationale: Patients discharged to disaster alternative care sites are excluded because these discharges are likely influenced by external emergency conditions, and may not represent discretionary discharges by the PAC provider. Discharges to federal hospitals are also excluded. 5. D ischarges to court/law enforcement Rationale: Patients who are discharged to court or law enforcement are likely ineligible for discharge to the community because of legal restrictions. 6. Patients discharged to hospice or enrolled in hospice during the post -discharge observation window Rationale: a. Patients discharged to hospice care are terminally ill, and have very different goals o f c are than non-hospice patients. For non -hospice patients, the primary goal of the PACFinal Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 20 provider is to return to baseline, independent living in the community; death is an undesirable outcome in the non -hospice population. For patients discharged to hospice, the goal is to give them the opportunity to die comfortably, at home or in a hospice facility. b. A large proportion of patients discharged to hospice care die in the 31 -day window following discharge from the post -acute setting. c. The hospice agency, not the PAC provi der, makes the final decision of discharge to hospice - home or hospice -facility. 7. P atients not continuously enrolled in Parts A and B FFS Medicare (or those enrolled in Part C Medicare Advantage) for the 12 months prior to the post-acute admission date, and at least 31 d ays after post -acute discharge date Rationale: Patients not continuously enrolled in Parts A and B FFS Medicare for the 12 months before the PAC admission date are excluded because risk adjustment for certain comorbidities requires information on acute inpatient, outpatient, and physician office bills for one year before post-acute admission. Patients not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for at least 31 days after post -acute discharge are excluded because admissions must be observable in the 31- day post- discharge period. Patients without continuous Part A and B coverage, or those who are ever enrolled in a Part C Medicare Advantage plan during the pre- or post- PAC periods will not have complete claims in the system. 8. P atients who have a short- term acute care stay or psychiatric stay for non -surgical treatment of cancer in the 30 days prior to PAC admission. Rationale: Patients with a prior short -term acute care stay for non -surgical treatment of cancer are excluded because they have a different trajectory for recovery after discharge, with a high mortality rate.108 Exclusion of these patients is consistent with the hospital- wide and post -acute readmission measures. 9. Post-acute stays that end in transfer to the same level of care Rationale: Post -acute stays that end in transfer to the same level of care are excluded from the measure because their post -acute episode has not ended. For a post- acute episode that involves transfer to the same level of care, only the final post- acute pr ovider is included in the measure. 10.Post -acute stays with claims data that are problematic (e.g., anomalous records for stays that overlap wholly or in part, or are otherwise erroneous or contradictory) Rationale: This measure requires accurate information from the post-acute stay and prior short- term acute care stay in the elements used for risk adjustment. 11. N ew proposed exclusion: Patients who had a long -term nursing facility stay in the 180 days preceding their hospitalization and IRF stay, with no intervening community discharge between the long- term nursing facility stay and qualifying hospitalization for measure inclusi on ( i.e., baseline nursing facility residents) Rationale: Baseline NF residents did not live in the community prior to their IRF stay and discharge to a community setting may not be a safe or expected outcome for these residents. Data source: We examine historical MDS data in the 180 days preceding the qualifying prior acute care admission and index IRF stay. Presence of an Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 108 NQF #1789: Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 21 (O BRA)-only assessment (not a SNF PPS assessment) with no intervening community discharge between the OBRA assessment and acute care admission date flags the index HHA episode as a baseline nursing facility resident. Data Sources This measure relies on data from Medicare's eligibility database as well as fee-for- service (FFS) claims from the home health, inpatient, outpatient, and physician office settings. The eligibility files provide beneficiary-level information such as date of birth, date of death, sex, reasons for Medicare eligibility, and enrollment histories in Medicare Parts A and B. The FFS claims files provide information about each home health and PAC stay, including dates of admission and discharge, diagnoses and procedures, and indicators for care received in the intensive care unit, coronary care unit, and emergency department. Furthermore, claims from all three file settings are used to construct for each patient a complete history of care before the index home health stay, which is used for constructing risk adjustment variables. No data beyond the bills submitted in the normal course of business are required from providers for the calculation of this measure. Below are links to documentation for each of the specific files for this measure. HH Measure Data Sources Information about the Medicare enrollment database is available online at: https://aspe.hhs.gov/centers -medicare -medicaid -services Documentation for the Medicare claims data is provided o nline by Research Data Assistance Center . D ata dictionaries are available for all three standard analytical files: oHome Health RIF - http://www.resdac.org/cms - data/files/carrier-rif Measure Ti me Window HH Time Window: In the HH setting, the measure is calculated using 2 years of data. HH episodes during the 2- year time window, except those that meet the exclusion criteria, are included in the measure. For patients with multiple HH episodes during the two- year time window, each episode is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Data from C alendar Y ear 2012 -2013 were used to develop this measure. Statistical Risk Model and Risk Adjustment Covariates We used a hierarchical logistic regression method to predict the probability of discharge to community. Patient characteristics related to discharge and a marker for the specific discharging HHA are included in the equation. The equation is hierarchical in that both individual patient characteristics are accounted for, as well as the clustering of patient characteristics by HHA. The statistical model estimates both the average predictive effect of the patient characteristics across all HHAs, and the degree to which each HHA has an effect on discharge to community that differs from that of the average HHA. The HHA effects are assumed to be randomly distributed around the average (according to a normal distribution). When computing the HHA effect, hierarchical modeling accounts for the known predictors of discharge to community, on average, such as patient characteristics, the observed HH rate, and the number of HH stays eligible for inclusion in the measure. The estimated HHA effect is determined mostly by the HHA's own data if the number of patient discharg es is relatively large (as the estimate would be relatively precise), but is adjusted toward the average if the number of patient discharges is small (as that would yield a less precise estimate). 22 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 We used the following model: Let Y ij, denote the outcome (equal to 1 if patien t i is discharged to community, 0 otherwise) for a patient i at HHA j ; Zij denot es a set of risk ad justment variables. We assume the outcome is r elated to the risk adjusters via a log it function w ith the following dispersion : l ogit(Prob(Y ij =1)) = j + *Zij + ij(1) j = \u00b5 + j ; j ~ N(0, 2) where Z ij = (Z 1, Z2, ... Z k) is a set of k patient -level risk adjustment variables; j represents the HH - specific intercept; \u00b5 is the adjusted average outcome across all HHAs; 2 is the between - HHA variance component; and ~N(0,2) is the error term. The hierarchical logistic regression model is estimated using SAS software (PROC GLIMMIX: SAS/STAT User's Guide, SAS Institute Inc.). The estimated equation is used twice in the measure. The sum of the probabilities of discharge to community of all patients in the HH measure, including both the effects of patient characteristics and the HHA, is the \"predicted number\" of discharges to community after adjusting for the HH case mix. The same equation is used without the HHA effect to compute the \"expected number\" of discharges to community for the same patients at the average HHA. The ratio of the predicted -to-expected number of discharges to c ommunity is a measure of the degree to which discharges to community are higher or lower than what would otherwise be expected. This standardized risk ratio is then multiplied by the mean discharge to community rate for all HH stays for the measure, yieldi ng the risk-standardized discharge to community rate for each HHA. Please note that the estimation procedure is recalculated for each measurement period. Re- estimating the models for each measurement period allows the estimated effects of the patient characteristics to vary over time as patient case- mix and medical treatment patterns change. Risk adjustment variables may include demographic and eligibility characteristics; principal diagnoses; types of surgery or procedures from a prior short- term acute care stay where applicable; comorbidities; length of stay and intensive care utilization from a prior short- term acute care stay; dialysis in the prior acute stay; and number of prior hospitalizations in the year preceding the PAC admission. Risk adjustment v ariable descriptions are provided below. See Appendix Table 1 for the full list of variables in the risk adjustment models. 1.Age and sex groups. 2.End stage renal disease (ESRD) or disability as original reason for entitlement. 3.Principal diagnosis (Clinical C lassifications Software groups) when from a prior hospitalization, if that hospitalization took place during the 30 days before the HH start or resumption of care. The ICD -9 or ICD-10 codes from the prior acute claim are groupe d c linically using the Clinic al Classifications Software groupings for ICD -9 or ICD1 0 di agnoses developed by the AHRQ.109 4.Surgical procedure categories from a prior hospitalization, if that hospitalization took pl ace d uring the 30 days before HH start or resumption of care. The procedures are grouped using the CCS classes for ICD -9 or ICD-10 procedures developed by AHRQ. 5.Length of prior acute hospital stay in days, for patients whose prior acute stay was in a non - psychiatric hospital (categorical variables are used to account for nonlinearity) . 109 Documentation of the AHRQ Clinical Classifications Software groupings of ICD -9 codes is available at http://www.hcup- us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp . for HH QRP Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 23 6.Indicator for if a prior hospitalization during the 30 days before HH start or resumption of care took place in the intensive/cardiac care units. Comorbidities (Hierarchical Condition Categories) recorded during the 1 year prior to HH start or resumption of care are clustered using the Hierarchical Condition Categories ( HCC ) groups used by CMS.110 7.Number of prior acute hospital discharges during the one year prior to HH, not including those that took place during the 30 days before HH start or resumption of care. 8.Indicator for whether or not the patient had an outpatient emergency room visit, or a post-acute care visit, or an inpatient dialysis session during the year prior to HH start orresumption of care. 9.Activity of Daily Living (ADL) Severity Score, as calculated using responses on th e p atient's OASIS assessment. Measure Calculation Algorithm The following steps describe the calculation algorithm/measure logic for the discharge- to- community measure: Step 1: I dentify patients meeting the criteria for the target population, after applying measure exclusions. Step 2: Identify patients meeting the numerator criteria (i.e., discharge to community, no unplanned admissions on the day of home health discharge or in the 31 days following home health discharge, and no death on the day of home health discharge or in the 31 days following home health discharge). Step 3: Identify presence or absence of risk adjustment variables for each patient. Step 4: Calculate the predic ted and expected number of discharges to community for each agency using the hierarchical logistic regression model. T he predicted number of discharges to community for each HHA is calculated as the sum of the predicted probability of discharge to community for each patient discharged from the HHA and is included in the measure, including the HH - specific effect . T o calculate the predicted number of discharges to community, pred j, for index HH stays at HHA j, we used the following equation: pred j = logit-1(\u00b5 + i + *Zij)(2) where the sum is over all stays in HHA j, and i is the random intercept. To calculate the expected number , exp j, we used the following equation: exp j = logit-1 (\u00b5 + *Zij)(3) Step 5: Calculate the standardized risk ratio for each HHA as the ratio of the predicted to expected number of discharges to community. 110 CMS -HCC Mappings of ICD -9 Codes: Mappings are at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health -Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Risk- Adjustors.html Final Specifications for SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 24 To calculate the HHA -wide standardized risk ratio, SRR j, we used the following equation: SRR j = pred j/exp j (4) Step 6: Calculate the risk -standardized discharge to community rate for each HHA. To aid interpretation, the HHA -wide standardized risk ratio, SRR j, obtained from equation (4) is then multiplied by the overall national raw discharge to community rate for all HH stays, , to pr oduce the HHA - wide risk -standardized discharge to community rate (RSR j). To calculate the risk -standardized discharge to community rate for each HHA, we used the following equation: RSR j = SRR j*(5) NOTE: Because the statistic described in Step 6 is a complex function of parameter estimates, re- sampling and simulation techniques (e.g., bootstrapping) may be necessary to derive a confidence interval estimate for the final risk -standardized rate, to characterize the uncertainty of the estimate. Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 25 Chapter 2 Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements Section 1: Introduction Introduction The Improving Medicare Post- Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) requires CMS to develop, implement, and maintain standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) for PAC settings. The four PAC settings specified in the IMPACT Act are HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs. The goals of implementing cross- setting SPADEs are to facilitate care coordination and interoperability, and to improve Medicare beneficiary outcomes. Existing PAC assessment instruments (i.e., OASIS for HHAs, IRF- PAI for IRFs, LTCH CARE Data Set (LCDS) for LTCHs, and the Minimum Data Set MDS for SNFs) often collect data elements pertaining to similar concepts, but the individual data e lements\u2014questions and response options\u2014vary by assessment instrument. With a few exceptions, the data elements collected in these assessment instruments are not currently standardized or interoperable ; therefore, patient responses across the assessment instruments cannot be compared easily. The IMPACT Act further requires that the assessment instruments described above be modified to include core data elements on health assessment categories and that such data be standardized and interoperable. Implementat ion of a core set of standardized assessment items across PAC settings has important implications for Medicare beneficiaries, families, providers, and policymakers. CMS is proposing SPADEs for five categories specified in the IMPACT Act: 1.Functional status, such as mobility and self -car e 2. C ognitive function (e.g., able to express ideas and to understand normal speech) and mental status (e.g., depression and dementia) 3. Special services, treatments, and interventions (e.g., need for ventilator, dialysis, chemotherapy , a nd total parenteral nutrition) 4.Medical conditions and comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart failure, and pressure ulcers) 5. Impairments (e.g., incontinence; impaired ability to hear, see, or swallow) 6.Other categories as deemed necessary by the Secretary Background In the following sections, we present additional information on the SPADEs being finalized in the CY 2020 HH PPS r ule. We include detailed specifications of the data elements along with a mockup of how the SPADE is proposed to appear in the OASIS . We outline how each SPADE is relevant to the care of patients receiving care from HHAs, review its current use in existing PAC assessment item sets, and summarize any prior testing of the data elements. For SPADEs that were inclu ded in the National Beta Test, which was conducted by RAND between November 2017 and August 2018, we present detailed information on data element performance. E vidence supporting the se SPADEs comes from several sources including the Post -Acute Care Payme nt Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD), MDS 3.0 testing, and the National Beta Test. The most relevant metrics for evaluation of SPADE performance (i.e., feasibility and reliability) include the amount of missing data, time to administer the data element, and interrater reliability (IRR). IRR is the level of agreement between two raters; that is, the extent to which two different individuals would code the same response when presented with the same information. Typically, percent agreement and the kappa statisti c\u2014or weighted kappas, for ordinal data \u2014are used to represent IRR. The kappa statistic is preferred 26 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 in most ca ses becau se there ar e agreed -upon c onventions for its interpretation and it corrects for chance agreement between r aters. However, kappa is sensiti ve to prevalenc e rates; w hen prevalen ce rates are extremely high or low, the resulting kappa statistic does not accurately conv ey the level o f agreement.111 112 113 114 In those cases, pe rcent a greement is preferred. The evidenc e offered f or the SPADEs in t he sections below follow standard conventions in reporting both percent agreement and kappas or weighted kappas to d escribe IRR. Post-Acute Care Payment Reform D emon stration (PAC PRD ) Some prior evidenc e for t hese S PADEs comes from the PAC P RD. T he PAC P RD was mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to examine the relative costliness and outcomes of similar types of Medicare beneficiaries discharged t o different P AC settings (i.e., HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs) . To meet t hese aims, t he study collected standardized assessment data, using the Continuity A ssessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) ac ross PAC s ettings to measure patient severity an d case-mix acr oss setting s at m ore than200 provider s in 11 g eographically di verse markets. The standardized as sessment data allowed cr oss-setting com parisons of the factors associated w ith costs and ou tcomes, as well as service substitution among post- acute providers, al l else being equal about the patient. Further information on the design and methods of the PAC PRC can be found at the CMS PAC -PRD of the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MD S 3.0) Additional testing information comes from the national testing of the MDS 3.0.115 During a 6-year period starting in 2003, CMS engaged in a national project to create an improved version of the MDS 2.0. A joint RAND/Harvar d team employed an iterative development process that culminated in the national testing of the MDS 3.0 i n 2006 a nd 2007. The national validation and evaluation testing of the MDS 3.0 include d 71 community nursing homes (3,822 residents) and 19 Veterans Health Administration nursing homes (764 residents), distributed throughout the regions of the United States . The evaluation was designed to test and analyze IRR , validity of key items, r espons e rates f or interview i tems, f eedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to com plete the MDS assessment . In a ddition, the national test design allowe d comparison of item distributions between MDS 3.0 a nd MDS 2.0.

Available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NursingHomeQualityInits/Downloads/MDS30FinalReport.pdf 27 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 The National Beta Test was conducte d to evaluate the reliability and validity of candidate SPADEs and to support t he identification of data element s for standardization across PAC s ettings, i n accordance with the mandates of the IMPACT A ct. To test S PADE pe rformance within each set ting, sufficient numbers of patients/residents needed to b e included in each o f the four settings to enable setting -specific performance estimates. Further, t he participating patients/residents needed to represent ad equate coverage of the clinical range of patients/resident s receiving care nationally i n each of the four PAC se ttings. To evaluate the s uitability of the SPADEs for cr oss-setting use, sufficient num bers of facilities/agenci es of each setting type needed t o be included in t he test. These facilities/agencies needed t o reflect a reasonable range of geographic d iversity r elative to P AC s ettings na tionally. Many large national s tudies of patients and health cond itions are designed t o generat e estimates and make comparisons of r ates of conditions or severity of patients on one or m ore clinical ch aracteristics (e.g., cognitive status). To do this, these studi es seek t o recruit a proportionally ba lanced representative sample, and employ case-mix models and/or sampling weights to the data. In contrast , the National Beta Test w as designed to g enerate valid an d robust na tional S PADE pe rformanc e estimates (i.e., time to complete and IRR), w hich f undamentally r equires acceptable geographic diversity, suf ficient s ample size, and reasonable coverage of the range of clinical cha racteristics. To m eet these requirements, the National Beta Test was carefully designed so data could be collecte d from a wide range of environments, allowing for thoroug h evalua tion of candidate SPADE pe rformance in al l PAC se ttings. These analyses i ncluded extensive checks on the sampling design ( e.g., generating results by market and by urbanicity) to i dentify possible limitations to the generalizability of results. Results of these sensitivity analyses are not included in this document, bu t will be de scribed in de tail in the forthcoming volumes of the National Beta Test Final Report ( see https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality ev idence from the National B eta Test that i s included for some SPADEs, w e include an abridged descripti on of the National Beta Test design and methods below. A n in-depth technical d iscussion of the design and m ethods of t he National B eta Test ca n be in the document titled \"Development and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: F indings from the National B eta Test ( Volume 2),\" available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality IMPACT - Act-Downloads-and-Videos.html . Design and sampling The National Beta Test included PAC providers in 14 geographic/metropolitan areas, or \"markets,\" across the country. This number was chosen to be similar to the design used for the PAC PRD. A mu lti- stage stratified random sampling plan was used to obtain the sample of 14 markets, in the United States, and then a sample of eligible PAC facilities was compiled from those markets. To be eligible for selection, markets had to meet the following crite ria: Sampled markets would yield a predefined number of PAC facilities/agencies of each type for th e s ample (12 SNFs, 10 HHAs, at least four LTCHs or IRFs, and at least one LTCH) The predefined number of facilities/agencies within the markets were expected to have flow rat es l arge enough to obtain the targeted number of assessments per facility The predefined number of facilities/agencies had to be located within 2 hours of one another tofacilitate completion of assessments in a timely manner Of 306 marke ts in the United States , 64 were deemed eligible. The random sampling of the 14 markets was stratified by U.S. Census division to enhance geographic representation yielding the following 14 markets: Boston, MA; Chicago, IL ; Dallas, TX ; Durham, NC ; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Harrisburg, VA ; Houston, TX ; Kansas City, MO ; Los Angeles, CA ; Nashville, TN ; Philadelphia, PA; 28 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Phoenix, AZ; St. Louis, MO ; and San Diego, CA. B ecause these markets are a random sample, t hey ar e expected to b e representative of the set of 64 eligible facilities and f indings a re therefore g eneralizable to the set of e ligible facilities. The target numbers of providers by setting within these 14 markets were 28 IRFs, 28 LTCHs, 84 SNFs, and 70 HHAs , totaling 210 PAC providers . The number of settings was determined based on standard sam ple size calculations which included t he numbers of faciliti es and patient s rather t han the proportions of the populations they represente d. The power calculations indicated that 28 providers per setting type (two in each market) would yield enough admissions during the field period to obtain robust estimates of can didate S PADE pe rformance. This minimum nu mber w as adopted as the recruitment target for IRFs and LTCHs; additional SNFs and HHAs were targeted t o enh ance sampl e diversity i n light of the larger proporti on of these setting types nationally. A total of 143 PAC facilities (35 HHAs, 22 IRFs, 26 LTCHs, 60 SNFs) were successfully recruited across 14 U.S. markets to participate in the National Beta Test. Although this number falls short of targets both overall and by setting this shortfall was offset by extending the field perio d, allowing for the accrual of more eligible patient/resident admissions and discharges. Eligibility The National Be ta Test SPADEs included in this rule were evaluated for performance among a sample of communicative patients/residents (who could make themselves understood through any means). All communicative patients/residents who were admitted to a participating prov ider site during the field period and were Medicare beneficiaries covered under one of the PAC PPS were eligible for the admission assessment, and all those who completed an admission assessment and were discharged during the field period were eligible fo r the discharge assessment. National Beta Test enrollment of non- communicative patients/residents was not tied to an admission date so as to ensure availability of sufficient numbers within the field period for evaluation of three data elements developed specifically for non-communicative patients/residents (observational assessments of cognitive status, mood, and pain). Although this ensured availability of sufficient numbers of non- communicative patients/residents for testing of the non- communicative data elements, it precluded assessing these patients/residents with non - interview SPADEs at admission. The three data elements developed specifically for non -communicative patients/residents are not included in this rule; thus, the non- communicative sample from the National Beta Test is not described further here. S ection 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act116 states that facilities that deliver PAC services under Medicare are required to provide qualified interpreters to their patients/residents with limited English proficiency. Facilities have discretion in how they furnish qualified interpreters, including the use of remote interpreters (i.e., high -quality telephone or video services). As described above, the focus of the National Beta Test was to establish the feasibility and validity of the data elements within and across PAC settings. Including limited English proficiency patients/residents in the sample would have required the National Beta Test facilities to engage or involve translators during the test assessments. In planning the National Beta Test, we anticipated that this would have added undue comple xity to what facilities /agencies were being asked to do, and would have undermined the ability of facility/agency staff to complete the requested number of assessments within the assessment window (e.g., Admission Days 3 - 7) a nd within the study field period. In light of the strong existing evidence for the feasibility of al l p atient/resident interview SPADEs included in this rule (B rief Interview for Mental Status [BIMS] , Pain I nterference, Patient Health Questionnaire [ PHQ]) when administered in other lang uages, either throug h s tandard PAC workflow (e.g., as tested and currently collected in the MDS 3.0) and/or through rigorous translation and testing (e.g., PHQ), the performance of translated versions of these patient/resident 116 For more information, see https://www.hhs.gov/civil -rights/for -individuals/section -1557/index.html 29 Final Specifications for SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 interview S PADEs did not need to be further evaluated. In addition, because their exclusion did not threaten ou r ability t o achieve acceptable geographic diversity, su fficient sample size, and r easonable coverage of the range of PAC pa tient/resident c linical characteristics, t he exclusion of limited E nglish proficiency patients/residents w as not considered a limitation to interpretation of the National Beta Test results. Data c ollection Admission assessments were completed between admission days 3 -7; discharge assessments could be completed from 2 days before discharge through the discharge date. Trained research nurses and/or staff at participating PAC facilities /agencies administered all assessments. A subset of the admission assessments was completed by research nurse/facility st aff assessor pairs to allow for evaluation of IRR . Power analyses indicated that reliability estimates required a minimum of 194 paired assessments, time to complete estimates could be compared across settings for detection of small effect sizes with a min imum of 274 assessments per setting, and as few as 460 assessments would be sufficient to evaluate aspects of validity (e.g., group differences, associations with other clinical variables, etc.) with small to moderate effect sizes. Therefore average assessment contributions per participating facility/agency were calculated for each of these goals (i.e., paired assessments, assessments completed by facility/agency staff, total admission assessments) and communicated throughout the study period to guide the data collection and track progress. These minimums were more easily attainable in SNFs and HHAs because of the larger number of partici pating facilities/agencies. However, participating LTCHs and IRFs also were able to collectively meet these targets by the end of the field period. The total number of admission assessments is shown in Appendix 3, Table 1.1. This table also shows the number of assessments from which completion times were estimated, and the number of assessments that were conducted by paired r aters and contributed to evaluation of IRR. In addition to meeting the minimum sample size requirements, the data collection yielded very small rates of missing data, speaking to the overall feasibility of the SPADEs. Table 1.2 in Appendix 3 shows completion rates by National Beta Test protocol module. Module completion rates ranged from 93.8 to 98.2 percent, and nearly 90 percent of the communicative admission sample completed all assessment modules. More information on the design and methods of the National Beta Test can be found at in the document \"Development and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: Findings from the National Beta Test (Volume 2),\" available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 30 Section 2: Cognitive Function Impairments in cognitive function can result from many underlying conditions, including dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, brain injury, side effects of medication, metabolic and endocrine imbalances, and del irium .117 Cognitive impairments may affect a patient or resident's ability to recover from illness or injury, or they may be a sign of an acute condition (e.g., hypoxia) that requires immediate intervention. Cognitive impairment that manifests with behaviora l symptoms \u2014or that impairs a patient's ability to communicate, prompting behavioral disturbances\u2014may put the patient or resident or others in the care setting at risk for injury or assault, or may signal unmet patient or resident needs (e.g., pain manageme nt). Screening for the presence of impairment can help ensure appropriate and timely intervention. A substantial proportion of PAC patients and residents experience cognitive impairment, delirium, communication impairment, or behavioral distress. Testing from the PAC PRD found that about one-third of patients and residents in PAC settings were classified as having moderately or severely impaired cognitive function. 118 About one-third exhibited disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness, and about one -half exhibited inattention. Fewer than 7 percent of patients and residents exhibited signs and symptoms of behavioral distress in the PAC PRD. Therapeutic interventions can improve patient outcomes, and evidence suggests that treatment (e.g., drugs, physical activity) can stabilize or delay symptom progression in some patients, thereby improving quality of life.119 120 121 In addition, assessments help PAC providers better understand the needs of their patients by establishing a baseline for identi fying changes in cognitive function and mental status (e.g., delirium), elucidating the patient's ability to understand and participate in treatments during their stay, highlighting safety needs (e.g., to prevent falls), and identifying appropriate support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of patient or resident cognition supports clinical decision -making, early clinical intervention, person -centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, enabling the transfer of accurate health information. CMS has identified several data elements as applicable for cross- setting use in standardized assessmen t of cognitive impairment. 1.The BIMS 2.The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) 117 National Institute on Aging.

They are collected by various modes (e.g., clinicia n assessed, patient reported). Brief In terview for Mental S tatus (BIMS) The BIMS i s a performance -based cog nitive assessment developed to be a brief cognition screener w ith a focus on learning and memory. T he BIMS ev aluates repetiti on, recall with and without prompting, and temporal orientation. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS does not include a performance- based cognitive assessment. The proposed p erformance- based cognitive assessment, the BIMS, would provide important baseline infor mation about cognitive function when patients are discharge d to the HH setting . In the PAC PRD, two-thirds of patients in the HH setting (67.5 percent) were cognitively intact or borderline functioning, but 18.6 percent were moderately impaired, and 11.2 pe rcent f ell into a severely i mpaired category.122 Although patients treated in HHAs, w hen c ompared t o those admitted to o ther se ttings, w ere least likely t o have severe cognitive impairment, cognitive function predicts changes in functional status (i.e., activities of daily living) among patients receiving HH, and can a ffect the ability of HH pa tients to sa fely m anage their m edication regimens.123 , 124 Cognitive im pairment is a lso associated w ith re-hospitalizati on among elderly patients receiving home health ca re.125 Therefore assessing cognitive function am ong patients in a home health setting is im portant.

Prior evidence supporting use of t he BIMS The BIMS data elements w ere tested in the PAC PRD, where they showed substantial to almost perfect reliability of 0.71 to 0.91 (weighted kappas) when used across all four PAC settings . The lowest agreement was on the \"repetition of three words\" memory da ta element , with a kappa of 0.71, whic h still falls within t he rang e of substantial agreement. P AC P RD t esting also de monstrated the feasibility of the BIMS f or use in a ll four PAC s etting s and found evidence of s trong reliability of the BIMS da ta elements across the four PAC setting s. In addition, the BIMS data elements w ere found to be predictive of higher patient cost.126 The BIMS da ta elements w ere also include d in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes and showe d almost perfect reliability.127 Agreement ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (standard kappa). The BIMS da ta elements were f ound to be highly correlated (0.906) with a gold-standard m easure of cognitive f unction, the Modified Mini- Mental S tatus (3MS) e xam.128 Evidence supporti ng us e of the BIMS from the National Beta Test Assessing impairment: In the National Beta T esting, t he BIMS w as administered at adm ission to 646 pa tients/residents in H HAs, 786 in IRFs, 496 in LTCHs, and 1,134 in SNFs = 3,062 overall). Overall, 5 pe rcent of patients/residents met criteria for being severely impaire d, 18 percent for being moderately impaired, and 76 percent for being intact. In the HHA setting, 4 pe rcent were severely impaired, 17 pe rcent were moderately impaired, and 8 0 percent were intact. P atients in t he HHA s etting show ed similar im pairment levels to thos e in IRF and somewhat lower impairment than those in an LTCH or SNF. Setting -specifi c admission frequencies f or BIMS da ta elements and t he overall impairment category at admission are shown in Appendix 3, Table 2.1.1. Missing data: In general, there wer e low rates of missing data for B IMS i tems. I tem-level missing data ranged from 0.4 to 1. 7 percent overall and ranged from 0 to 2.8 percent in the HHA s etting. F or all settings, m issing data rates were slightly hig her for recall of current day of the week. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to com plete: To assess f easibility of administration, the length of time to a dminister th e BIMS w as assessed am ong 445 patients/residents in HHA s, 537 in IRFs, 332 in LTCHs, and 494 in SNFs (n = 1,808 overall). Overall mean time to complete the BIMS was 2.2 minutes (standard deviation [ SD] = 1.2 minutes) . Time to complete in the HHA s etting was 2.4 minutes (SD = 1.2 minute s). Interrater r eliability: The IRR w as excellent for the BIMS , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters (n = 966 paired assessment s across settings; n = 199 paired assessments in HHAs ). Across all settings, t he kappa for the BIMS Impai rment Category classification (based on the BIMS total score) was 0.91; in the HHA s etting, t he kappa was 0.9 4. The kappas for individual items within the BIMS ranged from 0.83 to 0.93 across all settings and ranged from 0.84 t o 0.93 in the HHA setting. Ka ppa was not e stimated f or two items within the BIMS across settings and for HHA because the proportion of patients across settings with correct responses was out of range for a stable kappa estimate.

Confusion Assessment M ethod (CAM\u00a9) The CAM is a widely us ed delirium screening tool.129 Delirium, when undetected or untreated, can increase the likelihood of complications, rehospitalization, a nd death r elative to pa tients/resid ents without delirium.130 Although multiple versions of the CAM have been developed, CMS is proposing that the Short version be adopted for SPADEs . The Short CAM contains only four items (i.e., items 1 to 4) from the original C AM (Long CAM). These items focus on an acute change in m ental st atus, i nattention, disorganized thinking, a nd altered level of consciousness. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS does not screen for delirium through use of assessments such as the CAM. However, it is im portan t to do so in that delirium is common among home health populations; analyses of PAC PRD data have shown that HHAs have more patients with signs and symptoms of delirium than other PAC set tings.131 In PAC PRD testing, 52.9 percent of HH patients showe d inattention, 37.0 pe rcent showed disorganized thinking, and 14.0 percent showed altered level of consciousness as assesse d by the CAM.132 Among HHAs participating in the PAC PRD, the CAM demonstrated moderate- to-high inter- rater reliability for the inattention (kappa = 0.5 9), disorganized thinking (kappa = 0.79) , and altered level of consciousness/alertness (kappa = 0.54 ) questions.133 Delirium may int erfere w ith a patient's ability to engage in self-care, medication management, t herapeutic activities, a nd activities of da ily living. As such, assessing patients for signs and symptoms of delirium is critical for care planning and decision making in the HH setting.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 35 C urrent use The Short CAM data element s are currently collected in the MDS and the LCDS, and the scoring is based on staff observations of signs and symptoms of delirium. Although the Short CAM data elements are used in both assessment tools, the response options currently differ. The current version of the LCDS includes two response options (yes/no, indicating that the behavior is present or not present), whereas the MDS offers three response options (behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate; behavior present, fluctuates; behavior not present). The LCDS and MDS versions of the CAM also differ slightly in wording and criteria for the \"Altered Level of Consciousness\" item. Prior evidence supporting use of the CAM A version of the CAM, with an item added to assess psychomotor retardation , was tested in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes. Reliabilities were substantial or almost perfect. Overall average kappa ranged from 0.85 to 0.89 and items ranged from 0.78 to 0.90 (standard kappa). 134 Based on a meta - analysis of diagnostic accuracy in nine studies, the CAM demonstrated moderate sensitivity (82 percent, 95% confidence interval: 69-91 percent) and high specificity (99 percent, 95% co nfidence interval : 87- 100 percent), respectively, using a delirium diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV) as the standard.135 Evidence supporting use of the CAM from the National Beta Test Assessing impairment: In the National B eta Testing, we administered the version of the CAM that is currently collected in the MDS 3.0, that is, the version with three response options.

Overall, 5 percent of patients/residents had ev idenc e of mental st atus change from baseline, 12 percent had difficulty focusing (3 percent continuously), 6 percent had disorganized thi nking (1 percent continuously), and 4 percent had altere d consciousness (1 percent continuously). In the HHA setting specifically, 5 percent of patients/residents had evidenc e of mental s tatus change from baseline, 11 percent had difficulty focusing (2 percent continuously), 5 percent had disorganized thinking (1 percent continuously), and 3 pe rcent had altere d consciousness (1 percent continuously). S etting -specific frequencies for CAM data elements at admission are shown in Appendix 3, Table 2.2.1. Missin g data: Overall, t here were very l ow rates of m issing data for the CAM. Across all se ttings, item-level missing data did not exceed 0.4 percent for any of the four CAM items. In the HHA s etting , item-level missing data did not exceed 0. 5 percent. For all settings, m issing data rates wer e slightly higher for the change in mental status from baseline item . In general , the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration.

Interrater r eliability: The IRR w as good for the CAM as measured by k appa and percent agreement of paired raters (n = 914 paired assessment s across settings; n = 189 paired assessments in HHAs). T he kappa for the focusing at tention item was good both overall (0.66) and in the HHA s etting (0.66 ). Kappa was not e stimated f or the other three items within the CAM because the proportion of patients across settings a s well as within HHAs wit h correct responses was out of range for a stable kappa estimate.

Percent agreement in the HHA setting was similarly hi gh for the four C AM items (9 7 percent, 91 percent, 94 pe rcent, and 98 percent , respectively). Please refer to Table 2.2.2 in Appendi x 3 for kappa and percent agreement statistics for a ll CAM items. Mental Status (Depressed Mood ) Depression is the most comm on mental health condition in older adults, yet underrecognized and thus under-treated. Existing data show that depresse d mood is relatively com mon in patients and residents receiving PAC services . The PAC PRD found that about 9 percent of individuals in PAC were classified as likely t o have depression.136 The prevalence varied f rom a low of 7 pe rcent o f beneficiari es in S NFs to a high of 11 percent of patients in IRFs.137 Almost half of nursing home residents i n the United States with a n active diagnosis of depression a t the time of admission are not r eceiving psychiatric treatment (medication or psychological therapy) for the condition.138 Older adults with depression may exhibit different symptoms than younger adults , including fatigue, insomnia, irritable mood, confusion, and lack of focus.139 Some medications and medical 136 This estimate is based on patient responses to a question about being sad in the two weeks before the assessment interview in a study of patient/residents in the PAC PRD (Gage, Morley et al., 2012). If they responded \"often\" or \"always,\" they were considered to have depression. 137 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012. 138 Ulbricht, C. M., Rothschild, A. J., Hunnicutt, J. N., & Lapane, K. L. (2017).

Depressive symptoms improve in 60 t o 80 percent of elderly pa tients taking an an tidepressant medication.140 Psychosocial t reatments of depression in older adul ts have been show n to be more effective than no treatment, according to self -rated a nd clinician- rated m easures o f depression.141 142 A ssessments of the signs and symptoms of depression help PAC providers better understand the needs of their patients and residents by prompting further evaluation (i.e., to establish a diagnosis of depression); elucidating the patient's or resident's ability to participate in therapies for conditions other than depression during their stay; and identifying appropriate ongoing treatment and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of depression among PAC patients and residents supports clinic al decision -making , early clinical intervention, person- centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate health information. Standardized Data Elements to Assess Depressed Mood CMS has identified the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 to 9 (PHQ-2 to 9) data elements for standardized assessment of depressed mood. Patient Health Qu estionnaire-2 to 9 (PHQ- 2 to 9) The PHQ -2 to 9 data elements use a summed -item scoring approach to first screen for signs and symptoms of depressed mood in patients and residents by assessing the two cardinal criteria for depression: depressed mood and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure). 143 At least one of the two must be present for a determination of probable depression, which signals the need for continued assessment of the additional seven PHQ symptoms. The interview is concluded if a respondent scr eens negative for the first two symptoms. Relevance to HHAs The PHQ -2 is currently included in OASIS. Assessors are required to report on whether or not patients have been screened for the signs and symptoms of depression. The PHQ -2 items are included on the assessment form as an optional aide to complete the screening during the assessment process, but HHAs are not required to use this particular assessment of the signs and symptoms of depression. However, the PHQ -2 to 9 is now being proposed as a required assessment instrument for the purposes of standardization. Depression is common among HH patients. According to PAC PRD data, 9.2 percent of HH patients screened positive for signs and symptoms depression. 144 Identifying and treating depression in home c are can decrease short -term risk of re -hospitalization. A study conducted with 477 patients newly admitted to home care found that, although depression was not associated with overall hospitalization rates, the hospitalization 140 Lebowitz, B.

The PHQ-9 data elements, which include the two questions used in the PHQ-2 plus additional items, are in use in MDS. Prior evidence supporting use of PHQ -2 The PHQ -2 is a brief, reliable screening tool for assessing signs and symptoms of depression. Among studies conducted in primary care centers with large samples of adults, the PHQ-2 has performed well as both a screening tool for identifying depression and an assessment of depression severity. 149 150 It has also been shown to be sensitive to changes in a patient's mood. Across 15 studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ -2 against a recognized gold- standard instrument for the diagnosis of major depression in adults, sensitivity estimates ( based on the summed- item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of 3) have varied, ranging from 39 percent to 97 percent (median value = 77 percent); specificity estimates (based on the summed -item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of three) have been higher and more stable (kappas ranged from 0.74 to 0.91).151 It is thus a viable option for standardization, with the benefits of the shorter assessment counterbalancing the limitation of the lower sensitivity. 150 L\u00f6we, B., Kroenke, K., & Gr\u00e4fe, K.

SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 The PHQ -9 was also t ested in the national MD S 3.0 test in nursing homes. For the two presence items in the PHQ-2 (little interest in doing things; feeling down, depressed, o r hopeless), k appa statistics were almost perfect and ranged from 0.98 to 0.99.152 The PHQ-9 was also found to have agreement with Modified S chedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophreni a (m-SADS), a g old-standard measure for mood disorder , in residents without severe cognitive impairment (weighted kappa = 0.69) and wit h the Cornell D epression S cale, a g old-standard m easure for m ood disorder , in residents with severe cognitive impairment (correlation = 0.63).153 In addition, the Staff Time and Resource Intensity V erification (STRIVE) study conducted in a national sample of nursing homes by CMS concluded t hat the PHQ-9 used in the MDS 3 .0 was the \"best m easur e\" for identifying individuals with h igher w age-weighted s taff time, defined as the time that nu rsing hom e staff spe nt caring for residents.154 Evidence supporti ng us e of PHQ-2 to 9 from the National Beta Test Assessing depressed mood: The P HQ-2 to 9 was administered to assess depressed m ood in the National B eta T est. As a hybrid m easure, the PHQ -2 to 9 us es the first two el ements (PHQ -2) as a gateway i tem for the longer P HQ-9. The assessor on ly adm inister s the full PHQ-9 if the initial sco re on the PHQ-2 passes a threshold indicating possible depression. A patient/resident who di d not show signs of depression base d in the PHQ-2 would not receive the seven additional elements containe d in the PHQ-9. In the National Beta Te st, the PHQ-2 to 9 was administered to 646 patients/residents in 1,134 in SNFs (n = 3,062 overall). Across settings, 38 percent of patients/residents reported having little interest in doing things and 43 percent reporte d feeling down, depressed, or hopeless at some point in the last 14 days. Among H HA patients, 35 percent reported having little interest in doing things, and 38 percent reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. For each of these two symptoms, about 1 in 12 H HA pa tients had experienced them nearly ev ery da y over the past 2 w eeks. About 1 in 6 experienced these symptoms on half or more of the days. More t han one in four patients/residents (28 percent) across settings passed the PHQ-2 to 9 threshold based on one or both of these symptoms, and continued t o complete the remaining seven data elements. This positive screen r ate was l ower in the HHA setting (24 percent). Detailed sy mptom endorsement and frequency for the PHQ- 2 to 9 is shown in A ppendix 3, Table 3.1.1. The average PHQ - 2-only score across settings was 2.4 (SD = 1.7), and 2.2 ( SD = 1. 6) in the HHA s etting. The average full PHQ -9 score across settings was 11.9 (SD = 5.3), and 11.4 ( SD = 5. 0) in the HHA setting. The PHQ -9 has thresholds to indicate the severity of probabl e depression.155 Across settings, the largest group of patients/residents screening positive on the PHQ -2 and continuing on t o complete the full PHQ-9 w ere the mild (31 percent) and modera te (32 percent) severity g roup. The same trend w as noted in HHA, with most patients/residents being classifie d in the mild (27 percent) or moderate (37 percent) severity group. The mean scores and severity threshold proportions are shown in Table 3.1.1 of Appendix 3. Missing data: Overall, t here wer e low rates of m issing data for t he PHQ -2 to 9. Across all settings, i tem-level missing data did not exceed 5.2 percent for any of the items. I n the HHA s etting, it em- level m issing data did not exceed 4.6 pe rcent for any of the items.

Among patients/residents who only received the PHQ-2, time to complete was an average of 1.7 minutes (SD = 1.1). The average time to com plete t he PHQ -2 in the HHA setting was 1.8 m inutes (SD = 1.2). Among pa tients receiving the full PHQ -9, the time to complete was an average of 4.0 minutes (SD = 1.2). In the HHA s etting, the time to complete the PHQ -9 was 4.2 m inutes on average (SD = 1. 2). Without regard for PHQ-2 versus PHQ -9 stratification, the mood data elements took an average of 2.3 minutes (SD = 1.5) to complete across settings, and 2.3 minutes (SD = 1.5) in the HHA setting. Interrater r eliability: IRR was assessed f or 196 patients/residents in H HAs, 254 in IRFs, 231 in LTCHs, and 267 in SNFs (n = 948 overall). IRR for all symptom presence and frequency items was excellent: kappas ranged from 0.95 t o 1.00 overall, and f rom 0.90 t o 1.00 in HHA s. IRR regarding eligibility f or the full PHQ -9 based on PHQ-2 responses was nearly perfect: kappa for whether to continue from the PHQ-2 to the full PHQ-9 was 0.98 across settings and 0.96 i n HHA. Finally, for patients/residents who received t he full P HQ-9, the IRR for sum of symptom frequencies was nearly perfect ( 0.96 overall and 0.97 in H HAs). Percent agreement was also ne arly pe rfect, ranging from 97 percent to 100 percent ov erall a nd 93 percent to 100 pe rcent in HHAs. For eligibility to complete the full PHQ -9, percent agreement was 99 percent across settings, and 9 8 percent i n HHA.

Section 3: Special Services, T reatments, an d Interventions ( Including Nutritional Approaches) Some medical conditions require complex clinical care, consisting of special services, treatments, and interventions. The implementation of these interventions typically indicates conditions of a more serious nature and can be life-sustaining. Patients and residents who need them may have few clinical alternatives. Conditions requiring the use of special services, treatments, and interventions can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self -image, and quality of life. Providers should be aware of the patient or resident's clinical needs to plan the provision of these important therapies, ensure the continued appropriateness of care, and support care transitions. The a ssessment of special services, treatments, and interventions may also help identify resource use intensity by capturing the medical complexity of patients/residents. S tandardized Data Elements to Assess for Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions CMS has identified data elements for cross- setting standardization of assessment for special services, treatments, and interventions in the areas of cancer, respiratory, and other treatments, as well as nutritional approaches. 1.

Receipt of this treatment indicates that a patient has a malignancy (cancer) and therefore has a serious, often life- threatening or life -limiting condition. Both IV and oral chemotherapy have serious side effects, including nausea/vomiting, extreme fatigue, risk of infection (due to a suppressed immune system), anemia, and an increased risk of bleeding (due to low platelet counts). Oral chemotherapy can be as potent as chemotherapy given by IV but can be significant ly more convenient and less resource intensive to administer. Because of the toxicity of these agents, special care must be exercised in handling and transporting chemotherapy drugs. IV chemotherapy may be given by peripheral IV but is more commonly given via an indwelling central line, which raises the risk of bloodstream infections. The need for chemotherapy predicts resource intensity, both because of the complexity of administering these potent, because of toxic drug combinations following specific prot ocols , and because of what the need for chemotherapy signals about the patient's underlying medical condition. Furthermore, the resource intensity of IV chemotherapy is higher than for oral chemotherapy, as the protocols for administration and the care of the central line (if present) require significant resources. Relevance to HHAs Neither chemotherapy in general, nor specific routes of chemotherapy administration, are currently assessed in the OASIS. However, cancer is fairly common among HH patients. A ccording to data from the National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS), 9 percent of HH patients aged 65 and older had malignant neoplasms. 156 Another study of elderly patients newly admitted to HHAs found that 11 percent had a referral diagnosis of cancer.157 Oral and intravenous chemotherapy in the home for patients being treated for cancer has become increasingly common due to patient preference, its cost - effectiveness, and increasing demand for oncology services.158 Further, there is some evidence for the benefits of oncology home care; one study found that lung cancer patients who received oncology home care reported less distress and greater social independence compared to those who received usual outpatient care.159 Assessing the receipt of chemotherapy is important in the HH setting for care planning and defining case mix.

Prior evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) An IV Chemotherapy data element was found to be feasible for cross- setting use in the PAC PRD.160 In nursing homes, a checkbox for chemotherapy during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.161 Evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) from the National Beta Test Assessing Chemotherapy: One item assessed whether chemotherapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow- up items assessed whether the c hemotherapy was administered intravenous ly, oral ly, or by another route. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in IRFs, and 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, the overwhelming majority of patients/residents (99 percent) did not receive chemotherapy. In the HHA specifically, only 1 percent had chemotherapy treatment noted.

Radiation Radiation i s a type of c ancer treatment that u ses high -energy radiation t o shrink tumors and kill cancer c ells by damaging their D NA. H owever, it can a lso d amage normal cel ls, leading to side effects such a s fatigue, sk in irritation or damage, hair loss, n ausea, and delayed s ide effect s such as f ibrosis (scar tissue formation) , damage to the bowels if radiation was delivere d to the abdominal region, memory loss, and, infrequently, a second cancer due to radiation exposure. R adiation is a m ainstay of canc er treatment; about half to two-t hirds of all patients with can cer receive radiation therapy at some point in t heir treatment course.162 163 The indications rang e from early -stage cancer t reated w ith cu rative intent to palliative radiation therapy, suc h as to t reat m etastati c cancer; tumors that ar e pressing on the spine or growing within bones, causing severe pain; or shrinking a tumor near the esophagus, which can inhibit swallowing. There are many types of radiation, such as external- beam radiation therapy , internal radiation therapy (brach ytherapy that is delivere d from sources placed inside or on the body), and systemic radiation therapy (in which the patient sw allows or receives an injection of a radioactive substance). Relevance to HHAs Radiation t reatment is not currently a ssessed in th e OASIS. However, as mentioned above, cancer is fairly common among HH patients. According to data from the National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS), 9 percent of HH patients aged 65 and older had malignant neoplasms.164 Another study of elderly patients newly admitted to HHAs found that 11 percent had a referral diagnosis of cancer.165 A 2006 study of home health utilization among older adults with cancer found that approximately 29 percent of older patients' ac cess home health care following a cancer diagnosis.166 Thus, as sessing the receipt of radiation treatment for cancer is important in the HH set ting for ca re planning and defining case mix.

Kappas are not reported for the Radiation data element because its proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the Radiation data element was perfect across settings and 99 percent in the HHA specifically. Please refer to Table 4.2.2 in Appendix 3 for percent agreement statistics for the Radiation items. Oxygen Therapy (Intermittent, Continuous, High -Concentration Oxygen D elivery S ystem) Oxygen therapy provides a patient/resident with supplemental oxygen when medical conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, severe asthma) prevent the pa tient or resident from adequately oxygenating their bloodstream. Oxygen administration is a resource- intensive intervention, as it requires specialized equipment: a reliable source of oxygen, various delivery systems (e.g., oxygen concentrator, liquid oxygen containers, and high- pressure systems), and the patient interface (e.g., nasal cannula, various types of masks). Accessories are also required (regulators, filters, tubing, etc.). The equipment is generally the same for both sub -elements of this data el ement (continuous vs. intermittent) . The main differences between delivering oxygen intermittently versus continuously are the severity of the underlying illness (which often requires more hours per day of oxygen therapy) and the 167 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 46 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 bedside nursing care to se t up the oxygen delivery system if the patient is unable (whether physically or cognitively) to do so independently. The proposed Oxygen (Continuous, Intermittent) data element assesses if the patient received oxygen therapy and whether the oxygen was delivere d continuously (typically defined as >= 14 hours per day) or intermittently. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently asks about oxygen therapy, but does no t differentiate b etween in termittent and continuous oxygen. Assessing the receipt of intermittent and continuous oxygen therapy is important in the HH setting for care planning and resour ce allocation. HH pa tients may ha ve a medical con dition that r equires supplemental oxygen. A study by D wyer et al. found that 2.4 percent of individuals receiving home health care had pneumonia.168 Data from the National H ome and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS) indicate d that 15 percent of home health patients aged 65 and older had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allie d conditions.169 Pneumonia and COPD are the fourth and fifth most common diagnoses of Med icare beneficiaries discharged t o the home health se tting.170 According to a RAND ana lysis of 2013 OASIS da ta, 13.9 percent of patients in t he home health setting were receiving oxygen therapy.171 Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, Treatments, an d Interventions: Oxygen Therapy 168 Dwyer, L.

Prior evidence supporting use of Oxygen Therapy (Continuous, Intermittent, High -Concentration Oxygen Delivery System ) A related data element on high-concentration oxygen use (FiO2 > 40 percent) was used and found feasible for cross- setting use in the PAC PRD.172 In nursing homes, a checkbox for oxygen therapy during the last 5 days was shown to have reliability ranging from 0.93 to 0.96 (kappas) in the national MDS 3.0 test.173 Evidence supporting use of Oxygen Therapy from the National Beta Test Assessing Oxygen Therapy: One item assessed whether oxygen therapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow- up items assessed therapy type: intermittent, continuous, and use of a h igh-concentration oxygen delivery s ystem. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub- elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 1,087 in SNFs(n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, one in five patients/residents (20 percent), received oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy was less common in the HHA than in all other setting s, with 13 percent receiv ing oxygen therapy. Across settings, the most common type of oxygen therapy was i ntermittent therapy (14 percent). Only 6 percent of patients/residents had continuous therapy, and 1 percent of patients/res idents had a high-concentration oxygen delivery s ystem, respectively. This pattern was similar in the HHA setting : Intermittent Therapy (7 percent), Continuous therapy (6 percent) , and High-concentration Delivery (0 percent).

Suctioning (Scheduled, A s Needed) Suctioning is used t o clear secretions from the airway when a person can not clear those se cretions on his or her own for a variety of reasons, including excess prod uction of secretions from a pulmonary infectious process or neurological deficits that inhibit the ability to cough, swallow, and so on. S uction is done by aspirating secretions through a catheter connecte d to a suction source. Types of suctioning include oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning; nasotracheal suctioning; and suctioning through an artificial airway, such as a tracheostomy tube. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal su ctioning are a key pa rt of many patients' ca re plans, both to prevent the accumulation of secretions that can lea d to aspiration pneumonias (a common conditi on in patients with inadequate gag reflexes) a nd to relieve obstructions from mucus plugging during an acute or chronic respiratory infecti on, which often lead t o desaturations and increased respiratory effort. Suctioning can be done on a scheduled ba sis, if the patient is judged to c linically be nefit from regular interventions , or ca n be done a s needed, such as when secretions become so prominent that gurgling or choking is not ed, or a sudden desaturation occurs from a mucus plug. As suctioning is generally pe rformed by a care provider rather than independently, this intervention can be quite resource intensive if it occurs every hour, for example, rather than once a shift. It also s ignifies an un derlying medical co ndition t hat prevent s patient s from clearing their secretions effectively, w hich a lso m eans they need increased n ursing care more generally (such as after a stroke or during an acute respiratory i nfection). Relevanc e to HHA s The OASIS doe s not currently ass ess suctioning, al though many HH patients have m edical conditions that m ay ne cessitate thi s procedure. As mentioned above, a cross- sectional study by Dwyer et al. found that 2.4 percent of individuals receiving home health care had pneumonia.174 According to data from the National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS), 15 percent of home health patients aged 65 and older had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allie d conditions.175 Pneumonia and COPD are t he fourth and fifth m ost common diagnoses of Medicare beneficiari es discharged to the home health setting.176 These conditions may require suctioning to clear secretions from the patient's airway 174 Dwyer, L.

As such, assessing the receipt of suctioning is im portant in the HH setting for care planning and defining case mix. Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, Treatments, an d Interventions: S uctioning C urrent use Suctioning is currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received suctioning while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received suctioning while a resident and with in the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess whether the suctioning is scheduled or as needed. Prior evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) In the PAC PRD, suctioning was assessed as part of Trach Tube with Suctioning data element , which evaluated whether patients or residents had a tracheostomy tube or needed suctioning. This related data element was found feasible for cross- setting use in the PAC PRD.177 In nursing homes, a checkbox for suctioning during the last 5 days w as shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.178 Evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) from the National Beta Test Assessing Suctioning: One item assessed whether suctioning was provided during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow- up items assessed therapy type: Scheduled or As Needed. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub- elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 IRFs, 448 and 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, most patients/residents (99 percent) did not have suctioning noted, and those that did, noted \"a s needed \" suctioning (1 percent). In HHAs , only three patients (zero percent after rounding) had suctioning, which were always noted \"a s needed \" (zero percent after rounding). Detailed suctioning findings are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.4.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Suctioning items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent . In the HHA setting specifically, missingness for any Suctioning item was less than 1.0 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of admi nistration. 177 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 178 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 50 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Eff ective Date: Jan 1, 202 1 Time to com plete: Time to complete was examined among 422 asse ssments in HHAs, 457 431 SNFs (n = 1,554 overall) . The a verage time to co mplete the S uctioning items was 0.22 m inutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minut es in the HHA s etting (SD = 0.1). Interrater r eliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall) . The IRR was excellent for the Suctioning principal da ta element and sub-elements as measured by percent ag reement of paired raters. Kappas were not es timated for the Suctioning principal da ta element and sub elements because the proport ion of patients and resident s receiving suctioning was out of range for stable kappa estimates. P ercent agreement for the principal data element and sub elements r anged from 98 to 99 percent across settings and 99 t o 100 in the HHA s etting. Please refer t o Table 4.4.2 in Appendi x 3 for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all suctioning items. Tracheostomy Care A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure that consists of making a direct airway opening (tracheostomy) into the trachea (windpipe) . Tracheostomi es are created pr imarily t o bypass an o bstructed upper airway; i n chronic ca ses, to enable the removal of secretions from the airway; and to deliver oxy gen to the patient's lungs. For example, some indications for tracheostomy include a need for long- term ventilation (such as those in a persistent vegetative state or those who requir e long -term v entilator weaning but are alert an d oriented); t umors of t he upper ai rway; sev ere neck, m outh, or chest w all injuries; de generative neuromuscular d iseases such as a myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord injuries; and airway bur ns. Generally, suctioning is necessary t o ensure that t he tracheostomy i s clear o f secretions, w hich can i nhibit suc cessful oxygenation. Often, individuals with tracheostomi es also r eceiv e supplemental o xygenation. The presence of a tracheostomy, permanent or temporary, warrant s careful monitoring and immediate intervention if the tracheostomy becomes occluded or , in the case of a temporary tracheostomy, i f the devices used become dislodged. For patients with a tracheostomy, tracheostomy care, which primarily consists of cleaning, dressing changes, and replacement of the tracheostomy cannula (tube), i s a critical pa rt of their car e plans. Regular c leaning is important to pr event infect ion, such as pneumonia, and to prevent any occlusions, which c reate the risk of inadequate oxygenation. Although i n rare ca ses, the presence of a tracheostomy is not associated w ith increased care demands (and in some of those instances, the care of the tracheostomy is performed by the patient), in general , the presen ce of such a device is associated w ith increased patient risk, and clinical ca re services will necessarily include close monitoring to ensur e that no life- threatening event s occur because of the tracheostomy. Relevance to HHAs Tracheostomy car e is not c urrently asses sed in O ASIS. H owever, t racheostomy care is becoming more routinely performed in the home.179, 180 Caring for a tracheostomy, including suctioning and cleaning, preserves patency and pre vents infection. I n general, use of a tracheostomy car e protocol for patients with a tracheostomy l ead t o decreased morbidity and mortality.181,182 Effective management of a tracheostomy in the hospital and PAC settings has a significant positive impact on the quality of life.

Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, Treatments, an d Interventions: T racheostomy Care C urrent use Tracheostomy care is currently assessed in the MDS. The data element first assesses whether the resident received tracheostomy care while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then assesses whether the resident received tracheostomy care while a resident and within the last 14 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Tracheostomy Care In nursing homes, a checkbox for tracheostomy care during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.184 Evidence supporting use of Tracheostomy Care from the National Beta Test Assessing Tracheostomy Care: One item assessed whether t racheostomy c are was performed during the assessment period. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA setting s, 762 in IRFs, LTCHs, and 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, 1 percen t of patients received tracheostomy care. In the HHA setting specifically, only one patient (zero percent after rounding) had tracheostomy c are noted. Detailed t racheostomy c are findings across settings are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.5.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Tracheostomy Care item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent. In the HHA setting , missingness was 2.7 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554 overall).

Non-invasiv e Mechanical V entilation (Bilevel P ositive Airway Pressure Continuous Positive A Pressure [CPAP]) BiPAP and CPAP a re respiratory suppo rt devices that prevent the airways from closing by delivering slightly pressurized air through a mask continuously or via electronic cycling throughout the breathing cycle. A B iPAP/CPAP mask suppor ts breathing by providing positive airway pressure that prevents airways from collapsing during the respiratory cycle. Non- invasive mechanical v entilation differs from invasive mechanical v entilation becaus e the interface with the patient i s a mask r ather than an endotracheal tube in the windpipe. BiPAP and CPAP have a variety of clinical indications , from obstructive sleep apnea, t o acute respiratory infections, to progressive neuromuscular decline leading to respiratory f ailure. The key difference between BiPAP and CPAP is that BiPAP , as the name implies, deliver s two di fferent pressure levels (a higher pressure to support inhalation a nd a lower pressure to prevent the airways from collapsing during exhalation ), whe reas C PAP d eliver s the same amount of positive airway pressur e throughout the breathing cycle. T hese interventions signify unde rlying medical conditions in the patient who requires their use. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently asse sses BiPAP/CPAP t reatment. However, i t doe s not differentiate between BiPAP treatment and CPAP treatment. According to 2013 OASIS data, 2.6 percent of HH patients were on either B iPAP or CPAP t reatment.185 CPAP or BiPAP m asks enable i ndividuals to support their own breathing cycle. They can be used for sleep apnea or more serious conditions like COPD or respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilatio n is a common tool in the management of acute and chroni c respiratory f ailure in hom e settings. C omplications related to m ask us e may i nclude mask discomfort an d skin rashes; ot her complications include pressure and blood flow issues, such as general discomfort, ear or sinus pain, gastric insufflation, nasal dryness, congestion, and obstruction. More serious complications include aspiration and hemodynamic compromise, the latter in patients with compromised cardiac output.186 Non- invasiv e mechanical v entilation can be more difficult f or pa tients who rely on long-term ventilator support when compared t o invasive mechanical ventilation.187 Considering the use of non invasive mechanical v entilation is therefor e important t o assess in H HAs for purposes of case mix adjustment and care planning.

The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item asking whether the patient has non- invasive ventilator (BIPAP, CPAP) treatment at admission. The MDS first assesses whet her the resident received non- invasive mechanical ventilation while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received non- invasive mechanical ventilation while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS data elements do not assess whether the non -invasive mechanical ventilation is BiPAP or CPAP. Prior evidence supporting use of Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) A checkbox item for non -invasive v entilation (CPAP) was tes ted in the PAC PRD and was found to be feasible for cross- setting use.188 Evidence supporting use of Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) from the National Beta Test Assessing Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilation: One item assessed whether a non- invasive mechanical v entilator was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow- up items assessed whether this non- invasive m echanical v entilator was BiPAP or CPAP. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs , 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, 5 percent of assessments noted use of a non- invasive m echanical v entilator . In the HHA setting specifically, 4 percent of assessments noted use of a non-invasive mechanical v entilator . With regard to specific types of non- invasive m echanical v entilator across settings, 2 percent of assessments noted BiPAP and 3 percent CPAP . Similarly , in HHA, 1 percent noted BiPAP and 2 percent CPAP. Detailed findings regarding non- invasive mechanical ventilators are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.7.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Non- Invasive Mechanical Ventilator items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1.2 percent. In the HHA setting specifically, missingness was 2.7 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Non - invasive Mechanical Ventilator items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall). Most kappas for the Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilator 188 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 54 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Eff ective Date: Jan 1, 202 1 items are not reported because their proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimates. P ercent agreement for the pr incipal data element and sub elements ranged from 97 to 98 percent across settings and from 96 to 98 percent in the HHA s etting. P lease refer t o Table 4.7.2 in Appendix 3 for percent agreement statistics f or all Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilator items across settings. Invasive Mechanical Ventilator Invasiv e mechanical v entilator includes any type of electrically or pneumatically powered closed - system mechanical s upport devices, to ensure adequate ventilation of patients who a re unable to support their own respirati on. P atients receiving closed- system v entilation include those receiving ventilation via a tracheostomy and pa tients w ith an end otracheal t ube (e.g., nasally or orally i ntubated). Depend ing on the patient's unde rlying diagnosis, clinical condition, and prognosis , the patient may not be a candidate for weaning off the ventilator. For instance , certain medical conditions such as lung infections are expecte d to improve or resolve to a point where patients can support their own respiration, whereas chronic neurodegenerative diseases are likely t o progress over t ime and therefore preclude patient s from weaning and eventually having the tube removed. Ventilation in this m anner is a resource-int ensive therapy assoc iated w ith life-threatening conditions in which the patient would not survive without invasive ventilation . However, v entilator us e has inherent risks requiring close monitoring, a nd failure to adequately car e for v entilator -dependent patient s can lea d to death, pneumonia, s epsis, and other i atrogenic events. Me chanical v entilation further signifies the complexity of the patient's unde rlying medical and/or surgical condition. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently assesses respiratory t reatments used at home, wit h \"ventilator (continually or at night)\" as one response option. This data element will provide more specific information on whether the HH pa tient is receiving invasive mechanical v entilation specifically. Since there is no national registry f or home v entilation in the United S tates, i t is difficult to a ccount for th e number of patients us ing invasive mechanical v entilation in the HH s etting, bu t estimates suggest t hat the number of patients receiving hom e ventilation is increasing in the United S tates.189, 190 Goals of home invasive mechanical ventilati on include sustaining and extending life, enhancing the quality of life, reducing morbidity, improving or sustaining physical and psychological functioning, and providing cost-effective care.191,192 However, invasive mechanical v entilation is one of t he most adv anced and complicated types of m edical treatment provided outside a hospital setting.193,194 Potential major complications include pneumonia, injury t o the lung due to ex cessive ai r pressure , flui d overloa d, and bl ood clot in a lung artery.195 Assessing the use of invasive mechanical ventilati on in the HH setting is important for care planning, 189 Divo, M.

Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, Treatments, an d Interventions: In vasive Mechanical V entilator C urrent use Invasive mechanical ventilator use is currently assessed in the LCDS and MDS. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received invasive mechanical ventilation while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received invasive mechanical ventilation while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS includes an items that assess use and type of invasive mechanical ventilator support (e.g., weaning or non-weaning). Prior evidence supporting use of Invasive Mechanical Ventilator Checkbox items for ventilator (weaning and non- weaning) were tested in the PAC PRD and were found to be feasible for cross- setting use.196 A version of the item was tested in the MDS 3.0 National Evaluation Study and had perfect agreement (100 percent ).197 Evidence supporting use of Invasive Mechanical Ventilator from t he National Beta Test Assessing Invasive Mechanical Ventilator: One item assessed whether an invasive mechanical ventilator was noted during the assessment period. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 1087 in SNF s (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings overall, only 13 assessments (zero percent after rounding) noted use of an invasive m echanical v entilator . In HHA, no patients had an i nvasive m echanical v entilator noted. Detailed invasive m echanical v entilator findings across settings are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.6.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent for the item.

IV Med ications ( Antibiotics, Anticoagulation, V asoactive Medications, Other) IV medications are drugs or biologics that are administered via intravenous push (bolus), single, intermittent , or continuous infusion through a tube placed int o the vein, including one that allows the fluids to enter the circulation through one of the larger heart vessels or more peripherally through a vein, e.g., commonly referred t o as central midline, or peripheral ports. This dat a element is important to co llect, as IV m edications are more resour ce intensive to administer tha n oral medications and signify a higher patient complexity (and often higher severity of illness) . The clinical indications for each of the subtypes of IV medications (antibiotics, anticoagulants, vasoactive, and other) are very di fferent. I V an tibiotics ar e used f or severe infections when 1 ) the bioavailability of the oral form of the medication would be inadequate to kill the pathogen, 2 ) an o ral form of the medicati on does not exist , or 3) the patient is unable to take the medicati on by mouth. Because of growing conc ern abou t antimicrobial r esistance, antibiotic stewardship i nitiatives are aimed at increasing evidence-based antibiotic prescribing and decreasing antibiotic overuse. A lthough data on which antibiotic are used n ot be collected, co llecting data on t he use of IV an tibiotics overall i n the four PAC settings would assist with monitoring the implementati on of evidence- based prescribing guidelines moving forward. IV anticoagulants refer to anti -clotting medications ( that is, \"blood thinners\"). IV anticoagulants are commonly used for hospitalized patients who have deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction, as well as those undergoing int erventional cardiac procedures. Vasoactive medications affect blood pressure and/or h eart r ate by caus ing dilation or constricting of the blood vessels. V asoactive medications are used to t reat septic shock, cardiac ar rest, and other cardi ac function issues. C ontinuous infusions of v asoactive medications require close observation of the patient, including constant monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate , in order to respond quickly to any changes. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently assesses intravenous or infusion t herapy in a single item, bu t does not assess specifi c types of IV medications. However, IV antibiotic use in the HH set ting is becoming increasingly com mon due to pa tient p lacement difficulties and costs associated w ith sk illed facilities.198 Further, ther e is evidenc e that a n IV medication adjunct t o treatment can reduc e the likelihood of hos pital readmission for HH pa tients w ith he art failure.199 Thus, it is important t o assess the fact o f IV administrati on in addition to the type of IV medications being administered within the HH setting for care planning and defining case mix.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 57 C urrent use The item IV Medications is currently assessed in the LCDS and MDS. The LCDS uses a checkli st format, including an item at admission asking whether the patient is receiving any IV medications. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received IV medications while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then w hether the resident received IV medications while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess the type of IV medications. Prior evidence supporting use of IV Medications A similar but more focused data element, IV Vasoactive Medications, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. This data element was specific to the IV administration of vasoactive drugs (e.g., pressors, dilators, continuous medication for pulmonary edema) that increase or decrease blood pressure and/or heart rate. In nursing homes, a checkbox for IV medications during the last 5 days was shown to have reliability of 0.95 (kappa) in the national MDS 3.0 test.200 Evidence supporting use of IV Medications from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Medications : One item assessed whether IV medications were noted during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow- up items assessed specific types of IV m edications (antibiotics, a nticoagulation, or other). The category of Vasoactive Medications was not included in the National Beta Test. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub -elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in SNF s (n = 2,926 overall). Acro ss settings, one in four assessments (25 percent) had IV m edications noted. For specific types of IV m edication, 16 percent had antibiotics noted, 8 percent had anticoagulation noted, and 7 percent had other IV medications noted. In HHA specifically, 15 percent had IV medications noted. For the specific types of IV medication, 4 percent had antibiotics noted, 8 percent had anticoagulation noted, and 6 percent had o ther IV m edications noted. Detailed IV medications findings across settings are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.8.1. 200 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 58 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Missing data: Overall, t here were very l ow rates of m issing respon ses for the IV Medications items. Acro ss all settings, m issingne ss was less than 0.9 percent. In the HHA s etting, missingness for the IV Medi cation items was 0.3 percent. T he low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of adm inistration. Time to com plete: Time to complete was examined among 422 asse ssments in H HAs, 457 in IRFs, 244 LTCHs , and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall) . The average time to c omplete the I V Medications i tems was 0.22 m inutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA s etting (SD = 0.1). Interrater r eliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 ov erall). With the exception of the anticoagulation s ub-element, t he IRRs were fair to good a cross settings for t he IV Med ications p rincipal data e lement and sub elements as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters. The kappa for the pr incipal IV Med ications data element was 0.70 across settings a nd 0.15 i n the HHA setting . The kappa for t he Antibioti cs sub - element was 0.88 across settings. T he kappa for the Anticoagulati on sub-element was 0.13 across settings, placing it in the \"slight/poor\" range . The kappa for the Other sub-element was 0.46 across settings.

Transfusions Transfusions are the administration of blood or blood products (e.g., platelets , synthetic blood products) into the bloodstream . Blood transfusions are highly protocolized, with multiple safety checks and monitoring required during and after the infusi on to avoid adverse events. Coordination wit h the facility's blood bank is necessary, as well a s documentation by clinical staff t o ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the need for transfusions signifies underlying patient complexity tha t is likely to require additional nursing staff and care coordinati on, and a ffects p lanning for transitions of care, as transfusions are not performed i n all PAC se ttings. R eceipt o f transfusions is also important to assess for case m ix adjustment because of t he need for adde d resources and to the extent that receipt of transfusions indicat es a more medically com plex pa tient. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently assesses intravenous or infusio n therapy in a single item, but does not assess blood transfusions specifically. Bl ood transfusions can be safely administere d in the home. Common diagnoses for patients receiving hom e transfusions are can cer, chronic anemia, AIDS, and bone marrow transplantation.201 Further, as the population continues to age and more adults require care in the HH set ting it is likely t hat the demand for these services will co ntinue to rise.202 Advantages for home transfusion i nclude offering patients the physical and psychological co mfort of receiving services in their home, l ower co sts, f ewer c lerical er rors, minimizing the need of the patient t o travel f or care, and no risk of nosocomial infection.203,204,205 Noted concerns in t he past, sp ecifically distance from emergency 201 Benson, K., Popovsky, M.

Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, Treatments, an d Interventions: T ransfusions C urrent use Transfusions are currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether th e resident received transfusions while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received transfusions while a resident and within the last 14 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Transfusions In nursing homes, a checkbox for transfusions in the past five days was shown to have reliability of 0.67 (kappa) in the national MDS 3.0 test.207 Evidence supporting use of Transfusions from the National Beta Test Assessing Transfusions: One item assessed whether Transfusions were performed during the assessment period. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 in IRFs, 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, only 14 patient/resident assessments (zero percent after rounding) noted transfusions. In HHA, only one patient (0 percent after rounding) had transfusions noted. Detailed transfusion findings across settings are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.9.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Transfusions item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.0 percent for the item. In the HHA setting specifically, missingness was 0.3 percent. The low rate of missing data indicat es feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Transfusion item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall).

Dialysis ( Hemodialysis, P eritonea l dialysis) Dialysis is used pr imarily i n the case of end-stage kidney failure. I t is a process by which w aste, salt, and excess water a re remov ed from the body and key electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate ar e maintained at a safe level. H emodialysis i s conducted us ing an ar tificial k idney, an external hemodialyzer, which filters the blood. During peritoneal dialysis, the dialysate is injected in to the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity, excess fluid and waste products are draw n out of the blood a nd into the dialysate, and the fluid i s then drained. Hemodialysi s sessions are typically performed three times a week and last up to 4 hour s each. Peritoneal dialysis can b e performed continuously overnight or intermittently during the day. Both forms of dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal d ialysis) ar e resour ce intensive, not only during the actual dialysis process but before, during, and a fter. Patients who need and undergo dialysis procedures are at high risk for physiologic and hemodynamic instability from fluid shifts and electrolyte disturbances, a s well a s infections that can lead to s epsis. F urther, p atient s receiving hemodialysis are often transporte d to a different facility, or , at a minimum, to a different part of the same facility if adjacent to a dialysis center. Close monitoring for fluid shifts , blood pressure abnormalities, and other adverse effects is required before , during, a nd after each di alysis session. Nursing staff typically perform peritoneal dialysis at the bedside, a nd, as with hemodialysis, close monitoring is required. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS doe s not currently ha ve a separate i tem ass essing dialysis. Rather, it is included in a more general category of \"Intravenous or infusi on therapy (excludes TPN).\" An analysis of PAC PRD data suggests that 1.3 percent of patient s in the home health setting were receiving hemodialysis.208 Including an item specifically asses sing dialysis therapy with the HH s etting is important for ca re planning and defining case mix. Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, T reatments, an d Interventions: D ialysis 208 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012. 61 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Current us e The data element Dialysi s is currently as sessed in the LCDS and MDS. The LCDS us es a checklist format , including an item asking whether the patient receiv es dialysis as part of the patient's treatment plan. The MDS first assesses whether t he resident received dialysis while not a resident of the assessing facility and within t he last 14 days, and then whether t he resident r eceived di alysis w hile a resident an d within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS d ata elements do not assess the type of dialysis. Prior evidence supporting use of D ialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) In nur sing hom es, a dat a element asse ssing dialysis in the past 5 da ys was tested i n the national MDS 3.0 test and show n to have almost perfect reliability (kappas of 0.9 1 to 0.93).209 Evidence supporting use of Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) from the National Beta Test Assessing Dialysis : One item assessed w hether d ialysis w as noted during the assessment period. If indicate d, two follow- up items assessed whether t he dialysis w as he modialysis o r peritoneal dialysis . In the National Bet a Test, the principal data element and sub elements w ere administered t o 629 patients/residents i n HHAs, 762 in IRFs, 448 in LTCHs, and 1, 087 in SNFs(n = 2,926 overall). Across settings overall, 5 percent of assessments not ed us e of di alysis. I n the HHA s etting spe cifically, 3 percent of patients had dialysis noted . With regard to specific forms of di alysis , the vast majority of noted dialysis was hemodialysis. O nly se ven asses sments overall, and one in HHA (both 0 percent after rounding) indicated p eritoneal di alysis. Detaile d findings regarding Dialysis are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.10.1. Missing data: Overall, t here were very l ow rates of m issing respon ses for the Dialysis items. Acros s all s ettings, m issingness was l ess than 1 percent. In the HHA s etting specifically, m issingness was 0.3 pe rcent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasib ility of administration. Time to com plete: Time to complete was examined among 422 asse ssments in HHAs, 457 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall) . The average time to c omplete the Dialysis item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA s etting (SD = 0.1). Interrater r eliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in H HAs, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall) . Most kappas are not r eported f or the Dialysis pr incipal data element and sub elements b ecause the proportions both overall and for each setting were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. P ercent agreement for dialysi s principal d ata element was nearly perfect ov erall and in the HHA specifically (98 percent) . The same was t rue for the two t ypes of dialysi s sub elements across settings a nd in H HA s pecifically (98 percent an d 100 pe rcent, respectively). P lease refer to Table 4.10.2 in Appendix 3 for percent agreement statistics for all Dialysis items. IV A ccess (Peripheral IV , Midline, C entral line) IV access refers to a catheter i nserted i nto a vein f or a variety of clinical r easons, i ncluding long- term m edication treatment ; hemodialysis; large volumes of blood or fluid; frequent access for blood samples; intravenous fluid administration ; total parenteral nutrition ; or, in s ome instances , the measurement of central v enous pressure. The data elements associated w ith IV access distinguish be tween pe ripheral access and c entral access. In addition, different types o f centra l access are specifie d. The rationale for distinguishing between a peripheral IV and central I V acc ess is that c entral line s confer h igher risks associated w ith life- threatening events such as pulmonary embolism, infection, and bleeding. Patients with c entral l ines, including those peripherally i nserted o r who have subcutaneous central line \"port\" access, always require vigilant nursing care to ensure patency of the lines and, importantly , to ens ure that such i nvasiv e lines are 209 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 62 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 free from any potentially life-threatening events suc h as infection, air embolism, and bleeding from an open lumen. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently only has an option for \"Intravenous or infusi on therapy (excludes TPN).\" The proposed data element includes additional detail about the type of IV access, such as distinguishing between pe ripheral I V and central I V acce ss. A s noted abov e, this distinction is important in that central lines confer h igher r isks associated w ith life threatening ev ents. A nalyses of P AC PRD da ta sug gest that 1.5 percent of patients in the home health setting were receiving care for cen tral line.210 Furthermore, a study of patient s receiving home health ca re found that 3 pe rcent w ere receiving IV therapy or parenteral nutrition.211 Adding this data element will provide important information on different types of IV access, which i s important for resource planning and care transitions. Data Element for the Assessment o f Special Services, T reatments, an d Interventions: IV A ccess C urrent use The IV Access data element is not currently included in any of the PAC assessments. Prior evidence supporting use of IV Access The IV Access data element was not tested in the PAC PRD , but that study did test a related data element, Central Line Management, which was found feasible for cross- setting use. Evidence supporting use of IV Access from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Access : One item assessed whether IV access was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, four follow- up items assessed whether the IV was a peripheral line, m idline catheter, central line , or other form of IV access. In the National Beta Test, the principal data element and sub elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in IRFs, and 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, 24 percent of assessments noted use of IV a ccess. The rate in HHA specifically was much lower (4 percent) than in any other setting . For the specific type of IV a ccess noted, a central line was most common across settings (13 percent) followed closely by peripheral IV (11 210 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012. 211 Shang, J., Larson, E., Liu, J., & Stone, P.

M idline catheter (2 percent), and o ther (1 percent) w ere less common. In the H HA setting, a central line was also most common (3 pe rcent) with pe ripheral IV noted for only two patients (0 percent after rounding) , and other noted f or onl y three patients ( 0 percent after rounding). N o patients in HHA had m idline catheter noted. Detailed f indings regarding IV access are shown in Appendix 3, Table 4.11.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the IV Access items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1.4 pe rcent . In the H HA s etting specifically, missingness was 2. 5 percent . The low rates of missing data indicate feasibility of administration. Time to com plete: Time to complete was examined among 422 asse ssments in HHAs, 457 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall) . The average time to c omplete the IV A ccess item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in HHAs (SD = 0.1).

Parenteral/IV F eeding Patients can be fed p arenterally ( i.e., intravenously) t o bypass the usual p rocess of eating and digesti on. The person receives nutritional formulas containing salts, glucose, amino acids , lipids, and added vitamins. Parenteral/IV f eeding is often u sed after s urgery, when feeding by m outh or digestive system i s not possible, w hen a patient's digestive system cannot absorb n utrient s because of chronic disease , or if a patient's nutritional requirement cannot be met by tube feeding and supplementati on. The need for parenteral/IV feeding indicates a c linica l complexity tha t prevents the patient from meeting nutritional n eeds enterally. O verall, parenteral/IV f eeding is a form of nutritional s upport t hat can b e used to prevent or address malnutrition.212 Without treatment, malnutrition can lea d to a host o f negative consequences , including a decline in healt h, poorer physical and cognitive function, increased use of health c are se rvices, earlier institutionalization, and increased r isk of death.213 Malnutrition i s prevalent a mong ol der ad ults, a populati on commonly served in PAC settings. A study showe d that 58.3 percent of hospitalized patients diagnosed with malnutrition i n the U.S. in 2010 were more than 65 y ears of a ge.214 Additionally, as mentioned above, parenteral/IV feeding is often used 212 National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care (UK).

For example, pa renteral/IV feeding can b e used for individuals with inflammatory bowel disease , a condition t hat is common in older adults.215 216 217 Parenteral/IV f eeding is more resour ce intensive than other forms of nutrition, as it often involves monitoring of blood che mistri es and maintenance of a central l ine. Therefore, assessing a patient' s need for parenteral feeding is important for care planning and case mix adjustment. In additi on to the risks associated w ith central a nd peripheral i ntravenous access, pa renteral/IV f eeding is associated w ith significant risks such a s embolism and seps is. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently asse sses whether a patient r eceives parenteral nutrition a t home. A nalysis of 2013 OASIS data, 0.2 percent of patients in the home health setting were receiving total parenteral nutrition treatment.218 Home parenteral nutrition is needed when patients do not have adequate or functional gastrointestina l tract to m aintain f luids, e lectrolytes, and nutrition. Similar to e nteral nutrition, patients receiving it rely on the intervention as a life-sustaining effort in and out of the hospital.219 However, home parenteral nutriti on is a complex method of feeding that has been associated w ith a host of short- and long- term com plications.220 Assessing receipt of parenteral nutrition would provide important information for resource use and care planning in the HH setting. A nut ritional a ssessment of older adu lts receiving Med icare home heal th services found t hat 12.0 percent of patients were malnourished and 51.0 percent were at risk for malnourishment.221 Malnourished/ at-risk malnourished individuals are more likely t o experience hospitalization, em ergency room and home health aide utilizati on, a nd m ortality.222 A study by C orkins et al. found that discharges to hom e health care were twice as likely among malnourished hospitalized patients.223 When a patient is unable to receive e nteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition is a be neficial t reatment o f malnutrition in the HH setting.224 Data Element for the Assessment o f Special S ervices, Treatments, an d Interventions: Parenteral/IV Feeding 215 Semrad, C.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 65 C urrent use Different versions of the Parenteral/IV Feeding data element are currently collected in the OASIS, IRF -PAI, LCDS, and MDS. The OASIS data element assesses whether the patient is receiving parenteral nutrition at home. The IRF- PAI includes a check box data element to assess total parenteral nutrition with a 3 -day look-back period. The LCDS include s a checklist to assess whether the patient receives total parenteral nutrition at admission. The MDS first assesses whether the patient received parental/IV feeding while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 7 days, and then whethe r the patient received parental/IV feeding while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding A similar data element, Total Parenteral Nutrition, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. Parental/IV feeding in the last 5 days was shown to have almost perfect reliability ( kappa of 0.95) in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes.225 Evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding from the National Beta Test Assessing Parenteral/IV Feeding: The Parenteral/IV Feeding data element was included in the National Beta Test. This data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 and 1,087 in SNF s = 2,926 overall). Across settings, only 1 pe rcent of assessments indicated parenteral/IV feeding. In the HHA setting, no patients had parenteral/IV feeding noted. Detailed parenteral/IV f eeding implementation is shown in Appendix 3, Table 5.1.1 for all four settings. Missing data: Low levels of missing data (1.3 percent for this data element across settings and 1.4 percent in HHAs ) inform the feasibility of administering this data element across PAC provider settings. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Parenteral/IV Feeding item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the parenteral/IV feeding data element because its proportion was too low for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement was perfect (100 percent) for the Parenteral/IV feeding data element across settings and in the HHA setting . Please refer to Table 5.1.2 in Appendix 3 for setting- specific percent agreement statistics for the Parenteral/IV Feeding item. Feeding Tube The Feeding Tube data element refers to enteral nutrition, which is the delivery of a nutritionally complete diet containing protein, carbohydrate, fat, water, minerals, and vitamins directly into the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum.

The data element Enteral N utrition is currently collected in t he OASIS, with a question asking w hether the pa tient is receiving e nteral nutrition at home. I n the IRF-PAI, a Swallowing Status data element captures some informati on relate d to enteral nutrition through the response option \"Tube/Parenteral F eeding.\" The MDS da ta element, Feeding Tube - N asogast ric or Abdominal (PEG), first assesses whether a resident used a feeding tube while not a resident of the assessing facility and within t he last 7 da ys and t hen w hether t he resident used a feeding tube while a resident a nd within t he last 7 days. Prior evidence supportin g use of Feeding Tube In the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes, the Feeding Tube data element , collecte d for the last 5 da ys, w as shown to h ave almost perfect reliability ( kappa of 0.89). 242 Evidence supporti ng us e of Feedin g Tube from the National Beta Test Assessing Feeding Tube: The Feeding Tube dat a element was included in the National B eta Test. This dat a element was administered t o 629 p atients/residents i n HHAs, 762 in IRFs, LTCHs, and 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). A cross settings, 3 percent of assessments indicated use of a feeding tube. In the HHA setting, only two a ssessments (0 p ercent after rounding) noted use of a feeding tube. Detailed feeding tube implementation is shown i n Appendix 3, Table 5. 2.1 for all four settings. Missing data: There were very l ow rates of missing data for the Feeding Tube data el ement both overall (1.3 percent) and in the HHA setting (1.4 p ercent). Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Feeding Tube item was 0.22 minutes overall ( SD = 0.1) and 0.1 9 minutes in the HHA setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater r eliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHAs, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall) . Kappas are not reported for the Feeding Tube data element because its proportion s were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. P ercent agreement was 100 percent across settings and in th e HHA setting. Please refer t o Table 5.2.2 i n Appendix 3 for setting -specific percent agreement statistics for the Feeding Tube item. Mechanically A ltered D iet A mechanically al tered d iet is one that is specifically prepared to alter the textur e or consistency of food to facilitate oral i ntake. E xamples include soft solids, p ureed foods, ground meat, a nd thickened liquids. A mechanically al tered diet sh ould not automatically be considered a therapeuti c diet. The provision of a mechanically altered di et is resourc e intensive, as it si gnifie s difficulty swallowing/eating safely (dysphagia). O ften, nurses are required to s lowly f eed pa tients meals consisting of a mechanically al tered d iet rather than ha ving them eat independently. D ysphagia is frequently associated with various health conditions, including: n ervous system -related d iseases (e.g., and Parkinson's disease); stroke; he ad injury; he ad, neck, and esopha gus cancers; h ead, neck, and ch est injuries; and dementia.243 In the absence of treatment, swallowing disorders can lead t o malnutrition, dehydrati on, aspiration pneumonia, poor overall health, chronic lung disease, choking, and death.244 242 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 243 National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

A study of a geriatric population living independently found that the lifetime prevalence of a swallowing disorder w as 38 pe rcent, an d cur rent pr evalence of a swallowing disorder w as 33 percen t.246 Additionally, increasing age has been shown to be associated with a higher likelihood of swallowing problems in the previous year.247 Beyond general aging effects on swallowing physiology, age- related di sease is t he main risk factor for dysphagia i n older adults.248 Stroke and dementia are examples of common conditions among the elderly tha t may c ontribute to issues w ith swallowing.249 Furthermore, d ischarge to a PAC set ting is more likely am ong those with d ysphagia. A study examining burden among inpatients diagnosed with dysphagia found that individuals with dysphagia had a 33.2 percent higher likelihood of being discharged to a PAC facility than patients without dysphagia.250 Assessing whether a pa tient requires a mechanically altered diet i s important in ensuring patient safety and can inform car e planning, car e transitions, a nd resource utilization. Relevance to HHAs The OASIS currently collects data on a patient's ability t o feed him- or herself independently, but requires a liquid, pureed, or ground meat diet. However, the OASIS d oes not have a more general i tem on whether the patient r eceives a mechanically a ltered diet. Ther e is some evidence that dy sphagia, whic h is difficulty or discomfort in swallowing, may affect many HH patients. The prevalence of dysphagia is high am ong dementia and s troke patients.251 Data from the 2013-2014 National Study of Long-Term Care Providers showe d that 31.4 percent of home health patients had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dise ase or other dementias.252 Further, a l arge s tudy of stroke patients aged 18 years and older found that 11.5 percent were discharged to the home health setting.253 This speaks to t he importance of assessing whether H H pa tients receive a mechanically altered d iet. 245 Ibid 246 Roy, N., Stemple, J., Merrill, R.

It first assesses whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while not a resident and within the last 7 days, and then whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Mechanically Altered Diet In the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes, the Mechanical ly Altered Diet data element was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappas from 0.90 to 0.96).254 Evidence supporting use of Mechanically Altered Diet from the National Beta Test Assessing Mechanically Altered Diet: The Mechanically Altered Diet data element was included in the National Beta Test. The data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 in IRFs, 1,087 in SNFs (n = 2,926 overall). Across settings, 10 percent of assessments indicated m echanically altered diet. In the HHA setting, 2 percent of assessments noted mechanically altered diet . Detailed implementation is shown in Appendix 3, Table 5.3.1, for all four settings. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing data for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element both overall (1.2 percent) and in the HHA setting (1.4 percent). Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n = 1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Mechanically Altered Diet item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD = 0.1) and 0.19 minutes in the HHA setting (SD = 0.1). Interrater reliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n = 882 overall). IRR for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element was substantial/good across settings. In HHA, kappa is not reported for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element because its proportion s were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the data element was 93 percent across settings and 100 percent in the HHA setting. Please refer to Table 5.3.2 in Appendix 3 for setting- specific kappa and percent agreement statistics for the Mechanically Altered Diet item. Therapeutic Diet A therapeutic diet is a diet intervention ordered by a health care practitioner as part of the treatment for a disease or clinical condition manifesting an altered nutritional status. This diet will eliminate, decrease, or increase certain substan ces in the diet (e.g., sodium or potassium). Therapeutic 254 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 71 Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 diets ca n include low cholesterol, renal, diabetic, and low salt diets,255 the latter of which are most commonly used.256 Certain conditions, including diabetes,257 chroni c kidney disease,258 hypertension,259 and heart disease260 are highly prevalent am ong older ad ults who may r eceive services i n a PAC set ting. F or example, t he percentage of adults with d iabetes is 25.2 percent among individuals 65 years of ag e or older.261 Additionally, 61.7 percent of adults 65 y ears of age or older have hypertension.262 These conditions may be treate d with a therapeutic diet. The Therapeutic Diet data e lement is im portant to collect f or patient s receiving HH car e to distinguish therapeutic di et from various other nu tritional ap proaches. I t is less resource intensive from the bedside nursing perspective but does signify one or more unde rlying clinical conditions that preclude the patient f rom eating a regular d iet. Communicati on among PAC settings on w hether a patient i s receiving a particular therapeutic diet i s critical to en sure safe t ransitions of care. Relevance to HHAs Therapeuti c diet i s not cu rrently asses sed in O ASIS. However, t he standardized assessment of therapeutic diets is relevant t o patients in H H set tings due to an ag ing popu lation and high pr evalence of chronic diseases that w ill result i n increased need for t his type of d iet. In pa rticular, as the population ages, a nd the HH popu lation grows, gre ater de mand therapeuti c diet s can b e expected.263 Physiological changes of aging can affect f ood intake, in additi on to chronic disease conditions.264 Many disease specific- conditions could necessitate therapeutic diet. These include diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular di sease, chronic kidney di sease, and obesity, am ong others.265 According to data from the National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS), 32 percent of home health patients aged 65 and older ha d diabetes mellitu s and 39 p ercent had h eart d isease.266 Similarly, data from the 2013-2014 255 Kamel, H.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 73 High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication Most patients receiving PAC services depend on short- and long- term medications to manage their medical conditions. However, medications are a leading cause of adverse events. A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that 31 percent of adverse events in 2008 among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries were related to medication.269 Adverse drug events (ADEs) may be caused by medication errors such as drug omissions, errors in dosage, and errors in dosing frequency.270 In addition, approximately half of all hospital- related medication errors and 20 percent of ADEs occur during transitions within, admission to, transfer to, or discharge from a hospital.271 272 273 ADEs are more common among older adults, who make up most patients receiving PAC services. The rate of emergency department visits for ADEs is three times higher among adults 65 years of age and older than that among those younger than age 65.274 Some classes of drugs are associated with more risk than others.275 The six medication class response options in the High -Risk Drug Classes : Use and Indications data element are anticoagulants, antiplatelets , hypoglycemics (including insulin), opioids , antipsychotics, and antibiotics. These drug classes are considered high -risk because of the adverse effects that may result from use. In particular, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are associated with bleeding risk;276 277 hypoglycemics are associated with fluid retention, heart failure, and lactic acidosis;278 opioids are associated with misuse;279 antipsychotics are associated with fractures and strokes;280 281 and antimicrobials, the category of medications that includes antibiotics, are associated with various adverse events such as central nervous 269 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Almost 100,000 emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events occurred annu ally among adul ts 65 y ears or ol der in the United S tates from 2007 through 2009.285 About a third of the emergency hospitalizations involved the anticoagulant warfarin; 14 percent involved insulins; 13 percent involved antiplatelet drugs; and 11 percent involved oral hypoglycemic agents. More than two-thirds of the emergency hospitaliza tions were at tributed t o these four commonly prescribe d medications , taken alone or in combination. Assessing use of h igh-risk medications by HH patients and indications for each medication would provide important information relate d to patient safety in HH set ting and care transitions between H HAs and other settings. T he OASIS does not currently cont ain data elements that document the use of any medication or the indication or reason for the patient taking t he medication.

The number of days the resident received medications is assessed by category for antipsychotic, antianxiety, antidepressant, hypnotic, anticoagulant, antibiotic, diuretic, and opioid medications. Prior evidence supporting use of High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication The High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication data element was not tested in prior demonstration efforts. However, the use of similar data elements in the MDS 3.0 speak to the feasibility of collecting data on patient medications in a standardized assessment. Evidence supporting use of High-Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication from the National Beta Test Assessing High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication: As part of the assessment of the medication r econciliation process, the National Beta Test included a data element s that assesses whether the patient/resident was taking any medications in each of the six high -risk drug classes, and for each medication, whether there was a corresponding indication noted. The six classes are: anticoagulants, antiplatelets (excluding low -dose aspirin), hypoglycemics (including insulin), opioids, antipsychotics, and antimicrobials (excluding topicals). In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 627 patients/residents in HHA s, 769 in IRFs, and 1,096 in SNFs (n = 2,951 overall). In the four settings combined, the percent age of patients/residents taking medications in each of the six classes ranged from 12 percent (antipsychotics) to 51 percent (opioids). In the HHA setting, these percentages ranged from 9 percent ( antipsychotics) to 39 percent ( opioids).

In general, the low rate of missing data ind icates f easibility of administration. Time to com plete: Time to complete was examine d among 406 a ssessments in HHA s, 446 in IRFs, 271 in LTCHs , and 421 in SNFs (n = 1,544 overall). Average time to complete the H igh-Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication items was approximately 1.0 minute (SD = 0.6 minutes) in the four settings combined and 0 .9 minute (SD = 0.6 minutes) in the HHA setting. Interrater r eliability: I RR was examined for 187 assessments in H HAs, 240 in IRFs, 212 in LTCHs, and 261 in SNFs (n = 900 overall) . Kappas were not estimated within or across settings for items assessing antipsychotic u se and indication of opioids o r, in the HHA s etting, items assessing antimicrobial s. These proportions wer e out of range for st able kappa estimates. In the four settings combined, IRRs acros s settings ran ged from substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect (kappas = 0.72 to 0.89) for medication use items. In the HHA setting, kappas for medication use were substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect (kappas = 0.69 to 0.84). F or indication items, kappas ranged f rom substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect across settings (kappa = 0.65 to 0.87) and fair to substantial/g ood i n the HHA setting (0.33 t o 0.74) .

A total of 489 patients/residents in HHAs, 618 in IRFs, 375 in LTCHs, and 872 in SNFs (n = 2,354 overall) reported experiencing any pain and were administered the three pain interference items. Setting -specific frequencies are shown in Appendi x 3, Table 7.1.1. Across settings, pain interfered with sleep more often than rarely for two of three patients/residents (65 percent); 37 percent of patients/residents had pain t hat made it difficult to sleep \"frequently\" or \"a lmost con stantly.\" In t he H HA setting, pain interfered wit h sleep more than \"rarely \" for three of f ive patients ( 60 pe rcent); 31 p ercent of patients experienced pain that interfered w ith sleep \"frequently\" or \"a lmost con stantly.\" Most patients had been offered rehabilitati on therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), both across settings (89 percent ) and in the HHA ( 78 percent). Among these patients/residents, 73 p ercent reported that p ain rarely interfered w ith rehabilitation. Within t he H HA setting, 74 p ercent reported that pain r arely in terfered with rehabilitation; about one in eight (12 pe rcent) had pain that interfere d \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly\" with r ehabilitation . Fifty -five percent o f patients/residents across settings reported limiting their d aily act ivities (not including rehabilitation) more often than \"rarely or not at all.\" About one in three patients/residents (33 percent) ha d pain that limited ac tivities \"frequently\" or \"almost co nstantly.\" In t he H HA setting, 60 percent of patients had pain that interfered more often than rarely. About one of three HHA pa tients (3 3 percent) had limited a ctivities \"frequently\" or \"almost cons tantly.\" Missing data: Overall, t here wer e low rates of m issing data for pa in data elements. A cross all settings, missing data did not exceed 2.4 percent for any data element. Similarly, in the HHA s etting, missing data did not exceed 3.9 pe rcent f or any data element.

S ensory lim itation s can lea d to confusi on in new settings, increase isolation, contribute to mood disorders, a nd impede accurate assessment of other medical conditions, s uch as cognition. Hearing impairments may cause difficulty in communication of important information conc erning the patient's or resident's condition, preferences, and care transitions; vision impairments have been a ssociated w ith increased risk of falls. B oth types of impairment can also interfere with comprehension of and adherence to discharge plans. Onset of hearing and visi on impairments can be gradual , so accurate screening tools and follow-up evaluations are essential to determining which patients and residents need hearing- or vision- specific medical attention or assistive devices, and to ensuring that person -directed care plans are developed to accom modate patient s' and residents ' needs during PAC a nd at discharge. Assessments pertaining to sensory status aid PAC providers in understanding the needs of their patients and residents by establishing a diagnosis of hearing or vision impairment, elucidating the patients' a nd residents ' ability and willingne ss to p articipate in t reatments or us e assistive devices during their s tays, and identifying appropriate ongoing therapy and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized as sessment of vision impairment among PAC p atients and residents supports clinical decision making, early clinical i ntervention, person-centered care , and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid a nd reliabl e standardized assessments can aid i n the communication of information within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate healt h information. Standardized D ata E lements to A ssess Hearing and V ision Impairments CMS has identified t wo da ta elements for cross- setting standardized a ssessment of hearing and vision impairment. 1.H earing 2.Vision Hearing Hearing impairment is one of the most common complaints in adults over the age of 60 and is a major contributor to difficulties in speech comprehension.304 Causes of hearing loss can include noise, earwax or fluid buildup, a punctured ear drum, viruses and bacteria, certain health conditions (e.g., stroke, cardiac conditions, and brain injury), medications, heredity, and aging.305 Age -related hearing loss is caused by presbycusis and occurs gradually over time as an individual ages.

P ossible mechanisms include the effects of he aring loss on social isolation, health-related oral literacy, and c ognitive decline. I n addi tion, severe hearing impairment can adv ersely af fect H H pa tients' ability to functi on safely within their home environment (e.g., respond to warnings, or hear doorbells and alarms).

A study examining visual impairme nt among adults in the United States found that i n 2015, among the 3.22 million persons i n the United S tates w ho were visually impaire d, the largest proportions comprise d those in older age categories: 80 years of age and older (50 percent), 70- 79 years (24 p ercent), a nd 60-69 years (16 pe rcent).331 By 2050, the proporti on of adults with v isual impairment will inc rease t o 64 percent among individuals aged 80 years and older.332 Assessing visual impairment is critical to improving patient outcomes, saf ety, and quality of life. Additionally, assessment can inform future care planning and care transitions. Relevance to HHAs Severe v ision im pairment can a dversely a HH pa tients' m obility and their a bility to function safely within their home environment (e.g., a bility to see obs tacles in th eir pa th), including risk of falls.333 According to PAC PRD data, 2.1 percent of HH patients have severe vision impairment.334 A study by Jaffee et al . (2016) of 1,900 adult medicine inpatients at an urban hospital found that insufficient vision was associated with po st-discharge falls among participants aged 65 years or older (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-8.05 ), but not among participants younger than 65 years (AOR 1.44, 95% CI 0.89-2.32) .335 Severe vision impairment can al so adversely i mpact m any aspe cts of HH pa tients' self-care (e.g., reading medication labels; performing certain ADLs/IADLs, mobility). For example, patients with visual impairment have more difficulty reading medicati on labels and instructions and likely ne ed m ore assistance managing their medications. A ssessing the ability t o see among HH patients is important to support care management and planning.

The proposed data element s are as follows : 2.E thnicity 3.Preferred Languag e 6. Transportation 7. Social Isolati on Race and Ethnicity Relevance to HHA s The persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care is widely documented, including in PAC settings.338,339,340,341,342 Although racial and ethnic disparities decrease when social factors are controlled for, they often remain. The root cause of these disparities is not always clear because data on many SDOH are not collected. Measuring SDOH in HH settings is an important step to addressing these avoidable differences in health outcomes. Collecting data on race and ethnicity supports patient -centered care, and informs understanding of patient complexity and risk factors that may affect payment, quality measurement, and car e outcomes for HHAs. Improving how race and ethnicity data are collected is an important component of improving quality by identifying and addressing health disparities that affect Medicare beneficiaries.

The data element consists of a single question, which aligns with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) minimum data standards for federal data collection efforts.343 The 1997 OMB Standard lists five minimum categories of race: (1) American Indian or Alaska Native, (2) Asian , (3) 343 \"Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity (Notice of Decision)\". Federal Register 62:210 (October and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 Black or African A merican , (4) Native Hawaiian or Other P acific Islander , and, (5) W hite. The 1997 OMB S tandard also lists two minimum c ategories o f ethnicity: ( 1) Hispanic or Latino, a nd (2) N ot Hispanic or Latino .344 The current version uses a \"Mark al l that app ly\" response option. Evidence supporting use of Race and Ethn icity The proposed modificati on would result i n two stratified data elements, one for race and one for ethnicity , that would conform with the 2011 HHS Data Standards for person- level da ta collection and the 1997 OMB Standards. The 2011 HHS Data Standards permit the collecti on of more-detailed information on population groups provided additional categories can be aggregated i nto the OMB m inimum st andard set of categories. The 2011 HHS Data Standards require a two -question format when self- identification is used to collect data on race and ethnicity. L arge federal su rveys, suc h as the National H ealth I nterview Survey, t he Behavioral R isk F actor Surveillance System, and the National Survey on D rug Use and Health ha ve implemented the 2011 HHS D ata Standards. CMS h as similarly upd ated the Medicare Current B eneficiary S urvey, t he Medicare Health O utcomes Survey, and t he Health I nsurance Marketplace Application for H ealth C overage with the 2011 HHS data standards. Preferred L anguage and I nterpreter Services Relevance to HHA s More than 64 milli on people in the United States speak a language other than English at home, and ne arly 40 million of those i ndividuals ha ve limited E nglish p roficiency ( LEP).345 Individuals with LEP have been shown to receive worse care and have poorer health outcomes, including higher readmission rates.346,347,348 Communicati on w ith individuals with LEP is an important component of quality health care, which starts by unde rstanding the population in need of language services. Unaddressed language barriers between a patient an d provider care team ne gatively affects the ability to identify and address i ndividual medical and non-medical care needs, to convey and understand clinical informati on, a nd to convey and understand discharge and follow-up instructions , all of which are necessary for providing high-quality care. Understanding the communicati on assistance ne eds of residents and patients with LEP, including individuals who are de af or hard of hearing , is critical for ensuring good outcomes.

Final Specifications for HH QRP QMS and SPADES Effective Date: Jan 1, 2021 90 C urrent use The preferred language of residents and patients and the need for interpreter services are assessed in two PAC assessment tools. The LCDS and the MDS use the same two data elements to assess preferred language and whether a patient or resident needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with health care staff. The current preferred language data element in LCDS and MDS is open -ended, allowing the patient or resident to identify their preferred language, including American Sign Language. The MDS initially implemented preferred language and interpreter services data elements to assess the needs of SNF residents and patients and inform care planning. For alignment purposes, the LCDS later adopted the same data elements for LTCHs. Evidence supp orting use of Preferred Language and Interpreter Services The 2009 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on standardizing data for health care quality improvement emphasizes that language and communication needs should be assessed as a standard part of health care delivery and quality improvement strategies. 349 Although the 2011 HHS Primary Language Data Standard recommends a two -part question to assess spoken language, the need to improve the assessment of language preferen ces and communication needs across PAC settings should be balanced with the provider and patient assessment burden. In addition, preferred spoken language would not allow information to be collected on American Sign Language, as is accounted for by the pre ferred language and interpreter services data elements currently in the MDS and LCDS. Health Literacy Relevance to HHA s Similar to language barriers, low health literacy can interfere with communication between the provider and resident or patient and the ability for residents and patients or their caregivers to understand and follow treatment plans, including medication management. Poor health literacy is linked to lower levels of knowledge about health, worse health outcomes, receipt of fewer preventive services , higher medical costs, and higher rates of emergency department use.350 Proposed Data Element for the Assessment of S DOH : Health Literacy 349 Institute of Medicine.

Evidence supporting use of Health Literacy Health literacy is prioritized by Healthy People 2020 as an SDOH.351 NASEM's 2016 report on accounting for social risk factors in Medicare payment considers health literacy an individual risk factor affected by other social risk factors.352 The Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS) question, which assesses reading ability (a primary component of health literacy), tested reasonably well against the 36 -item Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S -TOFHLA), a thoroughly vetted and widely adopted health literacy test, in assessing the likelihood of low health literacy in an adult sample from primary care practices participating in the Vermont Diabetes Information System . 353,354 SILS is publicly available, and shorter and easier to administer than the S -TOFHLA. R esearch found that a positive result on the SILS demonstrates an increased likelihood that an individual has low health literacy, Transportation Relevance to HHA s Transportation barriers can affect access to needed health care, causing missed appointment s, delayed care, and unfilled prescriptions, all of which can have a negative impact on health outcomes.355 Access to transportation for ongoing health care and medication access needs, particularly for those with 351 Healthy People 2020.
