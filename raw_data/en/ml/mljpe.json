Parental attitude towards disease isknown to be a powerful predictor of vaccineuptake. 2Indeed, reports from the Health Edu- cation Authority tracking studies of parentalattitudes to vaccination suggest that condencein the safety of MMR vaccine has fallen in par-allel with vaccine uptake, 3and many parents now consider the vaccine to be a greater threatto their child's health than measles itself. Methods and Results An outbreak of measles among children from apredominantly un-immunised anthroposophi-cal community in Gloucestershire provided anopportunity to explore parental views andstudy disease severity in this group. Anthro-posophy is a spiritual movement that followsthe teachings of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrianphilosopher and scientist born in 1861. Theterm literally implies a wisdom about man,which is produced by the higher self in manand achieved through meditation and concen-tration. 4Anthroposophical medicine advocates freedom of choice in health care and naturalremedies. This type of medical practice is infavour of letting the body experience certaininfections and is against the overuse ofantibiotics, antipyretics and certain immunisa-tions. Many adherents oppose the measles vac-cine because they believe children gain physicaland mental robustness from natural measlesinfection, when supported by appropriatenursing care. Indeed, as Hanratty et al note \"the avoidance of immunisation in these com-munities is more than a refusal to acceptconventional medicine\". 5 A postal questionnaire was sent to notied cases of measles from the 1997/8 outbreak inGloucestershire. A total of 126 questionnaireswere returned, giving an overall response rateof 59%. Among the respondents the mean ageof the cases was 7.9 years, the mean time o V school was 14 days, 76 consulted their generalpractitioner, 61 received prescribed medicationand one child was admitted to hospital. Some62% of these respondents reported a change intheir child's personal development subsequentto the measles infection, with many claiming astrengthening and maturing of their child bothmentally and physically. Of the cases, 87% werereported to have been previously unimmunisedwith the measles vaccine. The main reasons cited for not being vaccinated included issues relating to the safetyof the vaccine and its e Vectiveness. Many believed that measles is important for a child'sdevelopment and had a \"benecial strengthen-ing eVect upon the child\". Many respondents were also concerned about the long term sideeVects of the vaccine and the e Vects of the vac- cine on the immune system. Friends and rela-tives were the main reported influences behindthe parent's decision to immunise. Although83% of respondents viewed measles as aserious infection, only three felt that theirchild's illness had changed their opinion onimmunisation. Discussion The ndings of low levels of morbidity associ-ated with measles are similar to previous stud-ies in the United Kingdom, 2and support the notion that measles is not a severe illness inmost children. These cases were, however, int, well nourished children from a communitythat advocates a healthy lifestyle and there wereinsu Ycient numbers of cases to observe many of the rarer sequelae. Influencing parental atti-tudes by emphasising the severity of the illnesswas one tactic used to improve coverage in therun up to the 1994 measles-rubella vaccinationcampaign, which was successful in increasingvaccine coverage and preventing a predictedmeasles epidemic. The observations from thissurvey suggest a more appropriate tack for vac-cination campaigners may be to emphasise thesafety issues of the vaccine and its e Vectiveness in a balanced argument. The results alsosuggest that, rather than simply repeating thescare tactics used in previous campaigns, it maybe worthwhile exploring the views of vaccinerefusers in more detail and considering alterna-tive approaches to promoting vaccination insuch groups. I am extremely grateful to Dr David Hunt for his continued support and assistance in the preparation of this paper. I wouldalso like to thank Dr Wouter Havinga for his involvement in thesurvey and Dr Andy Ness for his constructive comments on anearlier draft of this paper. Funding: none.
