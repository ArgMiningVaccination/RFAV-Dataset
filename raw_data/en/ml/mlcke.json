She recently relocated to the Sacramento area with her husband and two young children and hopes to share with you her extensive experience treating the healthcare needs of her community. Her specialties include pain and rehab management, gynecological syndromes, digestive disorders, the treatment and prevention of cold and flu symptoms, allergies and stress-related disharmonies. Her focus is on the treatment of the human body in its entirety and engaging every patient's unique potential to achieve Better Balance + Wellness. Her passion for the human body, mind and spirit began at UC Santa Cruz while studying psychology and the medical sciences. While there she also discovered the holistic methods of reflexology, acupressure, massage therapy and yoga. She graduated in 1998 with a BA in Biology. With a firm foundation in pre-medical studies she was able to dive deeper into Traditional Chinese medicine under the guidance of her mentor and completed her education at Five Branches University. She took the opportunity to travel to Beijing, China for intensive training with Dr Wang Ju-Yi and his colleagues. Upon graduation Karen further studied orthopedic acupuncture with Dr. Deke Kendall and worked for pain rehabilitation clinics in Salinas and Morgan Hill. She also opened her own clinic in Santa Cruz where she became known for her compassionate approach and commitment to supporting the healing journey of her patients. Dr. Mimi Le had always known she wanted to be a healer ever since she was a young, but was unsure which health field she should pursue in. She went to college and majored in pre-nursing thinking that perhaps Nursing would be her calling only to realize it wasn't the type of lifestyle she can handle. She then went into her second passion which was to specialize in skincare and dermatology and became a licensed esthetician to help people look and feel beautiful. As an esthetician she was taught facial diagnosis which stem from Chinese Medicine and was amazed at the amount of information she can learn about her patient's health with just a glance. It was at that moment that she realized that she needed to study Traditional Chinese Medicine since she believed it to be a highly beneficial holistic health field to be in. Dr. Mimi graduated with her Masters and Doctorates from Five Branches University and decided to specialize in women's health and fertility. She had the opportunity to complete her externship at the renowned China Medical University Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan by shadowing various acupuncturists in a hospital setting that incorporates both eastern and western approach to medicine in different fields of practice from gynecology to pediatric medicine. After graduating from Five Branches University, she was scouted by her mentors to work in their fertility acupuncture practice that has connections with multiple IVF centers in the Bay Area for over 4 years before making a life changing move to Sacramento. She feels blessed to join a team of like minded acupuncturists at Better Balance Acupuncture and hopes she can make positive changes to everyone that she meets. Specialized in different acupuncture techniques, Dr. Mimi strives to use her knowledge and skills to help patients improve their health using herbs and acupuncture. In addition to specializing in women's health and fertility, Dr. Mimi is also experienced in facial rejuvenation (microneedling), Chi Nei Tsang, dermatological issues and chronic pain. In her free time she practices archery, has a knack for learning new languages, trying new food, hiking and traveling. "}
