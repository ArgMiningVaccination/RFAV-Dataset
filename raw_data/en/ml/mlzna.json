With this intent, I pursued medicine- both conventional and naturopathic. I strongly believe that when the body sustains injury, a healing process has begun at once; nature's agencies are set to work to restore soundness. My purpose is to enable and empower nature's healing and restoration in the most effective manner. What Makes Dr. Lam Different Born in India and raised in the Middle-East (Kuwait), she experienced the Gulf war of 1990 as a child. This traumatic experience motivated her to persevere her medical degree (M.B, B.S) in India that equipped her with exceptional knowledge in tropical/ infectious diseases and rural health. After completion of medical school she moved to Texas to join her family and complete her medical boards for family practice residency. However, she soon was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease causing her to switch gears and treat herself with natural remedies and lifestyle changes. This prompted her to explore naturopathic medicine that emphasizes 'exploring the root cause of disease' and effectively heal chronic disease beyond pharmaceutical treatment. Integrative Naturopathic Medicine Functional | Holistic | Alternative Extensive education on a multicultural/multidimensional level in addition to the fusion of allopathic and naturopathic medicine brings a unique perspective to Dr. Lam's profession. In addition to her educational background, she has ample experience in research publications and presentations at conferences emphasizing evidence-based medical practice.
