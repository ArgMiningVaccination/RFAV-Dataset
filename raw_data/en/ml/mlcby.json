Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n=6). Hepatotoxicity in rats was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 400mg/kg of d-GalN for five days. Silymarin (100mg/kg) was given as reference standard. The degree of protecti on against liver toxicity was determined by measuring the bilirubin (Total and Direct). The result shows that d-GalN has enhanced the levels of SGPT, SGOT, wt. and 400 mg/kg B. wt.) brought back the altered levels o f biochemical markers to the near normal lev- els. Histopathological studies also confirmed the h epatoprotective activity of these extracts when compared with d-GalN treated groups. It can be concluded from the result that the extrac t of Madhuca longifolia bark possesses hepatoprotective activity against D-GalN induced hepatotoxic- ity in rats. Key Words : Madhuca longifolia bark, Hepatoprotective, D-galactosamine Accepted Feb 16 2015 Introduction Hepatitis induced by D-galactosamine shows many met a- bolic and morphological aberrations in the livers o f ex- perimental animals similar to those observed in hum an viral hepatitis [1]. GalN hepatitis is induced by a multiple step mechanism [2]. In particular, the peroxidation of en- dogenous lipids has been shown to be a major factor in the cytotoxic action of GalN [3]. GalN-induced oxid ative damage is generally attributed to the formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH\u00ba), stimulator of lipid peroxidation and source for destruction and damage to the cell membrane [4]. In the absence of reliable modern hepatoprotective drugs, there are a number of traditional medicines recomme nded for treatment of liver diseases. Many herbs reporte dly possess hepatoprotective the family Sapotaceae is an indigenous plant found largely in the central an d north Indian plains and forests [11]. Commonly known as Ma- hua, it is used in the treatment of epilepsy, and i nflamma- tions. Presence of a genuine sapogenol protobasic a cid and prospagenol in the seed kernels of Madhuca longifo- lia was reported by Yosioka [12]. Analgesic activity o f the alcoholic extract was reported [13] while antih pergly- cemic activity [14] of the extract of Madhuca longifolia bark was also studied. The plant possesses remarkable antioxidant and hepa to- protective potential against carbon tetra chloride and d- galactosamine induce hepatic injury [16,17]. This study aimed to conduct a scientic experiment using the ethanolic extract of Madhuca longifolia bark at differ- ent doses from previous report to investigate its h epato- protective activity and possible mechanism in D- galactosamine induced rat hepatic injury. Materials and Methods Chemicals D-Galactosamine (d-GalN) was purchased from Merck India Ltd., Mumbai, India. 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitroben zoic acid was obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Roy/Kannadasan/Gupta Biomed Res- India 2015 Volume 26 Issue 2 366 Ltd., Mumbai. Ecoline assay kits bilirubin (TB) were obtained f rom Merck Ltd., Ambemath, India and Silymarin from Ran- baxy India Ltd., New Delhi. All the other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Collection & Extraction Leaf samples of the plant Polyalthia longifolia were col- lected from Bardoli, Surat, Gujarat, during January 2013 and was authenticated by Dr. Bimal Shah. The leaves of the plant were shade dried at room temperature and were then pulverized. The coarse powder obtained was suc ces- sively extracted with various organic solvents in t he in- creasing order of their polarity (petroleum ether, chloro- form, ethanol & water) in a soxhlet extractor for a period of 24 - 28 hours. The extracts were then concentrat ed to dryness in a rotavapor under reduced pressure and c on- trolled temperature. The ethanol extract yielded a brown semi-solid (16g). Animals Both sex Wistar rats (150 - 200g) were selected for the study. They were housed in polypropylene cages in a n air-conditioned area at 22C \u00b1 3C and 59 to relati ve hu- midity with 12-hour light & dark cycle. All the ani mals had free access to standard diet and clean water ad libit- ium. The experiments were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) regula - tions approved by the Committee for the purpose of Con- trol and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). Experimental protocol The rats were grouped randomly into five groups, ea ch containing six animals. Group I, the negative contr ol group, received the vehicle (normal saline). Group II serv ed as positive control group and received the vehicle (no rmal saline). Group III was treated with standard drug s ilymarin at 100 mg /kg body weight. Group IV and V were trea ted with plant extract at the dose levels of 200 and 40 0 mg/kg body weight respectively for five days [18]. On the fifth day of the treatment, animals of all g roups except group I received a single dose of d-GalN in dis- tilled water at 400 mg/kg body weight intraperitone ally after two hours of their respective treatment. Afte r 24 hours of d-GalN administration blood was collected retro- orbitally under light ether anesthesia. Immediately , after blood withdrawal all groups were sacrificed. Liver sam- ples were also collected for histological and bioch emical estimations. The blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 - 40 minutes. Serum was separated by centrifugat ion at 37C and was used for estimation of various bioc hemi- cal parameters like SGOT, SGPT, total & direct bilirubin [19-22]. Histological studies Small pieces of liver xed in 10% buffered neutral forma- lin were processed for embedding in paraffin. Secti ons of 5-6 \u00b5m thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eo- sin and examined for histopathological changes (200 \u00d7) under a compound microscope [23]. Data analysis Quantitative data were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E. and all statistical comparisons were made by means of one-w ay ANOVA test followed by Tukey's test. P-Values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant while P-values less than 0.01 were considered extremely si g- nificant. Results Biochemical observations Administration of d-GalN resulted in a significant rise in the levels of SGPT, SGOT, ALP, Total Cholesterol an d Bilirubin (Total and Direct) when compared to the v ehicle treated group (Group-I). The extract of EEMLB treat - ments significantly (P<0.001) reversed the levels o f ele- vated biochemical parameters in dose dependent mann er (Group IV & V). The results indicated that the effe ct of test extract on biochemical markers was found to be al- most comparable than the reference standard, Silyma rin (Group III). The results are shown in (Table-1). Table 1. Effects of EEMLB on biochemical markers in D-galactosamine induced D-Galactosamine induced hepatotoxicity .

Free radicals damage the cell membrane and cellular con- stituents like DNA etc. Though the free radicals ar e generated even in health, human beings possess the inbuilt natural mechanism to scavenge the generated free radicals. The the glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), But during prolonged stressful conditions the free radi- cals produced cannot be handled by our inbuilt mech a- nism alone. Thus released free radicals react with the membrane poly- unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and oxidise peroxides. This lipid peroxidation damages membran e protein as well as the lipids. Thereby, the integr ity of the membrane is lost. Therefore it is considered that t he ex- tent of lipid peroxidation is directly proportional to cell damage. In addition, the free radicals may also att ack DNA and causes tissue damage. Galactosamine admini- stration in rats disrupts the membrane permeability of the plasma membrane causing leakage of the enzymes from the cell, which leads to elevation in levels of ser um en- zymes (Mitra et al., 2000). It is apparent that the levels of SGPT, SGOT, ALP, total cholesterol, and total and d irect Bilirubin increased signicantly in group treated w ith d- GalN comparing to normal control and it is an obvio us indication of hepatic insult [24-26]. Study of any herbal medicine becomes more signican t when it ameliorates some diseases conditions. In th e present investigation, hepatoprotective effects of the ethanolic extract of Madhuca longifolia bark was stud- ied based on d-GalN induced liver hepatitis. The he pa- toprotective effect of Madhuca longifolia has been shown in earlier studies. In our study the rise in SGOT, SGPT, ALP, and bilirubin levels induced by D-galac- tosamine administration was significantly reduced b y EEMLB pre-treatment suggesting that its hepatoprote c- tive activity might be due its effect against cellu lar leakage and loss of functional integrity of the cel l membrane in hepatocytes. Histopathological studies also support the protecti ve effects of the plant. Flavonoids, a polyphenolic deriva- tive could be the major contributory toprotective activity [27,28]. It seems the protec tive activity of the plant may be due to strengthening t he in- built antioxidant system and the antioxidant princi ples in the plant . However, further studies are needed to com- pletely establish the mechanism of hepatoprotective ef- fect of the plant. Conclusion Based on the present study, it can be concluded tha t etha- nolic extract of Madhuca longifolia bark have potent hepatoprotective activity in a dose dependent manne r. Further isolation of active principles will be adva ntageous to produce novel bioactive constituents from these ex- tracts, which may possess more significance in the treat- ment of liver diseases, and to elucidate its exact mecha- nism of action. Attempts are being made to isolate and characterize the active principle to which the hepa topro- tective activity can be attributed.
