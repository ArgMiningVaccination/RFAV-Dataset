Raja is starting Internal Medicine's new Complementary Medicine Program, which brings together acupuncture, meditation, guided imagery and other clinical services dubbed by some as \"alternative\" medicine. Services will open to patients in October. Patient interest in complementary medicine has grown dramatically in the 1990s, and academic medical centers-USC among them-are increasingly including it in their menu of health offerings. \"Many people in medicine have become more open to these ideas,\" Raja says, \"and patients would like their doctors to be aware of trends in alternative medicine.\" The proportion of Americans visiting an alternative medicine practitioner grew from about 34 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 1997, according to a national survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. In 1997, 629 million Americans were estimated to have visited alternative medicine practitioners-more than the total number of visits to the nation's primary care physicians. Herbal medicine, massage and homeopathy are among the fastest-growing therapies. And patients have been willing to pay for such treatments. Nearly three of five patients using alternative medicine have paid entirely out-of-pocket for those services (with a total of $21.2 billion estimated expenditures on alternative medicine services in 1997). Raja has been attentive to the trends, and hopes to fulfill some of those patient demands and needs through personal one-on-one care and skills as a traditionally trained physician, acupuncturist and osteopath. According to the program's philosophy, well being is based not only on physical health, but also on the ability to deal with emotional aspects of life. Program services complement traditional medical practices by offering patients chances for increased self-awareness, pain management and health maintenance. One of the most popular modes of treatment is acupuncture, Raja says. Patients interested in acupuncture will first meet with Raja for a comfortable, hour-long visit. Raja asks about patients' lives-their worries, their home situations, their spirituality-and, of course, the reasons they seek acupuncture. Raja listens to patients, uses their medical history and other factors to determine if acupuncture is the right choice and talks to patients' primary care doctors as well. Acupuncture originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. Healers use sterile needles to stimulate the flow of energy, known as \"qi\" (pronounced chee) in Chinese. Studies have found it effective against nausea caused by chemotherapy, as well as chronic pain. It may help other problems as well, Raja says. Meditation also will be offered to patients in a group setting. Calling it \"mind-body awareness,\" Raja will lead eight-week courses of two-hour classes focusing on learning about one's own self through guided meditations, breathing exercises, discussions, readings and personal experiences. Patients will learn to manage their responses to stress. \"This is for anyone, from people with chronic or acute illnesses to people who want to maintain their good health,\" Raja says. Guided imagery is the third component of the program. Patients learn to see images in their minds that may help them heal and recover from illness. Raja will help patients one-on-one with guided imagery to promote health and wellness. Once a cadre of patients joins the program, researchers may study the effectiveness of complementary medicine techniques on health, he says. Raja is board certified in internal medicine and rheumatology, and completed his rheumatology fellowship at USC. He also completed a rigorous program in medical acupuncture and is a doctor of osteopathic medicine. As a survivor of lymphoma himself, Raja also has seen the value of various healing techniques. Chemotherapy helped purge his body of cancer, while he has changed his diet to a specific Indian vegetarian regime, prayed and meditated to try to keep himself free of the disease. Meditation will be held during Tuesday evenings once a week at the USC/Norris Cancer Center and Hospital's 7th floor conference room and costs $200 (registration in advance) or $225 (registration at the door) for an eight-week session. Complementary medical services may not be covered by most health insurance plans, including the USC Network. For more information about the Complementary Medicine Program, "}
