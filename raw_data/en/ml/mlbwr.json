What's New Version 5.0.1 Minor bug fixed. Ratings and Reviews Update: bug seems to be fixed I think this bug was fixed a while back so I'm updating this here. I think this is one of, if not the best meditation timers out there. It works just the way I want it to. I don't use a lot of the extra features but it does exactly what I want in a meditation timer and it does it smoothly and simply. I just figured out that this app was the culprit for draining the battery rapidly on my iPhone. It seems that it isn't releasing the audio circuitry, and that drains the battery about three times as fast as it normally would!! Other than that I like the app, but I have to advise everyone to stay away from it until this bug is fixed. If you must use it, make sure to manually quit the app by swiping up on it in the task manager after each use, this will force it to stop draining the battery. Mostly Works! Using this on an iPhone 6S and love it. Very complete-seeming after reading reviews of several meditation timers. I agree that some of the sounds are utterly out of place in an app like this. Not sure who's need is met with some and would like more chime-type options. Not a problem if that never happens. The variability and options make this great for me. On the iPad Mini 4 this app has a hard time. Either there are no chime sounds, chimes ring repeatedly, (yeah, like over and over), or it won't run a saved/titled meditation at all. Now sometimes it does work on the iPad, but I've given up on that device with this app. BTW, I'm not having trouble with any other app on it. Would also prefer to use the app on the iPad to save on phone battery use. So I use it on the phone. Oh, and please note: it's true that if you don't close the app after use, it will continue to use up your battery. That said, love it. Works great I've had no problems with this meditation timer and I've been using it for years. I have a few meditations I've set up (with different lengths, intervals, etc.) for my typical daily/weekly routine. The only feature that would make this timer better for me would be a \"volume test\". Currently I always start a meditation so I can hear the volume level for the current bell then immediately end it if the volume is too loud or quiet. Then I adjust the volume and start again. If there were a button next to the start button for just testing the volume, that would help me. However, the app is configurable and the UI is straightforward enough for me to never want to look for another mediation app again. The quality and variety of bells are nice. Incidentally, I find the timer configurable enough to be useful in other practices. So I have a timer for stretching and yoga which repeatedly reminds me when to switch stretches or poses. Then a different bell signals when I've completed the amount of time I want to spend stretching or practicing yoga. Really nice.
