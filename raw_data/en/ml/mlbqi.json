Most people have heard of chiropractic but have a hard time accurately defining it. A chiropractor is a licensed professional that holds a doctor of chiropractic degree and is trained to treat the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. Most often chiropractors treat back pain, neck pain, joint pain, and headaches. How Does Chiropractic Treatment Work? Chiropractic treatment is a drug-free and surgery-free way to treat and recover from injury. Chiropractors put emphasis on your body's ability to heal itself. Treatment typically involves hands-on treatment for adjusting misaligned joints that have become \"stuck\" as a result of trauma or bad habits over time. Manual treatments range from stretching to quick and gentle thrusts to improve motion and functions. The spine gets the most attention for adjustments, but other parts of your body can be treated with the same techniques. Benefits of Chiropractic Treatment - Avoid Surgery - Long-term Pain Relief - More Energy - Faster Injury Recovery - Improved Immune Function - Improved Digestion - Better Asthma Control - Easier Breathing - Healthier Pregnancies - Improved Range of Motion - Better Sleep Why Does Chiropractic Treatment Work? To understand why chiropractic treatment works you first need to understand the relationship between your body's ability to move freely and the musculoskeletal system. Your bones provide the structural framework for your body. Muscles are a physiological mechanism that allows your body to move. Your muscles contract and relax to move bones at the joints. This allows you to run, lift, bend, twist, etc. A skeletal misalignment (bone or joint) often relates to a functional problem for the soft tissue (muscle, tendon, or ligament). Chiropractic treatment works because it adjusts your misalignments in a way that frees your body to heal itself without surgery or medication. Think of it as the best way to give your body a chance to heal itself. Understanding Chiropractic Care Frequently Asked Questions Are chiropractors licensed doctors? Yes. Doctors of Chiropractic (also known as chiropractors) are not medical doctors but go through a similar education process to become licensed in the field of chiropractic care. Educational requirements for chiropractors are among the most stringent of any health care profession. What types of pain do chiropractors treat? Chiropractors are known for their expertise in caring for patients with back pain, neck pain, and headaches. They also treat sports injuries and other disorders involving muscles, ligaments and joints. The benefits of chiropractic care go beyond this and extend into general health as our core body structure affects overall function and health. What is a chiropractic adjustment? A chiropractic adjustment is the art of using a specific, controlled force in a precise direction that is applied to a spinal joint not moving properly or \"locked up.\" The purpose of this natural and safe procedure is to correct structural alignment and eliminate interference in the nervous system. For the patient, this means improved spinal function, reduction in pain, and an overall improvement in health and wellness. Do chiropractic adjustments hurt? Chiropractic manipulation is a highly controlled procedure that rarely causes discomfort because minimal force and gentle pressure are used. Most patients feel relief immediately following treatment. Any reported soreness after an initial adjustment has been described as similar to that associated with starting a new exercise program. Drinking plenty of water, using an ice pack, and engaging in light stretching after your first visit can help ease any discomfort and promote healing. Are chiropractic adjustments safe? Chiropractic care is widely recognized as one of the safest drug-free, non-invasive therapies available for the treatment of most back and neck problems. Spinal adjustments are extremely safe when performed by a licensed chiropractor. Why do chiropractic adjustments sometimes make a popping sound? The noises you hear resembling popping sounds are your joints releasing tiny pockets of air. A chiropractic adjustment does not affect the bones of either side of a joint; it affects the connective tissue that holds the joint together. Can I see a chiropractor if I am pregnant? Many pregnant women find that chiropractic adjustments improve the pregnancy experience and make delivery easier. Adjustments are adapted to accommodate the stage of pregnancy and the unique needs of each patient. Do I need a referral from an M.D. to see a chiropractor? No, but it's best to check with your employer's human resources department or contact your health plan directly to find out if there are referral requirements for your healthcare plan. "}
