(Anti-1st amendment forces have forced the video to be taken down, but we can still get the details [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-vaccine-mandates-push-holdouts-get-shot-detox-rcna4859).) This treatment promises to be a godsend for the 30% of the country that understands the dangers of the Covid vaccine. It will allow us to get vaccinated so we can keep our jobs and enter buildings and travel to see our kids. The treatment eliminates the vaccine from our body so the government and Bill Gates can't track us. Fortunately, the treatment is quite simple and inexpensive. Just add baking soda and Epsom salts to detox the radiation from the vaccine. Include bentonite clay to pull out the vaccine poison. And add one cup of borax to take out the nanotechnologies. Mix it all into the hottest water you can stand. After soaking 20 minutes, the vaccine should be gone from our bodies. This will keep us safe from the pernicious effects of the vaccine, while giving us vax cards to wave at the clueless sheep. I was very optimistic this would help, but as always, I remain skeptical, even of such an esteemed expert as Dr. Carrie. As a scientist in computational fluid dynamics, I decided to do my own analysis with a number of blood samples provided by family and friends. What I found was interesting. The treatment was: - 100% effective at removing the smallpox vaccine from the blood - 98.8% effective at removing the polio vaccines - 74.9% effective at eliminating the MMR vaccine that causes autism - 53.6% effective at purging the tetanus vaccine However, for the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna, it only removed 25.3%. Against the J&J vaccine, the removal rate was even lower at 21.7%. If you live in a remote area where the government doesn't have many satellites pointed, the 21-25% attenuation of the tracking signal may provide adequate protection from tracking, especially if combined with protective clothing. However, for those of us living in metropolitan regions where cell towers can follow us, the attenuation is basically the... "}
