We have been seeing several cases of Influenza A in our office in the last few weeks. We will probably see additional strains as well, but so far everyone we've tested has been positive for Influenza A. The patients I am seeing are not getting terribly sick with this strain, but it is lasting a long time - up to 7 to 10 days - with high fever and uncomfortable symptoms. Patients have all been able to manage their symptoms at home using natural medicine, and ibuprofen as needed. Despite the hype about the flu last winter (2017 - 2018), our office is actually seeing more cases of the flu this year. So far, all of the patients who have tested positive for Influenza at our office have not received the flu shot. And, of course, the large majority of people who did not get the flu shot this year have not gotten the flu as well. I'd like to share some information to help you and your children stay healthy. As they say, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" - and we certainly believe this is true! PREVENTION I know I sound like a broken record, but the most important thing to do is maximize your child's health with the basics. Here are a few things you can do to keep your kids healthy during the winter. Hand washing for more than 20 seconds with soap and water. This has been proven to prevent influenza and many other infections. I recommend doing this before every meal and more often for children who still put their hands in their mouths. Also, encourage children to wash their hands upon returning home from school, errands, and other activities. Hand sanitizer - needs to have more than 60% alcohol to be effective. This is sometimes even more effective than hand washing (do your kids actually wash their hands well?!) and often the only good option when out of the house. Clean surfaces - many viruses can hang out and wait for you for 2 or more weeks! This is often overlooked. Some recommendations would be Seventh Generation Disinfecting Multi-Surface Cleaner, Cavicide, Clorox Wipes, Rubbing Alcohol, etc. Minimize travel and high risk activities. These include visiting the children's museum, indoor play areas or dropping your kids off at the gym, church, or synagogue child care. Trust me, the investment in babysitting will pay off in the end. Ask your play dates and guests if they are or have been sick recently. Again, viruses can hang out for far longer on surfaces. Keep your kids home if they are sick - that also means you should stay home if you are ill. This is a major reason why we have epidemics. In addition to infecting others, your child is more likely to get something else while their system is challenged/recovering. Nutrition - a good whole foods diet is crucial. Eat a well-rounded, nutrient-dense diet. Decrease sugar and processed foods. If you feel you need help with this, book a [session with Debbie](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/mn-philosophy/), my amazing wife and our nutritionist. She can help you get your family on track. Keep your family well rested - it's amazing how powerful this is! I can often overt illness if I get the proper rest my body is asking for when I'm first feeling run down. SUPPLEMENTS We know that you have a lot of options for purchasing supplements, and we greatly appreciate your support of our [online store!](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/online-store/) Your support helps us to continue to share helpful information and resources with our community. At a minimum, I recommend the following supplements... There are studies that show that these basics can significantly decrease the frequency of illness in both children and adults. Vitamin D: 400-1000 iu per day for most children. The large majority of children I have tested have insufficient levels of vitamin D and may actually need more than these basic recommendations. Call the office for an appointment if you want to discuss testing your child. Probiotics: These good bacteria are crucial for good health. Besides benefiting digestion, they are supportive with respiratory and immune challenges as well. Omega 3 fats: Fish or cod liver oil are essential for your immune system to work properly. Multivitamin: A good \"insurance policy\" that your basic nutrients are covered. Especially helpful for children who are \"picky eaters\". Specific Supplements to Prevent & Treat Viral Illness...
