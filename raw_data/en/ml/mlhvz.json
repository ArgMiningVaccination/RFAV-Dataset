Too often, patients with CD are given a diagnosis, told to follow a GFD, and never further monitored. Assessment of a patient's gluten-free lifestyle requires a careful history to ensure the patient fully understands the severity of their condition and the level of adherence they need to follow. Additionally, routine follow-up monitoring is essential to preventing sequelae of CD.

Any of these may be directly related to CD or to secondary autoimmunity, yet be easily overlooked.1 With our guiding principle of preventative medicine, naturopathic doctors should ensure that patients with CD as well as other autoimmune conditions are being routinely screened based on the recommended and evidence-based guidelines. Importance of Clinical Diagnosis Patients with CD often have positive serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies but are never diagnosed by duodenal biopsy to confirm a clinical diagnosis of CD. The Government of Canada provides limited financial assistance as a tax program to account for the significant difference in costs of standard vs gluten-free foods; however, this program is complex and often not realistic for individuals to claim every gluten-free expense. Regardless, there are several other factors that underline the importance of being clinically diagnosed. For example, the diagnosis relays the severity of a patient's condition and how strictly they need to comply with a GFD. Additionally, it empowers patients to advocate for the screening and prevention of known sequelae of CD. It also provides justification for direct family members to be screened, either through serum antibody testing or genetic testing for either HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 as a negative predictive value.

Additionally, with clinical diagnosis of malabsorption syndromes, including CD, additional nutritional lab testing is included under the Medical Services Plan (MSP) in British Columbia - Vitamin D testing, for example.2 With the clinical diagnosis, patients can also choose to participate in medical trials for the advancement of medical care. For these reasons, it is crucial that patients are clinically diagnosed so that they receive proper management of the disease. Initial Lab Testing & Gold Standard Diagnostics Patients diagnosed by serum testing of anti-transglutaminase, anti-gliadin, or anti-endomysial antibodies require referral to a gastroenterologist for clinical diagnosis via gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy.3 It is critical, while patients await their gastroscopy procedure, that they continue to consume gluten to ensure accurate biopsy results. Patients are recommended to eat 2-4 slices per day of gluten-containing bread for at least 2 weeks prior to serology or biopsy testing, although this amount of gluten exposure and length of time is highly debated. Repeat gastroscopy is also a highly debated topic among physicians; however, most research supports the recommendation that patients have a repeat gastroscopy and biopsy after 1 year of diagnosis to ensure that the histology demonstrates healing of the intestinal microvilli. In my clinical experience, this is rarely done. As naturopathic doctors, we should be encouraging patients to maintain a clinical relationship with their gastroenterologist, as confirming this histological change is the only established means of assessing healing. Symptoms, serology, or other non-invasive means of monitoring are poor predictors of healing, and thus can falsely represent patient progress.4 A likely contributing factor to the confusion surrounding follow-up recommendations and timing is the lack of unified consensus among the various organizations offering guidelines. A comparison of these differences among North American and world guidelines is outlined in Table 1. Case Study The following case study will illustrate how a lack of long-term management can lead to a poor outcome. A 32-year-old female presented to my office with a clinical diagnosis of CD, which was diagnosed at age 17 per positive anti-tTG Ab and duodenal biopsy. She reported following a GFD 95-98% of the time, but her household still contained gluten-containing foods and she did regular baking with wheat flour for her family. She had been diagnosed repeatedly with iron deficiency throughout her early adult years, but had never responded to oral iron prescriptions. She had not had repeat antibody screening or biopsy after diagnosis. Her TSH was screened at her first pregnancy, which was within normal limits; however, with screening at the beginning of her second pregnancy, it was determined that she had hypothyroidism and she was started on 25 \u00b5 g/day of levothyroxine. She reported that her thyroid was not checked throughout her pregnancy and that she was told by her physician to discontinue the levothyroxine post-partum without further testing. She presented to her family doctor approximately 2 months later with significant hair loss. TSH was retested and was started on 50 \u00b5g/day of levothyroxine. The hair loss continued, so her thyroid function was retested 2 months later. TSH was 21.57 mU/L and the fT4 was 9.8 pmol/L, so the levothyroxine was increased to 150 \u00b5 g daily. One week after the dosage of levothyroxine was increased to 150 \u00b5g, she presented to my office 5 months post-partum with significant hair loss, low energy, and brain fog. We discussed the importance of autoantibody screening, given her diagnosis of CD and the potential for autoimmune thyroid involvement. At this time, I discontinued her self- administration of 10 000 \u00b5g per day of biotin, to ensure future thyroid testing was accurate; I also recommended that future thyroid testing be performed after an overnight fast and in the morning before levothyroxine administration in order to create a new baseline for comparisons.

IgA = >250.0 U/mL (RR: <12.0 U/mL) This testing, along with her other symptoms, confirmed a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The elevated anti-tTG antibodies could be due to cross- reactivity with the anti-TPO antibodies and/or be reflective of undiagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis or uncontrolled celiac disease. Regardless, she was referred back to her family doctor for a standing order for testing of anti-tTG, anti-TPO, and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) every 3 months for 12 months, along with my recommendation for referral to a gastroenterologist for repeat gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy. Unfortunately, my clinical experience is that patients with CD have poor management and follow-up, and that while this case is an extreme example, as naturopathic doctors we should be educating our autoimmune patients that routine screening is important for preventing autoimmune sequelae. This is even more important at times of hormonal changes, such as pregnancy. A study of Dutch patients with CD reported that 12% of those CD patients were later diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.9 Potentially, had this patient been screened following her initial diagnosis of CD, monitored annually, and had antibody testing along with routine thyroid screening in early pregnancy, doctors would have arrived at her diagnosis before symptom severity progressed. The Canadian Digestion Health Foundation reports that approximately 30% of adults with CD have secondary autoimmune conditions, thus underlining the importance of thorough history-taking and adequate screening.10 Recommended Guidelines: A Naturopathic Perspective Developing a consensus on the recommendations of management for patients with celiac disease is greatly needed. A 2010 survey of gastroenterologists in Canada, examining their long-term management of patients with CD, showed that 76% of them provide routine follow-up care for patients with CD, and 65% include serology testing as part of that follow-up care. Additionally, 36% of respondents reported rarely performing follow-up duodenal biopsy. This study had only a 43% response rate and had greater response from practitioners within their first 10 years of practice, which may demonstrate a margin of positive reporting bias.11 My clinical observation has been that patients with CD are rarely aware that routine follow-up is recommended, and they have rarely had repeat serum testing or duodenal biopsy. The lack of consensus among recommendations for long-term management may be adding to physicians' confusion surrounding post-diagnosis management decisions. Additionally, there could be a general lack of awareness of the various recommendations regarding long- term management and screening tests for patients with CD. Naturopathic doctors are primary care physicians. Therefore, it is our duty to ensure these patients have adequate screening and reinforce the stringency of following a GFD and, more so, a celiac lifestyle. Based off an amalgamation of current recommendations, naturopathic doctors should repeat serology for patients at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis. In addition, a duodenal biopsy should be repeated in patients with persistent abnormalities or symptomology. The discussion regarding adherence to a GFD should be ongoing, nutritional serology should be done at the time of diagnosis, and repeated annually if the testing was previously abnormal. Additional autoimmune screening should be strongly considered in patients with ongoing inflammation, and possibly performed periodically in patients with CD. For patients who have not experienced long- term management, consider a general screen, as discussed above, at the initiation of your doctor-patient relationship. A collaborative, integrated healthcare team is required for CD patients for proper long- term management and the best possible clinical outcome. For my patients, I also suggest involvement with advocacy groups for additional resources and support, such as the Canadian Celiac Association, Celiac Disease Foundation, National Celiac Association, etc. Karly McMaster, ND, is a licensed naturopathic physician practicing in Delta, British Columbia.

Recent studies have shed light on a fascinating property of activated microglia: they can be polarized into 2 different forms, or phenotypes, in response to the CNS environment in which they find themselves. This means they are capable of shifting into having either proinflammatory/neurotoxic effects or anti-inflammatory/neuroregenerative effects, based on their microenvironment.8 The proinflammatory factors produced by microglia can damage local brain tissue. When a disordered immune response or damage to the blood-brain barrier persistently activates microglia, the inflammatory homeostasis is disrupted. As a consequence, microglia may not shift sufficiently toward their \"resolution\" phenotype. This situation induces more inflammation and further microglial activation, potentially leading to a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation. Prolonged activation of microglia and the resultant state of chronic neuroinflammation are thought to be linked to the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease9 and Parkinson's disease,10 and may be a cofactor in the development and clinical course of MS. Considering the significant role that the gut microbiome plays in microglial development and function, as well as the vital importance of communication between the microbiome and the immune system within and beyond the gut, it is not a big leap to say that gut dysbiosis may increase susceptibility to dysfunctional dietary antigens.6 The brain, another major organ subject to immune privilege, is protected from substances such as cytokines and metabolic or microbial byproducts, in large part by the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is closely monitored by macrophages and microglia that are resident in the CNS. It has been shown that the healthy maturation and function of CNS microglia are dependent on a healthy and diverse gut microbiome. Furthermore, the maturation and function of microglia are regulated on an ongoing basis by short- chain fatty acids (SCFAs) synthesized by gut flora.7 This means the gut microbiome is involved with crosstalk with the immune system beyond the gut. It also means the health of the microbiome can have a direct impact on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Microglia & the Gut Microbiome Microglia are the foremost innate immune cells of the CNS. They are involved and promote neuroinflammatory reactivity. The Gut-Brain Axis & Neuroinflammation The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex array of interactive neurochemical signaling pathways. It encompasses the neuroendocrine system, neuroimmune system, enteric nervous system, and autonomic nervous system. The GBA regulates multiple processes that are crucial for healthy functioning and homeostasis. In fact, scientific evidence continues to demonstrate the importance of the interplay between the gut and the brain for physical and mental health, as well as in the development of certain disease states. The gut microbiome (or gut microbiota; the terms are often used interchangeably) is a dynamic component of the GBA. The gut microbiome is actively involved in a process known as tolerogenic signaling with the immune system, which establishes and maintains immune privilege, or non- reactivity to both commensal flora and by uncontrolled activation of immune cells that infiltrate the CNS and attack the myelin sheath, leading to demyelination and axonal loss. MS clearly has autoimmune features, but as yet no specific autoantibodies have been consistently identified in every person with MS.4 This may be a consequence of its complex and varied etiology. MS is also described as an immune- mediated condition,5 meaning it does not have a definitive etiology but is distinguished by common inflammatory pathways that are instigated by a dysregulated immune response. The distinction between autoimmune and immune mediated may largely be moot for naturopathic physicians, as our therapeutic approaches aim to support the body at deep, multisystem levels. Neuroinflammatory autoimmune (or immune-mediated) conditions do not begin in the CNS. Increasing evidence points to the central importance of the gut microbiome in its capacity to both mitigate MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct? Address correct?

The restoration of a healthy microbial population in these patients was shown to result in a decrease in inflammatory episodes and immune reactivity.16 A healthy gut microbiome establishes and maintains physiological balance through a number of mechanisms, such as preventing colonization by pathogenic microbes; modulating host immunity within and beyond the gut; and ensuring the integrity of the intestinal barrier (thereby contributing to the integrity of the blood- brain barrier). A particularly simple approach that over the long term has the potential to address many of these mechanisms is having your MS patients add high-fiber prebiotics to their diet. These can be taken in the form of supplements, but they are also readily available in the diet and can be incorporated with a view to being a permanent lifestyle change. High sources of dietary fiber include legumes (such as black beans, lentils, and chickpeas), fruits (in particular avocados, berries, apples, bananas, and oranges), lightly cooked vegetables, whole grains (in patients without gluten sensitivity), seeds, and nuts (in particular, walnuts and raw almonds).immune activity in the CNS. Gut Microbiome & MS The link between CNS autoimmunity and the gut microbiome was first shown in studies using the experimental animal model of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE). Some of these studies showed that gut bacteria from people with MS exacerbated the symptoms of EAE in mice11 and even induced EAE in mice that did not already have it.12 The gut microbiome appears to have its immunomodulatory influence beyond the gut in a number of ways. Several studies using the EAE model suggest that interleukin-17 (IL-17) may be a significant cofactor in the development and severity of MS.13 IL-17 is a family of proinflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells. Many MS patients have elevated levels of IL-17 in their serum and cerebrospinal fluid.14 Along with playing a crucial role in the maturation and function of microglia, the gut microbiome is involved in the activation of T cells by modulating the balance of Th1/Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), even outside of the gut. Tregs are crucial for preventing autoimmune reactions because they inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, thereby restoring homeostasis and maintaining self-tolerance. It's not fully understood how Th1 and Th17 cells in people with MS become myelin-specific and are able to cross the blood-brain barrier; however, the presence of T cells in the CNS has many detrimental effects, including promoting microglial activation and the release of cytotoxic agents that MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

Summary As naturopathic doctors, we have a panoply of options to offer patients to mitigate the clinical course of MS and potentially promote remyelination. These approaches include directly addressing systemic inflammation, hormone imbalances, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter deficiencies using the wide array of therapeutic modalities in our toolbox. We are also experts at supporting gut health. Incorporating dietary fiber into a daily wellness regimen is a relatively inexpensive and easy thing for MS patients to do, whether or not they are supplementing with probiotics as well. It is also a simple yet powerful therapeutic strategy in support of neurological health. References 15-20 available online at ndnr.comdisorders.18 One caveat to be aware of is that adding prebiotic fiber to the diet of a patient who already has dysbiosis may cause intestinal discomfort. This discomfort is usually temporary while the microbiome environment adjusts, but it may be advisable to have your patient supplement for a time with probiotics first. Although the mechanisms of autoimmunity in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are different from those in MS, it's worth noting the benefits of addressing imbalances in the microbiome with probiotics in these conditions that do have neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in common. An in-vitro study in which immune cells isolated from people with Parkinson's disease were cultured with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium found that these probiotic strains significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines IL-17) and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines.19 In a randomized, double- blind trial, participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, who received a mix of The gut microbiome breaks down insoluble fibers into short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs have innumerable beneficial effects on inflammation, including neuroinflammation. They exert this effect in part by reducing levels of IL-1\u00df, and because of their role in microglial maturation and function. High-fiber diets can also differentially affect the preponderance of microbial strains and widen the range of beneficial flora. For example, the prebiotic inulin selectively influences the abundance of Anaerostipes, Bilophila, and Bifidobacterium . Beneficial alterations to the gut microbiome of mice fed inulin included increased microbial production of SCFAs and improved neurological outcomes.17 High-fiber diets have also been shown to increase circulating levels of butyrate, as well as to reduce the risk for chronic inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, stroke, and cardiovascular disease, which themselves are linked to an increased risk of dementia and other neurological Tolle Causam MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

To better understand how the circadian system influences viral infection outcomes, Sengupta et al, in the study referenced earlier, measured viral titers in both active-phase-infected mice and rest-phase-infected mice at 6 hours, 12 hours, and every second day until day 10 post-infection.1 Differences between the groups were not significant until 8 days post-infection. At this point, more mice infected during the rest phase showed low rates of viral clearance despite higher levels of inflammation, while the majority of the mice infected during the active phase had cleared the virus. They also found that while viral titers were similar between the 2 groups, increased cellularity in the bronchoalveolar lavage specimens indicated that mice exposed during the rest phase had higher levels of inflammation compared to mice infected during the active phase.1 This study demonstrated that circadian patterns influences viral clearance through modulating inflammatory responses against infection. The influence of the circadian system on inflammatory responses can be further elucidated by studying another core clock gene, Clock, which encodes the protein CLOCK. This protein heterodimerizes with BMAL1 to activate clock-controlled genes.2,5 Spengler et al performed an in-vivo study that exposed mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of inflammation, at disruption may influence outcomes of a viral infection. The importance of Bmal1 in maintaining endogenous circadian oscillations was highlighted in Sengupta's study, where deletion of this gene caused circadian disruption among subjects under constant darkness, as compared to Bmal1-intact subjects whose endogenous regulation was maintained.1 Majumdar et al tested this theory by observing immune responses against RNA viruses in mice.9 In this study, Bmal1-/- mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had worse outcomes in response to infection compared to WT mice. RSV replication (as well as parainfluenza virus type 3) was also 5-10 times higher in Bmal1-/- human cells and mice, as compared to their wild-type counterparts. However, the effect on viral replication may not be directly related to antiviral activity; rather, it may be circadian influences on inflammatory responses that most impact viral replication. Circadian System Influences Viral Clearance Host responses to viral infections can vary from efficient to dysfunctional, where success is measured by the ability to clear an infection without surpassing host tolerance. While inflammation is required to effectively fight an infection, a balance between inflammation and host tolerance is necessary for proper recovery and effective mediators, such as chemokines, cytokines, their receptors, and adhesion molecules, exhibits daily rhythmic oscillations.5 In both humans and (nocturnal) rodents, lymphocytes are at their highest levels during the rest period, whereas natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic effector cells have been shown in both humans and animals to be at their highest during wakefulness.5 Interestingly, in humans, inflammatory cytokines have been observed to be at their highest during the night or in the early morning.5 Recent animal studies found that immune responses against infections are more efficient when animals are exposed to pathogens during their active phase, whereas the immune response to infection is less robust when the exposure takes place during the rest phase.6,8 In short, these findings suggest that the immune system may be primed to fight infections during the active phase (daytime for humans), but be less efficient during the rest phase (nighttime for humans). This evolutionary change may have resulted from the active phase being associated with increased risks, such as contracting infection through injury, consumption of contaminated food, and/or attack by another animal.8 Time of Infection Influences Survival The current literature supports the notion that the time of infection strongly influences survival outcomes of the host. Sengupta et al conducted an animal study in which the time of exposure was found to determine mortality and morbidity in response to influenza infection.1 Mice infected with influenza A virus towards the end of the rest phase had increased weight loss, more respiratory symptoms, and overall higher risk of mortality when compared to mice that were infected towards the end of the active phase. To ensure these outcomes were completely related to endogenous circadian rhythms and not the influence of light, the same experiment was performed under constant darkness. Despite this change, similar outcomes were observed.1 Another study, performed by Edgar et al, found that in wild-type (WT) mice infected at the onset of the resting phase with recombinant luciferase-expressing Murid Herpes Virus 4 (M3:luc MuHV- 4), viral replication was 10-fold higher compared to WT mice infected at the onset of the active phase.6 To confirm that their results were related to circadian patterns, they repeated the study in Bmal1-/- (knockout) mice. Bmal1 is a core clock protein encoded by the gene Bmal1 , which is integral for maintaining endogenous circadian patterns. Bmal1-/- mice did not exhibit differences in viral responses between being infected at the active vs rest phase; however, these mice exhibited higher levels of the MuHV-4 infection compared to both WT mice.6 Circadian Misalignment Impacts Infection Severity Using Bmal1-/- mice in these studies allows us to better understand how circadian TANYA LEE, ND The circadian system is a powerful regulatory system that guides the physiology of living organisms through synchronizing physiological processes to the external environment. This system of ultimate homeostatic regulation has evolved over time and gives organisms a competitive advantage by allowing them to predictably adapt to external fluctuations within physiological range.1 The 12-hour diurnal pattern, contained within a 24-hour cycle, directs specific physiological and metabolic processes to function during the circadian day (active phase) vs the circadian night (rest phase). In humans, the circadian system consists of a \"core oscillator\" located at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) within the hypothalamus. This core oscillator is considered the central pacemaker of our circadian system and is \"entrained\" by external factors called \"zeitgebers.\" Light is the principal zeitgeber of the master clock. Entrainment is the alignment of an organism's endogenous circadian rhythm to the rhythms of the external environment.2 This master clock entrains our \"peripheral clocks,\" the second component of the circadian system, which are located in almost all tissues in the human body.3,4 The circadian system is a major contributor to the health and well-being of humans. Ten-percent of our genome is under circadian control, with regulation occurring at both the transcriptional and post-translational level.2-4 Circadian misalignment, a term used to describe disruption in the endogenous patterns of our clocks, occurs when deliberate changes are made to our circadian daily patterns, typically unbeknownst to the person. Examples include social jetlag, frequently shifting time zones, and shift-work.1 Circadian misalignment is an independent risk factor for many inflammatory health conditions, including cancer, allergies, metabolic disease, cardiovascular risk, and depression.3,5 Shift-work, specifically, has also been found to be an independent risk factor for many chronic diseases, including diabetes.6 The fact that cardiovascular events and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can show diurnal variations in symptom severity indicates the potential impact of circadian rhythms on immune function.2 The understanding that immune function is at least partially directed by circadian rhythms has inspired researchers to investigate whether immune responses to viral infections may also be under circadian control. The purpose of this article is to explore the interactions between the circadian system and the immune system's response to viral infections. Circadian Influences on Immunity It has been found that peripheral immune cells contain functional clock-controlled genes and that disruption of circadian patterns can alter immune function.5,7 This has been demonstrated through the discovery that the expression of immune Docere Immune Response to Viruses How Sleep/Wake Cycles Impact Clinical Outcome The circadian system is a major contributor to the health and well-being of humans.

Continued research in this area will hopefully soon pave the way for human clinical trials that examine how naturopathic and herbal medicine approaches support the system through the course of viral infections to prevent negative outcomes, as opposed to just battling the pathology once damage has already occurred. responses to viral infections. While human studies corroborating these findings are severely lacking at this point, the findings from animal studies may be a helpful tool when supporting patients through viral infections using naturopathic methods. These concepts are already being applied clinically in conventional medicine. One unique area of study that best represents the clinical application of circadian patterns and immune responses is the timing of vaccine administration. Several studies have shown that morning vaccinations (ie, during the active phase for humans) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and seasonal influenza elicit more favorable innate and adaptive immune responses compared to vaccinations administered later in the day.11-13 Seasonality, a circadian pattern on a larger scale, has also been found to have a profound effect on immune activity. This is well represented in the seasonal influence on symptoms observed in a number of immune-related chronic health conditions, such as mental health disorders, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune diseases, as well as on susceptibility to infectious diseases.14 Simultaneous outbreaks of specific infectious agents in remote areas, as well as the persistence of these infections despite the absence of an epidemic spread, demonstrate the seasonal influence on viral infections.15 Understanding seasonal predictability has paved the way for the development of seasonal vaccinations, such as the widely implemented flu vaccine. These concepts are not completely novel in naturopathic and herbal medicine. Renowned herbalist David Hoffman quotes in his book Medical Herbalism ,16 The role of the human immune system is not simply to resist the dangers present in the environment. Rather, it is part of the complex and beautiful dance of elements flowing back and forth between the human body and the rest of the world. Seen within the context of ecology, both human and environmental immunity is about harmony. What better representation do we have of this observation than the strong interaction between the earth's 24-hour rotation and immune physiology? Herbalists appear to have been treating patients based on these concepts for many years.17 In herbal medicine, it is common to support patients during an infection by encouraging the immune system to work to fight an active infection during the active phase using herbs that provide strong antiviral and diaphoretic actions. The goal is to encourage the efficiency of the fever to peak and then to break before the rest phase so that the patient can recover during the anti-inflammatory circadian night. And if the findings from the animal studies discussed in this article are applicable to humans, this approach would be important, as induction of inflammation during the rest phase (instead of the active phase) is linked to excessive inflammatory responses and poorer outcomes during infections. One might consider that melatonin may play a key part in our immune response to viral infections during the circadian night. Melatonin, a circadian hormone secreted during the rest phase, is known for its anti-inflammatory action and has been found to be helpful in suggesting that CLOCK is required for NF-B-induced inflammation. It was also found that CLOCK-induced NF-B- mediated transcriptional activation is independent of its dimerization with core clock partner BMAL1; however, BMAL1 may suppress CLOCK-p65 NF-B induced transcription of inflammatory genes. We can conclude from these findings that CLOCK and BMAL1 influence immune responses in an independent as well as an interdependent manner.10 Clinical Applications & Conclusions The findings from the animal studies outlined in this article suggest that contracting infections during the active phase can improve the efficiency of immune responses, and that circadian disruption negatively alters immune 2 different times of day: midway through their rest phase, and midway through their active phase.10 Not surprisingly, mice challenged during their active phase had better tolerance of LPS-induced acute inflammation compared to mice challenged during their rest phase. These responses were observed to be mediated through transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B), as NF-B-dependent inflammatory gene expression was higher during the rest phase compared to the active phase.10 How the circadian system is involved in this response is based on the interaction between CLOCK and the p65 subunit of NF-B, as this complex binds and activates the promoters and therefore the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory proteins. Spengler's study also found that NF-B responses are diminished in the absence of CLOCK, MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct? Address correct? Phone # correct?

Remembering Who We Are Those who choose Primary Care quickly find themselves drowning in the same model that has failed the medical doctors. Reimbursement is scarce, \"fishing\" labs are not reimbursed, and patients are more likely to come in for acute visits than preventive. Changing medicine has not generally yielded much recognition or wealth, but it honors the unique commitment we made when we took up this training. We have to commit the time and effort required to build a wall of data that will push policy toward prevention and protection of our patient base. Our field's birthright is a prevention-centered model of primary care, assuming we are focused, organized, and collaborative enough to claim it. trend towards prevention. As our place in the spectrum of healthcare expands, it's our moral imperative to remember that our foundation is staked in a toxin-free world.2,3 Medicine needs our voice, to encourage policy, screening, and treatment that consider each person as a whole member of the larger world. The correlation between autoimmune disease and environmental toxicity has been established.4-6 High levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals are associated with some of the most prevalent and costly conditions, including obesity,7 diabetes,8 cancer,9 and autoimmune disease.10 Furthermore, these effects have been demonstrated to impact future generations. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNiPs) we so thoroughly examine are not bedrock to the human genome, but rather genetic receipts from the pressure that generations of Silent Springs have put on us.11 The hypothetical challenges of a person's metabolic pathways are not enough to move the needle for medicine, and it's lazy. We need to know what the risks are to the people we are treating, based on their location, the environmental load associated with the geography of their ancestry, and their occupations. And we need to be measuring the real-time load on our patient base. The Importance of Tracking Today, we have environmental medicine doctors that biomonitor their patients. We need to surpass this specialty model if we are to continue serving as the moral conscience of medicine. In the same way that beating the drum of gut health over decades eventually resounded in the halls of conventional medicine with the sexy new title of \"SIBO,\" it's time to move assessment of environmental toxicity from the recesses of IV rooms and sweat lodges to the shiny waiting room of primary care. Counting this load should be part of the annual \"well visit.\" The urgency of this is augmented by the rolling-back of environmental protections under the Trump administration.12 Rather than waiting to see an increase in autoimmune disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases known to be exacerbated by environmental chemicals, we need to be monitoring patients for them now and working to prevent this increase in pathology. Correlating body burden to disease prevention is not easy.13,14 Currently, the only toxic agent that is routinely tracked in primary care is lead, and only routinely in infants. It is worth not only adding routine BPA, pesticide, phthalate, solvent, and heavy metal testing15 to your annual patient \"well visits,\" but also creating a method for tracking this data within your practice. Accumulating trends data that correlate conditions to triggering events will not stand alone as proof of causation, but it could help inform research agendas for our field. With the imminent challenge of predicting who will have long-lasting symptoms from COVID-19, it will be interesting to track correlations between the incidence of lasting symptoms or the triggering of autoimmune disease with student budgets. We naturopathic doctors are likely continuing to live those lives, but I wonder if we do enough to quantify its preventative value for our patient base. The value of functional medicine is moot if we note its nuance as genetic finites without stepping back and identifying the epigenetic pressure that caused the variation. Prevention-Centered Medicine The use of naturopathic medicine has expanded, and acceptance by conventional medicine has increased.1 It is a full schedule to treat patients diagnosed with conditions that have limited conventional treatment options - autoimmune disease, allergies, and cancer being chief among them. But it denigrates the full power of our medicine to simply identify the triggering event without also pushing the KERI LAYTON, ND Every generation of naturopathic doctors decries the rising generation as an erosion of true naturopathy.

The research clearly indicates the need for more examination into taking a multipronged approach to autoimmunity that encompasses mitochondrial support as well as overall inflammatory support. References 12-23 available online at ndnr.comresponse to self-antigens, increased production of autoantibodies, and oxidative stress with multiple-tissue injury.12 Recent research has demonstrated an accumulation of endogenous DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from autoimmune patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis.12 This accumulation of DNA damage was related to amplified DNA damage (partly due to induced oxidative stress), and epigenetically regulated abnormalities in DNA repair mechanisms.12 This aligns with similar studies that found extracellular and/or oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune patients.13-16 In an experimental mouse model of autoimmune encephalitis, researchers found Treg cell dysfunction with a prominent oxygen species signature.13 Treg mtROS weakens lysosomal induces a DDR, and promotes cell death in Treg cells. DDR was reversed and Treg cell death was prevented by scavenging of mtROS in the Treg cells; Th1 and Th12 autoimmune responses were also attenuated.13 Targeted Treatments This recent research has profound implications for the naturopathic treatment of autoimmune conditions. If autoimmune reactions are dictated by the efficacy of Treg cells, which is critically impacted by mitochondrial health, then addressing the inflammatory status of the body to mitigate mitochondrial damage and DAMPs should favorably impact Treg cell function and prove to be an important piece in the treatment of autoimmunity. Extensive research has been done into the effect of antioxidants and natural supplements to help mitigate mitochondrial damage and improve mitochondrial function.17 Alpha-lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant, redox transcription regulator, and anti- inflammatory agent.18 It is an essential cofactor in mitochondrial -keto acid dehydrogenases, thus is a key player in oxidative-decarboxylation reactions in the mitochondria. Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction.19 L-carnitine is critical for the transport of fatty acids into the matrix of the mitochondria, thus supports mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.18 NADH acts as a cellular redox cofactor in more than 200 cellular redox reactions and also serves as a substrate for multiple enzymes. NADH precursors as well as oral, stabilized NADH have been used therapeutically in chronic fatigue and various neurological disorders.18 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a critical cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). While CoQ10 is a potent antioxidant in its reduced form and can influencing gene expression in metabolism, cell signaling, and transport, its primary role lies in the transfer of electrons in the ETC.18 Research has found all 3 of these compounds to be helpful in the treatment of mitochondrial proto-eukaryotic cells sometime within our evolution as humans, mitochondria have a profound effect on our health.8 They are small organelles within the cell and are responsible for cellular respiration and energy production. Recent research also highlights the mitochondria's vital role in the immune system.9 Once immune cells are activated, mitochondria become essential for their function in the body. Our innate immune cells distinguish microbe-specific structures or microbial molecules like pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or flagellin (the main protein constituent of bacterial flagella).10 They also recognize cell-derived molecules from our own damaged cells, such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS).9 One of our DAMPs is mitochondrial DNA that is released in response to damage. Our innate immune cells have specific receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) - toll-like receptors being one example - to detect PAMPs and DAMPs.9 During an infection or trauma, mitochondria release DAMPs that resemble structures of bacteria-derived PAMPs.9 Mitochondrial DNA with hypomethylated CpG motifs and cardiolipin are 2 examples of mitochondrial DAMPs. These DAMPs released from the mitochondrion signal the immune system to ramp up the inflammatory response to infection.9 One way they do this is by increasing the reaction of antigen-specific T-cells during infection.11 Mitochondrial metabolites are essential for the activation of this adaptive immune T-cell response during infection; however, when those mitochondrial DAMPs persist, or emerge from other triggers such as toxins and stress, it does not bode well for the progression or severity of autoimmune disease. Recent research has revealed consistent metabolic alterations of Treg cells during autoimmunity. Increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and a robust DNA damage response (DDR) associated with cell death occur in Tregs in individuals with autoimmunity.12 The DDR is a complex system that recognizes and repairs DNA damage, while responding to immune threats, by acting together to increase cellular defense. Autoimmunity modifies this DDR system with an atypical immune CATHERINE CLINTON, ND Autoimmune conditions have risen dramatically over the last 25 years. In the United States, there are an estimated 23 million people with over 100 different kinds of autoimmune diseases.1,2 Autoimmune disorders have a multitude of causes, affecting a host of different organs in the body. As naturopathic physicians, we offer a unique set of skills and modalities to treat autoimmune conditions, and we address areas of health that pharmaceuticals cannot. An important consideration, when assessing and treating a patient's autoimmune disease naturopathically, is the patient's mitochondrial function. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune system hyperresponsiveness to the body's own tissues. While autoimmune diseases differ in terms of the predominant immune responses within the Th1, Th2, and Th17 branches of the immune system, they all rely on T-regulatory (Treg) cells to manage this inflammatory response.3 Treg cells serve as moderators of the immune system, squelching inflammatory responses throughout the body. They are formed in the gut and are potent immune system modulators. Our immune systems are made up of the innate and adaptive branches. While Treg cells were originally thought to act on just the adaptive immune system, recent research demonstrates that Treg cells have a role in the innate immune system as well.4,5 Tregs contain widespread inflammation by redirecting antigen-presenting cell maturation and function, destroying target cells, altering metabolic pathways, and producing anti-inflammatory cytokines.6 Ample research has shown an association between dysfunctional Treg cell function and autoimmune responses.7 Treg cells are paramount in the induction of self- tolerance, the very process that becomes dysfunctional in autoimmunity. As we'll soon see, our mitochondria play a vital role in the function of Treg cells and the progression of autoimmune diseases. Role of Mitochondria in Autoimmunity Mitochondria are traditionally thought of as the power houses of the cell.

SNPs in genes for DAO, MAOA/ MAOB, NAT2, HNMT, or MTHFR can be related to allergy symptoms, as all of these are enzymes that are involved in histamine metabolism.12 Histamine intolerance, which is also referred to as histaminosis, involves impaired metabolism of histamine.12 The biochemical pathways for histamine detoxification require several vitamin and mineral cofactors, including vitamins B1, B2, B3, folate, copper, magnesium, and zinc.13 Conclusion There can be 1 or many underlying causes of allergy symptoms in a patient. Doing a thorough evaluation to identify the cause, and then helping the patient eliminate it, will create a healthier immune system that is also now balanced. As naturopathic physicians, seeing beyond the label of the dis-ease, and finding the root cause(s) of the patient's imbalance most often proves to have the greatest benefit. Method of checking food intolerances. This is a bioelectric dermal screening, and the results include foods or food combinations that, when eaten, cause higher levels of toxemia.8 NSAIDs Other causes of leaky gut include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Mucosal damage that increases gut permeability occurs in 60-70% of people using the medication on a regular basis.5 I find that as little as a monthly NSAID for a headache or menstrual cramps is enough to cause a problem. NSAID use has been shown to enhance food allergy reactions9 and would likely contribute to higher body histamine levels. The endotoxemia caused by leaky gut also promotes liver inflammation.5 Environmental Toxins Occasionally, I have to look at the role of heavy metals or other environmental toxins in patients' immune dysregulation. Heavy metals are known to be immune system disruptors. For example, prenatal and early postnatal exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury are reported to produce a Th2 bias, which enhances the production of IgE antibodies and Th2 cytokines.10 Environmental chemical exposure can also disrupt the Th1 and Th2 balance and result in dramatically increased cytokine production.10 Fetal exposure to pesticides has been shown to be associated with allergies and hay fever in later life, especially in males.11 In my practice, I use post-DMSA challenge testing for heavy metals, and urine metabolite testing for environmental toxins. Detoxification protocols vary greatly, but often involve removing toxins from the body with methods such as heavy metal chelation, far infrared sauna, colonic hydrotherapy, and liposomal glutathione, duration 6 months to a year, and then retesting until their removal is confirmed. Of course, finding the source of the toxins and removing it can be challenging; however, this factor is vitally important. As a side note, while helping my patients with detoxification, I often recommend colonic hydrotherapy. Over the years, I have had several such patients report a noticeable decrease in their seasonal allergy symptoms. This makes sense, given that colonic hydrotherapy ultimately supports a \"dumping\" of toxins from the liver. My own understanding is that when the colon is empty, the body deems it safe to release more toxins. When the colon is sluggish, one might assume that the body would not want to release toxins, as they could be harmful and also get reabsorbed through enterohepatic recirculation. I now look for signs of sluggish bowels in allergy patients and recommend colonics even if environmental toxicity is not a key factor. Genetics & Histamine Detox Another important area to investigate is genetics. Two doctors who have published a substantial amount of information on this subject are Dr Paul Anderson and Dr Ben Liver Burden & GI Imbalances Another common underlying cause of allergy symptoms is liver burden. This can be secondary to factors such as gastrointestinal dysbiosis or inflammation, functional issues due to inborn single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), environmental toxicity, or lack of critical cofactors for proper hepatic function. In terms of gastrointestinal health, we are looking at many potential contributing factors, including the resident microorganisms. Optimal dosing of probiotics has been shown to inhibit immune responses in the gut.4 Levels of beneficial bacteria are often inversely proportional to pathogenic bacteria or yeast. The overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria can result in higher levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide), which in turn can increase intestinal permeability (aka leaky gut).5 An abnormally porous intestinal lining promotes the development of food sensitivities by allowing food antigens to breach the intestinal mucosa; Consequently, histamine levels increase and allergy symptoms result.6 Candida overgrowth also contributes to leaky gut, toxins in the blood, and liver burden by stimulating interleukin (IL)-9 and mast cells.7 Food Allergy Testing This is a good place to mention my argument with IgG food antibody testing. The \"allergenic\" foods, although possibly contributing to the body burden of histamine, are not the root cause of the problem. The testing may be useful to help diagnose leaky gut (a large number of positives on the test should arouse suspicion). Also, I've found that avoiding the \"positive\" foods on the panel may or may not alleviate patients' allergy symptoms, regardless of their antibody levels. This tells me that other underlying causes are at play and that we should be doing a thorough investigation in our goal of healing the patient. Regarding IgE testing, because of the potentially life- threatening effects of consuming potent allergens, I recommend avoiding the food(s) if the level is very high. I am an advocate of the O.G. Carroll WENDY WELLS, NMD When I see a patient who has allergy symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, and watery and itchy eyes, I consider all of the possible factors that laid the foundation for their symptoms. The underlying causes can include 1 or more conditions in the body that make histamine levels high enough to cause symptoms of allergy. The primary causes I have found in my patients include cortisol insufficiency (or adrenal fatigue), an over-burdened liver and/or genetic variations that impede the detoxification of histamine, poor gastrointestinal health, food intolerances, environmental chemical burden, and dietary and lifestyle factors. Causes of Allergy Symptoms Adrenal Insufficiency Cortisol insufficiency is a common condition among patients with a history of stress, trauma, or excessive exercise. Their symptoms may or may not include fatigue, blood sugar drops after eating carbohydrates, dizziness upon standing, brain fog, low mood or motivation, anxiety, and a tendency toward overwhelm and/or startle. There is evidence suggesting that endogenous cortisol is an important regulator of allergic disease and allergic inflammation.1 It is interesting to note that 2 patients of mine with chronic nasal congestion but no known allergies or other allergy symptoms were both found to have adrenal insufficiency. Both patients' symptoms resolved with adrenal glandular treatment over 6 months, and stayed resolved after withdrawal of treatment. Besides mediating histamine release and inflammatory responses, cortisol is known to enhance the activity of epinephrine in the vasoconstriction of nasal passages.2 Saliva cortisol testing is a valid way to check for cortisol imbalances. A salivary panel offers the advantage of providing a free cortisol level as well as a 4-times-per- day sampling via a convenient at-home test kit.3 I have found that cortisol replacement can help tremendously in those patients found to have low levels.Tolle Causam Allergy Symptoms Eliminate the Cause Wendy Wells, NMD, is a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the Arizona Board of Naturopathic Medical Association.

Because the well-characterized probiotic species Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are often both found at lower concentrations in eczema,19,20 the potential benefits of probiotic supplementation for prevention and treatment have been evaluated. But the results are mixed. A 2017 review and meta-analysis21 offers a glimpse into the heterogeneity of probiotic performance in atopic dermatitis (Table 1, online). Although not exhaustive, differences in study design, populations, and intervention (strains, formulations, doses) contribute to the variability of outcomes.is in itself positively correlated with the development of atopic dermatitis and asthma.6 Support for the Developing Microbiome It is clear that the microbiome profile of children suffering from atopic dermatitis is distinctive compared to their healthy counterparts.18 This has led researchers to investigate the impact of the largest surface in the human body where microbes and their products interact with the immune system: the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The primary proposed probiotic mechanisms of action focus on the ability Vaginal birth is associated with enrichment of Bacteriodes and Bifodobacterium species in the early weeks of life, whereas infants born by C-section are primarily exposed to bacteria from the mother's skin (eg, Staphylococcus spp).17 Although lack of Bacteriodes and Bifidobacterium is associated with the development of allergy and atopy, breastfeeding can help mitigate these risks. In fact, from 13 weeks, diet becomes the most important factor influencing infant microbiome development.6 Given our cultural trends toward shorter-term breastfeeding, it is important to note that premature cessation is also linked with an increase in Lachnospiraceae species, which JACLYN CHASSE-SMEATON, ND Atopic dermatitis (AD) dramatically impacts pediatric health and quality of life of the family as a whole. Although the pathogenesis of AD has not been clearly elucidated, there are multiple factors at play, including genetic predisposition, environment, defects in innate and adaptive immune response, epidermal dysfunction, and the developing microbiota.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Allergy Organization, the prevalence of both food (~5%) and respiratory (~17%) childhood allergies in the United States has increased in recent years.2,3 But none so much as atopic dermatitis, which is currently estimated to affect up to 30% of American children (or approximately 10 million), one-third of whom experience significant symptom severity and prolonged course of disease.4,5 This article will review risk factors, the role of the maternal and infant microbiome, and the potential for therapeutic probiotics in the prevention and management of childhood eczema. Atopic Dermatitis: Early-Life Risk Factors Mode of delivery Cesarean-section birth rates have tripled since 1990 and show no sign of abating. Studies have shown that C-section-delivered children harbor less Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, but more Clostridia, E coli, and S aureus compared to children delivered vaginally. They are also more likely to develop immune disorders, including asthma and allergies.6,7 Breastfeeding Breast milk influences microbiota diversity, gut barrier function, and oral tolerance induction. Although 84% of US mothers begin breastfeeding, nearly 20% supplement with formula by day 2, and only 58% of US babies are breastfeeding at 6 months of age.8 Antibiotic exposure Perinatal broad-spectrum antibiotic use has become common in modern obstetric/neonatal practice. But there is increased evidence that links early-life antibiotic exposure with inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity, and immune-modulated disease.9 Infant Immune & Microbiome Development: Maternal Influence The gestational microbiome is distinct from non-pregnancy and evolves during the course of gestation, adapting for fetal tolerance. Regulatory T-cell (Treg) levels increase during pregnancy, with a shift away from Th1 and toward Th2 helper cells.10,11 At the same time, cross-placental antibodies and growth factors instruct the developing infant immune system. Various studies have suggested that the reduction in Th1 may be a significant causative factor in the development of allergic disease.12-14 More recent hypotheses, however, assign it a lesser importance in atopy. Rather, diversity of microbe exposure appears to be more instrumental. And, despite the fact that commensal maternal microbes begin to migrate across the placenta in the last trimester to help seed the infant microbiome,15 it is the mode of birth that has the greatest initial impact on infant microbiome development.16 Tolle Totum Atopy & the Microbiome MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

Summary In summary, select probiotic strains and formulations offer promise in the prevention and amelioration of atopic dermatitis; however, not all strains or available probiotic formulations will perform at similar levels of efficacy. Digging deep is the route to confidence. Caveat emptor: Always understand the quality of evidence behind your recommendations. Table and references 14-27 available online at ndnr.comendotoxins, including lipopolysaccharides. However, microbes also play a direct role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune response through intestinal barrier integrity (which is impaired in AD children23), and the short-chain fatty lymphocyte functions.24 In the case of AD, specifically, the ability to downregulate Th2 cytokine production and induce regulatory T-cell cytokines also plays a role.25 Yet, these capabilities are highly strain-specific. It is therefore incumbent on probiotic formulation developers and manufacturers to identify the right players, in the right combination, to ensure the highest probability of efficacy. Synergistic Performance Beyond the individual strain components, the performance of a final, indication- targeted probiotic formulation is only clearly demonstrated through data. Niers et al offered a unique view into the efficacy of a An earlier meta-analysis found slightly more positive findings: In one subgroup, in particular, prenatal probiotic administration, followed by continued postnatal supplementation, was more protective than postnatal probiotic supplementation alone.22 Although promising, these reviews do not offer robust evidence of the efficacy of general probiotic supplementation in the prevention and resolution of atopy. Alternatively, these studies emphasize the importance of selective strain identification (validated immune-modulatory effects) and demonstrated efficacy of specific final formulations and dosing regimen.

Lastly, it bears repeating that we as naturopathic doctors are in the business of prevention. While we will always respond to disease as it appears, ensuring that our patients understand the impact of preventive treatments becomes just as important as treating the disease itself! opted for a modified annual Panchakarma detoxification treatment, to serve as a preventative. This is particularly important, since this is how Panchakarma is meant to be used. While Panchakarma treatments can do heroic things at times, it works even better when it is part of maintaining health, versus reacting to disease. I have seen the patient annually for 7 years now, and she remains well. The Power of Our Medicine No matter how many times I see it, the power of both naturopathic and Ayurvedic medicine will never cease to amaze me. So many times we watch our patients heal themselves with natural therapies that are all too often overlooked or ignored, despite the fact that they do not even interfere with drug treatments. The only interference, you could say, is that they often cause the drug to not be needed. It is important to point out the effectiveness of herbal medicine when treating complex diseases, as well as the critical role diet plays in the foundations of health. In addition, using herbs that support not just the body, but also the mind, proved essential for this case. When there is sadness, or a lack to her organs, a 10-week Panchakarma regimen was prescribed. Panchakarma is an Ayurvedic detoxification program that systematically removes toxic burdens from both the body and mind in a slow and gradual manner in order to avoid damaging the body. For every patient, the treatment is individualized based on their presentation and workup. In the case of this patient, dietary recommendations were made, including the removal of gluten and adherence to a predominately vegetarian diet that would include no less than 7 servings of vegetables and 3 servings of fruit per day. A small amount of cold-water fish was also permitted. In addition, several herbs were employed, listed in Table 1 with a simplified explanation for their use. The overall therapeutic principles included focused support for the liver and kidneys, modulation of the immune system, cooling the body off (as she has inflammation throughout her body), and healing the skin, since this was the patient's chief complaint. Follow-up Visits Ten Weeks After the 10-week Panchakarma detoxification protocol, the patient returned to the office. She reported that she had been following the diet as prescribed and maintaining her herbal protocol. She stated that her energy was back and she felt stronger. Additionally, the skin of her face had decreased in its severely red presentation and lacked the tightness that had been apparent at her initial visit. Additionally, her labs had begun to improve. As this was after the detoxification protocol, this was expected. Now we would move into treatment phase 2: allowing the body to heal itself. The patient was told to continue on the herbs and diet, but to no longer use Panchakarma detoxification protocols such as therapeutic sweating and fasting. Three Months At her 3-month follow-up, BK reported a marked improvement in all symptoms. Additionally, she was no longer requiring steroids to manage pain. Her lab results had also returned to normal values on all fronts. The most remarkable finding was that she no longer had any signs of inflammation on her face, and her skin had returned to looking like the photo she had wept for in our first encounter. At this point, she decided she would continue on the mostly vegetarian diet indefinitely, which I agreed would only serve her health. Her herbal regimen remained the same, except with all doses cut in half, to continue supporting the body as it continued to heal itself. One Year & Beyond I saw BK 1 year after her initial visit. Her progress had remained, with no flare-ups or changes to her skin condition. At this point the patient was considered stable and in remission of her SLE. While it is known that there is no cure for SLE, this patient's outcome could be considered as close as it gets to cure. Additionally, the patient VIRENDER SODHI, ND, MD (AYURVEDA) BK, a 32-year-old female at the time, presented to my office with a previously established diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had been diagnosed 2+ years prior by her physician, at which point she began the standard of care for her condition: steroid drugs and the immunosuppressive drug azathioprine. One of the patient's chief concerns was skin changes that were becoming disfiguring and causing deep psychological trauma. Through tears, the patient provided photos of her appearance at the onset of her diagnosis through to the present, which showed a marked change. Furthermore, the patient was unaware that azathioprine itself has a side effect, among many, of causing increased sun sensitivity and its own rash.1 As a result of her worsening condition, the patient had \"decided to try\" this naturopathic and Ayurvedic doctor's approach. I had treated this condition successfully in the past, but had never seen such severe skin reactions within the spectrum of skin changes that are part of the pathophysiology of SLE. I knew, at its base, this was a matter of detoxification and to provide an invitation for the body to heal itself. I was also well versed in Ayurvedic treatments that would harmonize both her mind and her body. In Ayurveda, all illnesses, let alone severe ones, must always contain a component that heals the mind. Given what we know now about the plethora of ways stress exacerbates autoimmune conditions, treatments for the mind should be considered by any physician treating any autoimmune condition. Symptoms & History At the first visit, BK's symptoms included the classic butterfly rash, with erythema all over her face and also her neck. Additionally, the skin around her lips and eyes, and also on her fingertips, had begun to tighten in a style not unlike scleroderma. It is known that a great deal of crossover symptoms can occur between these 2 conditions, though such severity is rare.2 She also suffered from fatigue, malaise, bloating after every meal, mouth sores, and heart palpitations. Her initial workup revealed not only the expected ENA-positive status that hallmarks lupus, but also elevated liver enzymes, with AST at 123 IU/L (reference: 0-40 IU/L) and ALT at 97 was also 1.8 BUN was 56 mg/dL (reference: 6-24 mg/dL). This demonstrated that, internally, her body was simply not handling the disease or the medications used to treat it. Lastly, food sensitivity testing was conducted, and a variety of food sensitivities were identified. Chief among them was gluten.

This article focuses treatment on immunotherapy, as it is expected that naturopathic doctors have proficiency in addressing the modifiable factors listed below. Treatment Considerations The Allergic Load Choosing the appropriate treatment of allergy requires understanding modifiable and nonmodifiable factors contributing to inflammatory burden.14 Nonmodifiable factors include genetic predisposition. Modifiable factors may influence allergy directly (environmental exposures) or indirectly (biome, food sensitivity, nutrition, hormones, stress, and exposure to environmental chemicals), and collectively constitute \"allergic load.\"14 My approach to allergy and atopic disease includes taking a detailed history and developing clinical suspicion regarding important allergens, individually assessing relevant modifiable factors suspected to be driving inflammation (the allergic load), avoidance of known triggers,7 and most often by treating allergy directly using immunotherapy. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a disease-modifying treatment that consists of strategic disordered breathing, and others - must be considered as well. The total annual US health care costs associated with diagnosed and treated allergy, eczema, and asthma approach and likely exceed $100 billion. These conditions cause significant morbidity among sufferers.8-11 Allergy-related illness is responsible for 3.5 million and 2 million lost work days and school days, respectively, in the United States each year.12 These trends are expected to accelerate due to the impact of human-driven climate change, which is the driving factor behind consistently increasing pollen counts (21% increase from 1990 to 2020) and a longer high- pollen season (20 additional days in 2020 compared to 1990); it has also led to increasing allergic sensitization and allergy and asthma expression among all age groups.13 The significant debility and cost of care, along with environmental factors driving reactivity, underscore the significance of allergy and allergic disease, as well as the need for targeted therapies to reduce the overall burden and suffering of allergic disease. It is important that naturopathic doctors understand the tools available to treat, rather than palliate, allergy. Addressing underlying causes of inflammation ( Tolle causam ) helps to prevent acceleration of immune reactivity as well as the development of involving multiple cell types, with the resultant inflammation dominated by Th2-driven IgE antibodies, eosinophils, and mast cells.4-6 Reactivity is induced by environmental exposures and is strongly genetically determined, with a 30% or 80% increased prevalence in children of 1 or 2 affected parents, respectively.7 Significance of Environmental Allergy To fully appreciate the significance of allergic disease, the burden of conditions associated with allergy - such as asthma (for which 75% cases have an allergic trigger), chronic ND, MPH Allergy is a leading chronic health condition throughout the world and is especially prevalent in westernized societies. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in the US population is 7-8% for all ages.1,2 Allergy accounts for upwards of $20 billion per year in healthcare expenses in the United States alone,3 leading world expenditures for this condition.

Typically, immunotherapy treatment does have durability of effect, and patients will notice improvements in allergy symptoms for months to years after discontinuing treatment. Again, addressing relevant elements of the allergic load is important in patients in whom non-allergic sources of inflammation are suspected, in patients for whom immunotherapy has been incompletely helpful, or if treatment response has plateaued. Importantly, immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment available that addresses the underlying genetic predisposition towards allergy by shifting immune deviation towards tolerance of specific triggering allergens. This, in addition to basic lifestyle and personal care controls, can have profound effects on quality of life and can decrease inflammatory burden as well as the burden of associated conditions. References 16-18 available online at ndnr.comgamma (IFN) and interleukin-10 expression lead to induction of tolerance by na\u00efve T cells, deviation from Th2 towards Th1, and/or apoptosis of Th2 cells specific to antigen triggers.6,15-18 The outcomes of consistent, long-term administration include decreased eosinophil activation and IgE production upon exposure to seasonal allergens, persistent increase in blocking IgG4 antibody activity, and likely prevention of new sensitization. Arguably, this is the most direct root-cause allergy treatment available. Risks inherent to any type of immunotherapy include anaphylaxis and local reactions such as oral swelling reactions, mouth and throat itching, and increased allergy symptoms. For these reasons, it is important to work with someone specifically trained in immunotherapy administration as well as knowledgeable in risk assessment and dose adjustment. Treatment Course A typical course of sublingual immunotherapy using allergy drops lasts 2 or more years, with steady improvements and symptom reduction noted over time. The duration of the therapy is key, due to the fact that desensitization results from consistent immune priming. Time to improvement is variable. Some patients may note immediate improvement in symptoms, while others will continue with treatment for multiple years or with consistent use throughout their lives. Treating pre-seasonally, starting 3 months prior to onset of the most problematic season, is an option for patients who have introduction of a known allergen in order to induce tolerance. Immunotherapy for inhalant allergy, specifically, can be in the form of sublingual immunotherapy drops (referred to as \"allergy immunotherapy (\"allergy shots\"), and sublingual immunotherapy tablets developed by pharmaceutical companies. Allergy drops and allergy shots offer the benefit of treating multiple allergens simultaneously, whereas sublingual immunotherapy tablets treat only 1 or 2 allergens (eg, dust, grass). To date, allergy drops are the safest and most convenient form of immunotherapy for inhalant allergies, when compared to allergy shots and tablets. It's a common recommendation to transition to allergy drops if allergy shots were not tolerated, or if a patient experienced systemic side effects, including anaphylaxis. Sublingual Immunotherapy Mechanism of Action Sublingual immunotherapy consists of the introduction of known allergens to the mucosal tissues of the mouth. Because the oral cavity is generally predisposed towards tolerance, this route is utilized for its favorable immunological environment. Following introduction, antigens are processed by antigen-presenting dendritic cells of the superficial mucosal tissues, thereby avoiding the Th2 inflammation- inducing eosinophils and mast cells of the submucosal tissues.6 Following capture, antigens are brought to cervical draining lymph nodes, resulting in a tolerogenic immune profile specific to the antigens introduced.15 Specifically, interferon-Tolle Causam MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

For example, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection is linked to autoimmune diabetes,20 and Epstein-Barr virus is linked to Graves' disease, MS, and SLE.21 Immune support in autoimmune patients, in order to eliminate the viral trigger, can be effective in eliciting improvement. Additionally, balanced levels of NO can defend against viral and bacterial invaders.22 On the other hand, insufficient NO production can lead to serious and potentially fatal infections.22 In autoimmune diabetes, NO produced in pancreatic beta cells suppresses EMCV replication and the beta-cell lysis caused by EMCV.20 NO therefore exhibits protective actions against EMCV infection in beta cells.20 Consequently, maintaining NO homeostasis in the form of a nitrate-rich supplement may have beneficial effects in this arena. Hormonal Regulation in Autoimmunity Addressing hormonal imbalances is a good example of going after a potential trigger of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in women, with 85% or more autoimmune patients being female.1,23 This predisposition is likely due to their stronger immune response compared with men, as well as the influence of estrogen on autoimmune disorders.24 In this population, alterations in hormones during menopause can impact inflammatory processes, which leads to increased vulnerability to autoimmune diseases among women undergoing peri- or postmenopause. At the age of 50, women's neutrophil percentage declines while lymphocyte percentage increases, which leads to increased risk of lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease in the perimenopausal years.25 Autoimmune diseases that develop in or near menopause usually have a more chronic disease course and fibrotic Th- mediated pathology.26 Often, autoimmune diseases that develop during older age are associated with an age-related increase in autoantibodies.26 Conversely, autoimmune diseases such as MS and RA improve during postmenopause.26 During menopause, alterations in sex hormones can change innate immune phenotypes via epigenetic remodeling.24 Balancing hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be beneficial. DHEA levels fall progressively, at the rate of 2% per year.27 Supplementation with DHEA is especially beneficial in autoimmune disorders like SLE.27 A study of 41 female patients with SLE found that 20-30 mg/day DHEA improved mental well-being and sexuality scores.28 However, it was also associated with a decrease in HDL-cholesterol.28 Supporting healthy estrogen levels is also important, as estrogen upregulates NO (eNOS).11,12 When eNOS is uncoupled, it superoxide anion instead of NO.11,12 The superoxide anion can also react with existing NO to produce a harmful free radical known as peroxynitrite.11,12 This reduces the bioavailability of endothelial NO, resulting in endothelial dysfunction.11,12 This diminished endothelial NO bioavailability is thought to explain why in rodent models of RA, plasma nitrite concentrations are reduced.12 Additionally, RA patients have relatively high circulating levels of methylated arginine asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which significantly suppresses the activity of eNOS.13 By lowering levels of eNOS, ADMA is thought to be involved in the increased endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis observed in RA patients.13 Indeed, healthy levels of endothelial NO have been shown to protect the cardiovascular system of autoimmune patients. This group of patients often exhibits increased cardiovascular risk factors.14 For example, there is an increased prevalence of hypertension in patients with SLE, psoriasis, RA, systemic sclerosis, and periodontitis compared to controls.14 It is important to note, however, that some researchers have suggested that NO from iNOS could be beneficial for the control of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Th2-mediated allergic asthma by inducing S-nitrosylation of transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, apoptosis mediators, and cytoskeletal proteins.15 Consequently, iNOS is not always the villain. Another connection between impaired cardiovascular function and autoimmune disease is the increased prevalence of arterial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular disease risk in RA patients.16 Furthermore, dietary nitrates in the form of increased daily vegetable consumption are associated with better arterial function in RA patients compared to those who consumed fewer vegetables daily.16 This enhanced arterial health was thought to be due to the nitrate derived from vegetable consumption. Nitrate is converted to NO in the body. However, in clinical practice, optimally augmenting NO often takes more than merely increasing veggie intake; this is why supplementation is routinely pursued. Ultimately, it is not NO per se that is of concern to autoimmune patients, but rather misdirected NOS pathways. NO itself is not the enemy. In fact, it is critical to cardiovascular support in autoimmune disorders. This is why it is important to utilize nitric oxide test strips to evaluate NO levels in autoimmune patients, so we can test rather than guess their actual need for NO. We should be addressing the drivers of misdirected iNOS rather than hyperfocusing on avoiding substrates for NO such as beets, kale, watermelon, arugula, bok choy, spinach, cabbage, Swiss chard, etc. Unless these foods are immunologically problematic for patients (more on this later in the article), using them along with a nitrate-rich supplement that includes beetroot to mitochondrial DNA may elicit changes in cellular functions that point immune cells toward an inflammatory phenotype.4,5 Further evidence of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in autoimmune diseases is the presence of a deficiency of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I in Hashimoto's thyroiditis.6 Mitochondrial complexes I and IV may also be altered in RA.5 The inability of the body to effectively eliminate damaged mitochondria plays an important role in impaired autoimmunity.3 Supporting mitochondrial health is therefore critical in autoimmune patients. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a mitochondrial rejuvenator that can be helpful in promoting autoimmune health by supporting mitochondrial function. For example, in a randomized, double-blind study of 54 RA patients given either 100 mg/day CoQ10 or a placebo for 2 months, CoQ10 supplementation led to reductions in serum enzyme that degrades collagen.7 Furthermore, CoQ10 improved clinical outcomes, such as pain, swollen and tender joints, and reduced disease severity. CoQ10 has also had beneficial effects in other autoimmune diseases, such as antiphospholipid syndrome,8 psoriasis (together with vitamin E and selenium),9 and Nitric Oxide Homeostasis Supporting beneficial nitric oxide (NO) pathways is an important part of an autoimmune protocol. This is where the saying, \"Don't throw the baby out with the bath water\" is appropriate. We all need healthy levels of NO in order to not only survive, but also thrive. NO is essential for circulation, heart health, and systemic wellness. However, patients with many autoimmune diseases have high levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS).11 Ironically, however, these patients may have reduced endothelial NO bioavailability.11 This is thought to occur due to overexpression of iNOS, which can in some circumstances be an undesirable NO pathway. Nitric oxide synthases are enzymes that catalyze the generation of NO from L-arginine. Overexpression of the iNOS pathway can lead to the uncoupling of what would normally be a more beneficial NO pathway: endothelial nitric oxide synthase CHRIS D. MELETIS, ND Autoimmune diseases afflict a considerable portion of the population, with recent numbers indicating that 15.9% of the US population, or 41 million people, suffer from an autoimmune condition.1 Although autoimmune diseases are more common among women, the number of men with this type of condition is increasing, according to a study conducted by scientists at the National Institutes of Health.1 At the same time, the incidence of food allergies and intolerances is increasing, impacting gut health and playing a role in autoimmunity by impairing intestinal permeability, otherwise known as leaky gut.2 Quite often, when autoimmune patients arrive at our clinical practices, they have been affected by numerous disease triggers and may often have more than 1 condition that must be addressed. We need to move away from the idea of 1 cause for 1 disease. Our patients present to our clinics with similar and overlapping symptoms that we strive to identify so that we can fit them into ICD-10 coding. Yet, each individual cannot be simplistically lumped into a single category because a patient suffering from an autoimmune disease arrived at his or her condition due to different experiences than those of the autoimmune patient sitting next to them in the waiting room. In keeping with the need for individualized approaches in treating autoimmune patients, I have found that resolving certain lesser-known triggers of autoimmune disease yields excellent results. It is important to pinpoint the autoimmune trigger for each patient if there is any hope of resolving symptoms. In this article, I'll discuss some of the most important autoimmune triggers and offer suggestions for eliminating those causes or at least reducing the burden. Mitochondria's Role in Autoimmunity Mitochondrial abnormalities have been observed in a number of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).3,4 RA is characterized by self- reactive immune cells, leading to inflamed and painful joints. In RA, alterations in An Individualized Approach Autoimmunity, Allergies, & Biochemical Pathways NO is essential for circulation, heart health, and systemic wellness. However, many patients with autoimmunity have high levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Ironically, however, these patients may have reduced endothelial NO bioavailability. 20APRIL 2021 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEWPhilosophy Meets Research supplements that seem healthy, such as turmeric, boswellia, and fish- and plant- based omega-3 fatty acids can in reality be harmful if a patient is intolerant to them. Likewise, vegetables that normally promote healthy nitric oxide levels may not be the best choice for patients who are sensitive to those foods. Conclusion Finally, it is important to begin measures to strengthen the gut barrier early in life by taking such actions as implementing probiotic supplementation to support the gut microbiota and knowing the individualistic food and environmental triggers for autoimmune disease in genetically predisposed individuals. We want to make certain we aren't priming the next generation with a higher risk of conditions and disease states. For example, infants who consume a dust mite allergen in their mother's breast milk may be more susceptible to IgE-mediated food allergies.45 There is a lot of talk about diminishing fertility rates, yet fertility is more than just the outcome of a successful pregnancy; it is also the health of the child. Therefore, we as clinicians should be mindful of autoimmune health and allergic predisposition across all age groups, from the very young to the very old. References 12-45 available online at ndnr.comin duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with type 1 diabetes, as compared to specimens from healthy controls.39 In a large cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes, their first-degree relatives, and controls, intestinal permeability was higher in diabetic patients and their relatives compared to controls, although type 1 diabetic patients had the highest intestinal permeability and zonulin levels.40 In this same study, 7 of 10 prediabetic patients who had positive autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes but who had not progressed to clinical disease had high serum zonulin concentrations, and 3 of the subjects with high zonulin levels went on to develop diabetes 3.5 years after their zonulin levels were tested. Commenting on these studies, Teshima and colleagues stated, \"Together, these findings suggest that in both the [prediabetes] rat model and human patients, an enteropathy in the small intestine, associated with increased paracellular permeability and perhaps driven by a zonulin-mediated pathway, precedes the clinical development of diabetes and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.\"2 Because wheat-gliadin peptides can enhance pathways that are dependent on zonulin,41 some scientists have suggested that wheat gluten is the environmental antigen that promotes type 1 diabetes in people who are genetically predisposed.42 This association between wheat gluten and type 1 diabetes, and the fact that food allergies and intolerances are associated with leaky gut,43,44 indicates it is critical to identify food reactions when treating autoimmune patients. Our GI tract will process tons of food over the course of our lives. Even prior to our birth, we are essentially processing food being consumed by our mother. Due to epigenetics, we know that even food consumed by Grandma can affect future generations. The GI tract, when working optimally, is a glorified collander that filters good from bad. Yet, at the same time, when we eat, we are fueling the integrity of the GI tract, which determines how well this filter works. If we are consuming foods that are problematic (burdensome) to our GI tracts, we are burdening and triggering our immune systems. With each morsel of food we eat, we are either adding to or substracting from our ability to thrive vs survive. Testing for food allergies and intolerances and placing patients on an elimination diet is a beneficial way to address food-related autoimmune triggers while at the same time allowing patients to become empowered and motivated by taking charge of their health. Even (GI) symptoms and atopic dermatitis are often initial symptoms in non-IgE- mediated food reactions, with asthma and allergic rhinitis subsequently developing as comorbidities.34 However, often symptoms are delayed and/or subtle and not obviously related to the food consumed. Leaky Gut Impaired GI permeability (leaky gut) creates a vicious cycle in both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated food reactions. Leaky gut can predispose to the development of food allergies and intolerances and can exacerbate preexisting sensitivities. Leaky gut can also contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders.2 This is not surprising, as nearly 70% of the immune system is located in the gut in the form of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).36 Many autoimmune diseases are thought to require a triad of factors for their development, including leaky gut37: 1) a genetic predisposition of the immune system to generate an abnormal reaction to an environmental antigen; 2) the presence of the environmental antigen to activate the abnormal immune response; and 3) a leaky gut to allow the antigen exposure to, and interaction with, the mucosal immune system of the gut. The association between leaky gut and autoimmune disorders involves the protein zonulin, which plays a role in intestinal permeability through the modulation of tight junctions between cells. Increased zonulin secretion from the lamina propria into the gut lumen leads to increased permeability of the gut barrier.2 One example of the relationship between intestinal permeability and autoimmune disease is seen in type 1 diabetes. High zonulin levels were observed in prediabetic rats, which correlated with the generation of autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells.38 This preceded the development of type 1 diabetes by approximately 25 days. The prediabetic rats that did not develop diabetes had zonulin levels similar to that observed in diabetes- resistant controls. Administering a zonulin receptor antagonist to prediabetic rodents suppressed both the increase in intestinal permeability and the development of diabetes.38 Commenting on that study, another group of researchers stated, \"Removing the dietary stimulus or correcting the leaky gut can prevent the disease, despite retaining the abnormal genetics of this animal model.\"2 There is also evidence of the connection between autoimmunity and leaky gut in humans. Researchers have found increased intercellular spaces between enterocytes production in immune cells.22 The Endocannabinoid System as a Key Player Animal studies have shown that cannabidiol (CBD) may support the immune response in autoimmune conditions. CBD works through the endocannabinoid system, an endogenous pathway that involves endocannabinoids and their receptors. In a rodent study, CBD reduced autoimmune hepatitis.29 In other research, it suppressed the development of type-1 autoimmune diabetes in mice.30 In a study of 11- to 14-week-old female mice that were either in a latent diabetes stage or had the beginning symptoms of the disease, CBD inhibited the manifestations of the disease.30 Only 32% of the mice in the CBD group developed diabetes, as compared with 86% and 100% of the control group and untreated animals, respectively. In a mouse model of autoimmune myocarditis, researchers administered CBD to mice and observed significant improvement in the animals.31 In vitro, CBD increases the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), one of the primary regulatory cells of the immune system that migrate to sites of inflammation.29 These cells can interfere with T-cell functions. By activating MDSCs, CBD can suppress inflammation and autoimmune hepatitis.29 Another way in which CBD may support autoimmune health is by enhancing the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs),32 which are often impaired in people with autoimmune disorders.33 Role of Food Allergies/ Intolerances & Leaky Gut Food Allergies/Intolerances Globally, the incidence of allergic reactions is increasing, with some countries experiencing a food allergy prevalence of 10%.34 Until recently, food allergies were traditionally thought of as a pediatric problem, since food allergies often begin in early childhood and spontaneously resolve in adulthood. However, even the elderly are now increasingly suffering from food allergies, and diagnosis is often challenging due to comorbidities.35 This vulnerability to food allergies in the elderly is due to physiological alterations in aging, impaired gut barrier function, age-related alterations to the gut microbiota, a switch from adaptive immunity towards a T helper type 2 (Th2) response, and impaired function of innate immune cells.35 During aging, immune system function is progressively altered, resulting in elevated inflammation due to the dominance of type-1 cytokines.35 On the other hand, serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations and the generation of Th2 cytokines are also observed to be increased in the elderly, indicating that a type-2 cytokine profile still operates effectively in older adults.35 Other explanations for increased susceptibility to food allergies in the elderly include impaired dendritic cells in the gut, alterations in secretory IgA, and weakened Treg function.35 While the greatest attention in the past was paid to IgE-mediated food reactions, scientists are now recognizing that non- IgE-mediated food intolerances also play an important role in what is known as the Allergic March,34 the course of atopic manifestations and clinical symptoms that last for years or decades.

Because this subject is so vast, this paper will limit its focus to issues of autoimmunity, and limit its discussion to rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. There is a large body of preclinical data on the ECS' role in autoimmune disease. One particular area of interest involves how cannabinoids affect the dynamic balance between regulatory T-cells and proinflammatory Th17 cells, the latter of which are associated with numerous autoimmune conditions.12 Cannabinoids demonstrate a unique modulation of the cytokine milieu by were contributing to the inflammation.17 Similarly, stimulation of CB2 receptors have been shown in multiple studies to significantly inhibit recruitment of neutrophils.18 Conversely, a deficiency of CB2 receptors in mice was observed to enhance neutrophil recruitment and increase inflammation.19 Macrophages In a mouse study, ECS activity via AEA contributes to how the well the gut tolerates foreign antigens by enhancing the activity of a subtype of anti-inflammatory macrophages (CX3CR1) in the gut.20 Commenting on this immune mediation via the ECS, the authors of this paper stated, \"These results uncover a major conversation between the immune and nervous system.\"20 Dendritic Cells Migration of dendritic cells is recognized as one of the most important means by which the immune system encounters foreign antigens.21 CB2 receptor activity decreases dendritic cell migration, helping to decrease inflammation and reestablish homeostasis.22 Meanwhile, 2-AG has been botanicals, also activates CB2 receptors.2 Through this interaction, BCP has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and improve motor paralysis in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis via actions on multiple immune cell lines.6 Maintenance of homeostasis is considered to be one of the ECS' major responsibilities. Modulation of ECS signaling cascades and the restoration of homeostatic endocannabinoid tone thus portend a promising future in the treatment and understanding of autoimmunity. The ECS responds not only to cannabis and cannabinoids; it is also positively affected by diet, exercise, probiotics, prebiotics, acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, mind-body medicine, and other non-cannabis botanicals and CAM therapies.7 As such, the body's own ECS offers potential insights into how various current and future non-cannabinoid-based CAM therapies can potentially provide therapeutic benefit through their actions on the endocannabinoid system.7 The ECS offers 21st-century clinicians an invaluable mechanism to unify our most current biochemical discoveries with traditional naturopathic and CAM modalities. The ECS & Immune Modulation It goes without saying that in many cases of autoimmunity, the balancing or suppression of an overactive immune response can provide clinical benefit. Although much more research is needed, studies to date indicate that manipulation of the ECS affects autoimmune-related tissue damage and even the course of certain diseases. Endocannabinoids have profound effects on immune cells and immunity, functioning as key regulators, including the modulation of immune cell trafficking and effector cell functions. Lymphocytes While na\u00efve T-cell and B-cells produce only small amounts of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, the immune activation of these cells was shown in a mouse model to promote an increase in the production of 2-AG, which in turn modulated inflammation by decreasing Th1 and Th17 responses. The findings suggest that 2-AG could confer therapeutic benefit in Th1-driven diseases.8 In a cell assay, THC and the endocannabinoid AEA were shown to have immunosuppressive effects by directly inhibiting B-cells through the CB2 receptor.9 Additionally, in a mouse model, the CB2 receptor was shown to be involved with the retention of immature B-cells in bone marrow.10 The effect of the ECS on T-cells is such that both Th1 and Th2 cytokines can be inhibited or upregulated by endocannabinoids.11 The CB2 receptor has been shown in animal and in-vitro studies to suppress T-cell activation.12-15 Interestingly, during vaccination in mouse models, 2-AG levels are upregulated in immune tissues, whereas CB2 blockade reduces vaccination-induced immunity.16 Neutrophils In a cell-line model of intestinal inflammation, ECS activity diminished the mobilization of neutrophils that JAKE F. FELICE, ND, LMP Autoimmune conditions and diseases of the nervous system are typically chronic, often have an early age of onset, and frequently cause significant pain, debility, and suffering. Autoimmunity is an arena of medicine that remains largely misunderstood, given that the immune system and immune regulation are still relatively new areas of medicine, since the late 20th century. The mainstay of conventional therapy for autoimmune diseases is immunosuppressive glucocorticoids despite their well-known adverse long-term effects. CB2 Receptors & Immunity Plant cannabinoids provide potential benefits for autoimmunity via 3 major avenues: modulation of the immune system, reduction of general inflammation, and digestive system support. Cannabinoid therapies may also treat symptomatic aspects of autoimmune diseases, including pain and muscle spasms. Other modes of influence on immune activity by the ECS include effects on cytokine information networks, induction of apoptosis by immune cells, and downregulation of adaptive and innate immune responses. The ECS consists of cannabinoid (CB) receptors CB1 and CB2, and their transport mechanisms, and endocannabinoid-metabolizing enzymes. CB1 receptors are expressed mainly in neural tissue, while CB2 receptors are expressed largely in immune cells and are the main focus of this paper. In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, endocannabinoids modulate several other pathways and receptors, including TRPV1, GPR-55, and others.1-4 The wide distribution of cannabinoid receptors-2 (CB2) on immune cells makes the endocannabinoid system (ECS) - a highly complex interconnected web of biochemical pathways - a natural candidate for the exploration of new treatment options for autoimmune disease. By affecting a plethora of receptors and biologic networks,2 cannabinoids including CBD expand their influence far beyond \"classical\" pharmacologic pathways. Current evidence indicates that phytocannabinoids modulate immune activity in a way that balances both overactive and underactive immune responses. They have been shown to act upon B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, and other immune cells, creating an environment that reduces inflammatory cytokines and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines.1 Interestingly, one of the ways that CBD affects the ECS is through via inhibitory actions on the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).2 Targeting the inactivation of FAAH may be a useful and non-toxic way to modulate the body's concentrations of cannabinoids and reduce inflammation in autoimmune conditions.5 Besides plant cannabinoids, the role of terpenes in cannabis deserves mention. The sesquiterpene beta-caryophyllene (BCP), cannabis and many other Endocannabinoids & Autoimmunity Phytocannabinoids modulate immune activity in a way that balances both overactive and underactive immune responses. They have been shown to act upon B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, and other immune cells, creating an environment that reduces inflammatory cytokines and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines. REVIEWVis Medicatrix Naturae Crohn's disease (CD). In patients with CD and UC, endocannabinoid levels have been found to be increased in plasma.35 Similarly, in murine colitis models, both endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors are upregulated.31,36-38 Other studies show that with cannabinoid receptor blockade and in models of cannabinoid receptor deficiency, these anti-inflammatory effects are reversed.31,36-38 Likewise, in mouse models, the inhibition of endocannabinoid hydrolytic enzymes (MAGL and FAAH) raises endocannabinoid levels and concomitantly diminishes disease scores of colitis.39,40 In a small human study of patients with active CD who failed to respond to corticosteroid treatment, inhaled cannabis produced clinically significant improvements in 10 out of 11 patients, and complete remission in 5 of 11 participants.41 Finally, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study examining the use of a CBD-rich botanical extract in UC patients, participants' global impression of change and quality-of-life outcomes were improved.42 Conclusion The ECS acts as a modulatory network that may be considered a future target of pharmacotherapy for immune-related disorders such as autoimmune disease. Like many exciting new discoveries, the study of this robust system portends opportunities to shed light on previously unknown aspects of the human immune system, paving the way for new classes of pharmacologic as well as CAM and plant-based therapeutic agents. In the meantime, autoimmune patients who use medical cannabis and CBD products for concomitant symptoms of pain, spasm, sleep, or anxiety may experience benefits from the immune modulation provided by cannabinoid-based therapies. References 24-42 available online at ndnr.comRA, animal models of MS demonstrate neuroprotective effects. Using an murine model of MS known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CBD treatment led to a dramatic increase in anti- inflammatory myeloid suppressor cells and significantly reduced clinical scores of paralysis.30 In another EAE study, by Lyman et al, 100% of control animals developed severe clinical EAE, and over 98% of them died.31 In contrast, THC- treated animals showed either no clinical manifestations or mild disease with delayed onset, as well as a survival rate of over 95%.31 A human study by Sexton et al found significantly higher levels of AEA in MS patients compared to normal controls.32 A cannabinoid-based medicine (1:1 THC:CBD oral-mucosal spray) is sometimes used as an add-on therapy for spasticity in MS patients. A recent systemic literature review of observational studies and treatment registries, from 2011 to 2017, examined various aspects of this treatment.33 Results revealed overall reductions in the spasticity numeric rating scale (NRS), as well as improvements in spasm counts, sleep impairment, and pain.33 The CBD:THC product was well tolerated, and no unknown safety issues emerged.33 The authors concluded, \"In therapy-resistant spasticity, that is, in patients not adequately responding to or not tolerating previous anti-spastic drugs, the add-on use of THC:CBD is an effective therapeutic option with a good tolerability and safety profile. No new or unexpected [adverse events] have been reported in clinical practice, and there are no indications of abuse or tolerance development with long-term use.\"33 A separate analysis of the 1:1 CBD:THC oral mucosal spray revealed persistent relief from MS spasticity, and good tolerability.34 The authors stated, \"The ability of treatment-resistant patients to respond to THC:CBD oromucosal spray may relate to its novel modes of action which distinguish it from conventional antispasticity medications. Patients with a longer disease history may stand to gain the greatest benefit from treatment with add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray.\"34 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to disorders of autoimmune chronic inflammation in the digestive tract, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and decreasing the inflammatory Th17 autoimmune phenotype while at the same time increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10.24 Specifically, CB2 receptor signals drive the immune response away from a proinflammatory cascade and towards a regulatory T-cell phenotype.25 Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases and is a well-known major source of pain, disability, and joint malformation. Interestingly, analysis of the synovial fluid of healthy volunteers shows undetectable levels of endocannabinoids, while the synovial fluid of RA patients reveals detectable levels of the endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA.26 Murine models indicate not only ECS involvement in RA, but also potential therapeutic effects. In a study of both bovine and murine models of arthritis, CBD effectively blocked the progression of disease after the onset of symptoms and protected the joints from severe degradation.27 The CBD-treated mice also showed decreases in proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interferon-gamma (INF), as well as decreased lymphocyte proliferation.27 In a murine model of arthritis with human synovial tissue, CB2 stimulation reduced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF in a dose-dependent manner.28 The authors stated that activation of CB2 has \"therapeutic potential for RA to suppress synovitis and alleviate joint destruction by inhibiting the production of autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines.\"28 In a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study of RA patients who were administered a cannabis- based medicine or placebo for 5 weeks, significant suppression of disease activity occurred in the cannabis group, as well as improvements in quality of sleep, pain at rest, and pain during movement.29 Though animal data consistently show benefits of cannabinoids in RA, more clinical research on disease modification in humans is clearly needed.

APRIL 2021 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEWNature Cure Clinical Pearls of 200c: Ceanothus - Spleen Spongia - Pancreas Colocynthis - Intestine Appendix Apis - Ovary (right) Bryonia - Lung/Pleura Phosphorus - Lung Nux vomica - Stomach Thuja, Chimaphila - Prostate Cimicifuga - Uterus Gelsemium - Kidney Cinchona - Gallbladder Chelidonium - Liver For the endocrine use a potency of 12c: Thyroidinum Adrenal cortexhelped, that might help confirm that she was suffering from a pancreatic problem. A dose of Spongia 200c resolved the acute pain. I presumed a case of pancreatitis and gave her the recommendations to more comprehensively address that, and she resolved. (Yes, we can successfully treat pancreatitis.) As I contemplated that case, it struck me that I had used a homeopathic remedy to help diagnose an acute abdomen. I began to consider the implication of this: I could use remedies to help with diagnosis. I began to apply this concept when the circumstances warranted it. Over a period of time, I developed a list of remedies to use \"diagnostically.\" These same remedies can also be used specifically in treatment. For the organ remedies, I use a potency and back pain both reduced. As I continued with the physical exam, her abdomen was quite tender to palpation, and I gave her a dose of Colocynthis 200c. Her abdominal pain resolved, the rest of the headache and back pain resolved, and her kidney pain resolved. The spleen pain was gone at this point. Her mind cleared, and her vision improved. As I laid out a treatment plan for her, I told her we were going to start at the foundation. We needed to improve her digestion and reduce the toxemia (evidenced by the high urinary indican and the acoustic cardiogram we ran, as well as by the abdominal pain). I recommended diet; constitutional hydrotherapy at home (she lives more than an hour away and is a mother of 3, so daily office treatments become problematic); a bitter tonic for the stomach; a bottle of the Ceanothus 1LM, to take as needed for spleen pain; and a bottle of Colocynthis 1LM, to take as needed for the abdominal (intestinal) pain. She was to contact me if the medicines bothered her or if she got worse. Otherwise, I'd see her in a month. I am reporting this case to you for a couple of reasons. First, it is an interesting case. These Lyme patients can be very difficult cases, and each one is different. Her presentation was pain, particularly spleen pain and abdominal pain. The case is by no means over. My other reason for writing about this case is to discuss my use of the 2 remedies that gave her such amazing and immediate relief. Spheres and Essences There are many prescribing strategies in homeopathic medicine. We are all familiar with the basic concepts, the similimum and the minimum dose, and most of us have read the Organon, Hahnemann's masterwork that defined homeopathy. We are familiar with prescribing in the \"constitutional\" manner, ie, finding the remedy that best fits the totality of symptoms. We are familiar with prescribing in acute situations, like using Arnica for acute physical trauma. Hahnemann referred to this as \"intercurrent\" prescribing: the use of a remedy in an acute situation other than the constitutional prescription. When I studied homeopathy in the 1980s with a Belgium homeopath, he taught us 19 prescribing strategies. I have discussed this in several webinars. I chanced upon a different prescribing strategy by accident a number of years ago. Many years ago, I had a patient who presented with abdominal pain. What can cause abdominal pain? Well, just about anything, from a heart attack to a bladder infection. I took her history. She described the pain as left-sided, under the rib cage, mostly toward the center of the abdomen. As I took her case and palpated her abdomen, I decided this was likely a pancreatic problem. Ultrasound was not readily available. Then I recalled that I had recently treated a case of pancreatitis successfully with Spongia, one of the most common remedies for that malady. It occurred to me that if a dose of Spongia JARED L. ZEFF, ND, VNMI, LAC The following is not an article prepared for a medical journal. Not every statement of fact is cited or referenced. This is a commentary on the medicine, a running set of observations about practice in the field. It's not meant to be a peer-reviewed presentation; rather, these are notes and thoughts from a practicing naturopathic physician, a primary care doc in general practice. A Case of Severe Pain I want to tell you about a case I just had, as it illustrates an approach to homeopathic prescribing that I've been honing during my years in practice because of its effectiveness. A woman, age 34, came to see me from a nearby town. She has had advanced Lyme disease, a very difficult condition. A few years back, a local naturopathic physician saved her life, she said. She had been seeing another doctor for frequent recurrent UTIs, often with pus and blood in her urine, but the treatments from her conventional primary care physician were not working. Then her kidneys appeared to be shutting down. Finally, she consulted with the naturopathic doc, who diagnosed the Lyme disease and began treating her aggressively with antibiotics, glutathione, cat's claw, and a number of other things she could not remember. She was on the antibiotics for 6-8 months. She began to feel better and better, and then seemed quite good. Prior to the Lyme disease, she had received a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, and her bladder symptoms improved with the Lyme treatment. About 3 months ago, she began to \"flare,\" with a return of the Lyme symptoms. Four months prior, she had her third baby and all seemed quite good. But now she was in constant pain, and the pain seemed to be getting worse. The naturopathic physician she had originally consulted was no longer in practice, and she found me on the internet. She had pain everywhere, especially spleen pain, she said, and abdominal pain, mostly in the lower left abdomen. She also had a constant headache, as well as many black spots in her vision, which were getting worse. She had mental fog and memory problems; she couldn't find the right word, and it was sometimes hard to speak. She hurt in her back, her bladder and kidneys, her legs, shoulders, and face. She had severe fatigue. But her main complaint was pain; she hurt so much that it was even difficult to walk. Out of desperation, she came to my office. I took her case, which took quite a bit longer than usual. I did my usual physical exam and labs. I ran a urinalysis and spun the urine and looked at it under the scope: nothing remarkable except occasional clumps of bacteria. No pus or blood. During the long history, I gave her a dose of Ceanothus 200c due to the spleen pain she was reporting, which was confirmed by palpation. This was her most severe pain. Within a few minutes the spleen pain lightened, and her headache Notes from the Field November, 2020 MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct? Address correct?

As one continues to practice, day after day, giving remedies to nearly every patient, one sharpens one's \"intuition\" and catalogues more and more information of this nature in one's memory. Adding to this a few keynotes, I could come up with a reasonable remedy within a few minutes for most patients. Clinical Homeopathy I also noticed that remedies act almost instantaneously. This is, of course, because they are semiotic in action, not biochemical. They affect the biochemistry, but through their information content, not their chemistry. Giving a remedy is like downloading information into a computer. It is not a chemical process; it is an information or programming process. A remedy is like a thumb drive in this regard. It conveys new organizational information into the biological system. I will give most patients a remedy while we are sitting, talking about their case, and then ask them within a few minutes whether they notice anything different. If they are in pain, a good remedy will have already eased the pain, etc. One does not need to wait 2 weeks to see the effect; it is apparent in almost all cases within a few minutes of giving the medicine. Using these techniques, one can give a remedy after this rapid repertorization, based upon knowledge of the remedies' essences and spheres, and then assess the effect within minutes. If nothing happens, rethink the case and give a different remedy. In this way, one can effectively and rapidly prescribe in a busy clinic. Then one decides upon the need for repetition of the remedy, and dispenses this, if indicated, along with whatever botanicals, dietary advice, etc, one needs to prescribe for the particular patient. I call this \"clinical homeopathy.\" Respectfully, Jared L. Zeff, ND, VNMI, LAc breath, which leads one to its selection. Phosphorus and Bryonia are more broad in their respiratory application. While they are both polycrest remedies, with many different applications, their respiratory symptoms include many rubrics. The remedy must fit the picture, of course, or it will not have effect; but the application of these remedies in the respiratory sphere is very broad, hence their service in this general application. Early in practice, I was often struggling to find the correct remedy. I had heard the theory, read several major books, and was in daily practice. Five years into practice, I was often seeing 20-25 people in a day, sometimes more. I did not have the time to spend hours repertorizing each case. I looked for more rapid ways to prescribe. Toward this end, I bought my first personal computer. It was called \"portable,\" though it was the size of a microwave oven, and the carry bag was big enough for one of my children to ride in, and I actually would carry one of them around in it if they begged enough. But the reason I got it was because I wanted to run one of the first computer programs to accomplish this task. I was looking for anything that might help me prescribe rapidly with accuracy. Remedy Essences Reading Margaret Tyler's Homeopathic Drug Pictures and Catherine Coulter's Portraits of the Remedies, I learned how to \"see\" remedies, that is, to see a \"Pulsatilla\" when she walked into the room, or a \"Sepia,\" or whatever. I learned that the remedies have what I came to call \"essences.\" If one reads the introductions to each remedy in Boericke's Materia Medica or in Clark's Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica , one will see the remedy picture summarized. These summaries generally explain the essence of the remedy. For example, the essence of Nux vomica is the serious person who is driven to overwork and is suffering the consequences of such activity. They tend to over-do, to drink coffee in the morning to wake up, and alcohol in the evening to wind down, and they depend on these things. They tend to overeat and to not take the best care of themselves in order to get the job done. In the course of this, they develop gastric and hepatic complaints. They get headaches, etc. This is the \"picture\" of Nux, illustrating its \"essence.\" In order to be a more rapid and effective prescriber, I learned that I could categorize the remedies by their essences as well as by their spheres of activity, ie, the well. But Bryonia and Phosphorus were most often effective in treating the cases of pneumonia I encountered. Remedy Spheres Those 2 remedies are not \"lung\" remedies per se, but they have a great affinity for the lung and its pathologies. The \"sphere\" of these remedies includes the lung more than, say, Gentiana lutea. If you peruse a materia medica, you will see that Gentiana has a very short section on the respiratory organs, but a very large section on the stomach and intestines. In contrast, Bryonia and Phosphorus have large sections on the lung. The \"sphere\" of Gentiana is more in the digestive aspect, while that of Bryonia and Phosphorus are more in the respiratory. There are certainly other major lung remedies, such as Antimonium tartaricum; however, Antimonium tart has the peculiarity of a great accumulation of mucus, and consequent rattling in the Estradiol Testosterone Progesterone/Folliculinum Hypophysinum/Pituitary It could reasonably be argued that this is not homeopathy, but something else. But let me dive more deeply into this. As I was struggling to learn homeopathy, through my early years of practice, I read much. I studied at one time with a Belgium homeopath, as I mentioned, as well as with my primary mentors, Harold Dick, John Bastyr, Bill Turska, Ravi Sahni, Robert Broadwell, and others. Homeopathy is a vast subject; there is much information to digest. The way my mind works, I began to understand that different remedies have different spheres of activity in the totality of their pictures. I found, for example, that in treating pneumonia, 2 remedies continually came to the top, though there were others as MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

Is it possible that H pylori is causing some kind of an acid decrease, or is it the other way around? Taking stomach acid blockers - rampant in the United States - may exacerbate the colonization of H pylori in the stomach because the conditions for its growth are now optimized. Digestive Enzymes Digestive enzymes are so much more than compounds that expedite digestion. They are anti-inflammatory and proteolytic outside of the alimentary canal. Proteolytic enzymes can be used for inflammatory conditions such as sports injuries because are more sensitive to pH than others. For instance, calcium, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and manganese seem to be particularly touchy when it comes to pH. If you do mineral analysis on people, you can often suspect hypochlorhydria (or achlorhydria, for that matter) because of the pattern of mineral deficiencies that might come up. Further, if you don't have the right conditions, you cannot grow the right bacteria in the alimentary canal. Without the right pH, you are not going to get the right microbes in the right proportions in the right parts of the gut. Take the issue of Helicobacter pylori , which is found more commonly in people and the bulk of our neurotransmitters, and maintaining the \"soil\" of our internal environment. The alimentary canal not only nourishes us, but also defends us, heals us, and affects our moods. With more neurons than in our brain, and 10 times more bacteria than cells in our body, the \"gut\" is the center of our physical universe. Review of the Alimentary Canal The alimentary canal is specifically modified in higher animals and humans to extract nutrients from our environment. There are some who suggest that one ought to think of the intestinal tract as being exterior to the body: \"That which is on the inside of the outside is still on the outside of the inside.\" The alimentary canal is designed to break down food from the teeth to the other end, to mix it chemically in different ways with emulsifiers, digestants, enzymes, etc. Food not only provides nutrients; it also introduces whatever else is in the environment at the time, which includes the multitudes of microorganisms to which we are exposed. It is estimated that 90% of our exposure to microorganisms occurs within the gut. Some experts have estimated that the surface area of the small intestine alone is over 200 times that of our skin.1 This is illustrative of the fact that the more surface area there is, the more exposure there is to microorganisms. The mechanics of the gut include chewing, grinding, and mixing of the food in the mouth, which then moves through the esophagus into the stomach, where a changing pH in response to the secreted hydrochloric acid changes pepsinogen into pepsin, allowing for digestion of proteins. The bolus of soupy food then moves further into the small intestines, where the bulk of absorption takes place, and finally into the large intestine for resorption of water and bile. Without normal function of the alimentary canal, we cannot absorb our nutrients. And whatever is not used, including the waste products dumped by liver detoxification activity, ends up going out the \"tail pipe.\" Stomach Acid We are living at a time when digestive problems are a huge issue. Many, many people have gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, etc, and many patients suffer from inflammatory bowel disease. And the gastroenterology approach to most of these issues is to block the acids. The low pH of the stomach is the signal for closing the cardiac sphincter and keeping the pyloric sphincter closed. It is only when the pH changes again towards pH-neutral that the pyloric sphincter can open. In the stomach you get protein digestion from HCl, and as the bolus of food moves into the duodenum, the liver, gall bladder, and the pancreas secrete compounds and enzymes that emulsify the fats and break down the carbohydrates. Gastrointestinal pH is more than just about digestion; it is vitally important for the absorption of certain nutrients, especially the minerals. Some minerals JAMES SENSENIG, ND This column is transcribed from a weekly live conversation produced by the Naturopathic Medical Institute (NMI). The goal of NMI is to preserve and promote the principles of naturopathic philosophy through clinical application, in your offices and in your communities, every day. On October 11, 2017, Dr Jim Sensenig spoke on the importance of gut health. In this lightly edited transcript (by Emily Kane, ND), the first part of a 4-part article, Dr Sensenig addresses the question, \"What's the Gut Got to Do With It?\" A Longstanding Appreciation The more scientific research we have available, the more we are reminded of just how far ahead of the curve our predecessors were with naturopathic medicine. They had a deep and fundamental understanding of today's subject - the importance of gut health - long before the topic was at the forefront of human biology, as it is today. Our naturopathic forebears, the eclectic physicians, could articulate very clearly the importance of GI health, although not with the cellular and molecular and genetic detail we have today. This raises an interesting question: Does the increased detail make that knowledge any more or less valid? I will argue that the very principles of self-healing, right living, and needing to clear toxins aren't changed particularly by drilling down at a genetic or cellular level. It is interesting that there are naturopathic modalities we apply in practice today that eventually can be explained in some kind of reductionistic, scientific way. What I'm asking is, are we all more comfortable when \"science\" explains, in a reductionistic way, how something \"works\"? Some examples might be acupuncture or homeopathy. People have said, \"This stuff is voodoo; it doesn't work, and it's all placebo.\" When the conventional world figures out how to explain it in reductionistic terms, within a mechanistic, Newtonian framework, then suddenly it's okay. In fact, these \"alternative therapies\" may even be presented as a new discovery, even though the principles had often been established since before recorded history. It is remarkable just how articulate and clinically valid our predecessors were in laying down what they taught us about the importance of the gut and its role in our overall health. In the early days of vitalistic, naturopathic medicine, we did not talk about gastroenterology or clinical nutrition, because these are not, in fact, separable. They are 2 sides of the same coin. The term for this field, from at least 100 years ago, was trophology, the science of feeding. The study was looking at how the avocado, for instance, goes from being an avocado in your salad to the point where the individual components of that avocado reach your cells. The \"gut\" brings nutrients into the body and eliminates waste, but it is far more than just a digestive system. It is the most active immunological location in the body, producing systemic enzymes The Vital Conversation The Importance of Gut Health Part 1 MUST BE COMPLETED IN FULL CHECK EACH BOX AS A GUIDE: Name correct?

As I mentioned, bacteria also produce nutrients. All of the known neurotransmitters, most famously serotonin and dopamine, are actually elaborated in the gut. Ninety-five percent of serotonin is made in the gut. If you do not have a normally functioning GI tract with a normal level of bacteria, a normal population of commensal bacteria, and a normal pH, you are not going to be breaking down the proteins or the vital peptides into the precursors for the neurotransmitters. This column, based on the Vital Conversations of the Naturopathic Medicine Institute, will continue in next month's NDNR . Dr Sensenig will be discussing the gut as a second brain. are less susceptible to C diff, and another factor is stomach acid. It is speculated that the rise in C diff follows the rise in the use of PPIs, since, as we block or diminish the pH in the stomach, we obviously change the environment away from the beneficial bacteria in the direction of the bad guys. This is too often missed in talks about digestion. The pH/bacterial connection is absolutely astounding. A question to consider: How come a dog can eat out of the neighbor's garbage and live to tell, but you eat a slightly bad avocado and get sick? Often the reason has to do with your gastric pH. The ambient pH of the stomach is about 2, and it is even lower when it is functioning to digest proteins. The pH of the rest of the gut remains acidic, but gradually goes to near-neutral at the tailpipe. The pH environment acts as a biological sieve or gate. The beneficial bacteria prefer an acid environment. That is why they are called \"acidophilus.\" The bad guys - the pathogenic bacteria, yeast, mold, fungi, and, to some extent, parasites - are able to live in or prefer an environment that is more alkaline. In the case of the dog - or, for that matter, the lion or tiger or bear or all other critters that are eating food off the ground and out of the stream - they all have digestive systems that are strong enough that the pH is low enough to kill off the pathogenic bacteria but allow the beneficial or commensal bacteria to remain. Bacteria are also involved in detoxification. Each different species has its own detox assignment. It is estimated that 2 to 3 pounds of our body weight is microorganisms. That's a lot of bacteria! traditionally have lived longer or have been healthier in some cultures. However, this may no longer be true due to the depletion of minerals in our soils these days. Bacteria In addition to stomach acid and the enzymes, we have multitudes of microbes living in our gut. Bacteria help in our digestive process by not only helping to break down some foodstuffs, but also by helping to make, or liberate, nutrients like some of the B vitamins and amino acids . Bacteria aid in our mucosal immunity. They are directly related to IgA production and actually stimulate IgA production in the various immune tissues in the gut - referred to as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, or GALT. Bacteria provide defenses in that, in a simple way of thinking about it, the good guys prevent the bad guys from taking over. The beneficial bacteria keep pathogens and other pathogenic bacteria at bay. Clostridium difficile is becoming a serious problem in America's hospitals. The only conventional treatment here is super-biotics or fecal transplant. Patients with normal intestinal bacteria they break down damaged tissue - which is comprised of proteins. Digestive enzymes are the body's scavengers. The proteolytic enzymes that are in the bloodstream - either loose or contained within white cells - are circulating, gobbling up, breaking down, and digesting abnormal or damaged proteins. Anybody who has used proteolytic enzymes in soft tissue injuries will know that it can speed up the healing by essentially cleaning up the injury site of hemolysis and injured, dead, and dying tissue. It is kind of like taking out the garbage before you can rebuild on the same site. Enzymes also break down pathogens. Beard's trophoblast theory of cancer2 suggests that one of the roles of our digestive enzymes is to digest, or break down, malignant cells, particularly carcinomas of various kinds. One of the benefits of a more vegan/vegetarian diet is simply its ability to spare our limited enzyme-synthesis capacity. Also, eating some raw food daily is optimal, because the inherent enzymes are not destroyed in the cooking.

A question to consider: How come a dog can eat out of the neighbor's garbage and live to tell, but you eat a slightly bad avocado and get sick? 28APRIL 2021 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEWapplication of science to health care. This was the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) movement,4 which can be described as the intersection of easy-to- access databases of studies, as well as refinements in the appraisal of studies. Evidence was increasingly ranked, with systematic reviews as a way to overcome the limitations in a single study, and meta-analyses began to synthesize data from multiple studies. These were good advances. Medline and similar databases went from something that was used at a library and was updated monthly from a disc, to a frequently-updated database that was accessible from the World Wide Web. Search filters and various Boolean operators could help the physician find the needle in the haystack of studies, or at least get pretty close. Three new elements had to be added to the naturopathic education. One was the simple proficiency in using these databases. Another was an understanding of the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine (healthcare) and how that evidence fits in with clinical judgment and biomedical sciences (the original 3-legged stool of EBM). And finally, the student had to know how to apply these skills to patient care. This is an important skill for naturopathic physicians, but it must be approached with confidence, not naivet\u00e9. For one thing, the arrival of new tools for eliminating bias from research and ways to access that research are not at a state of perfection. Critics of the \"gold standard\" of research, such as John Ioannidis of Stanford, are quick to point out how so much of the research in even top-tier journals falls short.5 This doesn't mean we should ignore it or - even worse - cast aspersion on some of the best practices in research. But it reminds us in naturopathic medicine that we should not be overawed or intimidated by the randomized control trial and systematic review complex. Don't Discard Judgment and Experience Another thing to keep in mind is that much of medical practice is empirical and based on clinical judgment informed by best evidence. That was the original intent of the EBM movement. It was perhaps inevitable that this would progress to a belief that absolute answers about treatment could be yielded if just enough data could be crunched fast enough. That vision has remained elusive even for well-trodden therapies such as statins. The temptation for naturopathic education is to too strictly model ourselves after this extreme meta-analysis approach, and the result would be a rather sad species of \"wannabee\" that won't do for as fine a group as our naturopathic profession. The naturopathic programs in North America have done a fine job of synthesizing EBM, tradition, and a very observational and patient-centered model. One other reason that even the top-tier research coming from a more allopathic model of care is perennially incomplete for our purposes is that it is really best suited for an allopathic approach. That has been compressed to allow for more time in actual clinical training. The idea is to provide the fundamentals to enter the training \"job market\" as a resident and to equip the student with the skills to learn more on their own or under guidance. Nobody would seriously propose teaching medical students the whole field. Science and Practice The emphasis of that science - preparing the allopathic student for pharmacotherapy versus the empirical, whole-person approach - is another matter. Naturopathic medical students need to understand and apply the biomedical sciences to skills such as diagnosis and pharmacotherapy (at the very least, knowing how it works). Unlike their allopathic counterparts, naturopathic students are also learning about the application of the biomedical sciences in other ways, in tandem with the standard medical approach . In one sense, we are looking at the changes in physiology that happen when the body is under duress and how we might support that crumbling physiology even if that support is not ultimately curative. An example would be giving a person with congestive heart failure the supplement coenzyme Q10. We know that in some clinical trials, it helps with quality of life. We also know that it can be poorly supplied in the ailing heart. It is intrinsic to the function of mitochondria, and it might be depressed in those receiving intensive statin therapy. So we supplement it, not as a \"cure\" for congestive heart failure, but to support a weakened and compensated system. Another way in which we use the biomedical sciences is to trace the symptoms of a patient to a disordered underlying physiology that probably arose due to disturbances to the determinants of health. Yet another is to think about how multiple systems interact; a supplement that supports hepatic biotransformation of hormones is an example. The seeming dichotomy between a mechanistic approach to understanding health and disease and a less reductionistic and more system-based approach to practice is an educational challenge. But practicing naturopathic doctors straddle these 2 modes of thinking every day. Still, the naturopathic curriculum cannot be a simulacrum of allopathic education, for this reason alone. Evidence-Based Medicine In the early 2000s, another, quieter, revolution was taking place in the the caliber of instruction for naturopathic students caught up to their allopathic counterparts, and in some instances surpassed it (anatomy at our schools is now far more rigorous than that at some schools training medical doctors). In 1996, Dr Clyde Jensen, then President of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM, now NUNM), published a paper in the Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine entitled \"Common Pathways in Medical Education.\"3 Achieving Parity The esteemed Dr Jensen showed, numerically, the significant similarities between medical, osteopathic, and naturopathic medical hours in sciences, pharmacology, diagnosis, and treatment. Of course, these disciplines were very divergent at the 3rd year, but the foundation was remarkably similar in terms of scientific basis. It was clear that naturopathic education had other critical elements, such as clinical theory, nutrition, botanical medicine, etc, that formed the alloy of naturopathic medical training. At Dr Jensen's behest, a group of us have updated the article and are submitting it to the same journal. In 25 years, the naturopathic strengths in the biomedical sciences have not diminished at all compared to medical and osteopathic training. And in terms of educating doctors who are skilled in nutrition and prevention, naturopathic medicine is clearly in a different league (this author's opinion). A Need for Progress That being made clear, naturopathic medicine would seem to be in the same lane as allopathic medicine - nothing left to do but flip on the cruise control and make refinements as the science continues to grow. Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. Replicating an education model of days gone by is the most comfortable and also the most inopportune thing we can do. The reasons for the risks inherent in what is intrinsically a good and noteworthy achievement are several. As is so often the case in life, change is the constant. That doesn't mean that the tried and true have to be discarded in favor of the novel; however, any school, any business, and any doctor, does need to keep up with the world. As an example, in the allopathic education system there is a still a progression from basic sciences to clinical sciences; however, the former FRASER SMITH, MATD, ND No matter the obstacles they place, the truth of our medicine will win out. (John Bastyr)1 If we take the phrase \"modern world\" to denote the advent of a society using technology at a higher level than ever seen, based on an explosion in the growth of pure and applied sciences, the timeframe for that seems to be the later-19th century to the present. Much is taking shape right now in science, including the advancement of computing powers (the implications of that for naturopathic medicine is the focus of next month's column). The birth of the 20th century ushered in many achievements, including the exact identification of the pathways of metabolism, the elucidation of the physiological bioregulatory systems, the role of DNA and the nature of genes, and much more. Much of today's health care - even if a microprocessor plays the role of mediator and the molecular diagnostics are far more precise - is based on technology from 100 years ago. In last month's column, we looked at how allopathic medicine rode this wave. The ascent of allopathic medicine was both transformative and opportunistic. There is no doubt that the biomedical sciences opened a door to a powerful model of therapeutics, be it antibiotics, cortisol to treat Addison's, or diuretics to lower blood pressure. At the same time, the allopathic profession seized the high ground in cultural authority, to the point that they nearly extinguished (in North America, at least) all rivals and came to have their opinions be almost unquestioned by the average patient. A New Foundation When \"naturopathic medicine\" arose from the remnants of the naturopathy movement, one of the new features was a solid basic science curriculum. The \"2 + 2\" model (2 years of basic sciences, laboratory medicine, and diagnosis, followed by clinical sciences taught at the bedside), had become the de facto template for medical education. Donald Schon referred to this as a \"normative curriculum.\"2 So, if naturopathic medicine were to populate a re-emergent profession with doctors practicing naturopathic medicine, then a foundation of basic sciences and science- based diagnosis had to be the concrete foundation of the house. This is what happened, and over time Education A Scientific Education Part 2 Much of medical practice is empirical and based on clinical judgment informed by best evidence. That was the original intent of the EBM movement. It was perhaps inevitable that this would progress to a belief that absolute answers about treatment could be yielded if just enough data could be crunched fast enough. 29 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW APRIL 2021Education systems, and really, individual humans, have to be approached with a sophisticated therapeutic sensibility ( Tolle totum ). A Scientific Foundation Finally, there is an even more powerful argument for maintaining some independence in this matter of science. That is the principle that naturopathic medicine is inherently scientific because it is based on bringing the patient into harmony with the laws of nature, the laws of health, and helping to right dysregulated systems in the body. It is that branch of medicine that was designed to restore the conditions for health and to help the candle burn more brightly. It is just 1 branch of medicine, but an ancient one with a bright future. When I was a new student, the great Dr John Bastyr came to visit us at CCNM (1993, I believe), at which point he was well into his 80s. The whole student body gathered in the gym. Dr Bastyr told us how he still read 2 scientific articles each night, and he kindly and effortlessly answered questions from some of the interns. I can no longer recall if he said the following then, or if I subsequently read it, or both, but he stated that being based on science, naturopathic medicine would be vindicated by advances in science (I heavily paraphrase). That is the heart of the matter: that science is something we should embrace and that we have a duty to champion a therapeutic approach where \"the patient does the healing,\" as Dr Bastyr would say. That kind of scientific education fills a void in health care, which is what inspired many of us to follow this path. Claiming the use of the science of today within a whole-person healing approach makes a fitting basis for the education of naturopathic doctors. In next month's column, we'll explore what this means for the possible science of tomorrow, which will be no less dramatic in its transformative effects on medicine. LDL levels are associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality.7 So, the heroic measures to pound LDL into the ground with intensive statin therapy may be for naught. The lesson for naturopathic education is that our job is not to make students \"drink the Koolaid,\" but to make them critical thinkers who understand and accept that whole systems, open and the value of ASCVD prevention guidelines make sense.6 Those guidelines do include risk factors. But I also am aware that the lethality of LDL depends on things like long-term circulating insulin levels, antioxidant status, omega-6 intake, vitamin D status, overall inflammation, and lipoprotein characteristics. In fact, the newest research is showing that depressed goes something like this: \"Here is a definable lesion or therapeutic target, here is the specific treatment, and here is the outcome.\" That is valuable to discover, but naturopathic medicine is equally invested in understanding open, whole systems. That is to say, much of what appears as health and disease is the outcome of many interacting variables in a single person, and that person is influenced by many environmental factors, and in a very fluid way. The accumulation of evidence about LDL-cholesterol as the therapeutic target for preventing atherosclerosis is a good example. One interventional cardiologist told me, \"Like my colleagues, I have drunk the Koolaid around LDL and statins.\" This translates roughly as, \"It's the cholesterol, Stupid!\" and statins are the best tool we have to lower it. As a naturopathic physician, I see those correlations too, Fraser Smith, MATD, ND, is Assistant Dean of Naturopathic Medicine and Professor at the National University of Health Sciences (NUHS) in Lombard, IL. Prior to working at NUHS, he served as Dean of Naturopathic Medicine at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM) in Toronto, Ontario. Dr Smith is a licensed naturopathic physician and graduate of CCNM. REFERENCES 1. Goldman E. John Bastyr: Physician, Healer, Mentor. November 20, 2018.

When he's not with his patients or his family he can usually be found on a trail with his dogs or on the golf course.Eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) affects 15% of children in industrialized countries, making it one of the top chief concerns in pediatric visits[1]. A complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors results in the disruption of the skin barrier, introduction of foreign antigens, and a shift toward TH2-dominant conditions. Providing safe and effective treatment has proven to be a challenge for both allopathic and naturopathic physicians. Common medications for AD include low to high potency topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), and immunosuppressants. These only address pruritus and have side effects related to their strength and duration of use, which need to be minimized. What are some of the other challenges of treating AD and how do we begin to address them? 1) Modifying Genetic Predisposition Loss-of-function mutations resulting in decreased filaggrin and genetic variation in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes have been shown to cause predisposition to eczema [2,3]. The expression of the TLR billion cfu/day) from 35 weeks gestation until 2 years of age significantly protected against eczema and this outcome was preserved at ages 2, 4, 6, and 11[4]. HN001 interacted with 26 TLR that reduced and 20 TLR SNPs that positively impacted atopic sensitization[3]. 2) Identifying Environmental Factors Early environmental factors set the stage and continue to influence AD pathogenesis. Cross- talk between the microbiome and immune system early in life is affected by vaginal birth, anti-biotic use, stress, pollutants, and diet [6-8]. Supporting women post-C- section, limiting antibiotic use, and working on managing stress are beneficial. Nutrition can also affect the severity of AD and should be part of a treatment plan. A systematic review of micronutrients in AD found that vitamin D supplementation provided benefit, and selenium and zinc deficiencies worsened AD severity [9].It is also important to figure out if there are IgE allergies if that hasn't yet been determined. Skin prick or blood tests should be carried out to identify any IgE allergies. Allergens should be avoided if possible. Desensitizing treatments, such as SLIT, can also be considered [10]. While patients with AD often have food allergies early in life, they tend to develop asthma and allergic rhinitis in later years[11]. Probiotics and prebiotics to support gut microbiota and immune modulation can reduce the risk of atopic conditions later in life[12,13]. Leaky gut often has to be addressed as well in children with AD as intestinal hyper- permeability can play a role in atopy[14]. 3) Providing Symptomatic Relief Reducing pruritis can limit scratching and prevent further barrier disruption. Ceramides found in the skin have anti-microbial and immune signalling activity[15]. Reduced ceramides lead to impaired hydration and immune function leading to bacterial infection, which leads to inflammation and irritation, and further infection - a vicious cycle. Effective ingredients such as ceramide and oat colloid should be used in salve/ emollient/ lotion right after bathing. Bathing twice daily and moisturizing has been shown to reduce SCORAD scores when compared to twice- weekly[15]. Applying wet wrapping after emollient for a minimum of 28 days has shown noticeable improvement[16]. Intermittent applications of topical corticosteroids (e.g. two consecutive days/week or a 2-day break between applications) can be helpful in controlling flare-ups while minimizing the risk of developing resistance to the therapy or infections[17]. Although researchers are discovering other prurinogens involved in AD besides histamine, preventing or reducing histamine release may help reduce pruritus[18]. Vitamin C and quercetin can be used to achieve this[19,20]. Night-time pruritus means sleep quality can be a challenge for patients with AD[21]. Prolonged sleep deficiency causes chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and has been linked to various inflammatory diseases[22]. Abnormal melatonin levels have been found in both pediatric and adult patients with AD[23,24]. Studies have shown melatonin supplementation (3 mg/day) can reduce AD severity and improve sleep in children and teenagers[25,26]. 4) Optimizing Patient Compliance The complicated nature of AD treatments reduces compliance[27]. Treating AD is a long- term uphill battle and adherence lessens with extended duration so realistic expectations need to be communicated [28,29]. Patient and caregiver education is an extremely important part of an effective AD treatment plan. Educational intervention alone has been shown to decrease SCORAD scores, improve emotional coping, itching behaviour, and subjective assessment of disease severity[29]. Written action plans resulted in superior patient knowledge when compared to verbal instruction[30]. Education around non-atopic comorbidities of AD is important as well. Certain mental health conditions are more common in pediatric AD patients, including anxiety, depression, increased risk of suicidal ideation, and ADHD[31]. Effective management of AD, a healthy gut-brain connection, and mindfulness activities are proactive ways to combat these risks[32]. Tolle Totum While at first AD might seem to be just a skin issue, its impacts are deep and broad. Due to the multi-faceted nature of AD, it's important for clinicians to treat the whole person with well-planned strategies, not just the disease itself. Treatment response should be monitored regularly and modified depending on disease progression, patient tolerability, and patient satisfaction.
