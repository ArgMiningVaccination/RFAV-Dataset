ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE EXAMINING COMMITTEE FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS. 1. History. The state examining committee for physical therapists was created in 1959 to assist the state board of medical examiners in the examination and registration of physical therapists in North Dakota. While it operated as a separate committee, it was by law an advisory committee to the state board of medical examiners. The Forty-sixth Legislative Assembly in 1979 revamped most of North Dakota Century Code chapter 43-26 on physical therapists, and in the process made the committee a separate entity with complete jurisdiction over the examination and registration of physical therapists. 2. Committee membership. The committee consists of six persons appointed by the governor. Three committee members must be registered physical therapists, two members must be licensed physicians, and one member must be a nonhealth care professional. The health care appointments are to be made from lists submitted by the North Dakota physical therapy association and the state board of medical examiners, and the citizen member is to be an at large appointment by the governor. Committee terms are to be staggered and are for five years. Possible nominations to the committee will be solicited by the committee's secretary from all registered physical therapists in the state at the time notices for registration renewal are sent out. 3. Meetings. The committee shall hold at least one annual meeting, and such other meetings as may be called by the president. Any committee member who fails to attend two consecutive annual meetings shall have been deemed to have resigned unless the member has reasons satisfactory to the committee for being unable to attend. 4. Compensation. Committee members shall receive expenses from committee funds for each day or a portion thereof spent in committee work as provided for other state officers in North Dakota Century Code chapter 44-08. 5. Secretary. North Dakota Century Code section 43-26-05 authorizes the committee to designate a secretary, who does not have to be a committee member, and to compensate any person it hires to administer the committee's duties. 46 The committee's secretary is: Ms. Lynn G.

RATES FOR PURCHASES. 1. Rates for purchases shall: Law Implemented NDCC 49-02-02 a. Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest; and b. Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities. 2. Nothing in this chapter requires any electric utility to pay more than the avoided costs for purchases. 3. Relationship to avoided costs. a. For purposes of this subsection, \"new capacity\" means any purchase from capacity of a qualifying facility, construction of which was commenced on or after November 9, 1978. b. Subject to subdivision c, a rate for purchases satisfies the requirements of subsections 1 and 2 if the rate equals the avoided costs determined after consideration of the factors set forth in subsection 6. c. A rate for purchases (other than from new capacity) may be less than the avoided cost if the commission determines that a lower rate is consistent with subsections 1 and 2, and is sufficient to encourage cogeneration and small power production. 73 d. Rates for purchases from new capacity shall be in accordance with subdivision b, regardless of whether the electric utility making such purchase is simultaneously making sales to the qualifying facility. e. In the case in which the rates for purchases are based upon estimates of avoided costs over the specific term of the contract or other legally enforceable obligation, the rates for such purchases do not violate this chapter if the rates for such purchases differ from avoided costs at the time of delivery. 4. Standard rates for purchases. a. There shall be put into electric utility) standard qualifying facilities with hundred kilowatts or less. effect (with respect to each rates for purchases from a design capacity of one b. There may be put into effect standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of more than one hundred kilowatts. c. The standard rates for purchases under this subsection: (1) Shall be consistent with subsections 1, 2, and 6; and (2) May differentiate among qualifying facilities using various technologies on the basis of the supply characteristics~of the different technologies. 5. Purchases \"as available\" or pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation. Each qualifying facility shall have the option either: a. To provide energy as the qualifying facility determines such energy to be available for such purchases, in which case the rates for such purchases shall be based on the purchasing utility's avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or b. To provide energy or capacity pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation for the delivery of energy or capacity over a specified term, in which case the rates for such purchases shall at the option of the qualifying facility exercised prior to the beginning of the specified term, be based on either: (1) The avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or (2) The avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred. 74 6. Factors affecting rates for purchases. In determining avoided costs, the following factors shall, to the extent practicable, be taken into account: a. The data provided pursuant to 18 C.F.R. 292.302, including commission review of any such data; b. The availability of capacity or energy from a qualifying facility during the system daily and seasonal peak periods, including: (1) The ability of the utility to dispatch the qualifying facility; (2) The expected or demonstrated reliability of the qualifying facility; (3) The terms enforceable obligation, sanctions for of any contract obligation, including termination notice noncompliance; or other legally the duration of the requirements and (4) The extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facility can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the utility's facilities; (5) The usefulness of energy and capacity supplied from a qualifying facility during system emergencies, including its ability to separate its load from its generation; (6) The individual and aggregate value capacity from qualifying facilities on utility's system; and of energy and the electric (7) The smaller capacity increments and the shorter lead times available with additions of capacity from qualifying facilities. c. The relationship of the availability of energy or capacity from the qualifying facility, as derived in subdivision b, to the ability of the electric utility to avoid costs, including the deferral of capacity additions and the reduction of fossil fuel use; and d. The costs or savings resulting from variations in line losses from those that would have existed in the absence of purchases from a qualifying facility, if the purchasing electric utility generated an equivalent amount of energy itself or purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity. 7. Periods during which purchases not required. 75 a. Any electric utility which gives notice pursuant to subdivision b will not be required to purchase electric energy or capacity during any period during which, due to operational circumstances, purchases from qualifying facilities will result in costs greater than those which the utility would incur if it did not make such purchases, but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy itself. b. Any electric utility seeking to invoke subdivision a of this subsection must notify, in writing, each affected qualifying facility in time for the qualifying facility to cease the delivery of energy or capacity to the electric utility, and must also send a copy of the notice to the commission. c. Any electric utility which fails to comply with the provisions of subdivision b will be required to pay the same rate for such purchase of energy or capacity as would be required had the period described in subdivision a of this subsection not occurred. d. A claim by an electric utility that such a period has occurred or will occur is subject to such verification by the commission as the commission determines necessary or appropriate, either before or after the occurrence.

Upon request of a qualifying facility, each electric utility shall provide: (1) Supplementary power; (2) Backup power; (3) Maintenance power; and (4) Interruptible power. b. The commission may waive any requirement of subdivision a if, after notice in the area served by the electric utility and after opportunity for public comment, the electric utility demonstrates and the commission finds that compliance with such requirement will: (1) Impair the electric utility's ability to render adequate service to its customers; or (2) Place an undue burden on the electric utility. 3. Rates for sales of backup and maintenance power. The rate for sales of backup power or maintenance power: a. Shall not be based upon an assumption (unless supported by factual data) that forced outages or other reductions in electric output by all qualifying facilities on an electric utility's system will occur simultaneously, or during the system peak, or both; and b. Shall take outages of coordinated facilities. into account the extent to which scheduled the qualifying facilities can be usefully with scheduled outages of the utility's History: Effective June 1, 1981.

(2) percent of that income of the ineligible medical assistance unit in the home which exceeds the appropriate medical assistance income level will be deemed to be available to an eligible individual residing in a specialized facility. Income is not otherwise deemed to be available to persons who live outside of the home of the medical assistance unit on other than a temporary basis. or parental resources will be deemed as available to those aged, blind, or disabled individuals as set out in saeseetieas subdivisions b and c. d. Resources. The following property provisions will be applied in determining eligibility for medical assistance. In all instances, including determinations of equity, property must be realistically evaluated in accord with current market value. Any reasonable costs which may be associated with liquidation of excess property must be taken into account: 142 (1) The home. The home e\u00a3 occupied by the individual or family will be exempt in determining eligibility for medical assistance. The home is defined as including the land on which it is located, providing the acreage does not exceed one hundred sixty contiguous acres [64.75 hectares] if rural or two acres [.81 hectares] if located in town. Acreage in excess of these amounts would be declared \"real property other than home\". The home will be considered occupied and exempt if the individual or family is temporarily absent but actually intends and is able to return within a reasonable length of time. (2) Real property other than the home.

An individual who is merely receiving rental or lease income from property is not eligible for this exemption. An individual is actively engaged in utilizing property if the individual contributes 143 significant current personal labor in utilizing the property for income-producing purposes. The payment of social security taxes on the income from such current personal labor is an indicator of the active utilization of the property.

(c) However, an individual would be actively engaged in utilizing such property if the individual contributed significant current personal labor in utilizing such property for income-producing purposes. The payment of social security taxes on the income from such current personal labor is an indicator of the active utilization of such property. (3) Personal property resources.

These amounts will not be considered as being available for medical expenses. (5) There is a presumption that the holder's interest in contractural rights to receive payment, including, but not limited to, the seller's interest in a long-term contract for the sale of real property, promissory notes, mortgages, and accounts receivable, is salable without working an undue hardship. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence demonstrating all of the following: (a) The holder's interest was publicly advertised for sale in a newspaper of general circulation, the circulation area of which includes any real property underlying the holder's interest, which advertisement was published successively for two weeks if the newspaper is a weekly publication, and for one week if the newspaper is a daily publication. (b) The advertisement included, at a minimum, a legal description of any real property underlying the holder's interest; a statement of a minimum price at which the holder's interest will be sold, which price shall not exceed seventy-five percent of the determined discounted value of that interest or thirty thousand dollars, whichever is less; and the name, address, and telephone number of a person who will answer inquiries and receive offers. (c) The sworn statement of the applicant, recipient, or the applicant's or recipient's representative, that no offers were received which equaled or exceeded the minimum amount identified in subparagraph b. e. Disqualifying transfers. (1) Every person who before or after making application for medical assistance gives an assignment or makes a transfer of the person's property (whether real or personal er-8otk property or liquid assets, or a combination thereof) for the purpose of rendering oneself eligible for medical assistance is thereby rendered ineligible. (2) The intent of the person making such a transfer is the basis for determining eligibility for medical assistance. 146 (3) There are legitimate instances when property transfers may be valid when related to a particular set of circumstances. The applicant or recipient should be given full opportunity to state the reasons for having made the transfer of property and this evidence should in turn be considered in relation to the following questions: (a) Was adequate consideration received? (b) How recent was the transfer? Caution on this point is advised since very recent transfers may in some instances be entirely acceptable insofar as eligibility for medical assistance is concerned. (c) Is the applicant's or recipient's stated purpose reasonable in view of the circumstances prevailing at the time of transfer? (d) Would it have been reasonable to anticipate that the transfer of property at the time it occurred would result in an earlier need for assistance? (e) Were benefits available to the applicant or recipient from the transferee that were contingent upon the transfer of the property? (f) Did the transferee have equitable interest in the to the transferee? a legal or otherwise property transferred (4) A transfer of property for less than adequate consideration, made either within two years prior to the application for medical assistance or after a previous application has been made and denied because of excess property resources, shall be presumed to have been made for the purpose of rendering the applicant eligible for medical assistance. This presumption may be rebutted by substantial evidence of an intent which is inconsistent with the presumed intent. f. There shall be a flexible measurement of available income which will be applied in the following order or priority: (1) First, for maintenance, so that amount at or below the established protected for maintenance. any income in an level will be (2) Next;-paymeats Payments made for noncovered necessary current medical and remedial care will be deducted. 147 (3) Reasonable work-related expenses for producing any earned income will be deducted. (4) Finally, payments made for necessary health insurance coverage will be deducted. (5) All of the remaining excess income will be applied to costs of medical assistance included in the state plan. g. All income and resources will be considered in establishing eligibility and in the flexible application of income to medical costs not in the state plan, and payment toward the medical assistance costs. (1) The state agency or local agency under supervision of the state agency will take reasonable measures to ascertain any legal liability of third parties arising after March 31, 1968, for the medical care and services included under the plan, the need for which arises out of injury, disease, or disability of applicants for or recipients of medical assistance. (2) The state or local agency, in determining whether medical assistance is payable, will treat any third party liability as a current resource when such liability is found to exist and payment by the third party has been made or will be made within a reasonable time. (3) The state or local agency will not withhold reimbursement from a third party for assistance provided when the party's liability is established after assistance is granted and in any other case in which the liability of a third party existed but was not treated as a current resource. In such cases, the state and local agency shall require the applicant or recipient to execute all necessary documents to protect rights to subsequent reimbursements. Failure of any applicant or recipient to execute any such documents shall be considered adequate grounds for ineligibility for medical assistance. (4) The state or local agency will seek reimbursement from a third party for assistance provided when the party's liability is established after assistance is granted and in any other case in which the liability of a third party existed, but was not treated as a current resource. (5) Each applicant or recipient shall execute all necessary documents to protect his, or the state 148 agency's, rights to subsequent reimbursement as a condition of eligibility. h. Only such income and resources as are actually available will be considered; income and resources will be reasonably evaluated. i. The financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant or recipient of medical assistance will be limited to the responsibility of spouse for spouse, and parents for ekilerea a child under age twenty-one, or blind, or permanently and totally disabled. Such responsibility is imposed on applicants and recipients of medical assistance as a condition of eligibility under the state plan. j. An applicant or recipient must take all necessary steps to obtain any annuities, pensions, unemployment compensation, veteran's benefits, and retirement and disability benefits to which the applicant or recipient may be entitled, unless the applicant or recipient can show good cause for not doing so. 3. Blindness and disability. a. The federal definition of the terms \"blind\" and \"disabled\" as used by the social security administration in the supplemental security income program shall be used in all applicable eligibility determinations. b. The following is the state's definition of blindness in terms of ophthalmic measurement: An individual is considered blind if the individual has central vision acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with correcting glasses or a field defect in which the peripheral field has contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of visual field subtends an angular distance of no greater than twenty degrees. c. In any instance in which a determination is to be made whether an individual is blind according to the state's definition, there will be an examination by a physician skilled in the diseases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the individual may select. d. Each eye examination report form will state supervising ophthalmologist who is the agency's decision that the applicant meet the state's definition of blindness. 149 be reviewed by a responsible for does or does not e. The following is the state's definition of permanent and total disability, showing that: (1) \"permanently\" is related to the duration of the impairment or combination of impairments; (2) \"totally\" is related to the degree of disability; and (3) \"permanently and totally disabled\" means that the individual has some permanent physical or mental impairment, disease, or loss, or combination thereof, that substantially precludes the individual from engaging in useful occupations within the individual's competence, such as holding a job. Under this definition: \"Permanently\" refers to a condition which is not likely to improve or which will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual; it may be a condition which is not likely to respond to any known therapeutic procedures, or a condition which is likely to remain static or to become worse unless certain therapeutic measures are carried out, where treatment is unavailable, inadvisable, or is refused by the individual on a reasonable basis; \"permanently\" does not rule out the possibility of vocational rehabilitation or even possible recovery in light of future medical advances or changed prognosis; in this sense the term refers to a condition which continues indefinitely, as distinct from one which is temporary or transient. \"Totally\" involves considerations in addition to those verified through the medical findings, such as age, training, skills, and work experience, and the probable functioning of the individual in the individual's particular situation in light of the individual's impairment; an individual's disability would usually be tested in relation to ability to engage in remunerative employment; the ability to keep house or to care for others would be the appropriate test for (and only for) individuals, such as housewives, who were engaged in this occupation prior to the disability and do not have a history of gainful employment; eligibility may continue, even after a period of rehabilitation and readjustment, if the individual's work capacity is still very considerably limited (in comparison with that of a normal person) in terms of such factors as the speed with which the individual can work, the amount the individual can produce in a given period of time, and the number of hours the individual is able to work. f. Each medical report form and social history will be reviewed by technically competent persons, not less than a physician and a social worker qualified by professional training and pertinent experience, acting cooperatively, who are responsible for the agency's decision that the applicant does or does not meet the appropriate definition of blindness or disability. The agency shall decline to determine blindness or disability when such determination can be made pursuant to the processing of a supplemental 150 security security purpose. income benefit's administration application by the social or its contractee for that History: Amended effective January 1, 1980; amended effective February 1, 1980; amended effective February 1, 1981.

Each facility shall maintain a formal set of accounting records which shall be maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A double entry form of accounting system is recommended for all facilities. However, a single entry accounting system, properly maintained, will 174 also be considered acceptable. (Suggested headings for a simple single entry system are contained in Appendix A.) 6. The accounting system must be maintained in such a manner that cost accounts will be grouped by cost center and be readily traceable to the reporting form. Organizations which maintain more than one facility must also maintain separate cost records identifiable with each facility. 7. If a facility fails to file the required statistical report on or before the due date, total allowable costs, for rate calculation purposes, shall be reduced by ten dollars for each calendar day of delinquency. This fiscal sanction may be waived by the director of economic assistance of the social service board upon a showing of good cause for the delinquency. 8. In order to properly validate the accuracy and reasonableness of cost information reported by the facility, the state will provide for an onsite audit each year. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC 75-02-07-03: Sets forth, in five subsections, allowable compensation for managerial, administrative, professional, or other services when those services are rendered by sole proprietors, partners, and corporate employees charged with the responsibility of administration in a home for the aged and infirm, establishes recordkeeping requirements related to salaries, and requires the Social Service Board staff to make a survey of administrator compensation every two years. 75-02-07-03. SALARIES. 1. The facility must provide, within their accounting records, adequate detail to show salaries as follows: a. Administrative. b. Plant. c. Services, including personal care, dietary, laundry, housekeeping, and any other service-related salary. 175 2. The allowance of compensation for services of sole proprietors and partners is the amount determined to be the reasonable value of the services rendered regardless of whether there is any actual distribution of the profits of the business. The limits set forth in subsection 5 will be allowable for sole proprietors and partners except that operator compensation may not exceed the facility's net profit for the period. 3. The allowance of compensation for managerial, administrative, and other services related to resident care is limited to the reasonable value regardless of the form in which it is paid. Compensation of this type must be documented. Any salaries accrued at year end must be paid within the first seventy-five days of the new fiscal year to be considered an allowable cost of the previous year. 4. Services which are not related either directly or indirectly to resident care (those provided primarily for the purpose of managing or improving the owner's financial investment) will not be recognized as an allowable cost. 5. Administrator compensation shall be determined, by survey, every two years. Survey data will be revised, at least annually, to reflect changes in the consumer price index (all items U.S. City Average). Reasonable administrator compensation shall be limited to the least of (a) the compensation actually paid, (b) the ninetieth percentile cost per licensed bed per year, or (c) the ninetieth percentile salary. History: Effective April 1, 1981. 75-02-07-04: Sets forth, in five subsections, the methods of depreciation and amounts of depreciation which will be recognized as costs to the home for the aged and infirm. 75-02-07-04. DEPRECIATION. 1. The principles of reimbursement for provider costs require that payment for services should include depreciation on all depreciable type assets that are used to provide covered service to general assistance recipients. Costs acceptable for depreciation purposes shall be based on actual cost of the fixed assets. Proper records shall be maintained by the facility to provide accountability for the fixed assets and 176 also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable resident-related cost. Tagging of major equipment items is not mandatory, but alternative records must exist to satisfy audit verification of the existence and location of the assets. Lack of adequate records will result in depreciation costs being excluded from the rate computation. A depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. 2. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. All accelerated methods of depreciation are unacceptable. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and detailed schedules of individual assets shall be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the form 19, a reconciliation shall be prepared. 3. The depreciable life of an asset is its expected useful life to the provider; not necessarily the inherent useful or physical life. If a difference is considered, a salvage value should be established prior to the application of the depreciation rate. The useful life is determined in the light of the provider's experience and the general nature of the asset and other pertinent data. In projecting a useful life, providers may follow the useful life guidelines published by the American hospital association. A different useful life may be used; however, when the useful life selected differs significantly from that established by the guidelines, the deviation must be based on convincing reasons supported by adequate documentation, generally describing the realization of some unexpected event. Depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system, may not be used for purposes of reimbursement. A composite useful life may be used for a class or group of assets. 4. If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, an estimated useful life of at least two years and historical cost of at least one hundred fifty dollars, or if it is acquired in quantity and the cost of the quantity is at least three hundred dollars, its cost must be capitalized and written off ratibly over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cost during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, interest, etc., should be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. 5. Major repair costs on equipment or buildings capitalized if the repairs have increased the useful the asset by at least two years. History: Effective April 1, 1981. 177 must be life of General Authority NDCC 50-18-02, 50-18-06 75-02-07-05: Sets forth, in four subsections, the types of interest expense which will be treated as costs to the home for the aged and infirm. 75-02-07-05. INTEREST EXPENSE. 1. To be allowable, interest must be supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required, identifiable in the provider's accounting records, related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred, necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider's facilities and used therein. 2. In such cases where it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shall be accounted for and written off over the life of the bond issue. 3. Interest paid by the provider to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider is not allowable as a cost. Where the owner's funds are used in a business, the funds are considered invested funds or capital, rather than borrowed funds. ~. Where the provider has invested funds from gifts or grants which are unrestricted as to use, and these funds are commingled with other funds, the provider's allowable interest expense is reduced by the amount of investment income earned by the funds. Any investment income in excess of interest expense will not be used to offset other operating expenses. However, if the gifts and grants are not commingled with other funds, the investment income earned by the fund does not reduce allowable interest expense. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC 50-18-02, \u00a7 75-02-07-06: Disallows consideration of rental expense paid to a related organization, but allows the cost of ownership of the facility to be treated as an expense. 75-02-07-06. RENTAL EXPENSE. A provider may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of the principles of reimbursement. In such case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider is not allowable as cost. The provider, however, would include the cost of ownership of the facility. Generally, these would be costs such as depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and other expenses attributable to the leased facility. The effect is to treat the facility as though it were owned by the provider. Therefore, the owner's equity in the leased assets is includable in the equity capital of the provider and is further used in the calculation of return on investment for proprietary homes. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC two subsections, for the allowance or disallowance of various kinds of taxes as costs to the home for the aged and infirm. 75-02-07-07. TAXES. 1. Except as provided in subsection 2, taxes assessed against the provider, in accordance with the levying enactments of the several states and lower levels of government and for which the provider is liable for payment, are allowable costs. Tax expense does not include fines and penalties. Whenever exemptions to taxes are legally available, the provider is to take advantage of them. If the provider does not take advantage of available exemptions, the expense incurred for such taxes are not recognized as allowable costs under the program. 2. The following taxes, which are levied on providers, are not allowable as costs: a. Federal income and excess profit taxes, including any interest or penalties paid thereon. b. State or local income and excess profit taxes. 179 c. Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, or refunding operations, such as taxes in the issuance of bonds, property transfers, issuance or transfers of stocks, etc. Generally, these costs are either amortized over the life of the securities or depreciated over the life of the asset. They are not, however, recognized as tax expense. d. Special assessments on land which represents improvements such as sewers, water, and pavements, be capitalized. capital should e. Taxes on property which is not used in the rendering of covered services. f. Taxes, such as sales taxes, levied against the resident and collected and remitted by the provider. g. Self-employment (FICA) taxes applicable to individual proprietors, partners, members of a joint venture, etc. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC \u00a7 75-02-07-08: Requires reporting of actual costs when services are rendered to a facility by a parent organization. 75-02-07-08. HOME OFFICE COSTS. Facilities which are directly related to a parent organization and have services provided to them for legal, accounting, and management assistance will be allowed to report the cost for these services only if the facility provides, with the cost report 19, the actual computation of the cost to the facility by the parent organization. Actual cost to the parent organization is the only cost which will be allowed for reimbursement purposes to the facility preparing the cost report. If the documentation does not accompany the cost report, this cost item will be eliminated from the reimbursement rate until such time as the cost data is received by the provider audit unit. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC 50-18-02, OF \u00a7 75-02-07-09: Establishes limits on fees to be paid to a facility's board of directors consistent with those limits set on legislative council members. 75-02-07-09. BOARD OF DIRECTORS' FEES. The fees paid to members of a board of directors for meetings attended shall be allowable in an amount not to exceed the maximum permitted compensation to members of the legislative council pursuant to subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 54-35-10, with additional compensation for mileage and travel expense not to exceed the maximum allowed for state officials pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 54-06-09. In addition, a maximum of twenty-four meetings per fiscal year will be considered reasonable. One meeting shall consist of any number of days required to transact the required business of the home. Any exceptions to the stated number of meetings shall be considered by the auditor in charge during the onsite audit and a determination made at that time. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC \u00a7 75-02-07-10: Allows certain formal annuity or pension plan costs to be treated as an allowable cost for reimbursement purposes. 75-02-07-10. ANNUITIES AND PENSIONS. Annuity and pension cost will be considered an allowable cost for reimbursement purposes if the facility formally adopts a plan and this plan is conveyed and open to all eligible employees. An eligible employee is anyone that has been employed by the facility for the required minimum period of time that is called for in the established plan. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC \u00a7 75-02-07-11: Limits costs of dues, subscriptions, and advertising to those directly related to resident care. 181 75-02-07-11. DUES, SUBSCRIPTIONS, PUBLIC RELATIONS, AND ADVERTISING. Costs of dues, subscriptions, and advertising are allowable only if directly related to resident care. Dues to fraternal organizations are not allowable. Subscriptions should be those of a type which will benefit the residents of the facility or which will keep administration on a current level with facilities of this type in their area. Public relations costs will not be considered as an allowable cost for reimbursement. Advertising costs will be considered for those items which include soliciting for employees. Other advertising costs will not be considered allowable for reimbursement purposes. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC \u00a7 75-02-07-12: Permits capitalized startup costs to be recognized as allowable costs when depreciated over 60 consecutive months starting with the month in which the first resident is admitted for care. 75-02-07-12. STARTUP COSTS. 1. In the first stages of operation, a new institution incurs certain costs in developing its ability to care for residents prior to admissions of residents. Staff is obtained, organized, and other operating costs are incurred during this time of preparation which cannot be allocated to resident care during the period because there are no residents rece~v~ng services. These costs are commonly referred to as startup costs. These costs must be capitalized and amortized over sixty consecutive months starting with the month in which the first resident is admitted for treatment. 2. In establishing the rate for the facility in the first twelve months of operation, budgeted costs for services will be considered and administrative costs, plant costs, and property costs shall be considered at eighty-five percent of licensed beds times the number of days in the first twelve months of operation. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC 50-18-02, OF \u00a7 75-02-07-13: Establishes a profit allowance for proprietary homes for the aged and infirm. 75-02-07-13. RETURN ON INVESTMENT. In order to provide for a return on investment for proprietary homes, an allowance of eight and one-half percent of net investment of fixed assets relating to resident care will be established. To compute the amount on which the percentage of return is applied, begin with the costs of fixed assets relating to resident care. Deduct therefrom the accumulated depreciation. This will produce the net fixed assets relating to resident care. From this amount deduct the balance of notes and mortgages payable pertaining to the fixed assets relating to resident care. The result will be the net investment which is eligible for the percentage of return. This allowance of the return on an investment will be made on form 19, annual statement of reimbursable cost. History: Effective April 1, 1981. General 75-02-07-14: Provides, in two subsections, for the keeping of a daily census record at the facility, and establishes guidelines for the keeping of that census. 75-02-07-14. RESIDENT CENSUS. 1. A resident day is any day that the facility has received remuneration for the available bed. The amount of remuneration has no bearing on whether a day should be counted or not. 2. A daily census record must be maintained by the facility to allow for proper audit of the census data. A suggested form would be a register allowing for listing of all rooms available and their occupants. The register would allow for a daily tally of in-house residents, hospital residents (when paid for), and therapeutic leave days. This register would provide for a daily census total and also a resident total which could be used as a billing at month end. Examples of days that must be included in census, providing they have been paid for, are hospital days and therapeutic leave days. In the case where a private room has been made of a previously utilized double room and a rate has been charged that does not correspond to a normal private room rate, two resident days would be counted for this room. History: Effective April 1, 1981. 183 General Authority NDCC 75-02-07-15: Provides, in 13 subsections, for the treatment of certain income items which will offset costs. 75-02-07-15. ADJUSTMENT TO COST. Several items of income to the home must be considered as offsets against various costs as recorded in the books of the facility. Basically, any income which is received by the home for reimbursements of cost, with the exception of the basic daily rate and income from charges to private pay residents for care items which are included in the rate, will be offset against costs reported. The following list details many of the items which must be offset, but any reimbursement not so listed which may be classified as an offset must be shown as such on form 19 and costs reduced accordingly. 1. Activities income -Income from activities department and the gift shop to the extent that it does not exceed the expenses as reported. 2. Confections items. All income from the sale of pop, candy, or other 3. Dietary Amounts received from or on behalf of employees, guests, or other nonresidents for lunches, meals, or snacks. 4.

Also creates exceptions for medical referrals and emergencies, and grants a right to appeal the imposition of a \"lock-in\". 75-02-02-11. LOCK-IN. 1. For the purpose of this section: a. \"Lock-in\" means the process used to limit a particular aspect or aspects of an individual recipient's medical care and treatment to a single physician or other provider in order to prevent the continued misutilization of benefits. b. \"Medical emergency11 means the sudden and unexpected onset of a medical condition for which the recipient secures care after onset, or as soon thereafter as care is reasonably available. c. \"Misutilization\" means the incorrect, improper, or excessive utilization of medical care and services, at the recipient's instance and request, which may, in some instances, increase the possibility of adverse reactions, interactions, or disadvantageous effects. d. e. \"Primary physician/provider\" means the physician or provider selected by the locked-in recipient to provide care and treatment to the recipient. \"Provider\" means any individual or entity furnishing medical or remedial care or service under a provider agreement with the division of medical services. 187 2. Lock-in may be imposed by the division of medical services on an individual recipient who has demonstrated misutilization including, but not limited to: a. Excessive visitations to more than one physician or other practitioner where there is little or no evidence of a need for medical care. b. Excessive drug acquisition whether or not detrimental to health, which results from seeing more than one physician or prescribing practitioner. c. Excessive utilization of outpatient services where no medical emergency is present. 3. Lock-in shall be imposed using the following procedures: a.

Such a consultation with a the provision of which the recipient b. The following factors shall be considered in determining if lock-in is to be imposed: (1) Seriousness and extent of misutilization; (2) The historical utilization pattern of the recipient; (3) The recipient's willingness to adhere to voluntary utilization controls; and (4) The availability of a primary physician/provider. c. Upon a determination to impose a lock-in, the appropriate county social service board will: (1) Provide the recipient with written notice of the lock-in, of the recipient's right to choose the primary physician/provider, of the recipient's responsibility for payment for medical care rendered by providers other than the primary physician/provider, and of the recipient's right to appeal; (2) Obtain the recipient's physician/provider; and selection of primary (3) Document the interview in the case record. 188 d. A lock-in may be imposed only on individual recipients and cannot be imposed on the entire medical assistance unit. If more than one individual within a unit is misutilizing medical care, each individual must be treated separately. e. A lock-in will be imposed for the next twelve months of the recipient's liability, whether those twelve months occur consecutively or otherwise, unless the case requires an unrestricted time period. f. No medical assistance payment will be made for medical care or services of the misutilized type furnished to the lock-in recipient by any provider other than the recipient's primary physician/provider, except for: (1) Medical care rendered in a medical or surgical emergency; or (2) Medical care rendered by a provider upon referral by the primary physician/provider. 4. A recipient has the right to appeal the decision to impose a lock-in. The appeal may be made in the manner provided by chapter 75-01-03. History: Effective May 1, 1981.

Compensation in corporate facilities. a. For purposes of determining whether the total compensation paid is reasonable, compensation as defined herein means remuneration paid regardless of the form in which it is paid. Compensation may be included in allowable provider costs only to the extent that it represents reasonable remuneration for managerial, administrative, professional, and other services related to the operation of the facility and rendered in connection with patient care. Services rendered in connection with patient care include both direct and indirect activities in the provision and supervision of patient care, such as administration, management, and supervision of the overall institution. Compensation of this type must be documented, especially in circumstances where there is an administrator of the facility that would normally be charged with the direct and indirect activities. Services which are not related to either direct or indirect patient care are those primarily for the purpose of managing or improving the owners financial investment, and will not be recognized as an allowable cost. b. Reasonableness requires that the compensation allowance be such an amount as would ordinarily be paid for comparable 193 services by comparable institutions depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Reasonableness also requires that functions performed be necessary in that, had the services not been rendered, an institution would have had to employ another person to perform them. The services must be pertinent to the operation and sound conduct of the institution. The social service board shall determine reasonable administrator compensation by survey, every two years, to be the least of (1) the compensation actually paid, (2) the ninetieth percentile cost per licensed bed per year, or (3) the ninetieth percentile salary. Percentiles shall be calculated separately for facilities of less than seventy-five beds, and those of seventy-five or more beds. Reasonable compensation data will be revised at least annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index (all items U.S. city average). c. Items which are considered compensation and includable in the test for reasonable compensation received by an administrator include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Salary amounts paid for managerial, administrative, professional, and other services. (2) Amounts paid by the institution for the personal benefits of the administrator or owner-administrator, e.g., housing allowance, flat-rate automobile allowance. (3) The cost of administrator institution. assets and services which the owner\u00ad or administrator receives from the (4) Deferred compensation (pension and annuities). (5) Supplies and services for the personal use of the administrator or owner-administrator. (6) The wages of a domestic or other employee who works in the home of the administrator or owner-administrator. (7) Insurance premiums paid for the owner-administrator or administrator (life and health insurance). 3. Travel costs which are incurred in the course of normal operations of the nursing facility and result in providing the required transportation of the residents of the home will be considered. The cost must be patient related and reasonable. All travel costs not related to local transportation needs 194 will require documentation to justify the cost and to indicate how the expenditure is patient related. a. Travel costs for administrators will be allowed in order that they may attend meetings which pertain to patient care, home office visits, and board meetings for associations. Allowable travel costs shall not exceed the maximum allowed pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 54-06-09. b. The fees paid to members of a board of directors for meetings attended shall be allowed in an amount not to exceed \u00a3i\u00a3~y--~we--deiiars-per-day the compensation paid, per day, to members of the legislative council, pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 54-35-10, plus travel at a rate not to exceed the maximum allowed pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 54-06-09. Normally, no more than twenty-four meetings per fiscal year will be considered reasonable. Any exceptions to the stated number of meetings must be presented for the consideration of the auditor in charge during the onsite audit. A determination of the reasonableness of any additional meeting expenses will be made at that time. 4. All plans within the definition of deferred compensation and pension plans set forth in HIM-15 sections 2140.1 and 2142.1, respectively, shall be considered in the determination of allowable costs. No prov1s1ons of these plans may discriminate in favor of certain employees, such as employees who are officers, stockholders, supervisors, or highly paid personnel. In order to be considered an allowable cost, the payment reported must benefit all eligible employees and be based on the same payment structure.

If certain costs within a particular cost center can be directly identified with the nursing home, then they shall not be subject to allocation procedures as previously outlined. The remaining costs within that cost center shall be allocated according to cost allocation methods as described previously. In no case shall the costs allocated by the methods above exceed those costs which are nursing home costs on the medicare report. 3. Allocation procedures for nursing homes combined with a hospital shall be those set forth in eae-appropriaee--meaieare reg~iaeioas this chapter.

General Authority Law Implemented 196 NDCC 50-24.1-04 a of subsection 3): Establishes a retrospective mechanism for determining salary costs in long-term care facilities, and provides an incentive for facilities to reduce salary costs. 75-02-06-16. REIMBURSEMENT. 1. The method of determining the reimbursement rate per day will be through the use of the prospective ratesetting system. The system requires that the rate be established during the year in which it will be effective with retroactive adjustment to the beginning of the facility's fiscal year. 2. The determination of a prospective rate for all accommodations begins with the actual cost of the facility's operations for the previous fiscal year. Once it has been determined that the costs from the previous year are, in fact, reasonable patient-related costs, adjustments are then applied to the historical cost to determine the prospective rate. Reasonable patient-related costs will be determined with reference to health insurance manual 15 (HIM-15). 3. The historical costs combined with the adjustments take into consideration the economic conditions and trends during the period to be covered by the rate. Costs which are incurred to meet certification standards shall be allowable and included in the determination of the rate. Rate adjustments to provide appropriate compensation may be requested where major unforeseeable expenses are incurred. Such requests may be made to the director of medical services, who shall determine if the expense is patient-related and beyond the control of those responsible for the management of the facilities. The following adjustment methods will be used: a. Salary and fringe benefit costs will be aatieipatee-8ased apea-aetaai-eata-reeerdee-ia-tke-fiaaaeial-reeeres--eariag tke--first--twe--meatks--ef-tke-earreat-fiseal-year-ef-tke faeiiity~ determined as follows: (1) Establish an upper salary limit by dividing the basic salary for the first two months by the number of days in the payroll period, multiplying by the number of days in the fiscal year, and adding salary costs for replacements due to prior year vacations. (2) Add a percentage of any increase over the prior year's salary costs to reflect costs of fringe 197 benefits. The percentage used will be determined by the agency on an annual basis. (3) At the end of a facility's fiscal year, a calculation will be made to determine the actual salary costs. Any facility which limits salary cost to less than the upper limit, but not less than ninety-five percent of the upper limit, will be permitted to treat salary costs as being at the upper limit. If a facility limits its salary cost to less than ninety-five percent of the upper limit, the facility will be permitted to treat salary costs as actual costs plus five percent of the upper limit, and the paid rate will be adjusted to reflect this cost figure. b. Property costs will be included in the rate at the historical amount unless there has been a major change in ownership or construction of the facility requiring certificate of need procedures. c. The other costs of the facility will be projected based upon the historical cost plus the annual percent of increase in the consumer price index as of the facility's fiscal year end. The consumer price index (CPI-U) percentage used is that considered as \"all items.\" (United States city average.) 4. Limitations. a. The appropriate division of the social service board shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by the nursing facilities. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations and incentives for efficiency and economy based on reasonable determination of standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations and incentives may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs of providing services or on specific areas of operations. It shall be the option of the social service board to implement the ceilings so mentioned at any time based upon the statistics available and under guidelines required within the regulations of title XIX. The methods used in determining limitations will be consistent for any or all classes of facilities. Approval will be received from health and human services regional office prior to implementation of additional limitations. b. At such time as federal regulations establish a ceiling on medical rates for skilled nursing facilities, that ceiling 198 shall also be considered the maximum for title XIX payment. c. A facility is expected to maintain an average annual occupancy rate which is based upon its size. Facilities with zero to forty licensed beds should maintain an eighty-five percent occupancy rate; facilities with forty-one to sixty licensed beds should maintain a ninety percent occupancy rate; and facilities with sixty-one and more licensed beds should maintain a ninety-five percent occupancy rate. For facilities with less than the stated percentage for the period under consideration, the number of patient days for rate computation will be computed using the required percentage instead of the lower actual percentage of occupancy. The computed patient days will apply only to the following areas: (1) Administrative costs; (2) Plant operation costs; and (3) Property costs. A reserved paid bed will be counted as an occupied bed. A waiver to the minimum bed occupancy allowance may be made for new facilities or existing facilities which add new beds under a certificate of need during the first year of operation. Consideration will be given in these circumstances to the facts available. d. Administrative cost shall be limited to fifteen percent of total allowable nursing home costs. e. For facilities which do not have an adequate accounting system to allocate costs to the various levels of care, the following methodology is used: (1) In calculating nursing care cost per day, total patient days are rated at a ratio of 1.0 for total skilled care days, .67 for total intermediate care days, and .12 for total custodial care days. (2) Costs other patient days. 5. Rate payments. than nursing are prorated over total (Subject to occupancy requirement.) a. The rate as established shall be considered as payment for all accommodations and includes all items designated as routine services for each level of care. No payments may be solicited or received from the patient or any other person to supplement the rate as established. 199 b. The rate as established shall only be paid if the private pay patients rates for semiprivate accommodations equal or exceed the established rate for medical services patients. The rate being charged private pay patients at the time the services are being or were provided shall govern. In cases where private pay patients are not charged a daily rate, the daily charge will be computed by dividing the total private pay charges for each month by the private pay census for each month. At no time shall the rate paid by medical services exceed the lesser of cost or private pay charges as previously defined. If at any time the facility discounts the private pay patients rate for those periods of time that the patient is not in the facility, the discounted rate may not be lower than the rate as established for medical services patients. If the discounting policy does create a situation in which the private rate is less, then all medical assistance patients shall be afforded a discount in the amount of the difference between the discounted private patient rate and the established medical assistance rate. c. If the medical assistance reimbursement rate exceeds the private payment rate for a particular level of care, on any given date, the social service board shall request a refund from the provider. The refund requested shall be the difference between the private pay rate and medical assistance rate times the number of medical assistance patient days paid during the period in which the medical assistance reimbursement rate exceeded the private pay rate. It shall be the responsibility of the facility to notify medical services if the rate paid is more than that charged private pay patients. d. Overpayments found in audits will be accounted for on the HCFA-64 report no later than the second quarter following the quarter in which found, as provided for in federal regulations. e. Participation in the program will be limited to providers of service who accept, as payment in full, the amounts paid in accordance with the rate structure. f. Rate payments to the facility will be made on a schedule detailed as follows: (1) During the last month of each facility's (LTC) fiscal year a letter will be mailed to them indicating the estimated amount of increase for all homes whose fiscal year ends that month. The home, by responding to this statement in writing, may indicate any amount of increase up to and including the amount specified in the letter. The amount specified in the letter will be based upon the percent of increase in rates 200 determined from the audits of the prior six-month period ending December thirty-first or June thirtieth. In accepting the amount the facility should consider the private pay rate in the facility at that time and their best estimate of cost to be reflected in the ratesetting procedure for the next fiscal year. The rate so indicated by the facility will then be implemented effective the first of that facility's fiscal year. This rate is only an interim rate. (2) Each facility must file an annual report 674 within three months of the end of its fiscal year. Within one month of the receipt of each form 674 it will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy. If the report is filed in a timely manner and if all information requested is present on the report, it will be used as a basis for establishing an interim rate for the facility. The rate so calculated will be based upon the costs as reported plus the percentage of increase in the consumer price index during the twelve-month period ended with the facility's fiscal year. The rate so calculated will be placed in effect as of the start of that facility's fiscal year and shall be considered an interim rate as the result of a desk review. (3) An onsite audit of the facility will be done as a final step in the procedure. At that time the actual rate will be established retroactive to the start of the home's fiscal year. The rate so calculated will be considered the final rate. 6. Adjustments and appeal procedures. a. Rate adjustments may be made to correct errors subsequently determined and shall also be retroactive to the beginning of the facility's fiscal year. b. A final adjustment shall be made for those facilities which have terminated participation in the program and have disposed of all its depreciable assets. In this case the regulations pertaining to gains and losses on disposable assets shall be effective. c. Any requests for reconsideration of the rate should be filed with the division of management services for administrative consideration within thirty days of the date of the rate notification. d. An appeal may be initiated by indicating a desire for an appeal hearing to the appeals referee supervisor, social 201 service board of North Dakota, state capitol. The appeal will be governed by the provisions of chapter 75-01-03. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective July 1, 1981. General Authority NDCC 50-24.1-04 202 Law Implemented 42 "}
