Straus, MD , Director National Center f or Complementar y and Alternative Medicine Preface 5 NOW THE VERY INCREASE IN KNOWLEDGE , THE WEAL TH OF DATABASES AND ANALYTIC TOOLS AND TECHNIQ UES, ARE POINTING TO THE NEED FOR SYNTHESIS PA RT I The Case f or Action Advances in medical science in the 20th centur y, coupled with impr ovements in sanitation and pub lic health, r esulted in dramatic g ains in the health and w ell-being of Americans and a r emarkab le incr ease in a verage life expectanc y from 47 y ears in 1900 to 76 y ears toda y. This stunning success w as largely the r esult of declines in deaths fr om acute le by the de velopment of vaccines and the ad vent of antibiotic dr ugs. To be sur e, new and r e-emer ging infectious diseases r emain serious, both locall y and g loball y, as the AIDS e pidemic has taught us, b ut the c hal\u00ad lenges con medicine1 and come incr eas\u00ad ingly from chronic diseases pr evalent among the g rowing ranks of matur e and older Americans. These adults, more informed and mor e demanding than their f orebears, ha ve high hopes of living long and w ell, fr ee of dis\u00ad ease and disability . Yet man y will e xperience c hronic and de generati ve diseases that can drain their ener gies and incomes, incr ease their pain and suf fering, and diminish their quality of life. Despite impr essive new tr eatments and tec hnologies, c hronic diseases often r esist cur e and e ven symptom r elief. Moreover, the incr eased r eliance on technolog y as w ell as the economic imperati ves and time constraints of manag ed car e mitig ate ag ainst the e xpres\u00ad sions of care and concer n that should c haracterize the ph ysician-patient r elationship , a dialogue that enhances the healing pr ocess bey ond the immediate ef fects of drugs and other tr eatments. These issues ar e emer ging at a time w hen the triumphs of reductionist biolog y are a dail y fact of life, climax ed by the stunning announcement of the sequencing of the human g enome in J une 2000. Indeed, the cumulati ve advances in cell and molecular biolog y over the past f ew decades ha ve helped medicine e volve from ar t toward science. Now the v ery increase in kno wledg e, the w ealth of databases and anal ytic tools and tec hniques, ar e pointing to the need f or synthesis, f or a w ay to put the inf ormation tog ether to understand ho w living or ganisms work as a w hole. For the r esearch scientist, this means the need to balance r eductionism with inte grative biolo\u00ad gy. For the healthcar e provider, it means the need to balance medicine as the science of genes and molecules with medicine as the ar tful interaction of genes, cells, or gan systems, and the w hole person with the social and physical en vironment, w hich tog ether deter mine the state of health and w ell-being of the indi vidual. THE APP EAL OF NONTRADITIONAL APPROACHES Frustrated b y the inability of mainstr eam medicine to meet all their e xpectations and needs, man y people ha ve turned to complementar y and alter native medicine (CAM) appr oaches. These de velopments ha ve been f acilitat\u00ad ed by the r evolution in inf ormation tec hnolog y, which is enab ling easy access to sour ces of CAM inf ormation on the Inter net and in print and electr onic media. The ad vertising and mark eting of alternative and complemen\u00ad tary medicine ha ve also g rown apace, assuring incr eased pub lic awareness and e xposur e to new pr oducts and approaches. Not sur prising ly, mor e and mor e Americans\u2014as man y as 42 per cent of the pub lic accor ding to one recent estimate\u2014ar e adopting CAM appr oaches to satisfy their personal healthcar e needs. Between 1990 and 1997, the number of Americans using CAM incr eased b y 38 per cent fr om 60 million to 83 million. Figur e 1 indicates that visits to CAM practitioners betw een 1990 and 1997 incr eased fr om an estimated 427 million to 629 million, almost half again as man y. Conser vative estimates put e xpenditur es for alter native medicine pr ofes\u00ad sional ser vices at $21.2 billion in 1997, with at least $12.2 billion paid out-of-poc ket. Indeed, Americans spent more out-of-poc ket for CAM than they paid out-of-poc ket for all hospitalizations\u2014an amount comparab le to the pr ojected 1997 out-of-poc ket expenditur es for all U .S. physician ser vices.2 The Case for Action 7 Figure 1 Growth of C AM Visits From 1990 to 1997 the number of adults r eporting use of CAM interv entions increased fr om 60 million to 83 million. While the estimated number of visits to primary car e physicians over the same time period remained stable, visits to CAM practitioners incr eased by 47 per cent, ex ceeding visits to MDs b y 243 million. The fiv e leading r easons for CAM visits w ere back pr ob\u00ad lems, aller gies, fatigue, arthritis, and headaches. (Eisenber g et al 1998). 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Millions of visits MDs CAM CAM DESCRIBED Complementar y and alter native medicine practices ar e best described as those not pr esentl y consider ed an integral par t of conventional medicine.3 Implicit in this def inition is the ac knowledg ement that as CAM practices ar e proven saf e and ef fective, they ma y become adopted into mainstr eam healthcar e practice. Generall y, patients w ho choose CAM appr oaches ar e seeking w ays to impr ove their health and w ell-being and to r elieve symptoms associated with c hronic or ter minal illnesses or the side ef fects of conventional treatments. Interesting ly, the o verwhelming majority of patients adopting CAM appr oaches use them to complement con ventional car e, rather than as an alter native.4 As di verse and ab undant as the peoples and cultur es of the w orld, CAM practices ma y be g rouped in f ive major domains: alter native medical systems; mind-bod y inter ventions; biologicall based F or example, discr ete suc h as meditation ar e con\u00ad sidered mind-bod y interactions, b ut they ar e also inc luded as par t of some alter native systems of medicine. In addition to the e xamples belo w, Appendix I pr e medical systems. Ayurvedic medicine, India' s traditional medical system, is an e xample of an alter native system based on the principle that health is ac hieved by restoring the innate har mony of the indi vidual. It emphasizes the equal impor tance of body, mind, and spirit. Man y other non-W estern societies embrace similar beliefs. Mor eover, the dominant medical system in Eur ope fr om ancient Gr eece to the moder n era w as based on the belief that ill health r esulted fr om an imbalance of the bod y's four humors (b lood, phle gm, y ellow bile, and b lack bile). Mind-Body inter ventions. The practice of meditation, cer tain uses of hypnosis, pra yer, and f orms of art, music, and dance therap y are consider ed CAM mind-bod y inter ventions. hemical e vidence een the ner vous system and endocrine and immune systems and e vidence of benef it have led to the entr y of certain mind-bod y inter ventions, f or example, cogniti ve-beha vioral therapies and v arious means of stress reduction, into mainstr eam medicine. 8 NCCAM Five-Year S trategic P lan Biologically based therapies. Herbal r emedies, special diets, and f ood pr oducts used therapeuticall y are consider ed biologicall y based CAM practices. Herbs ar e defined as plants or plant pr oducts that pr oduce or contain c hemicals that act upon the bod y. Manipulativ e and body-based methods. Chiropractic appr oaches in w hich the spine (primaril y) is manip\u00ad ulated to r estore health and function to the bod y is an e xample of a bod y-based method. Various f orms of massag e that in volve manipulation of soft tissues and/or the musculosk eletal system ar e other e xamples. Energy therapies. Therapies based on the acti vation or g eneration of energy fields either originating in the body or acting e xternally on the bod y are examples of energy therapies. Qi g ong (pr onounced 'chee gung') is a component of traditional Chinese medicine that combines mo vement, meditation, and r egulation of breathing to enhance the f low of vital ener gy (qi) in the bod y to impr ove circulation and enhance immune function. CAM YESTERDA Y; MAINSTREAM HEAL THCARE TODAY As noted, CAM practices once consider ed unor thodo x in the United States can become par t of the main- stream healthcar e repertoire following demonstration of safety and ef ficacy by rigorous scientif ic investiga\u00ad tion. F or example, bef ore Nix on went to China in 1971 and J ames R eston 's compelling memoir that same year,6 acupunctur e was consider ed arcane. Today acupunctur e is often pr escribed to manag e pain and some- times to contr ol the nausea associated with c hemotherap y. Mor e recentl y, investigators ha ve reported positi ve results in the use of acupunctur e to tr eat cocaine addiction.7 (See the te xtbox.) Among the f irst dr ugs for treatment of high b lood pr essure was reserpine fr om the herb Rauwolfia serpentina , described man y centuries ag o in Indian A yruvedic monog raphs. Indeed, some of our most impor tant dr ugs, w hile not originating as CAM therapies, ar e deri vatives of the acti ve ingredients identif ied in herbal r emedies. Suc h drugs of botanical origin include digitalis f or the tr eatment of congestive hear t failure and vincristine, and mor e recentl y, taxol, for treatment of cancers. There are indications that other herbal r emedies and CAM practices ma y prove effective in preventing and tr eating c hronic diseases, possib ly reducing the costs of healthcar e, as w ell as ad vancing our understanding of how healing w orks. At pr esent, ho wever, few of these practices ha ve been tested f or saf ety and ef fectiveness. Still others a wait disco very and v alidation of their w orth. Acupunctur e for Addiction 53.8 per cent of cocaine addicts tr eated fiv e times a week with acupuctur e at sites in the ear tested fr ee of the drug at the end of an eight-w eek study , In compar\u00ad ison, r esearchers r eported that only 23.5 per cent of addicts giv en sham acupunc\u00ad ture and 9,1 per cent of sub\u00ad jects who watched r elaxation videos w ere drug-fr ee when tested in the final w eek. Further studies ar e needed to confirm these encourag\u00ading results. The Case for Action 9 RESOL VING THE ISSUES Despite their potential, untested CAM therapies ma y have unintended ne gative consequences.8 They ma y interf ere with or displace ef fective treatments (see Figur es 2 and 3); they ma y expose patients to potentiall y toxic substances; and they ma y absorb r esour ces that might be better in vested in mor e appr opriate tr eatment. Thus, it is critical to e valuate widel y used CAM tr eatments f or both saf ety and ef ficacy, as deter mined experimentall y in rig orously conducted c linical trials. As appr opriate, CAM therapies should also be e valuat\u00ad ed for effectiveness (the measur ed outcome of routine use within the g eneral population). Beyond testing pr evalent CAM inter ventions, it is also impor tant to identify pr omising CAM appr oaches that merit mor e intensi ve study. To pursue these in vestigations, w e must train, encourag e, and suppor t skilled in vestigators in both CAM and con ventional medical academic communities. Fur thermore, we must present cr edible, rather than anecdotal, data to a curious pub lic. Finall y, we must br oaden the kno wledg e base of CAM and con ventional healthcar e practitioners to encompass the full r epertoire of safe and ef fec\u00ad tive healthcar e practices\u2014tr uly expanding the horizons of healthcar e. These practices can then be inte grated into optimal inter disciplinar y treatment plans de veloped in cooperation with patients. These imperati ves dictate serious ef forts in r esearch, training , education, and communication, along with strate gies their inter disciplinar y inte gration. antideprA Cautionar y Tale Figure 2 Figure 3 Figur e 2 indicates the pr om- ise of S t.

Programs to e xpand basic and c linical r esearch, train investigators to conduct CAM r esearch, disseminate inf ormation, and f acilitate inte gration of CAM and conventional healthcar e deli very are essential in mo ving the CAM f ield f orward. Our priorities in eac h of the four ar eas of research, research training , information dissemination, and inte gration ar e outlined belo w. RESEAR CH The Clinical I mperativ e. The extensive use of untested CAM practices b y the pub lic dictates that NCCAM make clinical r esearch15 its highest priority and the center piece of its research portfolio. In this r egard, the Center' s appr oach differs signif icantl y from that of the other NIH Institutes and Centers w here the emphasis is on the disco very of new kno wledg e through basic r esearch. In contrast CAM consumers and healthcar e practitioners w ant to kno w now whether a vailable options ar e safe and ef fective. Thus, w hile essential basic information will be sought in parallel, NCCAM is committed to the c linical stud y of promising CAM sub- stances and modalities bef ore kno wledg e becomes a vailable about their acti ve ingredients, mec hanisms of action, stability , and bioa vailability . To help identify f ertile ar eas for clinical in vestigation and the appr opriate le vel of investment in these ar eas, the Center r elies on e vidence-based r eviews (described in A ppendix VI). These indicate that inf ormation regarding the ef ficacy and saf ety of CAM therapies spans a continuum ranging fr om anecdotes and case studies thr ough encouraging data deri ved from small, w ell-de veloped Phase I and II c linical trials (T able 1). Several additional f actors, suc h as the e xtent of utilization b y consumers, the potential f or pub lic impact, the oppor tunity to e xpand the science base, f easibility , and cost ar e also consider ed, in no priority or der, in selecting w hich treatments should be studied and at w hat de pth. Accor dingly, NCCAM will suppor t large (Phase III) c linical trials of CAM substances and modalities that appear fr om evidence-based r eviews to be the most pr omising and impor tant. A number of such trials ar e already underw ay, such as those to e valuate the use of St. John's wort for de pression, r esearch conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health and the Of fice of Dietar y Supplements; Ginkgo biloba to prevent dementia, in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging , the National Hear t, Lung , and Blood Institute, and the National Institute of Neur ologic Disor ate for osteoar thritis, in collaboration with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculosk eletal and Skin Diseases; and acupunctur e in the tr eatment of osteoar thritis of the knee. Man y mor e widel y used, promising therapies ar e deser ving of definitive study, including milk thistle f or chronic li ver disease, Ec hinacea for respirator y virus inf ections, and alerian or slee disor ders. F or other but still pr omising appr oaches, NCCAM will fund initial Phase I or Phase II trials to estab lish the scientif ic rationale and methodological f easibility needed to justify lar ge, randomized c linical trials. NCCAM will also seek to deter mine the potential f or toxic or ad verse r eactions and f or interactions with pr escription and over-the-counter medications. Finall y, NCCAM will in vest as w ell in car eful studies of popular inter ventions Futur e Directions 13 Large randomiz ed clinical trials Small randomiz ed clinical trials Uncontr olled trials Observational studies Case S tudies Anecdotes SYSTEMA TIC RE VIE WS Table 1 Hier archy of E vidence The w eight of evidence sup- porting the safety and ef ficacy of any clinical modality ranges from the str ongest\u2014deriv ed from lar ge randomiz ed con- trolled clinical trials (consider ed the gold standar d)\u2014thr ough successiv ely weaker lev els of support, with case studies and anecdotes pr oviding the w eak\u00ad est evidence. S ystematic reviews may be conducted at and acr oss all lev els. for which reports of efficacy are only anecdotal and no rational biomedical e xplanation f or the mec hanism of action has been pr oposed, suc h as magnet therap y. NCCAM also plans to pursue studies of placebo ef fects and ho w interactions betw een practitioners and patients ma y influence healing . In addition to in vestigating indi vidual therapies, NCCAM also aims to stud y entir e systems of traditional and indigenous medicine that ha ve been practiced o ver the centuries. Such studies ma y identify additional health tools of potential use to the American pub lic and ma y present oppor tunities to addr ess health disparities and the needs of special populations. This is an ar ea highlighted f or attention acr oss the NIH and r eflects the changing demog raphics of America. By 2050 it is estimated that the numbers of Latino , black, and Asian and Pacific Islander racial and ethnic g roups will e xceed the w hite non-Hispanic population. Man y of these indi\u00ad viduals will ha ve absorbed traditions of healthcar e and specif ic modalities practiced in their f amilies and their countries of origin f or generations. Appropriate e valuation of CAM tec hniques and pr oducts will r equire that e xperts in the use of a given CAM modality ar e intimatel y involved in the design, conduct, and o versight of these studies. Also, diverse r esearch designs will be needed to assess the spectr um of CAM tec hniques and pr oducts. For example, it is not possib le to examine some CAM modalities (f or example, massag e) thr of therapies that ar e custom-tailor ed to eac h patient' s needs. In this r egard, it is helpful that r ecent studies sug gest that obser vational studies can be suf ficientl y well designed to yield data comparab le to those of some randomized, contr olled trials.16 17 18 Notwithstanding the dif ficulties in designing some CAM studies, NCCAM will demand the same high standar d of scientif ic excellence that is r equired thr oughout the NIH. Basic Science R esearch. While c linical r esearch is the center piece of NCCAM' s research portfolio, NCCAM will pursue basic studies in parallel. The realization that herbals ar e not sing le agents b ut mixtur es of many compounds mak es our understanding of their under lying mec hanisms of action all the mor e critical. Moreover, research projects suc h as those designed to understand the neur obiological basis f or acupunctur e- mediated analg esia and the essential components of St. John's wort that ameliorate de pression ma y contrib ute to the kno wledg e base of conventional biomedical r esearchers and inspir e novel treatment appr oaches and rational dr ug disco very. To take full ad vantag e of the oppor tunities to b uild a of sci\u00ad ence disco veries, randomized c linical trials will be designed not onl y to test tr eatments, b ut also , to the e xtent possib le, to deter mine under lying mec hanisms of action, disco ver biomark ers, def ine phar macokinetics, identify the acti ve components in natural pr oducts, and collect data on the natural pr esentation and pr ogression of the diseases under stud y. For example, NCCAM' s current trial of Ginkgo biloba not onl y will test w hether this ancient natural pr oduct dela ys the onset and pr ogression of dementia, b ut the trial also r epresents the sing le largest pr ospecti ve study of intellectual dec line in aging Americans to date. NIH Areas of E mphasis. NCCAM shar es the NIH-wide imperati ve pr essing pub lic health con\u00ad cerns, and our r esearch aims ar e closely aligned with the NIH-designated ar eas of emphasis. Toward this end, the Center will contrib ute to the collecti ve effort in thr ee specif ied ar eas: the biolog y new preventive strate gies ag ainst disease; and new a venues f or the de velopment of therapeutics. The potential contrib ution of NCCAM with r espect to this latter ar ea is substantial. NCCAM also will par ticipate in the trans-NIH ef fort to understand and eliminate the health disparities obser ved betw een minority and majority populations. To this end, NCCAM is de veloping a strate gic plan to addr ess health disparities to be incor porat\u00ad ed into the o verall NIH plan. 14 NCCAM Five-Year S trategic P lan The oppor tunities f or suc h Critical materials will be translated f or non-Eng lish readers, CAM practitioners, and the r elative roles of CAM and con ventional pr oviders, ar e not within the pur view NIH.

TRAINING Our ability to ac hieve our r esearch goals is de pendent on the a vailability of a critical mass of skilled in vestiga\u00ad tors in both CAM and con ventional communities. Thus, NCCAM must encourag e skilled r esearchers to investigate CAM appr oaches and train CAM and con ventional practitioners to conduct or par ticipate in rig or\u00ad ous studies. To this end, NCCAM will full y exploit the rang e of options within NIH' s pur view to pr omote the training and pr ofessional de velopment of researchers. ically, we will mak e awards to both indi viduals and institutions, f or both mentor ed and inde pendent r esearch, ranging fr om basic thr projects. ork to pr omote collaborations betw een CAM and con ventional practitioners and r esearchers, w hich are essential to f orward. INFORMA TION DISSEMINA TION We regard as one of our highest priorities the need to inf orm the pub lic, w hich toda y is immersed in media reports and Inter net claims r egarding CAM appr oaches, to wards the saf est and most ef fective practices and away from those that ar e risky or unsaf e. Using all f orms of communication, w e must disseminate cr edible, not anecdotal data to a curious pub lic that deser ves complete and accurate inf ormation. Thus, w e will aim to make available an ab undance of timely and r elevant materials f or distrib ution, not onl y through the interacti ve capabilities of the Inter net, b ut also as har d cop y. as appr opriate. We will hold open f orums to eng age the pub lic in dialogue and interact with the scientif ic com- munity at pr ofessional meetings. INTEGRA TION Finall y, NCCAM must w ork to o vercome the r eluctance of conventional healthcar e providers to consider CAM therapies f or their patients. If we are to capitalize on the oppor tunities to ac hieve changes in both the CAM and con ventional healthcar e communities, w e must incr ease oppor tunities f or training medical and post-g raduate pr ofessional students to become educated about CAM. With this inf ormation, they ma y knowledg eably guide and r efer patients to ward safe and ef fective CAM applications and practitioners experienced in deli vering them. While man y agree in principle r egarding the merits of an inte grated healthcar e deli very system, ther e are numer ous polic y issues that a wait resolution bef ore such a system can be full y implemented. These matters, luding de velopment and enhancement of clinical training pr ograms, insurance r eimbursement, licensing Medicine P olicy, and concer ned or ganizations. As a component of NIH, NCCAM' s role is to pr ovide the scientif ic evidence to inf orm polic y mak ers ade\u00ad quatel y. It is b y holding CAM therapies to the highest standar ds of evidence, that w e belie ve we will best acilitate the cr eation of an inte grated healthcar e deli very system in w hich con ventional ph ysicians and CAM practitioners w ork as an inter disciplinar y team. Ginkgo Biloba to Prevent Dementia in Aging Americans For centuries, extracts fr om the leav es of the Ginkgo biloba tree hav e been used as Chinese herbal medicine to treat a v ariety of med\u00ad ical conditions. I n Europe and Asia, standar dized extracts fr om ginkgo leav es are routinely taken to treat a wide range of neuro-cognitiv e symptoms, including those of Alzheimer' s disease. Little is kno wn, ho wever, about the safe dosage levels of Ginkgo biloba extract, let alone its actual effectiveness in pr eventing Alzheimer' s disease. A newly funded NCCAM study, in collaboration with NIA, may help r esolve these questions. I n FY 1999, the U niversity of Pittsbur gh School of Medicine was awar ded six-year, the ef of Ginkgo biloba extract in preventing dementia, a cognitiv e decline in memo- ry and other intellectual functions, in older individu\u00ad als. This study , the lar gest of its kind ev er conducted on Ginkgo biloba , will include four clinical centers and enr oll almost 3,000 people.

NCCAM g roups CAM practices within f ive major domains, ac knowledging that other groupings ar e possib le: native medical systems, (2) mind-bod y inter ventions, (3) biologicall y based treatments, (4) manipulati ve and bod y-based methods, and (5) ener gy therapies. The indi vidual systems and treatments comprising these cate gories ar e too numer ous to list in this document. Instead, w e are providing examples within eac h domain. The absence of any one CAM modality in no w ay implies its intentional omis\u00ad sion. Note also that ther e is some o verlap acr oss domains so that a CAM practice c hosen as an e xample with- in one domain might also be c lassified within one or another of the five domains.2 I. ALTERNA TIVE MEDICAL SYSTEMS \u2014 Alter native medical systems in volve complete systems of theor y and practice that ha ve evolved inde pendentl y of, and often prior to , the con ventional biomedical appr oach. Man y are traditional systems of medicine that ar e practiced b y indi vidual cultur es thr oughout the w orld, inc luding a number of venerab le Asian systems. Traditional oriental medicine emphasizes the pr oper balance or disturbances of qi (pr onounced c hee), or vital energy, in health and disease, r especti vely. Traditional oriental medicine consists of a group of techniques and methods, inc luding acupunctur e, herbal medicine, oriental massag e, and qi g ong (a f orm of energy therap y described mor e full y belo w). Acupunctur e involves stimulating specif ic anatomic points in the bod y for thera\u00ad peutic pur poses, usuall y by puncturing the skin with a needle. Ayurveda is India' s traditional system of medicine. A yurvedic medicine (meaning \"science of life\") is a com\u00ad prehensi ve system of medicine that places equal emphasis on bod y, mind, and spirit, and stri ves to r estore the innate har mony of the indi vidual. Some of the primar contr olled br eathing . Other traditional medical systems ha ve been de veloped b y Nati ve American, African, Middle-Easter n, Tibetan, and Central and South American cultur es. Homeopath y and natur opath y are also e xamples of complete alter native medical systems. Homeopath y is an uncon ventional Western system de veloped in Ger many that is based on the principle that \"like cures lik e,\" i.e., that the same substance that in lar ge doses pr oduces the symptoms of an illness, in v ery minute doses cur es it. Homeopathic ph ysicians belie ve that e ven dilute r emedies ha ve great potenc y, provided that they ar e precisel y selected based on detailed e valuations of symptoms to deter mine a patient' s sensiti vity. Therefore, homeopaths use small doses of speciall y prepared plant e xtracts and minerals to stimulate the bod y's defense mec hanisms and healing pr ocesses in or der to tr eat illness. (1) alter Appendices 25 Natur opath y views disease as a manif estation of alterations in the pr ocesses b y which the bod y naturall y heals itself and emphasizes health r estoration as w ell as disease tr eatment. Natur opathic ph ysicians emplo y an ar ray of healing practices, inc luding diet and c linical nutrition; homeopath y; acupunctur e; herbal medicine; hydrotherap y use of water in a rang e of temperatur es and methods of applications); spinal and soft- tissue manipulation; ph ysical therapies in volving electric cur rents, ultrasound, and light; therapeutic counseling; and phar macolog y. II. MIND-BOD Y INTERVENTIONS \u2014 Mind-bod y inter ventions emplo y a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind' s capacity to af fect bodil y function and symptoms. Onl y a subset of mind-bod y inter ven\u00ad tions ar e consider ed CAM. Man y that ha ve a w ell-documented theor etical basis and f or which ther e is sup- porting scientif ic evidence, f or example, cogniti ve-beha appr oaches, ar e now consider ed \"mainstr eam.\" On the other hand, meditation, cer tain uses of hypnosis, dance, music, and ar t therap y, and pra yer and men\u00ad tal healing ar e cate gorized as complementar y and alter native. III. BIOLOGICALL Y BASED THERAP IES \u2014 This cate gory of CAM inc ludes natural and biologicall y based practices, inter ventions, and pr oducts, man y of which overlap with con ventional medicine' s use of dietar y supplements. Inc luded ar e herbal, special dietar y, orthomolecular , and vidual biological emplo y indi vidual herbs or mixtur es of herbs f or therapeutic pur poses. Herbs ar e plants or plant par ts that pr oduce and contain c hemical substances that act upon the bod y. Special diet therapies, suc h as those pr oposed b y Drs. Atkins, Or nish, Pritikin, and Weil, ar e belie ved to pr event and/or contr ol illness as w ell as promote health. Or thomolecular therapies aim to tr eat disease with v arying concentrations of chemicals, suc h as, magnesium, melatonin, and me gadoses of vitamins. Biological therapies inc lude, f or example, the use of laetrile and shark car tilage to tr eat cancer and bee pollen to tr eat autoimmune and inf lammator y diseases. IV. MANIPUL ATIVE AND BOD Y-BASED METHODS \u2014 This cate gory includes methods that ar e based on manipulation and/or mo vement of the bod y. For example, c hiropractors f ocus on the r elationship betw een structur e (primaril y the spine) and function, and ho w that r elationship af fects the pr eservation and r estora\u00ad tion using manipulati ve therap y as an inte gral treatment tool. Some osteopathic ph ysicians practice osteopathic manipulation, a full-bod y system hands-on tec hniques to alle viate pain, r estore function, and promote health and w ell-being . Massag e therapists manipulate musc le and connecti ve tissue to pr omote opti\u00ad mal function of those tissues and pr omote elaxation and w f ocus either on f ields belie ved to originate within the bod y (biofields) or those fr om other sour ces (electr omagnetic f ields). ar e fect ener gy fields that pur portedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existence of such fields is not y et experimentall y proven. Some f orms of energy therap y manipulate biofields b y appl ying pr essure and/or manipulating the bod y by placing the hands in, or thr ough, these f ields. Examples inc lude Qi g ong, Reiki, and Therapeutic Touch. Qi gong is a component of traditional oriental medicine that combines mo vement, meditation, and r egulation of breathing to enhance the f low of vital energy (qi) in the bod y, to impr ove blood cir culation, and to enhance immune function. R eiki, the J apanese word representing Uni versal Lif e Ener gy, is based on the belief that b y channeling spiritual ener gy through the practitioner the spirit is healed, and it in tur n heals the ph ysical bod y. Therapeutic Touch is deri ved from the ancient tec hnique of \"laying-on of hands\" and is based on the pr emise that it is the healing f orce of the therapist that af fects the patient' s recovery and that healing is pr omoted w hen the bod y's ener gies ar e in bal\u00ad ance.

Appendices 39 APPENDIX VI EVIDENCE-BASED RE VIEWS To help identify f ertile ar eas for clinical in vestigation and the appr opriate le vel of investment in eac h, NCCAM e xamines the scientif ic evidence r the ef fectiveness of CAM tr eatments. This hierar chy of evidence rang es from those consider ed to pr ovide the w eakest evidence, f or example, anecdotes and case studies, thr to lar ge randomized c linical trials, consider ed the g old standar d in ter ms of level of evidence. Systematic r eviews ma y be conducted at and acr oss all le vels. NCCAM taps a number of resour ces to obtain e vidence-based r eviews. Centers f or Disease Contr ol and Pr evention (CDC) \u2014 NCCAM has eng aged the CDC to de velop ef fective methods of identifying and enlisting the cooperation of practitioners w ho claim to ha ve obser ved effective new therapies and sub\u00ad sequentl y will w ork with CDC r epresentati ves to r eview their case f iles in a systematic f ashion. The goal of this acti vity is to identify practices w orthy of scientif ic stud y by NCCAM. Cancer Ad visory Panel f or Complementar y and Alter native Medicine (CAPCAM) \u2014 NCCAM, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), estab lished the f ederall y chartered CAPCAM to enab le disco very of new, promising CAM cancer tr eatments. Members of the 15-person panel (listed in A ppendix VII) r epresent a cr oss section of expertise from the CAM and mainstr eam oncolog y communities. CAPCAM' s members r eview and assess c linical data submitted by CAM scientists and c linicians, inc luding e valuation of best-case series (r etrospecti ve anal yses of data fr om patients treated with a specif ic modality in or der to assess specif ic therapeutic benef it). Based on these e valuations, CAPCAM will identify therapies w orthy of more rigorous scientif ic stud y by NCCAM. Agency for Healthcar e Research and Quality (AHR Q), formerly the Ag ency for Health Car e Policy and R esearch (AHCPR) \u2014 NCCAM contracts with AHR Q to car ry out systematic r eviews though the Ag ency's Pr suppor ts 12 Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) in the United States and Canada. Under this pr ogram, the EPC at the Uni versity of T exas, San Antonio e valuated the use of garlic for car diovascular disease and the use of Silybum marianum (milk thistle) f or treatment of liver disease and cancer . Cur rently, the Souther n Calif ornia Evidence-based Practice Center - RAND , Santa Monica, CA is sur veying the state of CAM science to identify pr omising \"frontiers of CAM in vestigation\" for which they will subsequentl y conduct full systematic r eviews. The Coc (CC) \u2014 The (http://www .cochrane.dk) is an inter national non- profit organization that emphasizes the need to r ely on systematic r eviews of scientif ic evidence, rather than on beliefs, traditions, common practices or case histories. The CC' s mission is to pr epare, maintain, and disseminate systematic, up- to-date r eviews of randomized contr olled c linical trials acr oss all ar eas of health car e. A g roup of Fields/Netw orks represents the inter ests of specif ic groups of patients or specif ic types of treatment (suc h as c hild health, v accines, and rehabilitation and r elated therapies). The Complementar y Medicine (CM) Field, suppor ted b y NCCAM and coor dinated by Brian Ber man, MD , was added in 1996 (http://www .compmed.ummc.umar yland.edu). The Coc hrane Field Gr oups with appr oximatel y 50 Coc hrane R esearch Groups (CR Gs), ar ranged by disease specialty , to car ry out systematic r eviews r elated to their disease specialty . The CR G with w hich the Field w orks is deter mined b y the r esearch question. F or example, e xamining w hether massag e is ef fective in incr easing the w eight of low bir th weight inf ants is being done in collaboration with the Neonatal CR G, whereas exploring w hether homeopath y is effective for asthma is being done in collaboration with the Airw ays CR G. Since f ormation of the CM Field, staf f have produced the Coc hrane R egistry of Randomized Contr olled Trials in Complementar y Medicine. As of March 2000 the r egistry holdings inc lude appr oximatel y 4,700 R CTs, possib 204 systematic r eviews, and 1,812 hard cop y reports in the ar chive. The registry is a vailable in the Coc y Contr thr ough the Of fice of Medical A pplications of Research at the NIH.
