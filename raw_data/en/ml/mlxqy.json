We evaluate the physical, chemical, and environmental factors that contribute to acute and chronic illness. Systematic inflammation is a common culprit for many auto immune and digestive issues. We help our patients find answers through metabolic, hormone, and microbiome testing. Functional medicine serves the body exactly as it sounds. Finding where the dysfunction is through these tests shows us how to guide the patient to make nutritional and lifestyle changes to heal the body. The Standard American Diet ( [SAD](https://fullscript.com/blog/standard-american-diet)) is largely inflammatory and high in sugar. Taking the steps to choose a diet that feeds the body's needs is part of the process. We can help our patients see incredible changes if they are prepared to begin and follow through with the functional medicine process. Why Functional Medicine? The typical model for health care is to treat the symptom. While there are many symptoms that come about due to hormonal, nutritional, or chemical dysfunction we believe in finding the root. We go through a complete history with the patient in addition to testing and we coach you through the process. Mineral deficiencies, inflammatory reactions and disease can be found and treated with functional medicine. Whether you are seeking to lose stubborn weight, stop chronic pain, or find balance in your hormones we can help! Are you experiencing the symptoms of chronic inflammation? - Fatigue - Mood Swings - Sugar Cravings - Joint Pain - Dizziness - Digestive issues - And much more... How is Functional Medicine Different? Integrated Medical Practices: Functional medicine combines traditional practices with alternative and integrative medicine. This means we focus on not just treatment but prevention through diet, exercise and lifestyle changes. Supplementation and stress management also play an integral part in functional medicine. Care Centered Around the Patient: Treatments are tailored to the individual needs of the patient rather than the symptoms themselves. This allows us to gain a better knowledge of the patient's story and history, allowing us to provide the best care possible. Functional medicine enables our clinic to practice proactive, predictive, personalized medicine and empowers patients to take an active role in their own health. Testimonials from Linda and Kent of Shelby, NC \"Since I've started this program, I have been amazed that my bloating is all but gone! People have commented that my skin looks better and brighter, too. I am sleeping much better, and my dancing is easier to do now because my energy is so much better. Before I started this program, I rated my energy as a 4 or 5 out of a possible 10; now, I'm easily at a 8 or 9...and we haven't even finished up with our program yet!\" -Linda B., Shelby, NC \"So far, I've lost 18 pounds and people are always asking how I'm doing it. I no longer take my TUMS for acid reflux, and I no longer get woken up by the reflux. No surprise that I'm waking up earlier on my own because I guess I'm getting better quality sleep. I have to say that my joints feel much better, too, and I've started to exercise. \" -Kent B., Shelby, NC Book Your Functional Medicine Consultation At Carolina Chiropractic Plus, we are dedicated to offering our patients the best treatments available by using the highest grade cutting edge technology at our state-of-the-art facility.
