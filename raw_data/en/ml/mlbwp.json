Since weight status in young childhood affects development and is predictive of adult weight status, the goal of our laboratory is help all individuals reach and maintain a healthy weight. Current Research Studies Current studies: One of our current studies involves Dietary Approaches for Cardiovascular Health. [Click to learn more about this study.](https://sites.udel.edu/ebn-lab/files/2019/05/COBRE-2_V3.pdf) Another one of our current studies focuses on the impact of first foods on an infant's natural gut bacteria.

Lab Directors Jillian Trabulsi, PhD, RD Associate Professor Bio Shannon Robson, PhD, MPH, RD Associate Professor, Director of Nutrition Science PhD Program Bio Carrie P. Earthman, PhD, RD Professor and Director of Research for the UD Health Nutrition Clinic Bio Dr. Earthman joined the faculty at the University of Delaware in 2019, after spending much of her academic career at the University of Minnesota. She has been a Registered Dietitian since 1991, when she began her career as an acute care dietitian working in GI disorders, heart and pulmonary failure, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and nutrition support. She went on to earn her MS and PhD in Nutritional Sciences at the University of Illinois and the University of Arizona, respectively. Graduate & Undergraduate Research Assistants Graduate Adriana Verdezoto Alvarado is a Nutrition Sciences doctoral student from Ecuador. She graduated with a BS in Biology with a minor in Chemistry at Randolph College and an MS in Nutritional Sciences at Arizona State University. At ASU, Adriana worked with minority populations to improve nutrition and physical activity in children and adults. Her research interests include behavioral-based interventions, the home food environment, dietary patterns, and prevention of chronic disease. Lynn Ferro is a doctoral student working in the Energy Balance and Nutrition Laboratory. Lynn's research interests are centered around infant nutrition and its connection to the gut microbiota. Currently, Lynn is conducting the First Foods Study to examine the impact that first complementary foods fed to infants have on the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract. Prior to coming to the University of Delaware, Lynn received her B.S. in Nutritional Sciences with a concentration in Biomedical and Molecular Nutrition from Michigan State University. Michelle Delahanty is currently a Research Associate in the Energy Balance and Nutrition Lab. She earned her Master of Public Health in Behavioral and Community Health Sciences, with a certificate in Evaluation, from the University of Pittsburgh in 2019. Her research interests include food security, maternal and child diet/health, and chronic disease management and prevention.
