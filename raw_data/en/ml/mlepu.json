Having any background above the core courses is not required to participate in the course. The class would be done entirely online. GS647-022 Nanocourse: Analysis of the Structural and Unstructural Biology of the SARS-CoV-2 Proteome Course Instructor(s): Alaji Bah, PhD Enrollment limit: None Brief Description: This nanocourse is designed for students (and faculty) with expertise or interests in biochemistry, molecular, structural and computational biology, who are would like to employ their skills in understanding the proteome biology of of SARS-CoV-2, with the ultimate goal of using this knowledge to identify therapeutic targets. After an introduction to Coronaviruses in general, we will focus specifically on the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, and we will identify virus' proteins and their potential biological functions. We will determine whether the structures of these proteins (or their homologs and/or their complexes) have solved and deposited in protein databases. If no structural info is available, students will generate homology models using computational tools. These structures could be starting points for structure-based drug designs. We all also identify regions of the viral proteome that cannot fold in isolation i.e the so called Intrinsically Disordered Proteins or Protein Regions (IDPs/IDRs), which are normally sites targeted for post translational modifications (PTMs). Viral or host proteins that are involved in 'writing', 'reading' and 'erasing' these PTMs will be identified to explore the feasibility of targeting them. Finally, in addition to identifying unique SARS-CoV-2 targets, we will investigate whether previous known targets in other Coronavirus can also be exploited in SARS-CoV-2.
