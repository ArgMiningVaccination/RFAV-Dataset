Immunized volunteers were followed to determine the duration of protective immune responses. Antibody levels decreased to between one-third and one-half of peak values 6 months after the last dose of vaccine. T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production in vitro were observed in response to RTS,S or hepatitis B surface antigen. Seven previously protected volunteers received sporozoite challenge, and 2 remained protected (1/1 for vaccine 1, 0/1 for vaccine 2, and 1/5 for vaccine 3). The prepatent period was 10.8 days for the control group and 13.2 days for the vaccinees (P < .01). Immune responses did not correlate with protection. Further optimization in vaccine composition and/or immunization schedule will be required to induce longer-lasting protective immunity.
