Vaccinations and malaria risk Review both the Vaccination and Malaria sections on this page to find out if you may need vaccines and/or a malaria risk assessment before you travel to this country. If you think you require vaccines and/or malaria risk assessment, you should make an appointment with a travel health professional: A travel health risk assessment is also advisable for some people, even when vaccines or malaria tablets are not required. Risk prevention advice Many of the health risks experienced by travellers cannot be prevented by vaccines and other measures need to be taken. Always make sure you understand the wider risks at your destination and take precautions, including: Our advice section gives detailed information on minimising specific health risks abroad: Other health considerations Make sure you have [travel insurance](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travel-insurance) before travel to cover healthcare abroad. Find out if there are any restrictions you need to consider if you are [travelling with medicines](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travelling-with-medicines). Know how to access healthcare at your destination: see the [GOV.UK English speaking doctors and medical facilities: worldwide list](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/doctors-and-medical-facilities-worldwide-list) If you feel unwell on your return home from travelling abroad, always seek advice from a healthcare professional and let them know your travel history. Vaccinations - Confirm primary courses and boosters are up to date as recommended for life in Britain - including for example, [seasonal flu vaccine](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/flu-influenza)(if indicated), [MMR](http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/measles), vaccines required for occupational risk of exposure, lifestyle risks and underlying medical conditions. - Courses or boosters usually advised: Diphtheria; Hepatitis A; Poliomyelitis; Tetanus; Yellow B; Meningococcal Meningitis; Rabies; Typhoid. - Selectively advised vaccines - only for those individuals at highest risk: Cholera. - Yellow fever vaccination certificate required for travellers aged 9 months or over arriving from countries with [risk of yellow fever transmission](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/yellow-fever/yellow-fever-risk-areas)and for travellers having transited through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. Notes on the diseases mentioned above - [Cholera](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/cholera): spread through consumption of contaminated water and food. It would be unusual for travellers to contract cholera if they take basic precautions with food and water and maintain a good standard of hygiene. Risk is higher during floods and after natural disasters, in areas with very poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Risk is highest for humanitarian aid workers; those working in refugee camps or slums; those caring for people with cholera. - [Diphtheria](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/diphtheria): spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Risk is higher if mixing with locals in poor, overcrowded living conditions. - [Hepatitis A](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-a): spread through consuming contaminated food and water or person to person through the faecal-oral route. Risk is higher where personal hygiene and sanitation is poor. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs. - [Hepatitis B](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/hepatitis-b): spread through infected blood and blood products, contaminated needles and medical instruments and sexual intercourse. Risk is higher for long stays, frequent travel and for children (exposed through cuts and scratches), those who may require medical treatment during travel. Risk is highest for those with underlying medical conditions where there is increased risk of severe disease e.g. chronic liver/kidney disease; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; people who change partners frequently; people who inject drugs. - [Meningococcal Meningitis](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/meningococcal-meningitis): spread by droplet infection through close person to person contact. Meningococcal disease is found worldwide but epidemics may occur within this country, particularly during the dry season. Risk is higher for those mixing with locals for extended periods. - [Poliomyelitis](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/poliomyelitis): spread mainly through person to person contact (faecal-oral route) and by consuming contaminated food and water. A total of 5 doses of polio-containing vaccine are recommended in the UK for lifetime cover. Boosters are usually recommended for travel to countries where polio remains a problem. Countries may require proof of polio vaccination when you leave them: check the 'Alerts' section below to see if there are any 'Polio Vaccination Exit recommendations' for this country. - [Rabies](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies): spread through the saliva of infected animals (especially dogs, cats, bats and monkeys), usually through a bite, scratch or lick to broken skin. Risk is higher for those working or living in remote or rural areas (with no easy access to medical facilities), longer stay travellers, those planning on undertaking activities such as trekking, cycling or running in a ['high risk'](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/rabies/rabies-risk-areas)country, those working with, or regularly handling animals or bats, as part of their job, and children. Even after receiving pre-travel rabies vaccine, urgent medical advice should be sought after any animal or bat bite. - [Tetanus](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/tetanus): spread through contamination of cuts, burns and wounds with tetanus spores. Spores are found in soil worldwide. A total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine are recommended for life in the UK. Boosters are usually recommended in a country or situation where the correct treatment of an injury may not be readily available. - [Typhoid](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/typhoid): spread mainly through consumption of contaminated food and drink. Risk is higher where access to adequate sanitation and safe water is limited. - [Yellow Fever](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/yellow-fever): spread by the bite of an infected, day-biting mosquito. The disease is mainly found in rural areas of affected countries but outbreaks in urban areas do occur. Vaccination is usually recommended for all those who travel into risk areas. (View [yellow fever risk areas](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/yellow-fever/yellow-fever-risk-areas)here), and areas where there is an outbreak ongoing (check the 'news' section for outbreaks). In addition, certain countries may want to see proof of vaccination on an official yellow fever vaccination certificate - check above under Immunisations. Malaria Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes.You cannot be vaccinated against malaria. Malaria precautions [Malaria Map](/destinations/africa/nigeria/nigeria-malaria-map) - Malaria risk is high throughout the year in all areas. - Malaria [precautions](/advice/malaria)are essential. Avoid mosquito bites by covering up with clothing such as long sleeves and long trousers especially after sunset, using insect repellents on exposed skin and, when necessary, sleeping under a mosquito net. - Check with your doctor or nurse about suitable antimalarial tablets. - See [malaria map](/destinations/africa/nigeria/nigeria-malaria-map)- additional information can be found by clicking on the Regional Information icon below the map. - High risk areas: [atovaquone/proguanil](/advice/malaria/atovaquoneproguanil)OR [doxycycline](/advice/malaria/doxycycline)OR [mefloquine](/advice/malaria/mefloquine)is usually advised. - If you have been travelling in a malarious area and develop a fever seek medical attention promptly. Remember malaria can develop even up to one year after exposure. - If travelling to an area remote from medical facilities, carrying [standby emergency treatment](/advice/malaria/sbet-standby-emergency-treatment-for-malaria)for malaria may be considered.
