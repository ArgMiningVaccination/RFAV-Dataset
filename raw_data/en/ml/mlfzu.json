It is revered for its focus on synergy of the body and mind, and powerful remedies that address the root causes of physical and emotional ailments - rather than just their symptoms. Ayurveda is much more than a way to treat illness - it is a science of life (Ayur = life, Veda = science or knowledge) that combines powerful botanical remedies, yoga, and lifestyle modifications to treat modern afflictions as effectively as it treated them thousands of years ago. | | Furthermore, Ayurveda encompasses not only science but also philosophy, whereby the whole of life's journey is considered sacred. Ayurveda draws on a system of scientific and practical knowledge, which is rooted in the ancient belief systems about the constitution of the human body, and its close relationship with the environment it exists in. Providing guidelines on ideal daily and seasonal routines, diet, behavior and the proper use of our senses, Ayurveda reminds us that beauty and health are rooted in the balanced and dynamic integration between our environment, body, mind, and spirit. | | | | | | "}
