Each type of provider provides a unique perspective on pregnancy and birth that enhances your experience. You may see different types of providers throughout your pregnancy. At the time of delivery, you will be cared for by a team including nurses, residents, fellows, certified nurse midwives and attending physicians. The team taking care of you on labor and delivery is dedicated to caring for women in labor and rotates from day to day. The provider you have seen for your prenatal visits is not necessarily going to be the provider who delivers your baby. You may not opt out of resident-care. UCSF is a teaching hospital, committed to training excellent future healthcare providers. There may be a nursing, midwife and/or medical student in training who may participate in your care with close supervision from a licensed provider. Registered Dietitian Registered dietitians provide nutritional counseling for pregnant women. They also provide nutritional management for women who have high risk pregnancies due to pre-existing and gestational diabetes. Social Worker Social workers offer a wide variety of services focused on providing short-term counseling and connections to community resources. Outpatient Lactation Consultant An International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) provides outpatient lactation services to UCSF patients. One-on-one lactation appointments are available for mother and baby couplets to help address breastfeeding difficulties. Patient Navigator The patient navigator is a valuable resource to help coordinate your care and guide you through the experience of having your baby at UCSF. Research Assistant A research assistant may approach you and ask you to participate in a clinical research study. Perinatal and Antenatal Testing Nurses These nurses are specially trained and experienced in the care of pregnant women. They work with the other team members to coordinate your plan of care, ensure the safety of your baby and provide education. Diagnostic Sonographer The Diagnostic Sonographer specializes in pregnancy ultrasound and works under the supervision of a Perinatologist. A Diagnostic Sonographer performs the ultrasound exam when your baby needs screening for birth defects and growth. The sonographer also assists the physician during diagnostic procedures. Genetic Counselor A genetic counselor is a health care professional with a Master of Science degree in Human Genetics. Counselors work closely with families by reviewing screening and testing options, explaining risks for chromosome abnormalities and birth defects, and discussing relevant family histories of genetic conditions. They help families understand this information and provide support during their decision-making process.Your Health Care Team and Their Roles Certified Nurse-Midwife (CNM) Certified nurse-midwives have a college or graduate degree in nursing and have completed specialized training in midwifery. A nurse-midwife could be your primary health care provider during prenatal care and delivery. In addition to caring for patients, they teach and do research at the University. Nurse Practitioner Our nurse practitioners (NP's) are medical providers who have completed advanced education and clinical training, with an emphasis in women's health. An NP is qualified to provide a wide range of healthcare services, and is part of your prenatal and postpartum care team. Obstetrician/Gynecologist (OB-Gyn) Obstetricians/gynecologists are physicians who have special training in obstetrics and gynecology. In addition to caring for patients, they teach and do research at the University. They are sometimes called attendings, which is a term that means they have completed their training. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Perinatologist A perinatologist (maternal-fetal medicine doctor or \"MFM\") is an obstetrician/gynecologist physician with specialized training in caring for mothers and babies who may be at high risk for complications. In addition to caring for patients, they teach and do research at the University. They are sometimes called attendings, which is a term that means they have completed their training. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Fellow A fellow is a physician who is training to care for women with high-risk pregnancies. They have graduated from medical school and finished a residency training program in obstetrics/gynecology. You may be treated by a fellow during your care at UCSF. OB-Gyn Resident A resident is a physician who has graduated from medical school and is in graduate training. They are supervised by the attending physician. UCSF is also a research institution and you may be approached about research. Medical Student During one of your appointments, a medical student may take your medical history and present your case to the attending physician or the health care team. Medical students may also be part of the labor and delivery team. 2Perpetual Calendar-Your three trimesters General Care steps [ ] Follow up OB care with MFM team [ ] Follow up OB care with generalist OB doctorFebruary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29March 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31January 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 May 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31June 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30April 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 August 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31September 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30July 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 November 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30December 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31October 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 [ ] Centering Pregnancy program [ ] Follow up OB care with CNM 3Your three trimesters at-a-glance General Care steps [ ] Follow up OB care with MFM team [ ] Follow up OB care with generalist OB doctor[ ] Centering Pregnancy program[ ] Follow up OB care with CNMBeginning Your Pregnancy 3 3First prenatal visit Your first visit or \"intake visit\" will most likely be with a Certified Nurse Midwife or Nurse Practitioner, even if your prenatal care will be with an MD. We hope you will have the opportunity to complete your intake paperwork and review some of the information in this guidebook before your first visit so we can take that time to focus on your questions. Your first visit will include a detailed review of your health history, a physical exam (which may include a pelvic exam) and may include a brief ultrasound to check on your pregnancy (this will be up to the provider performing your visit). You may or may not hear the baby's heartbeat at this visit depending on many factors (for example - how far along you are, your body shape, the position of the uterus and pregnancy). At your intake visit, your initial questions will be addressed, you will receive preliminary information about tests that are offered and suggested during pregnancy and you will discuss a plan for your ongoing prenatal care. Antenatal testing visits For some women, extra fetal monitoring is recommended in the third trimester. These visits, called \"antenatal testing\" (ante - before, natal - birth) consist of monitoring the baby's heart beat with an external monitor and monitoring for uterine contractions, typically for around 20-30 minutes. A brief/informal ultrasound will also be performed to evaluate the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby. Antenatal testing starts for most women between 32 and 36 weeks and is performed once or twice weekly, depending on the circumstances. This may be suggested for women who have high blood pressure, diabetes, twins, are over age 35-40 or have other complications of pregnancy. Your healthcare provider will discuss your individual pregnancy with you and recommend antenatal testing if it is appropriate. Timing of prenatal visits Many factors affect the timing and number of visits you will have. Most women with uncomplicated pregnancies have around 8-10 prenatal visits. The visits can be spaced out to 6 weeks in the first half of pregnancy and not closer than 2 weeks at the end of pregnancy. Other types of visits during your pregnancy may include: Genetic counseling Detailed ultrasounds (performed in our Prenatal Diagnosis Center) Antenatal testing (fetal monitoring in the third trimester) What Happens at Your Prenatal Visits Ongoing visits Ongoing visits are much shorter. Your weight, blood pressure and the growth of the baby are evaluated at each visit. These visits give you the chance to ask questions and learn more about your pregnancy. Ultrasound visits Most women are referred for two formal/detailed ultrasounds during their pregnancies. The first is typically done around 12 weeks and is the \"nuchal translucency\" ultrasound. This is a part of prenatal genetic screening (see page 13 for further information). The next ultrasound is usually done around 20 weeks and is the \"fetal anatomic survey\" ultrasound. At this ultrasound, the baby's physical structures including the heart, brain, spine, limbs and some organs will be examined. This visit also includes an assessment of the placenta, uterus and cervix. At UCSF, these ultrasounds usually take place in our Prenatal Diagnosis Center (\"PDC\"). The PDC is located in the same building and on the same floor as our OB clinics at Mission Bay - 1825 4th street, 3rd Floor. Your ultrasounds will be performed by an ultrasound technician (sonographer) and will be reviewed and interpreted by a high-risk OB doctor (perinatologist). Under most circumstances, you will not see the doctor for your 12 week ultrasound, but your results will be reviewed with you by a genetic counselor before you leave the office. You may or may not see the doctor at the time of your 20 week ultrasound depending on many factors. Rest assured that a doctor reviews your ultrasound images before you leave the office, and if there is any cause for concern or anything that requires additional follow-up, the doctor will speak to you directly. Some women will be referred for an additional detailed or formal ultrasound in the third trimester depending on individual factors, but for most women, only two formal ultrasounds are performed. Other brief or informal ultrasounds are usually performed in the office during your first visit and again in the third trimester around 36 weeks, but these ultrasounds will be at the discretion of your provider and depend on your health circumstances. 4CenteringPregnancy\u00ae UCSF Women's Health Obstetric Services offers an alternative program in receiving your care called CenteringPregnancy\u00ae. In CenteringPregnancy\u00ae, you will come to clinic once a month with 8-12 other women at similar stages in their pregnancy and receive all of your prenatal services and an evaluation of your baby. The CenteringPregnancy \u00ae group meets 10 times during the pregnancy and once after delivery. Partners or support persons are encouraged to participate in these sessions. During group discussions, topics of discussion will include infant care, breastfeeding, parenting, nutrition, exercise, relaxation and childbirth preparation. If needed, women can also see their health care provider privately for other evaluations. The advantages of Centering have shown a decrease in pre-term labor, increase in breastfeeding rates, decrease visits to the emergency room, and greater satisfaction with care. Developing strong relationships with other group members through the shared education has been a rewarding experience for our patients. As one of our patients stated, \"We felt it was a very effective way to combine brief physical check-ups with the education that is so important for a healthy pregnancy and delivery. I have never in my life felt better cared for, and my husband and I have told countless people about UCSF and CenteringPregnancy \u00ae.\" A great way to meet other moms. The staff was above superb and the level of care was beyond our expectations. This group setting was incredibly helpful and I'd recommend this for all future parents.We felt it was a very effective way to combine brief physical check-ups with education....I have never in my life felt better cared for.The best thing is building community with other new moms, spending the time to mentally prepare for birth and motherhood. For more information about CenteringPregnancy\u00ae, please view our video at http://whrc.ucsf.edu/whrc/gex/cp.html or contact our coordinator to make an appointment: centeringpregnancy@ucsf.edu.Beginning Your Pregnancy 5 First Month 4-8 weeks (since last mentrual period) The baby has begun to develop a heart, liver and digestive system. The baby is being nourished and getting rid of wastes through the placenta and umbilical cord (the vascular structures that connect baby to the wall of the uterus). The entire baby is approximately 18 inch (12 cm) in length.Third Month 12-16 weeks By the third month, the baby is now growing rapidly, adding a few millimeters of length each day. Features are becoming distinct. The baby weighs about 1 ounce (28 g) and is 3 inches (8 cm) long.Second Month 8-12 weeks By the end of the second month, most women begin to notice the physical signs of pregnancy (i.e. nausea, fatigue, breast pain, etc.). The baby's arms and legs have begun to form. All the major internal organs have developed and the tiny heart begins to pump blood. Facial features become more defined and brain development is well underway. The baby is nearly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Baby's Month-to-Month Development 6Fourth Month 16-20 weeks All of the organs are formed and now the baby must simply grow in size. By the fourth month, babies become more active and may begin to push their arms and legs against the sac in which they float. The baby is now more than 6 inches (15 cm) long and weighs more than 14 pound (114 g). Seventh Month 28-32 weeks The baby's eyes may occasionally be open for short periods of time. If born at this time, the baby would be considered premature and require special care. The baby weighs approximately 2 12 pounds (1.13 kg) and is about 15 inches (38 cm) long.Sixth Month 24-28 weeks The woman's abdomen continues to get bigger and the baby's movements become faster. The baby's skin is red and wrinkled. The baby is about 12 inches (30 cm) long and weighs about 1 12 pounds (689 g). Ninth Month 36-40 weeks The baby has now reached a size and maturity that allows it to live outside the mother's body. The head is covered with hair. The baby settles down lower into the abdomen preparing for birth. The baby weighs around 6 to 7 pounds (2.7 to 3.2 kg) and is 20 inches (50 cm) or more long.Fifth Month 20-24 weeks Movements are stronger and more easily felt. The baby is now about 10 inches (25 cm) long and weighs about 12 pound (227 g). Eighth Month 32-36 weeks The baby is now almost fully grown and movements or \"kicks\" are strong enough to see from the outside. The skin is no longer as wrinkled, and the baby is usually in the head-down position from which birth will occur. The baby weighs about 4 pounds (1.81 kg) and is about 16 12 inches (42 cm) long.Beginning Your Pregnancy 7 Nausea and vomiting Nausea is a common side effect of pregnancy, especially during the first three months. Despite being called morning sickness, it can occur any time of day. Here are some tips to help you get through the nausea so that it does not interfere with balanced nutrition and appropriate weight gain: Eat small frequent meals. Try three meals and 2-4 snacks per day, with no more than 2-3 hours between feedings. Going too long without eating during pregnancy can cause nausea or make it worse. If you experience continuous nausea, eat every 1 to 2 hours. For balanced nutrition, choose a variety of foods from all food groups. Avoid greasy, fried and high fat foods. They are more difficult to digest and can make nausea worse. Consume dry starchy foods (such as crackers, pretzels, toast, or cereal) in the morning before you get out of bed. It may help if you stay in bed for 20 minutes or so after eating. Get up slowly from bed. A sudden change of position can make you more nauseous. Tea made by boiling minced fresh ginger root may reduce nausea (strain before drinking). Carbonated beverages relieve nausea for some women, and chamomile tea may also help. Stay away from strong odors. Eat in a well-ventiated room and get plenty of fresh air. Many women find cold foods easier to tolerate than hot foods. Take prenatal vitamins only as directed. If they upset your stomach, try taking them before bed or ask your practitioner if you can delay taking them for a few weeks. Your health care provider might recommend a multivitamin with less iron or folic acid if your nausea continues. Avoid coffee. It stimulates acid secretion which can make nausea worse. Stay hydrated. Drink small amounts of liquid throughout the day. Dry meals and snacks may minimize nausea, so drink liquids 20-30 minutes before or after your meals and snacks. Try supplementing vitamin B6. Take 25 mg three times a day. Wear anti-sea-sickness wrist bands. These can be purchased at most pharmacies. Please read \"Use of Medications during Pregnancy and while Breastfeeding,\" included in this guide (pages 25-27). Common Discomforts of Pregnancy Pregnancy produces many physical changes. Aside from weight and body shape, other changes in your body chemistry and function take place. During pregnancy, the heart works harder, body temperature rises slightly, body secretions increase, joints and ligaments are more flexible, and hormones are altered. Mood changes can occur due to a combination of hormonal shifts and greater fatigue. It is also common to feel anxious about body image, sexuality, finances, relationship roles, and impending parenthood. Following is a list of the most common discomforts of pregnancy and some guidelines on how to deal with them. 8Constipation Digestion naturally slows down during pregnancy which can lead to constipation. Decreased physical activity also contributes to the problem. If the following tips do not relieve your constipation be sure to talk to your health care provider. Increase fiber in your diet. Choose brown or wild rice, whole grain breads and other whole grains, such as oatmeal, millet and quinoa. Try whole grain pasta, buckwheat noodles and whole wheat tortillas. Limit white bread, white rice and pasta. Eat at least 4 1/2 cups per day of a combina - tion of fresh and dried fruits, raw and cooked vegetables, and salads. Eat prunes or figs, or drink prune juice. These fruits contain a natural laxative. Choose a breakfast cereal that has at least 5 grams of fiber per serving. Drink plenty of fluids. Be more active. If the problem is not resolved with the above suggestions, let your health care provider know. Over-the-counter stool softners and laxitives are safe for use in pregnancy. Use them as directed. Be sure to discuss with your healthcare provider. The iron in prenatal vitamins can make constipation worse. The prescription for iron can be adjusted if it becomes a problem. Fatigue and insomnia This is very common during pregnancy. Get as much sleep or rest as you can - even short naps will help. A warm bath, massage or a cup of hot milk or non-caffeinated tea before bed may help. Breast tenderness Breast tenderness is most noticeable during the first three months of pregnancy. The breasts get bigger and can be quite tender. A good support bra is useful.Frequent urination Frequent urination is common during pregnancy. It is most noticeable during the first three months and towards the end of the pregnancy. This is caused by pregnancy hormones as well as the pressure on the bladder as the uterus enlarges. Do not drink fewer fluids to decrease how often you urinate. As long as you do not have burning or pain when you urinate, urinating more often is normal. Leg cramps Cramps in your calf or thigh occur most frequently at night. While in bed, stretch with your heels pointed, not your toes. This will help relieve cramping. Increasing magnesium and potassium can help as well. Heartburn As the baby grows in size, the uterus crowds the stomach. Stomach acid can be pushed up into the esophagus which results in burning. Eating smaller meals and avoiding foods that bother you can help. Eat smaller but more frequent meals. Try three small meals and 2-4 snacks a day. Some foods cause the opening between the esophagus and stomach to relax, which means even more stomach acid may enter the esophagus and make heartburn worse. Typical problem foods are greasy, fatty and fried ones. Caffeine, chocolate and mint (including mint tea) can also be a problem. Highly seasoned and spicy foods can cause heartburn in some people. Avoid any foods that bother you. Acidic foods such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, pickles and other foods made with vinegar may cause heartburn. Do not lie down flat after eating. If you must lie down, elevate your head and shoulders with pillows. Nonfat or low fat milk may relieve heartburn. Antacids including TUMS and Zantac (ranitidine) are safe for use in pregnancy when used as directed. Please contact your provider to discuss further. Beginning Your Pregnancy 9 Backache As the baby grows in size, the mother's belly enlarges. To maintain balance, the mother's posture shifts. This can lead to lower back pain. Try not to stand in one position for too long. An exercise called pelvic rock may help relieve back pain by strengthening the lower back muscles that receive the most stress. It can also be helpful to elevate the feet onto a stool while sitting. Exercise, stretching, yoga, walking, massage and acupuncture may help to relieve back pain. Dizziness When you do not have enough food in your body and change your position suddenly, you might feel dizzy. It may be helpful to move slowly when standing from a sitting or lying position. Eat well and frequently. Carrying snacks at all times might be helpful. Juices and fruit raise blood sugar quickly but should be followed by a normal meal. If you feel dizzy frequently despite trying the recommendations above, let your healthcare provider know.Swelling of hands and feet Slight swelling of hands and feet is common in the later stages of pregnancy. Do not decrease your fluid intake to avoid this. Improve the circulation in your legs and feet by elevating them as often as possible. Lie on a bed or the floor and raise your legs up on the wall keeping your knees bent. If you are wearing elastic hose, drain your legs this way before putting them on. Hemorrhoids Constipation and straining during bowel move - ments can lead to hemorrhoids. To help prevent constipation, eat a diet that is high in fiber and includes plenty of fluids. Witch hazel or Tucks can be applied to the hemorrhoids for symptomatic relief. Stool softeners are safe for use in pregnancy. Consult your health care provider for sugges - tions. Danger Signs during Pregnancy The following danger signs can signal potential problems during pregnancy. Notify your health care provider at once, if you have: Vaginal bleeding Ongoing vomiting Chills or fever Continuous pain Continuous headache Burning when you urinate Blurred vision Sudden swelling of hands or face Five or more uterine contractions per hour Fluid leaking from the vagina Decreased fetal movements 10What is Zika virus? Zika is a virus that is primarily transmitted through the bite of a mosquito, but also can be transmitted sexually and passed from a woman to her fetus. Zika has the potential to cause devastating birth defects with a wide range of effects known as Congenital Zika Syndrome. Microcephaly, which is an abnormally small head, is one of the potential effects of Congenital Zika Syndrome. How can I protect myself from a Zika infection? Avoid travel to Zika areas Women who are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant should avoid travel to areas of active Zika transmission. This includes Mexico, most of Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Asia and Africa. For the most updated list of travel notices, see the Center for Disease Control website at https://www.cdc.gov/zika Abstain from sex or use protection if your partner has traveled If you have a partner who has traveled to a Zika area, the recommendation is to wait 6 months before trying to conceive. If you are already pregnant, abstain from sex or use condoms to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of Zika. How will my prenatal care be affected by the global Zika epidemic? Zika Screening You will be asked at every appointment if you or your partner has traveled since your last office visit and the dates and locations of travel. If you have traveled to an area at risk for Zika, you will receive follow-up through MyChart or a phone call to determine if testing is indicated.Zika testing Testing is valid 2-12 weeks from a potential Zika exposure from travel or unprotected sexual activity with a partner who traveled. If you or a partner have had symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, or eye inflammation and potential exposure was in the past 2 weeks, please call for follow-up. Ultrasound monitoring If it has been more than 12 weeks since your potential Zika exposure, the testing currently available may not reliable. We will follow your baby's growth more closely to monitor for signs of abnormalities related to Zika. After 20 weeks gestation, ultrasounds every month are offered until delivery. Anyone with an exposure history, even if tested, is offered an additional 3rd trimester ultrasound to monitor growth. Are there treatments for Zika? There are no vaccines or treatments for Zika. There currently is no way to prevent a woman from transmitting Zika to her fetus, though not all fetuses become infected. If a Zika infection is confirmed by lab testing or suspected from ultrasound evaluation, you will be referred to one of our Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialists to follow your care. How do I get more information? If you have additional questions, please call our Zika nurse at (415) 203-6759.Zika Virus and Pregnancy If you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, questions about Zika may be on your mind. For updated information about Zika, please visit our website at www.ucsfhealth.org/education/zika_virusBeginning Your Pregnancy 11 Pap smear and vaginal cultures During a pelvic exam, your health care provider may perform a Pap smear and often collects vaginal cultures to make sure you do not have any vaginal infections. Ultrasound test Prenatal ultrasound is generally performed for all women around 20 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier ultrasounds may be performed if necessary.An ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves that transmit through the belly via a device called a transducer to look inside the uterus. The ultrasound shows images of the baby, amniotic sac, placenta, and ovaries. Some anatomical abnormalities or birth defects can be seen on an ultrasound. During the ultrasound, the health care provider checks to see that the placenta is healthy and attached normally, and that your baby is growing properly in the uterus. The baby's heartbeat and movement of its body, arms and legs can also be seen on the ultrasound. If you wish to know the baby's sex, it can usually be determined by 20 weeks. Be sure to tell the health care provider performing the ultrasound beforehand whether or not you want to know your baby's sex. An ultrasound is not a foolproof method to determine your baby's sex. There is a chance that the ultrasound images can be incorrect. Your ultrasound visit may take place in the Prenatal Diagnostic Center or ultrasound department.Please note that you will not have an ultrasound at every visit. Ultrasound visit differs from your prenatal visit and will cover information related to your ultrasound exam only. Tests and Other Screenings in the First 3 Months of Pregnancy Routine Tests Blood Tests A complete blood count (CBC) gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood, especially red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We screen all pregnant women for certain infections including hepatitis, syphilis and HIV. Additionally, a test is done to check if you are immune to rubella (German measles). A test to check your blood type and Rh factor is also taken. If the blood of an Rh-positive baby mixes with the blood of an Rh-negative mother during pregnancy or delivery, the mother's immune system makes antibodies. This antibody response is called Rh sensitization. If a pregnant woman is Rh-negative, she can get a shot of Rh immunoglobulin Rhogam that prevents sensitization from occurring. An ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves that transmit through the belly. Be sure to tell the health care provider performing the ultrasound beforehand whether or not you want to know your baby's sex. 12Tuberculosis Screening and Diagnosis during Pregnancy Your healthcare provider may recommend testing for tuberculosis if you have any risk factors for infection. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that usually affects the lungs, but can attack almost any part of the body. It is spread from person to person through the air. Carrier Screening testing is offered to identify couples who carry gene changes that could lead to genetic conditions in their children. It is well known that each of us carries significant changes in 3 to 5 genes, meaning we are carriers of 3 to 5 recessive genetic disorders. Because we generally carry two copies of each of our genes, as long as one copy is working normally, we have no symptoms of the recessive genetic disorder or condition - one working gene copy is enough. However, if a woman and her partner both carry a gene change for the same genetic disorder, and if both pass on the non-working gene copy to their baby, the baby will have the genetic disorder. Some genes and genetic conditions are more common in people of different races or ethnic backgrounds. But for most genes, any person from any background can be a carrier. For this reason, panels to test many genes at the same time have been developed.You can have TB and not know it because it is inactive. Some symptoms of active TB are fever, cough and weight loss. If you have active TB, you can give it to others, including your baby. You will be tested for TB early in your pregnancy because it is a dangerous, yet highly treatable disease. Conditions that have serious medical consequences are usually included in these test panels. A negative result on a carrier screening test will significantly reduce, but cannot eliminate, the chance that an individual is a carrier of each of the conditions on the panel. When a woman is pregnant, or considering getting pregnant, genetic carrier screening is offered so that the chance that she carries a serious genetic condition that her child might inherit can be evaluated. Some people elect not to have any carrier testing, others choose to have carrier testing for those conditions associated with their ethnic background, and others decide to have expanded carrier screening. Your physician or a genetic counselor is able to guide your review of the available screening options in the context of your family and pregnancy history. Genetic Carrier ScreeningBeginning Your Pregnancy 13 Who should consider prenatal testing? There are specific guidelines about who might benefit from genetic counseling and prenatal testing. These include: Pregnant women at increased risk for chromosome abnormalities because of age. Pregnant women with abnormal results from a screening test designed to estimate the risk of certain birth defects. Couples who are at risk because of a previous child with a birth defect or who have a family history of birth defects. Pregnant women with exposure to medications that might be harmful . Pregnant women who desire more information about the health of the fetus . Why is testing performed? While most women in the United States give birth to healthy babies, about three percent have some type of major birth defect. A birth defect can result from a problem with the number or structure of chromosomes and can affect how an infant looks and how the baby's organs function. In most cases, prenatal diagnosis provides the reassurance of a normal result. When an abnormality is diagnosed, this information combined with expert genetic counseling can help women and their partners make important decisions about this and future pregnancies. UCSF Prenatal Diagnostic Center UCSF Ron Conway Family Gateway, Medical Building1825 Fourth Street, 3rd Floor, Reception C(415) 476-4080 Providing information and support The Prenatal Diagnostic Center at UCSF Medical Center provides comprehensive counseling, screening and diagnostic testing for fetal disorders. The decision to make use of these services is unique for each woman and her partner. As a result, we are committed to providing the information and support patients need to make the choices that are right for them. The Prenatal Diagnostic Center is part of the UCSF Women's Health Center - a nationally designated Center of Excellence in Women's Health- and patients are ensured the highest quality care and service. They benefit from the most advanced technology and procedures. Our providers (Genetic Counselors and Ultrasound Techs) bring a wealth of experience and expertise, having performed more than 40,000 amniocentesis and 17,000 chorionic villus sampling procedures over the last 35 years. In addition to providing the most advanced testing available today, the Prenatal Diagnostic Center is working to develop new and less invasive methods for the screening and diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal disorders. Research studies are available for women interested in participating. For more information on carrier screening, or to arrange testing, please contact our Prenatal Diagnostic Center. What are the options? Counseling Preconception and prenatal counseling are available to help you understand your options and make decisions about whether or not to proceed with prenatal testing. The service is provided by specially trained and board certified genetic counselors who assess family history and maternal and paternal risk factors to determine which tests might be appropriate. You and your partner may receive counseling whether or not you decide to have prenatal testing. As part of the counseling process, maternal and paternal risk factors are assessed to determine if either parent could be a carrier of a genetic disorder. This includes a review of the family history and factors such as ethnicity that can indicate risks for certain birth defects or diseases. Counseling will help you determine if you want further testing and, if so, which tests are appropriate. Additional counseling is available for patients who receive abnormal results. Screening Tests Screening tests are available to help predict the risk of birth defects. There are different types of screening tests. 14The tissue is cultured and an analysis of the chromosomes is performed. It takes about two weeks to receive the results. The advantage of CVS over amniocentesis is that the test is performed much earlier in pregnancy. Amniocentesis The amniocentesis procedure is usually performed between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Under ultrasound guidance, a needle is inserted through the abdomen to remove a small amount of amniotic fluid. The cells from the fluid are cultured and a karyotype analysis is performed. It takes about two weeks to receive the results. This test detects most spinal cord defects as well as chromosomal disorders. Miscarriage risk There is a small risk of miscarriage as a result of CVS or amniocentesis. Miscarriage rates for procedures performed by UCSF providers are less than one in 500. Frequently asked questions What happens during the office visit? Your visit will take one to two hours. If you are having full integrated screening or a diagnostic test, you will meet with a genetic counselor. The actual procedure (CVS or amniocentesis) usually takes about 10 minutes. Most women do not find the procedure painful, although there is some minor discomfort. What if the test is positive? If the test finds a genetic abnormality, you will have a chance to discuss the diagnosis and your options with a geneticist and a genetic counselor from the Prenatal Diagnostic Center, as well as with your own doctor. Referrals and support are available for all decisions. Does insurance cover testing? Most insurance plans cover prenatal testing, especially for women over age 35. Our office staff is available to assist you with insurance questions. How do I make an appointment? Call (415) 476-4080. In addition to our main office at UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco, we have convenient locations to serve you throughout Northern California. What other services are offered? The Prenatal Diagnostic Center is part of the UCSF Medical Center Reproductive Genetics Unit, which also provides diagnosis and management of fetal anomalies, specialized fetal tissue biopsy, and fetal therapy for selected disorders. If you are interested in any of these other services, please call our office for more information. Sequential Integrated Screening Sequential integrated screening is noninvasive testing offered to all pregnant women by the State of California. It is performed in multiple steps. In the first step, which is performed between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy, a maternal blood sample is taken and a nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound is performed to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby's neck. If the blood test is performed prior to the scheduled ultrasound, an instant result can be provided at the conclusion of the ultrasound appointment. The results of the blood test, the NT measurement and the mother's age are used to estimate the risk for Down syndrome and trisomy 18. The second step of sequential integrated screening is a maternal blood test between 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. When the results of this blood test are combined with the results from the first trimester blood test and NT ultrasound, the detection rate for Down syndrome increases. This test also provides a personal risk assessment for having a fetus with trisomy 18 or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, an open neural tube defect or an abdominal wall defect. If the patient presents for screening later in her pregnancy, modified screening tests are available. Cell-Free DNA screening Cell-free DNA screening refers to testing for fetal disorders through analysis of fragments of DNA in maternal blood. The test can be performed on a blood sample from pregnant women at increased risk for chromosome abnormalities after 10 weeks of pregnancy. Cell-free DNA screening can test for trisomies 13, 18, and 21 and the sex chromosomes; the accuracy of testing for each of these is somewhat different. A positive result on a screening test indicates an increased risk for a genetic abnormality. Based on the results, a woman has the option of diagnostic testing. Diagnostic tests Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis detect large chromosome problems, like Down syndrome, and can also identify small extra or missing pieces of chromosomes called copy number variants (CNVs). Tests can also be performed for other genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease and sickle cell disease in at-risk families. Chorionic Villus Sampling The CVS procedure is performed between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy and involves removing a tiny piece of tissue from the placenta under ultra- sound guidance. The tissue is obtained depending on your pregnancy either through the abdomen or with a catheter inserted through the vagina.Beginning Your Pregnancy 15 Eating Right during Pregnancy Eating a balanced diet is important. This is especially true during your pregnancy. The foods you eat provide the nutrients that you and your baby need. Eating for two does not mean doubling portions. Pregnancy increases your calorie requirements by only about 300 calories per day, which is about the same amount of calories in \u00bd sandwich and 1 cup of low fat milk. What is most important is selecting a variety of foods from all of the food groups. The following table provides reasonable guidelines for choosing the foods and portions needed during your pregnancy. Diet guide for pregnancy Food Group 1st Trimester2nd & 3rd TrimesterWhat Counts as 1 cup or 1 ounce? Eat this amount from each group daily.* Vegetables 2\u00bd cups 3 cups1 cup raw or cooked vegetables or 100% juice2 cups raw leafy vegetables Fruits 2 cups 2 cups1 cup fruit or 100% juice\u00bd cup dried fruit Grains 6 ounces 8 ounces1 slice of bread1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal\u00bd cup cooked pasta, rice, or cereal Dairy 3 cups 3 cups1 cup of milk8 ounces yogurt1\u00bd ounces natural cheese2 ounces processed cheese Protein Foods1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal6\u00bd ounces1 ounce lean meat, poultry, or seafood\u00bc cup cooked beans\u00bd ounce nuts or 1 egg1 tablespoon peanut butter *If you are not gaining weight or gaining too slowly, you may need to eat a little more from each food group. If you are gaining weight too fast, you may need to cut back by decreasing the amount of \"empty calories\" you are eating. Information on this page was compiled from the Pregnancy Fact Sheet available at USDA, www.ChooseMyPlate.gov 16Vegetables Vary your vegetable choices. Many different vitamins and minerals are found in vegetables. To get the most out of your vegetables, select different colors and textures. Make sure you eat some of the following: dark green vegetables (broccoli, brussel sprouts, asparagus), orange colors (carrots, yams, winter squash), legumes (kidney beans, pintos, black beans, hummus, lentils, split peas), starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas) and leafy vegetables (romaine lettuce, spinach, arugula, cabbage, kale). Fruits Choose a variety of fruits including fresh fruits, frozen fruits, or fruits canned in water or their own juice. Dried fruits and juices are concentrated calorie sources. Fats and oils Oils, butter, margarine, mayonnaise, and salad dressings are all sources of fat. Fats such as these have about 45 calories per teaspoon. A general guideline is to limit fat to 2 tablespoons (total) per day. Other sources of fat include cream cheese, half & half, cream, avocado, olives and nuts. Although vegetable oils are healthier for the heart than animal fats and trans-fats, all fats have the same number of calories. Fats should be limited to control calories if your weight gain is excessive. You can use food labels on packaged foods to find information on fat content. Look on the Nutrition Facts Label for Total Fat grams. Low fat is defined as 0-3 grams of fat per ounce of meat or cheese (or per serving of all other foods). A medium fat choice has 4-7 grams of fat, and anything with 8 grams of fat or more is a high fat selection.Additional diet tips Grains Make half of your grain servings whole grain choices. Try whole wheat tortillas, whole grain breads, brown rice, oatmeal, millet, bulgur, and whole grain pastas. When reading labels, 3 grams of fiber per serving is a good choice, and 5 grams of fiber per serving means the choice is high in fiber. Meats and proteins Skinless poultry and fish are naturally lean. Other lean selections include sirloin, tenderloin, flank steak, lean pork, ham, and Canadian bacon. Remove skin from poultry. Avoid fatty meats such as bacon, sausage, hot dogs and ribs. Use low fat cooking methods such as braising, broiling, baking, grilling, or poaching. Make sure all meat and egg dishes are cooked until well-done. Do not eat raw or undercooked fish or meat. Deli meats should be re-heated until steaming to reduce the risk of food borne illnesses. Vegetarian protein sources such as beans and lentils provide beneficial fiber. Many soy-based meat substitutes are available including veggie burgers, tofu hot dogs and soy breakfast links. Milk and dairy Choose nonfat and low fat milk and yogurt most often. Look for reduced fat cheeses. All dairy products should be pasteurized. Some cheeses may contain bacteria called listeria. Milk, yogurt and cheese are excellent sources of calcium. Calcium is needed for maternal and fetal bones and teeth. The recommendation for pregnancy is to get at least 1,000 mg of calcium per day. There is 300 mg calcium per cup of milk or yogurt, or per 1\u00bd ounces of cheese. If you do not meet your calcium requirements through diet choices, you may need a calcium supplement. If you take a calcium supplement, more of it is absorbed if you do not take the calcium at the same time as your prenatal vitamin. Calcium is absorbed best in doses up to 500 mg at one time. So if you want to supplement 1000 mg of calcium it is best to take 500 mg at two separate times of day. Calcium interferes with iron absorption. Take calcium supplements at a separate time from prenatal vitamins and iron supplements.Beginning Your Pregnancy 17 Food Safety Guidelines during Pregnancy Food safety is very important for pregnant women. Alcohol Women should not drink any alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol has toxic effects on the unborn baby and can cause nutrient deficiencies. Even one to two alcoholic drinks per day can increase the risk for miscarriage and the baby's risk for birth defects and low birth weight. Mercury Eating fish is healthy in pregnancy, and is thought to benefit babies' brains. Fish and shellfish offer important nutrients such as high quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Unfortunately, fish may contain a contaminant called mercury. Mercury can harm the nervous system of the developing baby, so pregnant women should be cautious about which seafood they choose. While most fish contain only trace amounts of mercury, some fish and shellfish con - tain significant amounts and should be avoided. Choices to avoid : swordfish, tilefish (Gulf of Mexico) , shark , and king mackerel , tuna, bigeye . Choose chunk light tuna instead of white or steak alba core tuna. Chunk light tuna is lower in mercury. If you choose to eat albacore tuna, it is recommended that you limit intake to no more than 6 ounces per week. Eat up to 12 ounces per week from a variety of fish and shellfish that are known to be low in mercury. Best choices: wild salmon, tilapia, cod, sole, trout, pollock, haddock, catfish, and shrimp. The Environmental Protection Agency has a fish advisory website with up-to-date information and links to information on fish local to your area: http://www.epa.gov/ost/fish The American Pregnancy Association provides information on mercury in fish: http://americanpregnancy.org/?s=mercury +and+fish Additional information can be found at the following websites: www.cdc.gov, oehha.ca.gov/fish/women-and-children or www.fda.govGeneral guidelines Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating. Avoid eating raw or under cooked meats, poultry, fish, or eggs. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Avoid refrigerated pate, smoked seafood or meat spreads unless they are part of a cooked dish. Eat perishable foods before \"use by\" date. Store food in the refrigerator at 40\u00b0 or less, or in the freezer at 0\u00b0 or less. Discard foods that look or smell spoiled. When in doubt, throw it out. When cooking Scrub fresh fruits and vegetables under running water. Thoroughly cook meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Hot dogs and deli meats may contain bacteria. Cook them again before eating to reduce the risk of infection. Raw chicken has a high bacteria count, so be sure chicken juices do not come in contact with other foods or kitchen surfaces. Wash hands and utensils with warm water and soap after handling raw foods. Clean cutting boards, sponges and work surfaces after each use. When dining out Avoid salad bars that seem unclean. Avoid eating fresh foods displayed without refrigeration. Ask for food to be well-cooked (meat: well-done; eggs: firm). Use caution at picnics, parties and buffets where foods may be left at room temperature too long. 18Caffeine We recommend limiting to no more than 12 oz of caffeine a day. It is known that caffeine is a diuretic, which means it increases urination and can lead to dehydration. It can also worsen heartburn. There is caffeine in coffee, tea, cola drinks, energy drinks, chocolate and some medications. Sugar substitutes The following sweeteners are approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe for use in pregnancy and breastfeeding: Acesulfame K (Sunett, Sweet One) Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet, however, - mended as it crosses the placenta and may remain in the baby's tissues. Lead Lead is a toxin that can cause miscarriage and harmful to babies' brains. Avoid cooking in lead-glazed pottery (which may come from Mexico or China). Lead can also be found in some imported candies, spices and natural remedies. Remodeling your home can result in exposure to lead from old paint. Other exposures include jobs or hobbies in battery manufacturing or recycling, making jewelry or stained glass. For more information, please contact your provider or visit: www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/pregnant.htm Listeria Listeria is a common bacteria in soil that very rarely makes pregnant women very sick. The general food safety guidelines on page 18 will prevent most exposures to listeria. Periodically, produce or other foods will be recalled due to concern for possible listeria contamination. Most people who have consumed the recalled foods will not get sick. If you have consumed recalled foods but do not have a fever, no testing is necessary. If you develop a fever or nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, call your provider. Food safety is very important for pregnant women.Beginning Your Pregnancy 19 Weight Gain during Pregnancy It is important to eat a balanced, healthy diet during pregnancy. It only takes about 300 extra calories per day to support the additional needs for pregnancy. The goal amount of weight to gain during pregnancy depends on how much you weighed before becoming pregnant. Underweight women need to gain more than average, while overweight women should gain less. For your optimal weight gain ask your provider or use the BMI and pregnancy weight gain calculation www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-weight-gain.htm For women who are pregnant with twins or more , the weight gain goals are higher: Average weight women should gain 37-54 pounds For women who are pregnant with twins or more, discuss goal weight-gains with your healthcare provider Very overweight women should gain 25-42 pounds Information on this page was compiled from Weight Gain during Pregnancy: Reexamining the Guidelines available at www.nap.edu ...goal amount of weight to gain during pregnancy depends on how much you weighed before becoming pregnant 20Exercise during Pregnancy A general rule of thumb is that things that keep you healthy when you are not pregnant continue to keep you healthy when you are, including exercise. Thirty (30) minutes of exercise everyday has been shown to greatly benefit your health. Pregnancy, birth, and newborn care are very physical endeavors. All will go better, with fewer complications, if you are in shape! When you are pregnant, regular exercise can help: Avoid excessive weight gain, which may decrease your risk of cesarean delivery Lower your risk of diabetes in pregnancy Lower your risk of developing high blood pressure Improve your mood, energy level and sleep Prevent constipation and back pain What types of exercise are safe to do? Many studies have examined exercise in pregnancy, with the consensus being that exercise is beneficial, not risky, for pregnant women. There are few restrictions on what you can do. Running, spinning, Pilates, yoga, weight lifting, aerobics, and swimming are all fine. It makes sense that sports which increase your risk of falling or injury should be avoided (ex: contact sports, downhill skiing). Even in these instances, the most likely risk is to you (ex: broken ankle), not your baby. If you are already involved in an exercise program you can likely just continue it with some pacing and adjustments as you get farther along. This is not the time to train for a marathon or break new records but to consider it a \"maintenance\" phase. If regular exercise will be new for you, your goal would be to build up to 30 minutes a day. It doesn't have to be done at one time; for example taking two 15 minute walks is just as good. Joining a pregnancy exercise class, walking with a work friend at lunchtime, taking the stairs, and walking after dinner with family are motivating and simple ways to meet the goal. In either case, it's always best to start by having a conversation with your pregnancy provider about your exercise plans. Guidelines: Drink plenty of water Avoid getting overheated (breaking a sweat is good, though!) Avoid getting so out of breath that you can't talk Avoid extended periods flat on your back in the second half of pregnancy Hot tubs and saunas should be avoidedBeginning Your Pregnancy 21 Preparation for Breastfeeding The hormones of pregnancy will naturally prepare your body to breastfeed your baby(ies). Increase your knowledge of how to breastfeed through the following resources: Women's Health Resource Center Great Expectations Breastfeeding class Breastfeeding resources page 60 Lactation consultant can recommend helpful books on breastfeeding Breast changes Many women will notice that her breasts become larger and more tender. This is due to the development of milk producing glands. The areola may darken, and the Montgomery glands (the small bumps on the areola) may become more prominent. Later in pregnancy your breasts will begin to produce colostrum: this is the baby's first milk, a thick, sticky yellow or clear liquid. Although small in quantity, it is full of protective factors for your newborn baby. Take a breastfeeding class with your partner: You will learn many invaluable tips to get through the first few weeks of breastfeeding. Feeding your infant frequently (8-12 or more times in 24 hours) in the early days and weeks will help create abundant milk for your baby....you cannot overfeed a breastfed baby. We strongly suggest learning more about breastfeeding prior to delivery. Women with history of breast issues - may benefit from lactation. Flat or inverted nipples: If you have nipples that do not protrude, it may help to wear Soft Shells for Sore nipples (Medela). These will help your nipple stretch, and will make it easier for your baby to latch. Skin-to-skin: Studies over the past 30 years have shown the importance of immediate skin-to-skin contact. Babies held skin-to-skin stay warmer, calmer, cry less, and breastfeed better, then babies who are swaddled and put in a crib. Your partner can share skin-to-skin time with you. Your amazing newborn will be hard wired to breastfeed: when placed skin-to-skin, your healthy, newborn baby will probably latch with very little help. In the womb they have been practicing sucking and swallowing since the early second trimester. If you need help with breastfeeding, make sure to ask for help as soon as possible. The hospital nurses, and lactation consultants are eager to help you get off to a good start. Breastfeeding support If you need help after you leave the hospital you can make an appointment with the UCSF Outpatient Lactation Consultant at (415) 353-2566 or attend the Mother & Infant Lactation Kooperative (MILK) Support group, pre-register at (415) 353-2667. Colostrum: this is the baby's first milk, a thick, sticky yellow or clear liquid. Although small in quantity, it is full of protective factors for your newborn babyEMMI video See a Lactation Consultant 22Toxins in your Environment Toxic substances are chemicals and metals that can harm your health. Everyone is exposed to toxic substances everyday, but developing fetuses, children, pre-teens, and teenagers are especially vulnerable. Below are recommendations on how to prevent and reduce exposures at home, work, and in the community. Prevent exposures at home Keep your home a smoke-free environment Don't let people smoke around you and stay away from public places where people are smoking Choose safe home improvement projects Pregnant women should stay away from remodeling projects and recently remodeled rooms Check the ingredients in personal care products like soaps and cosmetics Many of these products have ingredients that can harm reproductive health. Find links to safer products on our resource page at prhe.ucsf.edu/toxic-matters-resources Don't use pesticides to spray bugs, kill bacteria or mold, or in tick-and-flea pet collars. Find pesticide-free alternatives at prhe.ucsf.edu/pesticides-matter Avoid foam products that contain flame retardants Flame retardants can be toxic to brain development- ensure that foam products like crib mattresses and other upholstered items are labeled 'flame-retardant free' or comply with TB-117-2013 Find more information about flame retardants from the EPA and more on our resource page at: prhe.ucsf.edu/toxic-matters-resources Clean your home with non-toxic products like vinegar and baking soda Many toxic substances are present in dust and can spread into the air when swept Use a wet mop or cloth to clean floors and surfaces and vacuum, using a HEPA system if possible, weekly Pick your plastics Avoid household products like shower curtains, toys, and food containers that contain toxic chemicals like vinyl chloride and bisphenol A (BPA)Don't use plastic containers for hot drink or food, and use glass instead of plastics in the microwave Keep mercury out of your home and diet Mercury can be found in household items such as light bulbs and thermometers and food like big fish (i.e., tuna, swordfish, orange roughy, shark) Avoid lead exposure Call the National Lead Information Center for information about how to prevent exposure to lead at: 800-424-LEAD Test for radon if you have basements or ground floors Learn more by calling 1-800-SOS-RADON Tips for a healthy diet Avoid foods grown with pesticides. If buying organic doesn't fit into your lifestyle, buy fruits and vegetables with the lowest pesticide levels. Learn about these foods and more at: prhe.ucsf.edu/food-matters Wash fresh fruits and vegetables Limit foods high in animal fat. Toxic substances can built up in fat tissues Avoid canned and processed foods as much as possible. Many cans have BPA lining Prevent Exposure at Work Know your rights in your work place- you have the right to a safe and healthy work environment Talk to your employer about potential hazard - ous substances and exposures. Always follow guidelines, use protective gear, and follow protocol when handling potentially harmful substances in the work placeBeginning Your Pregnancy 23 Dental Health It is important to take good care of your teeth and gums while you are pregnant. Pregnancy causes hormonal changes that increase your risk of developing gum disease, which can affect the health of your developing baby. Do not skip your dental checkup appointment simply because you are pregnant. Now more than any other time, regular gum examinations are important because pregnancy causes hormonal changes that increase your risk for getting periodontal disease and tender gums that bleed easily - a condition called pregnancy gingivitis. Pay attention to any changes in your gums during pregnancy. If tenderness, bleeding or gum swelling occurs at any time during your pregnancy, talk with your dentist as soon as possible. Practice good oral hygiene to prevent and/or reduce oral health problems. If X-rays are necessary, your dentist will use extreme caution to safeguard you and your baby. Advances in technology have made X-rays much safer today than in past decades. If nausea is keeping you from brushing your teeth, change to a bland toothpaste.

Cocaine is one of the most harmful drugs to unborn babies. It can cause a miscarriage and may cause pre-term birth, bleeding, fetal death and fetal strokes, which can lead to brain damage and death. After birth, a baby who has been exposed to cocaine before birth withdraws from the drug. Symptoms include the jitters and irritability. These babies are hard to comfort and are often unable to respond to being comforted. Cocaine use during pregnancy may also be linked to an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Amphetamines, also called speed, are harmful to unborn babies. One study showed that the babies of mothers who used speed during pregnancy, weighed less, were shorter and had a smaller head size. Another study showed that these babies had more strokes (bleeding into their brains). Marijuana Marijuana is never safe during pregnancy and it can harm the baby at any stage of development. Its use can affect fetal and infant development and may cause a miscarriage. Studies indicate that prenatal marijuana use is linked to premature births, small babies at birth, difficult or long labor and increased jitteriness in newborns. Marijuana smoked by a pregnant woman remains in the baby's fat cells for 7 to 30 days. Smoking marijuana can affect the amount of oxygen and nutrients the baby gets to grow. Marijuana can have long-term effects on infants and children including trouble paying attention or learning to read. Alcohol Since it is not known if there is a safe level of alcohol during pregnancy, it is best not to drink at all. Even one drink a day has been shown to have effects on the growing fetus. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of miscar - riage, stillbirth, newborn death and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Babies with FAS have low birth weight, heart defects, facial defects, learning problems and mental retardation. The best time to stop drinking alcohol is before you conceive. If your pregnancy is unplanned, you should stop drinking as soon as you think you might be pregnant. Tobacco Smoking is a very serious health concern for both mother and baby. If you smoke, quit now. Ask your health care provider for information about classes or support groups for pregnant women who want to quit. Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have babies who are too small. Babies born weighing less than 5 pounds may have more health problems early in life and learning problems in school. Smoking also increases the risk for miscarriage, pre-term labor, stillbirth and newborn death. Vaping is not a safe alternative to smoking. Even if there is no nicotine, there is no information about content and its safety in pregnancy. Prescribed drugs Some prescribed medications may be harmful to your unborn or nursing baby. If you are taking any prescribed drugs, tell your health care provider as soon as possible, so medications can be changed or adjusted, if appropriate. However, do not stop taking regularly prescribed medications without talking with a health care provider first!Tobacco, Marijuana, Alcohol and Drugs during Pregnancy The use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs can have a harmful effect on anyone's health. When a pregnant or breastfeeding woman uses these substances, her baby is also exposed to them. All these substances cross the placenta through the umbilical cord and enter into the baby's bloodstream. While pregnant, it is best to eat well, stay healthy, and avoid taking anything that may be harmful to you or your baby's health. 28Secondhand Tobacco Smoke and Children's Health Smokers are not the only ones being harmed by their habit. Non-smokers who are exposed to tobacco smoke - especially newborns and children - often suffer health effects from this secondhand smoke. This is true even when smokers only smoke outdoors! Immune system damage and infections Infants and young children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at higher risk for infec - tions. This may be the result of damage to their developing immune systems. Secondhand smoke has been shown to cause respiratory infections in children, including pneumonia and bronchitis. These infections can be severe and even life-threatening in children who already have asthma or cystic fibrosis. Secondhand smoke has also been shown to cause ear infections in children. Ear infections are more frequent and last longer in children exposed to secondhand smoke. They are also the most common cause of hearing loss in children. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death in children aged 1 month to 1 year. The causes of SIDS are not completely understood. The risk of SIDS is higher, however, in infants exposed to secondhand smoke. Resources Smokers Help line (1-800-NO-BUTTS): www.californiasmokershelpline.org U.S. Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.gov/tobaccoPrenatal risks Secondhand smoke can affect a pregnant woman's developing baby. Babies born to moth - ers who are exposed to secondhand smoke tend to weigh less than babies not exposed. They are also more likely to be born early (premature). Each year in California, secondhand smoke causes as many as 4,700 early births. Dangers to children Children may be exposed to secondhand smoke in homes and day care, at outdoor smoking areas, in cars, and anywhere that people are smoking cigarettes, cigars and pipes. Secondhand smoke can cause chronic symp - toms like cough, phlegm, and wheezing in infants and children. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have more visits to health care providers for these problems. Asthma Asthma is a chronic health condition. Its symp - toms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Asthma is the number one reason children are admitted to hospitals. Secondhand smoke has been shown to cause new cases of asthma. It also has been shown to make children's existing asthma worse. Children with asthma who are exposed to secondhand smoke have more severe symptoms, use more medication, and miss more days of school than those not exposed. Beginning Your Pregnancy 29 Violence during pregnancy is common. Each year, 1 in 12 pregnant women in this country is battered by her partner. Violent abuse is more common than any other serious complication of pregnancy. It is as dangerous to the baby as it is to the mother. Health risks to the woman Abused pregnant women have a higher-than-average risk for tobacco, alcohol and drug use, as well as depression and suicide attempts. All of these things have negative effects on the baby. Abused women also have more problems in pregnancy, such as anemia, infections, and bleeding in the first 6 months of pregnancy. Health risks to the fetus Battering during pregnancy can lead to injuries that may cause premature delivery, low birth weight and miscarriage. Battered pregnant women are 4 times more likely to have babies with low birth weight than women who are not battered. Effects on the newborn Abuse usually increases after the baby is born. The stress in the relationship can cause the infant to have difficulties being comforted, calming down, feeding and sleeping. It can also cause delays in the child's physical and language development. Exposure to violence can have lasting effects on the child's health. Children who witness intimate partner violence are likely to exhibit anxiety and depression, be aggressive with peers, and can have poor memory and concentration resulting in learning problems. As they get older, they are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol and engage in criminal activity and/or anti-social behavior. Are you safe in your relationship? Do you feel afraid of your partner? Has your partner ever hit you, hurt you, or threatened you? Has your partner ever forced you to have sex? Does your partner keep you from your family or friends, or keep you from being in control of your own money? Protect Yourself and Your Baby from Violence If you answer \"yes\" to any of these questions, you are not alone. Talk to your health care provider, nurse-midwife or childbirth educator. They can help you live more safely within your relationship or safely leave the relationship. They can also connect you with advocates at UCSF and in the community who can help you.

As part of your routine prenatal care or when you are in labor and delivery, you will be tested for HIV unless you decline. HIV testing during pregnancy is the best choice for you and your baby. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIV is a disease that weakens the immune system, making it hard for the body to fight infections. It is primarily spread by having unprotected sex or sharing needles with an HIV-infected person. Most HIV-positive women in the U.S. have been infected through sex with men. A pregnant woman who is HIV-positive or who has AIDS can pass HIV to her baby during pregnancy, delivery, and while breastfeeding. The HIV test A small amount of your blood will be drawn for the HIV test. This test will help you and your baby by alerting you to the need for treatment if you are HIV-positive, which means you are infected with the virus. An HIV-positive result If you are HIV-positive, you will want to discuss treatment options with your health care provider. They will likely recommend medication that is considered safe in pregnancy. Treatment during pregnancy, labor and delivery can help decrease the risk of transmitting HIV to your baby. You may be encouraged to continue the medication after delivery for your own health, depending on a number of factors. Protect yourself from HIV Use a latex/polyurethane condom (male or female) when you have sex, even if you are pregnant. Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based lubricants weaken condoms and make them less effective. Do not share needles for injecting drugs or steroids, or for tattooing and piercing. Resources For HIV referral and consultation resources including experts on prenatal HIV treatment in your local area call the California HIV/AIDS Hotline: (800) 367-2437 (AIDS). Beginning Your Pregnancy 31 Depression is common Depression and anxiety affects 10-20% of all women in pregnancy and postpartum. They can begin before the baby is born or develop months after the baby arrives. Any woman can develop mood concerns during pregnancy or postpartum. Having the blues is a normal part of adjusting to pregnancy and motherhood. It is common for most pregnant women and new mothers to have emotional ups and downs and to feel overwhelmed. After delivery, a majority of women will develop postpartum blues within the first two days to two weeks. Many women find that talking to family and friends (including other new mothers), taking time to care for themselves and getting more rest and assistance with childcare duties will help them feel better.Depression and Anxiety during Pregnancy and After Delivery Pregnancy and the postpartum (after delivery) period are times of great change - physically, hormonally, emotionally and socially. Even though pregnancy and birth are joyful occasions, they are also times of increased stress that put women at higher risk for mood concerns like depression and anxiety. Mood concerns during pregnancy and postpartum: more than just the blues Anxiety and depression is more serious than the blues . Besides being very difficult for you and your family, depression and anxiety, instead of just depression can interfere with your baby's intellectual and emotional development. Women who are depressed, suffer from a variety of the symptoms below every day for two weeks or more: Mood concerns in perinatal setting include: Anxiety Attachment difficulties Depression Grief reaction Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms of perinatal mood concerns: Tearfulness/sadness Irritability Anxiety/racing thoughts/panic Difficulty concentrating Excessive guilt In extreme cases, thoughts/feelings about hurting oneself or the baby Hopelessness Loss of appetite Obsessive thoughts Sleeplessness ..Women find that talking to family and friends (including other new mothers), taking time to care for themselves...will help them feel better. 32Depression or Anxiety during Pregnancy and Postpartum is Treatable Untreated mood concerns can last for months or years, but there are many good treatment options available. They include: individual therapy, group therapy, medication, support groups, mindfulness meditation, and yoga. Many antidepressant medications can be taken during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.

Call (415)353.2566 to schedule an appointment. Beginning Your Pregnancy 33 Pregnancy is a time of physical and emotional change. Personal history, symptoms, and attitudes about becoming a parent influences the feelings that a woman has about her body and about making love during pregnancy. The pregnancy may change how a woman and her partner feel about making love. There can also be differences in sexual need. The best way to deal with these differences is to talk, to listen and to be open to each other's feelings and concerns. Talk with your health care provider during one of your prenatal visits about any questions regarding sexual practices and their effect on the baby and the pregnancy. Pregnancy changes and sexuality Many women are nauseous and tired during pregnancy. If a woman feels that way, she may not feel like making love. Sex is safe during pregnancy and many women continue to enjoy it. During pregnancy there is an increase in blood supply to the pelvic area. Many women enjoy sex during pregnancy. A woman's breasts increase in size during pregnancy, and get even larger with sexual arousal. For some women this is the first time that they truly enjoy having their breasts fondled, while others experience these changes as uncomfortable due to breast tenderness. As the pregnancy progresses and a woman begins to gain weight, positioning and comfort become important in lovemaking. A woman may become depressed as the shape of her body changes. She may be bothered by increased pelvic pressure as the baby begins to move down into the pelvis. She may not like the idea of sex, and her partner may also worry about hurting the baby. Orgasm may be somewhat frightening during pregnancy. Upon reaching orgasm, the uterus contracts in a rhythmical fashion. In a pregnant woman, these contractions may last longer. They can sometimes turn into long, hard contractions that may feel uncomfortable. Sensitivity to each other's wishes is important. Cuddling and massage may be another way to share intimate time together. Sex during Pregnancy Pregnancy and safe sex Partners need to be honest and realistic about sex during pregnancy. Open communication may help to avoid frustration. Since AIDS/HIV infection is transmitted through sexual activity, always practice safe sex. HIV infection can be transmitted to your unborn child. If you have questions about what safe sex is, and want to discuss concerns in confidence, call (800) FOR-AIDS and ask for a health care provider. Sexuality and high-risk pregnancy Certain problems can occur during pregnancy that put the baby at risk for premature delivery. If you are experiencing vaginal bleeding, preterm labor or ruptured membranes, you should not have sex and avoid having orgasms. Your health care provider will tell you if sex could be harmful, but do not hesitate to ask if you have questions or concerns. 34UCSF Research Studies for Pregnant Women As a patient at UCSF, you are able to participate in research studies to help improve the health of women and babies in the future.

Beginning Your Pregnancy 35 Travel Recommendations Every woman's pregnancy is different and we encourage you to discuss specific travel plans with your healthcare provider. However, for most women with uncomplicated pregnancies, travel through around 36 weeks is generally thought to be safe. Here are a few things to consider as you make plans: Every airline has different requirements for travel. In the unlikely event that you have a pregnancy complication while traveling, you may wind up being unable to fly home as planned. Travel insurance and/or flexible flights may be good investments in the event of unexpected complications that require you to change your plans. If/when you do travel: Wear your seatbelt low and under your belly Drink plenty of water Consider wearing compression stockings (knee-length, can be purchased at the drug store) Walk frequently (get up to walk at least 10 minutes every 3 hours) Consider an aisle seat to allow easy access to the restroom and the aisle to stretch your legs Consider traveling with your health records If you do travel...An aisle seat will allow easy access to the restroom and the aisle to stretch your legs. 36Preparing for Birth to do list More information on many of these topics can be found throughout the booklet.

An active baby is a healthy sign. Babies also have sleep periods throughout the day which can last for over an hour. On any day that you feel your baby is not moving as much as usual, follow these steps: Eat and drink something. This may help wake your baby up if he or she is sleeping. If you feel 4 kicks or movements within one hour, you need not worry. If your baby moves 4 times before the hour is up, you can stop counting. If the baby has not moved 4 times by the end of the hour, call the advice line during business hours (Monday-Friday 8-4:30 pm) at (415) 353-2566 or the UCSF Center for Mothers and Newborns at night or on weekends at (415) 353-1787. Preparing for your test: Please arrive for the test having fasted for at least 8 but no more than 10 hours. Fasting longer than 10 hours can result in a false-positive test. The testing process: We appreciate your patience, as the complete glucose tolerance test involves three separate blood draws and takes approximately three hours to complete. Please arrive before 2pm to ensure that the entire test can be completed. An initial fasting blood sugar is obtained. Before proceeding with the rest of the test we must wait for this result to come back, which can take approximately 30-40 minutes. If the fasting blood sugar result is within our normal range, you will then be given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. One hour and two hours after the sugar drink, we will collect two more blood samples to complete the test. Why are some tests stopped after the fasting blood sugar: If your initial fasting blood sugar result was 92 mg/dL or higher, then we will stop the test prior to giving you the sugar drink, as this result alone is sufficient to indicate that you have gestational diabetes.What should I do if my test indicates I have gestational diabetes: This result may come as a shock to many women, and if you are feeling a little overwhelmed and/or frustrated, you are not alone. Please be assured that you will have many opportunities to discuss this diagnosis and ask any questions you may have in the coming days and weeks. A nurse from the Diabetes Clinic will contact you to discuss next-steps. Typically this involves attending our GDM class where you will learn both how to test your blood sugars at home and about diet to help manage your GDM. Please do not worry and please do not stop eating! You and your baby need nutrients (including carbohydrates). If you are eager to make adjustments immediately, it is reasonable to avoid juices, sodas, candy and sweets until you learn additional dietary advice. Also, if you don't already get regular exercise, adding a walk into your daily routine can really help. While a diagnosis of GDM is not necessarily welcome, please know that you will have lots of help and we have every reason to believe that you will have a very healthy pregnancy! Sincerely, Your Diabetes in Pregnancy TeamGestational Diabetes Testing Thank you for taking the time and effort to have your Gestational Diabetes (GDM) testing completed. As you may know, UCSF recommends testing for GDM in all pregnancies, as it is quite common (~20% of pregnant women) and proper treatment can dramatically improve overall health and pregnancy outcomes. Below is some key information that you may find helpful. 38Infection At the time of birth, babies are exposed to the GBS bacteria if it is present in the vagina. This can result in pneumonia or a blood infection. Full-term babies born to mothers who carry GBS in the vagina have a 1 in 200 chance of getting sick from GBS during the first few days after birth. Occasionally, mothers also get a postpartum infection in the uterus. Testing for GBS During a regular prenatal visit 3 to 5 weeks before your due date, you or your health care provider will collect a sample by touching the outer part of your vagina and also just inside the anus with a sterile cotton swab. If GBS grows in the culture that is sent to the lab from that sample, your health care provider will let you know so you can expect to receive antibiotics during labor through an IV. Prevention If your GBS culture is positive within 5 weeks before your delivery, your health care provider will recommend that you receive antibiotics during labor. GBS is very sensitive to antibiotics. A few intravenous doses given up to 4 hours before birth almost always prevents your baby from getting GBS during birth. It is important to remember that GBS is typically not harmful to you or your baby before you are in labor. Why we wait until labor to give antibiotics Although GBS is easy to remove from the vagina, it is not so easy to remove from the intestine, where it lives normally and without harm to you. While GBS is not dangerous to you or your baby before birth, if you take antibiotics before you are in labor, GBS will return to the vagina from the intestine, as soon as you stop taking the medication. Therefore, it is best to take antibiotics during labor when it can best help you and your baby.Occasionally GBS can cause a urinary tract infection during pregnancy. If you get a urinary tract infection, it should be treated at the time it is diagnosed and then you should receive antibiotics again when you are in labor. Symptoms that a baby is infected Babies who get sick from GBS infection often do so in the first 24 hours after birth. Symptoms include difficulty breathing (including grunting and having poor color), fluctuating temperature (too cold or too hot), or extreme sleepiness that interferes with breastfeeding. Treating GBS in a baby If your baby is full-term and the infection is caught early, it is very likely the baby will com - pletely recover with intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment. Of the babies who get sick, about 1 in 6 will have serious complications. Some very seriously ill babies die. In most cases, if you carry GBS in the vagina at the time of birth and you are given antibiotics in labor, the risk of your baby getting sick is a 1 in 4000 chance. Penicillin Allergy Penicillin or a penicillin-type medication is the antibiotic recommended for GBS infection. Women who carry GBS at the time of birth and who are allergic to penicillin, however, can receive different antibiotics during labor. Be sure to tell your health care provider if you are allergic to penicillin and what symptoms you had when you got that allergic reaction. Resources: Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.gov/groupbstrepGroup B Strep in Pregnancy Group B Strep (GBS) is one of many common bacteria that live in the human body without causing harm in healthy people. GBS lives in the intestine from time to time, so sometimes it is present and sometimes it is not. GBS can be found in the intestine, rectum and vagina in about 2 out of every 10 pregnant women near the time of birth. GBS is not a sexually transmitted disease, and it does not cause vaginal discharge, itching or other symptoms. Later in Pregnancy and Preparing for Birth 39 Certain factors may increase a woman's chances of having premature labor, such as carrying twins. Often, the causes of premature labor are unknown. Sometimes a woman can have premature labor for no apparent reason. It may be possible to delay a premature birth by knowing the warning signs of premature labor and by seeking care early. Warning signs and symptoms Uterine contractions that occur six or more times in an hour, with or without any other warning sign Menstrual-like cramps felt in the lower abdomen that come and go or are constant Low dull backache felt below the waistline that may come and go or be constant Pelvic pressure that comes and goes and that feels like your baby is pushing down Abdominal cramping with or without diarrhea Increase or change in vaginal discharge such as change into a mucousy, watery or bloody dischargeUterine contractions It is normal to have some uterine contractions throughout the day. They often occur when you change positions, such as from sitting to lying down. It is not normal to have frequent uterine contrac - tions (six or more in one hour). Frequent uterine contractions may cause your cervix to begin to open. Recognizing Premature Labor A term pregnancy takes about 40 weeks to complete. Babies born before 37 weeks may have problems breathing, eating and keeping warm. Premature labor occurs after the 20th week but before the 37th week of pregnancy. It is a condition in which uterine contractions (tightening of the womb) cause the cervix (mouth of the womb) to open earlier than normal. It could result in the birth of a premature baby. Uterine contraction What You Should Do If you think you are having uterine contractions or any other signs and symptoms of premature labor: Lie down tilted towards your side. Support your back with a pillow. Sometimes lying down for an hour may slow down or stop the signs and symptoms. Do not lie flat on your back because lying flat may cause the contractions to occur more often. Hydrate yourself. Drink several large glasses of water. Sometimes being dehydrated can cause contractions. Check for contractions for one hour. To tell how often contractions are occurring, check the minutes that elapse from the start of one of your contractions to the beginning of the next one. Call your health care provider at (415) 353-2566 or go to the hospital if you have: Six or more uterine contractions in one hour, or Any of the other signs and symptoms for one hour, or Bleeding or leaking fluid from your vagina 40Non-medical approaches The UCSF Center for Mothers and Newborns provides a number of options for comfort during labor, including space to move around, tubs for soaking, rocking chairs, and beds that convert into different positions. Relaxation and breathing techniques ease the discomfort for many as do the presence of family and friends and the support of health care providers. Comfort measures can be learned from classes during your pregnancy or from books and DVDs available through UCSF Great Expectations. Medical Approaches Injections of a narcotic can be given intra - venously (IV) during labor. The narcotic works quickly and can be given every 30 minutes during labor. It is not given immediately before delivery, however, to ensure that the effects of narcotic are not present during delivery. For some women this \"takes the edge off,\" and allows them to rest and relax between contractions. Nitrous oxide gas can be inhaled during contractions through a hand-held mask (it is the same gas that you may have used at the dentist). Similar to the narcotic, the gas can lessen but not eliminate the pain of labor. The effect occurs only while the gas is being inhaled and disap - pears rapidly when the mask is removed. It can be used through delivery. Pain Relief for Labor and Vaginal Birth Labor and birth are hard work and involve some discomfort. The amount of discomfort during childbirth varies from woman to woman. Women also choose different ways to experience their births. Some women choose medication or anesthesia and others do not. Most choose to \"see how it goes\" and make choices as labor unfolds. Epidural anesthesia offers the most complete pain relief during labor and birth. A tiny tube or catheter is placed through a needle into a space (the \"epidural space\") outside the spinal cord sac in the lower part of the woman's back. The needle is removed and the tubing is taped in place. Similar to an IV, medication is given continuously through the tube during labor and birth. The medication blocks the pain of contrac - tions and birth, other than pressure. Because of the numbness produced by the epidural, a woman with an epidural cannot get out of bed (and usually takes the opportunity to get some rest). Support from UCSF Anesthesia Department The UCSF Anesthesia Department has a team available to the UCSF Center for Mothers and Newborns unit 24 hours a day. An anesthesia resident meets with every woman admitted in labor regardless of whether she is planning anesthesia for her birth. An anesthesia attending in the hospital supervises this resident. The purpose of this visit is: 1) to learn of any medical problems a woman may have in the unlikely event of an emergency; and 2) to answer any questions a woman may have about the pros and cons of medical approaches to pain relief. If you are interested in taking a FREE Pain Relief in Labor class with a UCSF Anesthesiologist, please call Great Expectations at (415) 353-2667Later in Pregnancy and Preparing for Birth 41 Reasons for a cesarean birth Most often women have a cesarean birth when labor does not progress (the cervix does not completely dilate or the baby cannot be pushed out) over a long period of time. It is a decision made by the woman and her doctor when both feel everything else has been tried and this is the only alternative. Sometimes a cesarean birth is planned. Situations that might require a scheduled cesarean include: Breech position Previous cesarean section Placenta previa (placenta covering the cervix) Although it is rare, a cesarean birth can sometimes be necessary due to an emergency situation that endangers the woman's or her baby's health. In these situations, there is no time to wait for the regular process of labor, and the decision to perform a cesarean section must be made very quickly. Indications for an emergency cesarean may include: Maternal bleeding Baby in \"distress\" Anesthesia for a cesarean birth For a planned or non-emergency cesarean, either an epidural or a spinal is the anesthesia of choice. It allows the mother to be awake and able to see her baby as soon as it is born. In an emergency situation, the mother is put to sleep using general anesthesia. This is the fastest anesthesia to administer when time is of the essence. Support/partners at cesarean delivery If the mother is awake, a support person can be with her for the birth. If general anesthesia is used and the mother is asleep, support people need to wait in the labor room or waiting room until the surgery is completed. Type of incision Most often a \"bikini cut,\" or low transverse incision, is made both on the skin (just above the pubic hair) and on the uterus itself. This is done for both comfort and recovery. Occasionally an \"up and down\" or vertical incision is made on the skin and/or uterus. This is a faster cut and may be used in an emergency. The size and position of the baby may also determine the need for this kind of incision. Recovery from cesarean delivery Recovery from surgery takes longer than recovery from a vaginal birth. Most women are ready to go home on the third day after surgery. Also, more help at home might be required in the first few weeks after delivery. The next pregnancy and birth Many women choose to attempt a vaginal birth after cesarean, often called a VBAC, and many succeed. Every woman who has had a cesarean birth needs to discuss the subject of VBAC with her health care provider. Many factors including the reason for the cesarean, the type of incision and the number of prior cesareans influence the safety of vaginal birth after a cesarean. Cesarean Birth While most women will have a vaginal delivery, some may need a cesarean section. UCSF is now offering Family-Friendly Cesarean deliveries for families meeting criteria. In this supportive environment, one or two family members, or support persons, may attend the delivery. Mothers can opt to bring in a small portable device to play her own music during the birth of her child. Surgical draping with a clear window is used to allow for observation of the birth. Skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding is encouraged and supported in the delivery room. In the event of unplanned surgery this approach may not be possible. 42Circumcision If you have a baby boy, you will be asked if you want to have him circumcised. This is a matter to be considered carefully before the baby is born while you have time to think about it and discuss it with your partner and your baby's health care provider. At birth, boys have skin, called the foreskin, that covers the end of the penis. Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, exposing the tip of the penis. It is usually done on the day of hospital discharge. A baby must be stable and healthy to be circumcised. It's the parents' choice The American Academy of Pediatrics considers circumcision a choice for parents to make. There are no strong medical reasons for this procedure. Some parents choose circumcision for religious or cultural reasons. To make a decision, it is important to understand the pros and cons, how the surgery is done and what complications can occur. Medical reasons some parents choose circumcision Research suggests some medical benefits to circumcision: A slightly lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTI). A circumcised baby has about a 1 in 1000 chance of getting a urinary tract infection in his first year of life. Uncircumcised babies have a 1 in 100 chance. A slightly lower risk of getting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV A lower risk of getting cancer of the penis, but this cancer is very rare for all men Prevention of foreskin infections Prevention of phimosis, a condition in which it is impossible to pull back the foreskin Medical reasons some parents might not choose circumcision There are some risks of the surgery. Complications from circumcision are rare but include bleeding, infection and injury to the penis or urethra. The foreskin protects the tip of the penis. When the foreskin is removed, the tip of the penis may become irritated and cause the opening of the penis to become too small. This can cause urination problems that may need an operation to correct. The foreskin has more nerve endings than the tip of the penis, or glans, and its removal decreases sensitivity. Uncircumcised boys can be taught proper hygiene to lower their chances of getting infections and STIs. The surgery For most babies, circumcision is performed before you and your baby go home. Like any surgery, circumcision is painful. To relieve the pain, a numbing cream is placed on your baby's penis about an hour before the procedure. Right before the procedure, the doctor injects a local anesthetic at the base of the penis. Then a clamp is attached to the penis and the foreskin is removed by scalpel. Circumcision takes just a few minutes. You can be with your baby during the operation, if you choose. Not all insurance companies pay for the proce - dure. If you plan to circumcise your son, contact your insurance provider for information about coverage. Care of the circumcised penis You will be instructed by the nurse or doctor about the care of your baby's circumcised penis. Keep the area as clean as possible after the surgery. Clean the penis with every diaper change and apply the ointment provided so that the penis does not stick to the diaper. It takes about 7 to 10 days for the penis to fully heal. Call your health care provider if you notice any signs of infections such as redness, swelling or foul-smelling discharge. Care of the uncircumcised penis The nurse or doctor will instruct you on how to care for your baby's uncircumcised penis as part of routine baby care. Wash the outside of the penis with soap and water. Do not pull back the foreskin toward the base of the penis. It should never be forced. After washing, place the foreskin back over the head of the penis. By the time your son is about 3 or 4 years old, the foreskin will begin to pull back naturally and your son can be taught how to wash the head of the penis and inside the fold of the foreskin.

It provides everything your baby needs to grow and develop for the first 6 months of life. Breastmilk continues to provide at least \u00bd of your baby's nutritional needs for 6-12 months. Breastmilk is easy to digest. Premature babies benefit greatly from breast milk because they absorb it better than formula. It contains special nutrients and protective factors that a premature baby needs to grow, develop and stay healthy. Breast milk has substances not found in formula that improve your baby's IQ, vision and digestion. Breastfeeding can reduce your baby's incidence of diarrhea, ear infections, breathing problems, blood poisoning, allergies, urinary infections, meningitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Exclusively breastfeeding a baby for at least 2 months decreases their risk for childhood type 1 diabetes. Breastfeeding after introducing solid foods ensures good nutrition and helps with digestion. Benefits to mother may include Improved recovery from Childbirth Increases self-esteem Breastfeeding releases prolactin, a hormone that promotes relaxation, and oxytocin, which promotes bonding between mother and baby The longer a woman breastfeeds, the more protected she is against obesity. Women who had gestational diabetes can reduce the chances of developing type 2 diabetes by breastfeeding. Extended breastfeeding lowers a mother's risk of developing coronary heart disease, the number one killer of women in America.Protects from ovarian and breast cancer and bone loss after menopause. Breastfeeding can help new mothers lose weight by burning up to 500-800 calories per day. Mothers who breastfeed miss less work to care for sick infants than those who use formula. Breastfeeding is a great way for mothers to bond with their baby.The Importance of Breastfeeding The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, and continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, for a total of one year or longer as desired by mother and infant. Our Lactation Consultant(s) work together with Labor and Delivery nurses who are trained in addressing and triaging lactation needs. There are Postpartum Lactation Nurses who are available to assist those patients with more challenging and difficult breastfeeding needs. At UCSF, we strongly encourage you to breastfeed for many reasons: See Breastfeeding & Community Resources, page 60.A mother's milk is full of antibodies that protect against chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and obesity. Children who are breastfed for more than six months have been shown to score higher on fine motor skills (such as wiggling fingers and toes) and cognitive, receptive and expressive communication (such as attention, memory, listening, speaking, and writing). Infants who are breastfed exclusively for more than six months are four times less likely to contract pneumonia . Breastfeeding after six months continues to provide babies with antibodies, immunities to infections, as they begin to crawl and put items in their mouth. Children who are breastfed for six months are significantly protected against eczema, a skin disease, for their first three years of life. The longer a mother breastfeeds, the less likely her child will need braces or speech therapy. 46Great Expectations Pregnancy Program Prenatal Childbirth Preparation Classes We offer a variety of classes and groups to help expecting mothers and their partners prepare for birth, breastfeeding, and parenting.

Fee: No ChargeLater in Pregnancy and Preparing for Birth 47 Protect Your Baby in the Car Beginning with your baby's first car trip, make the car safe by using an approved infant car seat. This is very important because: Car accidents are the most common cause of death and injury for babies and small children. Most accidents occur within 5 miles of home. Most of these deaths and injuries can be pre - vented with the proper use of a car safety seat. A parent's arms are not a safe place for a baby, even for a short ride. A small impact or sudden stop could knock a baby from their arms. Infancy is the best time to begin car safety habits that should be continued for the rest of your baby's life. California Car Seat Laws (V.C. 27360-27368) state that all children under the age of 8 or under 4 feet 9 inches in height must be properly restrained in an appropriate child safety seat in the rear seat of a motor vehicle. Children age 8 or older, or who are 4'9\" or taller, may use the vehicle seat belt if it fits properly with the lap belt low on the hips, touching the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt crossing the center of the chest. If children are not tall enough for proper belt fit, they must ride in a booster or car seat. Keeping Your Baby Safe Have your car safety seat inspected by a certified child safety seat technician. Call your local California Highway Patrol office or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (888) 327-4236 for locations. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends using a rear-facing car safety seat for infants and toddlers until they are at least 2 years of age or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat's manufacturer. Any child who has outgrown the rear-facing weight or height limit for his convertible car seat should use a forward-facing car seat with a harness for as long as possible, up to the highest weight or height allowed by the car seat manufacturer. California State Law states that children under 2 years old must be rear facing unless they weigh 40 pounds or more, or are 40 inches tall or more. The seat should be installed tightly; it should not move more than an inch. Follow your car seat manufacturer's instructions and your vehicle owner's manual on how to install. Booster seats should be used for children under the age of 8 or under 4 feet 9 inches in height. All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing car seat until they are at least 2 years of age or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat's manufacturer. All children younger than 13 years of age should be restrained in the rear seat of vehicles for optimal protection. Never place a rear-facing car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle. Unless there is no rear seat or the car safety seat cannot be properly installed. If your baby needs to ride rear-facing in the front seat, make sure the airbags are turned off. Do not use a used child safety seat unless you are certain it has never been in a collision. Keep the car clear of clutter to avoid any additional impact in the event of a collision. Register your car safety seat with the manufacturer to receive recall information or register with the NHTSA.

When to call your health care provider If you think you are in labor: 1st baby - contractions every 5 minutes for 1-2 hours 2nd baby - talk to your health care provider ahead of time about when to come to the hospital If you think your bag of water broke If you have bleeding like a period If the baby is not moving as much as they normally do If you have any questions or concerns Arriving at the hospital Address UCSF Betty Irene Moore Women's Birth Center1855 Fourth Street, Third FloorSan Francisco, CA 94158(415) 353-1787 Entrance Enter at the main hospital entrance at 1855 4th Street The entrance is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Check in with Security at the Main Information Desk (unless it's an emergency).

Long-term parking: Public parking at UCSF Medical Center is available, for information about parking rates, call (415) 476-2566. Patient valet parking will be offered on weekdays from 8AM to 6PM (last drop off at 3:30pm) in front of the Hospital outpatient building at 1825 4th Street. Public transportation The San Francisco Muni buses 22-Fillmore, 55-16th Street, T-Third Street line all stop at UCSF Medical Center. Visiting hours Your primary support person is allowed 24/7 access. Other Family/Friends/Siblings: 8:00am-8:00pm A brief health screening will be completed for visitors by the Welcome Desk. Please encourage any friends or family members to stay home if they have any signs of illness. Your delivery team At the time of delivery, there is always an attending physician and most often a nurse-midwife in the hospital. They, along with a nurse and resident, will be your core health care providers during your labor. Based on the unpredictable nature of labor, there is no guarantee that your primary health care prenatal care provider will be available on-call at the time of your delivery. 50Birthing suite You will labor and give birth in a birthing suite and spend a few hours there after delivery. Each birth suite is equipped with a sofa that turns into a cot, a television, telephone and rocking chair. Each room also has a private bathroom, includ - ing a tub with Jacuzzi\u00ae jets and a shower head, which is good for massage. You can still use the tub after your water has broken unless there is a medical reason not to do so. You can labor in the tub, but you must come out of the tub for delivery. The bed can be placed into many positions and also has a squatting bar. You can labor in any position that is safe, in or out of bed. If you choose to have an epidural, you will not be able to walk or get out of bed during the remainder of your labor. After delivery Our goal is that your baby will be dried, placed on your belly and covered with a blanket so that skin-to-skin bonding can take place. Immediately after delivery, your baby's condition will be evaluated. Your baby's birth recovery, including birth weight, will be assessed in your birthing suite. If your baby needs a higher level of care, you may accompany your baby, or send your partner or a family member with the baby. Both the newborn nursery and the intensive care nursery are located on the 3rd Floor of the hospital. Cesarean birth If there is a need for you to have a cesarean birth or delivery, there are three Operating Rooms on the floor. After cesarean, you will be moved to a recovery area for about 2 hours. You may have up to 2 support people in the operating room with you depending on the circumstances. Nurseries Both the well-baby nursery and intensive care nursery are staffed 24 hours a day by physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners to care for and meet the needs of your baby throughout your stay. After delivery and depending on the condition of your baby, they will visit the nursery for assessment and care. Staff also perform newborn screening testing, vaccinations and circumcisions in the nursery. After a cesarean birth, the baby often recovers in the nursery. While most healthy babies typically room with their mother during her stay, the staff may sometimes assess a baby and care for it in one of the nurseries. Babies who require greater care stay in the intensive care nursery.Postpartum care A few hours after delivery, you and your baby will be moved to a postpartum room, where you will remain for the rest of your hospital stay. This is usually 1 or 2 nights after a vaginal birth and 2-3 nights after a cesarean birth. This private room (which has your own bathroom and shower) is equipped with a television, telephone and a sofa that turns into a cot. You may have one person spend the night with you. There is also a bassinet for your baby. Your baby should not be in bed with you while you are sleeping. If you get sleepy, the baby should go back in the bassinet. Staff can assist you with this if you need help. The UCSF Center for Mothers and Newborns has a shared pantry, which nurses can access, with ice machine, popsicles, juice and a refrigerator. Everything you need for your baby during his/her first couple days of life, such as diapers and clothing, is provided during your stay. Be sure to bring the things with you that you will need to take your baby home, such as a change of clothing, a hat, blanket and an infant car seat, which is required by law. Lactation & Postpartum All Labor & Delivery nurses are trained in addressing and triaging lactation needs post-partum and are able to assist with general Breastfeeding questions. There are Post partum Lactation Nurses in the unit who are available to assist those patients with more challenging and difficult breastfeeding needs. What you might like to bring to the hospital with you Bathrobe and slippers Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, massage oil, lip balm Snacks and drinks for your support people Clothes for you to wear home An outfit, hat and blanket for your baby to wear home Infant car seat is required for discharge. Mom Mobile After your baby's birth, enjoy the convenience of educational and support services right in your hospital room! If you are interested in viewing the Mom Mobile catalog during your hospital stay, please ask your nurse or call the coordinator at the Women's Health Resource Center (415) 514-2670.Later in Pregnancy and Preparing for Birth 51 Our philosophy and practices at UCSF We provide you and your family with the best evidence-based care, and we adhere to the following standard procedures: Explain recommended interventions including medications or breaking the bag of water around the baby before proceeding. Encourage movement while in labor as often as possible. Encourage families to create the birthing environment that they desire. Encourage eating and drinking in labor, unless otherwise medically indicated. Support women who choose to have an un-medicated birth and encourage them to bring support people to help make this possible (including doulas for those who chose doulas). Support women who desire pain medication with 24/7 availability of anesthesia (these options are discussed upon your arrival in labor and can be modified at any time) Do not offer routine enemas or shaving. Perform episiotomy rarely and only when necessary for the health of mother or baby. Encourage getting breastfeeding guidance from our team after the birth. Do not offer babies formula or sugar water without an important medical reason (or for babies who will be formula-fed). Encourage skin-to-skin contact as soon as the baby is born as long as baby is transitioning well. Routinely delay procedures and first bath to enhance bonding and promote breastfeeding. In most cases, if you are having a vaginal birth, you will be assisted by an OB-GYN Resident and a Certified Nurse-Midwife attending. If any complications arise, you will be evaluated and possibly treated by the Chief Resident and OB-GYN Attending. After birth, the baby will be treated with erythromycin eye-ointment to reduce the risk of certain eye-infections that may be transmitted at the time of birth and a vitamin K injection to reduce the risk of bleeding. These medications are recommended for all newborns. Please mark your preferences and bring this with you to your next prenatal appointment to discuss with your care provider. In addition, present a copy to the nurse upon arrival to Labor & Delivery. During my labor and birth, I plan to have the following people in the room with me: To assist with my comfort, I would prefer: [ ] Alternative pain relief options (such as breathing, massage, hydrotherapy, position changes). [ ] I will ask for medication if needed.[ ] To hear about my medication options if you see that I am having difficulty coping with labor.[ ] To try IV narcotics [ ] To try Nitrous Oxide [ ] An epidural (regional Name: Reviewed with: 52Other preferences include: [ ] Intermittent fetal monitoring if it is safe for my baby [ ] A saline lock placed when my blood is drawn during hospital admission. I understand this will allow IV access for medications and hydration, if needed, but will allow me freedom of movement. [ ] Not to have an IV placed on admission. I understand that I will need to stay hydrated by drinking clear liquids and may need an IV later in the labor process. When pushing, I would prefer: [ ] To \"labor down\" until I have the urge to push, for a maximum of 1 hour, if it is safe to do so. [ ] To be offered coaching if progress is slow or pushing is not felt to be effective[ ] To be given a choice to push in whatever position feels most comfortable as long as it is safe. [ ] To use a mirror to see the baby as it crowns[ ] To touch the baby as it crowns After the birth, I would like: [ ] A delay in cord clamping, as long as baby is transitioning well[ ] To have the cord blood collected for banking (I have provided a cord collection kit) To have my birth partner: [ ] Cut the umbilical cord[ ] Stay with the baby during routine care procedures[ ] Announce the sex or our baby If a cesarean birth is necessary, I would like to: [ ] Have my birth companion present: _______________ [ ] Have the baby placed skin to skin post delivery For my baby: [ ] I plan to have usual newborn treatments including Erythromycin eye ointment and the Vitamin K injection[ ] I plan to decline use of Erythromycin eye ointment, but consent to Vitamin K injection. [ ] I do not consent to Erythromycin ointment and the Vitamin K injection. (I am aware that a pediatrician will speak to me about the risks.)[ ] I consent to Hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital (usual recommended treatment for newborns) [ ] I wish to decline Hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital If I have a boy, I plan to: [ ] Have him circumcised before leaving the hospital[ ] Not circumcise For the baby's feedings, I plan to: [ ] Formula feed [ ] BreastfeedLater in Pregnancy and Preparing for Birth 53 UCSF Center for Mothers and Newborns UCSF Betty Irene Moore Women's Hospital Birth Center Welcome Desk 1855 4th Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94158 (415) 353-2787 Parking Patients may be dropped off at the circle at 1855 4th Street, for about 15 minutes.

A certified copy will be mailed to your home. Should you ever need additional certified copies, you may get them from the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Office of Vital Records or the California Office of Vital Records. A birth certificate is a legal document, which your child may need to: Obtain a social security number Enroll in a school Obtain a work permit Apply for a driver's license Obtain a passport Apply for various benefits, such as public assistance and military Please be certain the information on the certificate is accurate and complete. Your signature on the birth certificate confirms that you have carefully reviewed the information and that it is correct. An amendment form is required to make corrections to the birth certificate. It can take up to one year to apply an amendment, and it becomes a two-page document instead of a single page. Many changes on the birth certificate require the applicant to go to court for a court order. Common mistakes that require amendments: Use of a nickname rather than the formal first name (i.e., Kathy instead of Katherine) Misspelled first, middle and last names of child and/or parents Incorrect state, country and/or birth date of parent(s) Reversed order of last (family) names Incorrect sex of child Incorrect birth date If you make an error, amendment forms may be obtained at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Office of Vital Records or the California Office of Vital Records.
