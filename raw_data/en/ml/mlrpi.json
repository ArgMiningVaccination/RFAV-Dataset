Blubrry Nominated Favorite Woman Podcaster! Ranked in the Best 20 Christian Health Podcasts! As our summer days are coming to an end, I must say that I'm really going to miss it. I had some of my most memorable moments from enjoying the hot sandy beaches, walking on the boardwalk, to hiking in some of the most beautiful forests that I've ever seen, as well as spending quality time with family and friends. Although Summer can bring fond memories, it can also present challenges regarding our health. I know this all too well living on the Jersey shore. One of the things that we are on high alert about is Tick season which is from May-October. If you are bitten by a tick this can lead to Lyme Disease. If left untreated, Lyme Disease can lead to more severe complications affecting the joints, heart, and nervous system. For years, my guest on today's show, Dr. Kim Grom, suffered from unexplained illnesses that she didn't know stemmed from Lyme Disease. She candidly shares how faith strengthened her for the healing journey and what holistic treatments she implemented to recover and maintain her health. Listen. Apply. Transform.
