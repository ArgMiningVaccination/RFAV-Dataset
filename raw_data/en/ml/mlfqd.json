One of the best examples was written about 5,000 years ago in the Mahabharata in the war between the Kauravas and Pandavas. The wicked Duryodhana mixed snake poison with food in an attempt to kill his cousin-brother, Bhima. After losing consciousness, Duryodhana tied Bhima up and threw him into a nearby pond, where he was bitten by hordes of snakes living at the bottom. Though his body was filled with the terrible venom, Bhima miraculously survived. To Duryodhana's dismay, the poison he fed Bhima earlier neutralized the venom of the snake bites. In this way, the seed of inoculation grew into the concept of modern-day vaccination. While allopathic vaccines are biologic preparations made in the lab, Ayurveda uses immune-enhancing herbs, with centuries of proven benefit. Suvarnaprashan, which is gold powder rubbed with honey and ghee is given to newborns to lick and serves as the baby's first vaccination. Other 'Lehana' (licking medicines) made of herbal powders (kustha, vacha, brahmi, shankhpushpi, etc.) are also mixed with gold, ghee and honey to fortify the immunity of children. Not only is honey considered safe, it is a potent anti-microbial agent that also improves intelligence and digestive fire in infants. Panchagavya prashana is another type of vaccine given for disease resistance; it means 'five parts of the cow' and is made of fresh cow dung, milk, urine, curd, and ghee. It's often given with ashwagandha adjuvantly to enhance its effects. Ayurveda's approach to immunization is all-encompassing. 'Vyadhikshamatva' or resistance to disease through strong immunity is a core philosophy of Ayurveda. Strengthening the body is also covered under 'Rasayana and Vajikarana' (rejuvenation and aphrodisia) therapies. And, Nidan Parivarjan is the principle of avoiding causes of infection or disease. It requires awareness of how the body reacts to unwanted stimuli. Staying away from polluted water, air and noises which cause harm (5G is a case and point in our modern era!) are all examples. It also involves following healthy daytime, nighttime and seasonal patterns of lifestyle and diet, such as eating food rich in antioxidants, avoiding bad food combining, oiling, massaging, exercising, meditating, chanting mantras, and so much more. In Allopathy, vaccine shots are considered a safe and proven way to prevent unwanted diseases. Most of the world has been eradicated of smallpox, polio, tetanus and other diseases because of worldwide vaccination efforts. But not all people are keen on getting immunized, called 'vaccine hesitancy'. According to The World Health Organization (WHO), this is the main reason for major global deaths and disease outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccines are made up of parts of the offending agent and cause the body to develop passive immunity by making antibodies against it. This means the person receiving the vaccine needs to have good immunity for it to properly work. Two or more staggered doses are often needed for protection. Pediatric and adult immunization schedules are provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Vaccines and Immunizations | CDC. These rigorous schedules require parents to make tough decisions on timing of doses, combining vaccine, and simply whether or not to give them. Caregivers need to be able to manage vaccine side effects, which range from mild fever and pain at the injection site to severe reactions like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and anaphylaxis. Due to public fear, in 2001, thimerosal, a mercury compound used to manufacture certain vaccines, was removed from childhood vaccines because of concerns that it caused autism, though the evidence never proved this. Where does that leave us now? There is mounting pressure for worldwide covid vaccination amidst many unanswered questions. For example, what is the vaccine's actual effectiveness against the known strain and newer, more virulent strains? Will it be given yearly like the flu shot, or last longer? What are the differences in the various manufacturers' products? Who is a candidate and who is not, for vaccination? What is the long-term safety of the vaccine? Assuming a large percentage of people will likely receive the covid vaccine, it's a good idea to get prepared. Here is one approach, taken from Bharat Vaidya at Ayurved Sadhana Vidyalaya, that integrates the holistic practices of Ayurveda along with getting the covid vaccine: Starting 5 days before vaccination: Drink 2 glasses of warm or hot water upon awakening, eat a 1 cm piece each of fresh ginger and fresh turmeric. Have a warm, soupy diet consisting of red rice gruel, watery kitcharee and simple soups with spices like black pepper, asafoetida, and ginger. Drink a total of 6-8 glasses of warm or hot water in the day. This will remove toxins and build your digestive fire. Take supplements of Vitamin D3 1000 units, Zinc 50 mg, and a multivitamin to boost your immunity. Take herbs to purify the blood and liver - manjistha 1 tablet + guduchi (or shamshamni) 1 tablet after breakfast along with kanchanar guggulu1 tablet + punarnava guggulu 1 tablet after lunch and dinner. After vaccine administration: Eat a 1 cm piece each of fresh turmeric and ginger before meals, and continue the warm, soupy diet with spices. Drink a cup of hot milk (cow or nut) with 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper at night. Take guduchi (or shamshamni) 3 tablets every morning. Then for an additional 5 days, take guduchi (or shamshamni) 1 tablet in the morning, rasayan churna 1 teaspoon in hot water after lunch and dinner, and haritaki 2 - 3 tablets at bedtime. Finally, any prayer or meditation which uplifts your spirits will help the mind remain calm provide spiritual protection. Consulting an ayurvedic practitioner to guide you and personalize the regimen is recommended. Both Ayurveda and Allopathy subscribe to the \"Prevention is better than cure\" philosophy. Ayurveda is an all-inclusive system and does not shun vaccination. However, the current situation in which the covid vaccine underwent a fast-tracked development, makes for many unknowns. Using a combination of the lifestyle and dietary recommendations of Ayurveda along with taking the covid vaccine may be the best approach. We're living in a time of great change. It is important we stay informed, support one another through love and prayer, and use the great wisdom of Ayurveda to stay healthy and well-resourced. References: 1. Vaccination - Wikipedia 2.
