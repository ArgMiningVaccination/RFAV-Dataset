[Global health, equity and trust](/colloquium-2023/session/1452907/global-health-equity-and-trust) An important goal of global health is to advance health equity for all people worldwide. Trust in global health research, practice and policy is crucial for achieving this goal. In this plenary we start by examining the historical roots of mistrust in global health, citing examples of research abuses and barriers to the delivery of care in marginalised communities. This is followed by a discussion of challenges for evidence generation, synthesis and use encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we shift our focus to the impact of the profit motive on trust and equity in health and offer guidance on the conduct of systematic reviews focussing on the commercial determinants of health. We conclude by providing recommendations for improving research integrity and building trust in global health research. Keynotes: - How COVID broke the evidence pipeline (Helen Pearson) - Building trust in (global) health research (Gowri Gopalakrishna) - Why trust is an important issue in global health (Jimmy Volmink) - Commercial determinants of health: influence of private sector activities on evidence and equity (Mark Petticrew) The session will be chaired by Cochrane's Editor-in-Chief, inclusion](/colloquium-2023/session/1578361/global-health-equity-diversity-and-inclusion) [Assessing evidence certainty](/colloquium-2023/session/1578345/assessing-evidence-certainty) [Beyond the intervention question: three new Cochrane Handbooks as the pillars of methodological standards for producing high-quality systematic reviews with different types of evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1463327/beyond-the-intervention-question-three-new-cochrane-handbooks-as-the-pillars-of-methodological-standards-for-producing-high-quality-systematic-reviews-with-different-types-of-evidence) Cochrane's vision is a world of better health for all people where decisions about health and care are informed by high-quality evidence. Since its inception, Cochrane has pioneered and developed systematic review methodology with highly structured, transparent and reproducible standards. Historically, Cochrane has concentrated on systematic reviews of interventions, with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions being the leading guide for preparing and maintaining systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare interventions within Cochrane and globally. However, the health landscape has changed and given rise to complex challenges and a need for trusted health evidence to guide decision-making in areas beyond intervention research. To continue meeting the needs of the users of our research, it is essential for Cochrane to increase its capacity to address different research questions. To provide guidance on the methodological standards for producing high-quality systematic reviews with other types of evidence, Cochrane has expanded its Handbook collection to include the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (complete and available to buy), the Cochrane-Campbell Handbook for Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (complete and available in draft), and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Prognosis (in development with some chapters available in draft). These three new Cochrane Handbooks are led by the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests, Qualitative and Implementation, and Prognosis Methods Groups, respectively, and draw on the expertise of hundreds of contributing methodologists, researchers and editors worldwide. In this session, the Editors for each of the three new Cochrane Handbooks will introduce their Handbook and discuss methodological challenges that arise from these types of systematic reviews. In addition, they will highlight new developments in research methodologies and what they hope to achieve with the addition of these Handbooks to the collection of Cochrane guides that are available for authors, editors and the wider community. Target audience: Authors, editors, methodologists and anyone interested in different types of systematic reviews. Format: Lecture, panel discussion [Do's and Don'ts in the Rapid Review search: Find information faster without losing confidence in the results](/colloquium-2023/session/1473947/do's-and-don'ts-in-the-rapid-review-search-find-information-faster-without-losing-confidence-in-the-results) Background: Evidence syntheses are key tools to support reliable, unbiased, and reproducible healthcare decisions. However, identifying, appraising, and synthesizing new evidence is often resource intensive. The Cochrane Rapid Review Methods Group (RRMG) investigates ways to meet growing demands within resource constraints by using rapid review (RR) evidence synthesis methods. RR information retrieval methods aim to assist in accelerating the review process while still being systematic, transparent, and reproducible. Search processes may be abbreviated by 1) reducing time spent on conducting searches and 2) reducing the size of the search result. There are many ways to make searches more efficient, ranging from searching fewer sources to the application of limits, filters/hedges, and restrictions (e.g., publication dates, language, and precision-focused search strategies). But how do we decide which approach is appropriate for a particular topic or review goal? Objectives: The aim of the workshop is to present and discuss potential abbreviated approaches in RR information retrieval and their appropriate application to different research questions or goals (e.g., focused clinical questions, broader public health topics, and horizon scanning). Description: The workshop comprises four sections, combining short expert presentations with large and small group discussions. 1. Short presentation of the topic, definition of terms, and recently published guidance focusing on literature searching for RRs from the RRMG.[1] 2. Large group discussion: Collection of \"shortcut strategies\" and their pros/cons, as used by the participants. 3. Brief case studies from the presenters of how their organizations use RR search methods depending on the research question or review goals. 4. Small group discussion based on a case scenario: Participants will discuss possible search approaches for a specific research question, weighing pros and cons of frequently used shortcuts. Workshop prerequisites: Participants should be familiar with the fundamentals of systematic searching. Familiarity with RR methodology is welcome but not necessary. Patients or healthcare consumers are not involved in this workshop. However, the application of appropriate RR search methods is important for providing robust evidence rapidly in healthcare settings. [1] Klerings I, Robalino S, et al. Rapid Reviews Methods Series: Guidance on Literature search. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine. 2023(in-press). new ways to participate in Cochrane](/colloquium-2023/session/1473974/forward-together-new-ways-to-participate-in-cochrane) Background: Cochrane has developed many new ways to get involved, which go beyond authoring reviews. These include Cochrane Crowd, Cochrane Engage, translations, and consumer engagement. These initiatives are part of Cochrane's Membership Project that seeks to broaden our community by giving a wider range of people the opportunity to be part of Cochrane. In addition, developments and changes within Cochrane might open up lots of other new opportunities for people to participate. We seek to have an inclusive and diverse community, and so in this workshop we will discuss the impact and limitations of these existing options and consider additional ways in which the community can be involved. Objectives: The objective of this session is to learn about opportunities to get involved in Cochrane's ecosystem and identify new ideas for improving the current offering. Description: The session will be divided into two parts with greater emphasis given to the future-focused second part. The first part will look back at what we have achieved so far through brief presentations on topics, such as volunteer best practice or case studies regarding Cochrane Crowd, Cochrane Engage, translations, and consumer engagement. This will then be followed by discussion. The second part of the session will be future focused, asking participants how they think Cochrane can build on this work to further develop our diverse and global community through new ideas or through addressing the limitations of the existing options. This will take the form of small group discussions. The session will close with an open discussion about priorities for the future. Relevance and importance to patients: Patients are benefiting from these initiatives, for example, by gaining access to plain language summaries translated into their languages and improved evidence production. Patients are able to share their lived experience as healthcare consumers within Cochrane to improve evidence. [Research priority setting that inform or use systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473962/research-priority-setting-that-inform-or-use-systematic-reviews) Background: The Cochrane priority setting methods group has been working on developing guidelines and methods in this area and how it relates to the Cochrane Collaboration. There are a few areas that would be relevant to this conversation. These include the following: - conducting research priority setting exercises that inform prioritisation of topics for conducting or updating systematic reviews; - using systematic reviews on primary research on the topic as a source of information for stakeholders who participate in a research priority setting process; and - using systematic reviews of other research priority setting exercises to either replace a research priority setting exercise or inform one. Objectives: Our workshop will provide tools and guidance on how to use systematic reviews in the research priority setting process in any of the categories defined above. This includes how the methods of the research priority setting need to be adapted or the approach to conduct systematic reviews needs to be changed or adapted. Description: The workshop will start with a few presentations, followed by small group activities, and finally result in a final discussion and summing-up. Presentation: There will be two presentations: (a) the methods of setting priorities for research\u2014this includes guidance on how to make decisions and what methodology to choose based on the focus of the exercise and the stakeholders involved. This will be accompanied by a diagram on how to engage stakeholders in (b) the methods to conduct systematic reviews of research priority setting exercises and appraising them. The latter uses an adapted version of AMSTAR to conduct the evaluation. Exercise: The groups will be given different examples of research priority-setting exercises and systematic reviews of research priority-setting exercises along with appraisal forms to evaluate. Discussion and summing-up: The workshop will finish with reports from individual groups along with discussions on how these methods can be used in their organisations. [Better data extraction with Covidence and RevMan Web](/colloquium-2023/session/1473966/better-data-extraction-with-covidence-and-revman-web) Background: Cochrane review authors can now import completed data extractions and quality assessments (Risk of Bias) from Covidence into RevMan Web. When completed successfully, all the data collected in Covidence are added to the RevMan Web review, and authors are ready to proceed with setting up the analyses. This new workflow saves time and reduces the risk of error. Careful preparation and formatting of the data will ensure successful import into RevMan Web. This workshop will explain the requirements of this workflow in detail; demonstrate the process; and help reviewers to troubleshoot common problems. Objectives: At the end of this session, workshop attendees will be able to describe the steps of the workflow in detail; map study arms from Covidence to interventions in RevMan Web; and identify the fields in Covidence and RevMan Web that must match exactly to ensure successful transfer of data. Description: The new workflow requires use of the Extraction 1 tool in Covidence and the study-centric data feature in RevMan Web. Review authors download their data from Covidence in csv files which are then imported to RevMan Web. This workshop will provide slides and a demonstration of the new workflow. Example export files will be shown and modified to illustrate the process. Workshop attendees will also have the opportunity to ask questions, share their own experiences and ideas and give feedback. Healthcare consumers have not been involved in the planning of this workshop. Note for organisers: This session can be repeated as needed to enable as many people as possible to attend over the course of the 3 days. [ROB-ME: a tool for assessing risk of non-reporting biases in systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473957/rob-me-a-tool-for-assessing-risk-of-non-reporting-biases-in-systematic-reviews-with-or-without-meta-analysis) Background: Researchers' decisions about whether, when, how, or where to report studies or results are often influenced by the P value, magnitude, or direction of the study results ('non-reporting biases'). A consequence is bias in systematic reviews because the available evidence differs systematically from the missing evidence. Existing tools for assessing the risk of non-reporting biases are limited in terms of their scope, guidance for reaching risk of bias judgements, and measurement properties. Objectives: Introduce ROB-ME, a comprehensive new tool for assessing the risk of non-reporting biases in systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis and provide participants with the opportunity to apply ROB-ME. Description: The workshop will be split into two parts. 1. Introduction to ROB-ME: We will provide a brief overview of the key components of ROB-ME. These include: Specifying which syntheses will be assessed for risk of bias. Determining which studies meeting the inclusion criteria for the review have missing results. Considering the potential for missing studies across the review. Answering signalling questions to inform risk of bias judgements. These questions ask users to consider the extent of missing results in the studies identified, as well as the risk that a synthesis is biased because additional studies or results, beyond those already assessed, are missing systematically. 2. Applying ROB-ME: Participants will apply ROB-ME to an example systematic review within small groups. Each group will assess the example review with regard to a particular component of ROB-ME. In a plenary session, we will discuss the results of each group's assessment and issues that arose during the assessment process. The workshop will conclude with a facilitated, structured discussion focusing on the implications of using the tool alongside other risk of bias tools (e.g., RoB 2, TACIT) and further development needs for guidance and software. [Introduction to analysis and meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473928/introduction-to-analysis-and-meta-analysis-of-interrupted-time-series-studies) Background: Interrupted Time Series (ITS) studies are commonly used to evaluate public health and policy interventions when randomisation is impractical or infeasible; for example, examining the effects of mass media campaigns on the use of methamphetamine among young adults. In an ITS study, measurements on a group of individuals (e.g., community) are taken repeatedly both before and after the intervention. The key benefit of the ITS design is that any secular trend in the period before the intervention can be accounted for when estimating the impact of the intervention. Several effect measures can be used to characterise both short- and long-term effects of the intervention (e.g., immediate level-change and long-term level-change). Meta-analysis of these effect estimates can usefully inform decision-making. Objectives: In this workshop, we aim to equip review authors with the knowledge and tools to incorporate ITS in their reviews by: i) demonstrating how to digitally extract data from ITS graphs; ii) how to analyse ITS studies and meta-analyse their results; and iii) highlight design features to consider when assessing the risk of bias. This workshop will require access and basic competency in Stata or R and will assume knowledge of meta-analysis. Description: We will use a combination of presentations and computer practicals. For the analysis of the ITS studies, we will focus on fitting segmented linear regression models and demonstrate how to set up the data for analysis and undertake the analysis. We will discuss the complexities that arise when analysing time series data (e.g., autocorrelation). We will then demonstrate how to meta-analyse the resulting effect estimates. Finally, via example, we will use the ROBINS-I framework to discuss features of ITS designs that may bias effect estimates. [Consumer Involvement 101: producing Cochrane evidence with consumers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473930/consumer-involvement-101-producing-cochrane-evidence-with-consumers) Background: This workshop is for researchers and consumers who are interested in involving people in producing systematic reviews, and it aims to address the questions that people have, share the different possible methods, and explore the resources and support that are available. By the end of the session, participants will understand where to start their involvement journeys. Cochrane is committed to the production of Cochrane Evidence with consumers in its new Consumer Engagement and Involvement Framework and by signing the Putting People First pledge to involve patients in health research. Currently, approximately 1 in 10 reviews have some form of consumer involvement in the authoring of reviews. Whilst most researchers and consumers support the principles of consumer involvement, there is still much uncertainty about methods for involving people in reviews. Objectives: Introduce and discuss the concept and principles of coproduction; share examples and experiences of involvement and engagement from both researchers' and consumers' perspectives; introduce the ACTIVE framework for stakeholder engagement and involvement; identify barriers and enablers to engagement and involvement; describe the range of resources available to support coproduction; consider the implications of the increasing priority given to involvement and engagement; and introduce the principle of coproduction and diversity and inclusion in our work. Description: The workshop will be an interactive and practical session with opportunities for group work and discussion. The first part of the session will be a discussion about the key principles of involvement, engagement and coproduction. Presenters will be invited to share a number of short case studies of examples of involvement and coproduction from both researchers' and consumers' perspectives. These will be followed by a Q&A session. Participants will be introduced to the ACTIVE framework including concepts of power sharing, involvement in the lifecycle of review production, and the extent and nature of involvement. In small groups, participants will explore the practicalities of involvement and coproduction using the framework and case studies as the basis for discussion. The session will conclude with signposting to resources to support involvement, a discussion about the future of coproduction, and identifying barriers and increasing diversity and inclusion in this work. [Prepare for success! How to lead a review team and complete your review (or update) on time.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473979/prepare-for-success-how-to-lead-a-review-team-and-complete-your-review-or-update-on-time.) Background: An essential feature of performing Cochrane reviews is working well in a collaborative and interdisciplinary author team. Beyond the methodological aspects, logistical and management issues in the systematic review process can be rather challenging. Identifying and managing the different tasks required to complete a systematic review often falls on the lead author. Careful planning and effective communication within the team can reduce delays and ensure timely completion of tasks. Objectives: To discuss logistical and management challenges while planning and undertaking a systematic review; to identify possible solutions to managing a systematic review team and ensuring tasks are completed timely; and to weigh the pros and cons of these solutions and learn from the experiences of other teams. Description: This workshop will appeal to anyone interested in conducting a systematic review for the first time, those leading a review team, or those interested in learning about practical issues concerning team management. We will give a short presentation at the beginning of the workshop (15 minutes) to outline the scope of the session, introduce key issues concerning the effective management of a systematic review as well as common reasons for delay, and explain group activities. Attendees will participate in small groups to discuss challenges relating to logistical and management issues and complete a number of small tasks. These tasks involve brainstorming key issues around managing a review team (e.g., communication, responsibilities, setting targets, and keeping on track) and identifying the tasks involved in a review (from protocol to publication), methods for screening/data extraction (e.g., templates), and document/file management. We will try to ensure each group is formed by people with different backgrounds and expertise to bring a variety of views to the discussion (40 minutes). The groups will be asked to report the most critical aspects identified (5 minutes per group). We will stimulate debate on practical issues and provide tips that can assist review teams in undertaking project management from our own experience. Time will be allowed for discussion of the main areas of concern, and a short report on the workshop will be provided to all participants the week after the Colloquium. [Impacts of climate change on health and health systems: Producing evidence syntheses to support decision-making](/colloquium-2023/session/1473969/impacts-of-climate-change-on-health-and-health-systems-producing-evidence-syntheses-to-support-decision-making) Background The climate emergency is a pressing threat to human health and health systems. Members of the Cochrane community must bring our evidence synthesis expertise to the work of supporting effective decision making to adapt to or mitigate its impacts. Because of the multi-level and systemic challenge of this topic, relevant evidence is complex and heterogeneous. Synthesis of this evidence requires appropriate methods that incorporate interdisciplinary approaches. Objective To introduce participants to the knowledge and skills needed to conduct comprehensive and rigorous evidence syntheses on climate-health topics. Participants will gain an understanding of available relevant evidence synthesis methods and will be introduced to the skills needed to conduct their own syntheses. They will also have the opportunity to network with other researchers and practitioners working in the field. Description Overview of key concepts and terminology - Introduction to climate change and human health linkages - Adaptation and mitigation initiatives related to health and health systems Decisions related to conducting a review: - Framing the PICO question - Search strategies and selecting databases - Incorporating logic models/conceptual frameworks to link health and climate variables - Decisions about scope (lumping versus splitting) and levels of analysis - Addressing equity considerations - Establishing a review advisory board There will be facilitated small-group work sessions addressing specific issues for designing a protocol on a climate-health question. Participants can bring their own topics or work from sample topics provided by the facilitators. The workshop will conclude with a brief discussion of future methods needs for climate-health syntheses.

On 26th March 2020 we formed the Cochrane Covid Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group - an international group of methodologists, test accuracy specialists, statisticians, epidemiologists and clinicians committed to deliver a portfolio of reviews to provide and maintain a reliable evidence base on which test policies could be based. In the following days, Cochrane published two Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Protocols (on days 29 and 68), and five Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy systematic reviews (on days 91, 103, 153, 189 and 239) reporting on the accuracy of antibody tests, signs and symptoms, rapid antigen and molecular tests, imaging tests, and routine laboratory tests. Since then, Cochrane has published eight updates of these reviews, and a further four reviews are close to being completed. To date, these five reviews have been cited 3375 times, and used in 22 international guidelines. Completing these reviews has involved: recruiting over 100 researchers on a voluntary basis from more than 14 countries across six continents; developing new methods to deal with the magnitude of papers, use of pre-prints and new data sources; adapting protocols as knowledge and understanding developed; identifying and engaging with stakeholders (including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and the Cochrane Infectious Diseases group) to ensure the reviews were informative and addressed relevant questions; and developing working arrangements across Cochrane to enable timely publication, including rapid peer review, editorial support and fixing software challenges. Our approach exemplifies Cochrane's principles of collaboration, enthusiasm, avoiding duplication of effort, and minimizing bias whilst striving for clinical relevance, quality, open access and avoiding all conflicts of interest. This session will introduce the story of the team's approach and work. We will highlight the findings of the reviews, discuss the challenges and solutions we found in working in a new and moving area of health and technology, and discuss how we tried to make sure our findings had impact. We are keen to discuss our experience with the audience and the lessons we have learned. Target audience: Reviewers, methodologists, policymakers, funders, media, the public: all who are interested in seeing how an international team collaborates effectively and efficiently Format: Multiple short presentations followed by a panel discussion [The Commercial Determinants of Health and Evidence Synthesis (CODES): methodological guidance for systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1463369/the-commercial-determinants-of-health-and-evidence-synthesis-codes-methodological-guidance-for-systematic-reviews) The field of the Commercial Determinants of Health (CDOH) is growing rapidly, as evidenced by a new World Health Organization (WHO) programme on CDOH and increased researcher and funder interest. Evidence synthesis will be a crucial tool in the evolution of CDOH. While CDOH reviews can draw on existing methodological guidance, there are areas where the methods will differ, and there is no overarching guidance on the conduct of CDOH-focussed systematic reviews, nor on the specific methodological and conceptual challenges. CODES provides guidance on CDOH-focussed systematic reviews, from shaping the review question, through to disseminating the review. Existing methods guidance was used to identify key stages and provide a structure for the CODES guidance. The main objective of the session is to (i) present the guidance and initiate a discussion on its potential use and value to reviewers working in the field of CDOH, and (ii) to identify next steps for the development and implementation of CODES guidance. The session will be primarily focussed on discussion of the main steps of the CODES guidance: on the face validity of the guidance, on its likely acceptability to reviewers and how this can be enhanced. It will start with a short presentation on CDOH, and then a short structured exercise to identify participants' views of where CDOH-related biases may enter the review process. The findings of this exercise will be considered in the context of the current version of the CODES guidance, to identify key topics for further discussion. The session will end with a short presentation on equity considerations and how these might be incorporated into CODES. This session will highlight the special methodological and other considerations for CDOH reviews, including equity considerations, and provide pointers to areas for future methodological and guideline development. More generally, CODES will contribute to the reliability and utility of CDOH reviews (in line with the Colloquium theme of \"Producing Trusted Evidence\") and will help stimulate the production of reviews which are less affected by commercial biases, and more likely to improve the health and wellbeing of patients and the wider public. A member of the public will help design the session. Target audience: Review authors Format: Discussion [Putting evidence at the centre of everyday life](/colloquium-2023/session/1473976/putting-evidence-at-the-centre-of-everyday-life) Background: Citizens make many decisions each and every day. Some are personal decisions for themselves or their families, whereas others are decisions related to their community, their country, or the world. In January 2022, the Global Commission on Evidence to Address Societal Challenges released a report.(1) Two recommendations in particular speak directly to the impact of evidence on citizens: 1) help citizens use evidence to inform both personal decisions and decisions related to their community, their country, and the world; and 2) address the spread of false, inaccurate, and misleading information (also called 'misinformation'), which can lead to bad decisions and harmful consequences. These recommendations are in perfect alignment with Cochrane's goals of producing trusted evidence, advocating for evidence, and informing healthcare decisions. Objectives: This interactive workshop aims to support a discussion about 'putting evidence at the centre of everyday life,' including: the challenges in using evidence in everyday life; possible solutions to address these challenges; and potential barriers and facilitators to move forward with these solutions. The workshop will also be an opportunity to explore how to promote, contribute to, and/or lead efforts to put evidence at the centre of everyday life (keeping in mind the importance of a global lens and the challenges/opportunities present in different contexts). Description: The workshop will consist of a short presentation to prompt discussion, followed by small-group and plenary discussions. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to share their insights about how the challenges can be experienced locally and globally. Each small group will be asked to tackle a potential strategy to put evidence at the centre of everyday life, discussing whether and how it is relevant to their context and how it could be operationalized. These may include strategies to: - help citizens judge what others are claiming or more generally find (and receive) reliable information; - make evidence available to citizens when they are making choices; - engage citizens in asking questions and answering them (with new research or with existing evidence); and - make evidence-based choices the default or easy option. [Introduction to meta-analysis 1: meta-analysis of binary and continuous outcomes](/colloquium-2023/session/1473959/introduction-to-meta-analysis-1-meta-analysis-of-binary-and-continuous-outcomes) Background: A core component of many systematic reviews is meta-analysis, which is a method for statistically combining results across studies. Meta-analysis results often underpin healthcare decision-making. Most commonly, meta-analysis of binary or continuous outcomes are undertaken. Many issues need to be considered when meta-analysing binary or continuous outcomes ranging from data extraction through to the selected meta-analysis method. Objectives: To provide review authors with knowledge to undertake meta-analysis of binary and continuous outcomes. This workshop is part of a series of workshops delivered by the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group. Description: We will use a combination of presentations and practicals. We will begin with a brief recap of meta-analysis models. We will then cover issues specific to meta-analysis of binary and continuous outcomes, including: data extraction (e.g., for binary outcomes, extraction of event frequencies and/or effect estimates; and for continuous outcomes, extraction of standard deviations, or calculation from standard errors, confidence intervals, test statistics and P-values); effect measures (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio, standardised mean difference), with rationale for choosing between them; and different meta-analysis methods (e.g., inverse-variance, Mantel-Haenszel). [How to author, publish, and dynamically update digital and trustworthy living evidence summaries, guidelines, and decision aids using MAGICapp](/colloquium-2023/session/1473961/how-to-author-publish-and-dynamically-update-digital-and-trustworthy-living-evidence-summaries-guidelines-and-decision-aids-using-magicapp) Background: There is an increasing emphasis on using living evidence to inform decision-making; however, creating living guidelines and decision aids is challenging. MAGICapp (www.magicapp.org) is an open-access software for evidence users, synthesizers, guideline developers, and proponents of shared decision-making to facilitate the creation, dissemination, and updating of trustworthy, digitally structured living evidence and clinical decision support tools. MAGICapp was designed with multiple stakeholders (healthcare providers, consumers, methodologists) while adhering to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) guidance, with features that are continuously updated through research and innovation. Objectives: To learn about and get practical experience with authoring, publishing, and dynamic updating of digitally structured living guidelines and evidence summaries with summary of findings (SoF) tables, recommendations, and decision aids using MAGICapp. Description: The workshop will first introduce examples and features of rigorous practice evidence summaries and guidelines, starting from structured clinical questions (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes [PICO] format) to making SoF tables and recommendations and how MAGICapp facilitates a living format through dynamic updating. Participants will split into groups, simulating panels responsible for updating a guideline for a clinical issue where there is a newly published Cochrane systematic review. Each group will receive a Cochrane review and access to an example brief guideline in MAGICapp that includes a recommendation with a linked SoF table and decision aids (semi-automatically generated from the SoF). Participants will collaborate to author a modified guideline based on the latest review evidence using MAGICapp's features for updating and adapting content. Workshop facilitators will assist groups through \"guideline panel\" discussions and using MAGICapp. In a wrap-up session, participants will share experiences of creating and publishing living evidence and guidelines in MAGICapp and propose how to improve the software. [Assessing the certainty of the evidence from network-meta analysis using the GRADE approach](/colloquium-2023/session/1473922/assessing-the-certainty-of-the-evidence-from-network-meta-analysis-using-the-grade-approach) Background: Assessing the certainty of the evidence is among the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards, and it is also acknowledged as a key step in non-Cochrane reviews. Appropriate interpretation of the results from network meta-analysis (NMA) requires considering the certainty of the evidence. Objectives: For individuals considering conducting an NMA, to gain familiarity with and begin to gain facility in applying the GRADE Working Group's approach to rating the certainty of evidence in comparisons within an NMA. Description: The GRADE Working Group has developed an approach to rating the certainty of evidence (also known as confidence in evidence or quality of evidence) in each comparison within a network meta-analysis. The approach involves three steps: i) rate the certainty of the direct estimates, ii) rate the certainty of the indirect estimates, and iii) rate the certainty of the network estimates. The workshop will begin with an interactive lecture providing details of the approach and then review a step-by-step template for applying the approach. Workshop participants will then break into groups of five or six to work through an example of a network meta-analysis, guided by facilitators when needed. Before the end of the session, the facilitators will lead the large group in a discussion of the results and details of the assessments. [Assessing risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions: introduction to the ROBINS-I tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473953/assessing-risk-of-bias-in-non-randomized-studies-of-interventions-introduction-to-the-robins-i-tool) Background: Non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) can provide information about effects of interventions that is not available from randomized trials, but their results may be affected by confounding, selection and information biases. Assessing the risk of bias in NRSIs included in systematic reviews is essential to ensure the robustness of review findings. The ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions) tool (BMJ 2016;355:i4919), which provides a structured approach to such assessments, has been updated since its publication. Objectives: 1) To describe the ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias in NRSI. 2) To describe recent updates and improvements to ROBINS-I. 3) To provide participants with hands-on experience in ROBINS-I assessments. Description: This workshop will describe key features of the ROBINS-I tool and improvements to the version published in 2016. - Specification of a hypothetical pragmatic randomized trial that is free of bias, as a basis for risk of bias assessments. - Preliminary considerations at review protocol stage. - Specification of the effect of interest (either the effect of assignment to intervention or the effect of adhering to intervention). - Assessments of risk of bias within seven domains (confounding; selection of participants into the study; classification of interventions; deviations from intended intervention; missing data; measurement of outcomes; selection of the reported result). - Signalling questions to inform judgements on risk of bias. - Use of algorithms to map answers to the signalling questions to suggested risk of bias judgements. - Overall risk of bias in the result. The workshop will include a guided practical session. Working in small groups, participants will complete parts of a risk of bias assessment for a selected non-randomized study. There will be opportunities for discussion of the tool and its role in systematic reviews. Participants are encouraged to bring their own portable computing device to access detailed guidance from the internet (www.riskofbias.info). The facilitators are unable to provide printed copies of the guidance document. [Mapping Reviews and Evidence Gap Maps: Evidence syntheses for broader health questions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473949/mapping-reviews-and-evidence-gap-maps-evidence-syntheses-for-broader-health-questions) Background: Demand for evidence syntheses to inform health practice, policy, and research agendas has grown exponentially with methods evolving to address the increasingly diverse types of questions that patients, practitioners, and policymakers pose. Mapping reviews and evidence gap maps (EGMs) have emerged over recent years to answer broader research questions. They aim to identify gaps in existing evidence and guide future research. Typically, mapping reviews and EGMs have a visual output that can be interpreted by a wide range of key stakeholders, including patients. We will draw on our expertise undertaking EGMs across a diverse range of topics (including preterm birth, medicines repurposing and elder abuse) to illustrate their utility and method. Learning Outcomes: Workshop attendees will gain an awareness of mapping review and EGM method including when suitable for use; gain an awareness of stakeholder involvement and engagement in mapping reviews and EGMs; be able to create a framework for an EGM; and be able to create an EGM using EPPI-Mapper. Embedded signposting within handout materials will enable self-directed learning to a greater depth. Description: \u00b7 5 minutes: Introduction to workshop facilitators and how the session will run. \u00b7 15 minutes: Overview of mapping review/EGM purpose using examples from health and social care research. Use of an interactive e-learning tool to reinforce understanding. \u00b7 10 minutes: Small group work designing and assessing the suitability of research questions for EGMs. \u00b7 15 minutes: Introduction to methods for undertaking an EGM, including stakeholder involvement and engagement, particularly focused on EGM framework development. \u00b7 30 mins: Small group work to create an EGM framework for a pre-defined question using physical materials and a \"walk the wall\" facilitation approach. \u00b7 10 mins: Demonstration of EPPI-Mapper software for EGM creation. \u00b7 20 mins: Attendees use EPPI-Mapper to create their own EGM. \u00b7 5 mins: Round-up of learning outcomes and close. \u00b7 Post-workshop: An interactive online tool (Padlet) will allow participants to reflect on their learning and indicate if they would like to know more about anything. We will collate responses and use them to create an FAQ with signposted resources. [First do no harm: how can systematic reviewers do justice to harms? Deciding which harms to search for and how](/colloquium-2023/session/1473917/first-do-no-harm-how-can-systematic-reviewers-do-justice-to-harms-deciding-which-harms-to-search-for-and-how) Background: Any intervention that can have an effect has the potential to have an adverse effect. All systematic reviews of interventions should at least consider the harms of that intervention. Harms are important to patients, impacting on morbidity and mortality. There are many differences (as well as similarities) in how researchers should approach a review question on harms, as opposed to a question on benefit. Formulating the question on harms is a challenging but key step in the review process. Review teams need to decide whether to focus on specific harms (and if so which ones) or whether to have a broader objective. Balancing the quest for an answerable, useful question with limited resources is difficult. Searching for included studies on harms can also be problematic and often requires a different approach to searching for effectiveness studies. Obstacles include the lack of harm information in journal abstracts, inconsistent terminology and indexing, and the need to search a range of study designs beyond randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Objectives: To give guidance to review authors on formulating the question, signposting the available data sources on harms, and retrieving data for incorporation into a systematic review. This will include the development of optimal search techniques for different interventions and discussion of the impact of CONSORT-harms. Description: We will facilitate discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of a range of approaches to question formulation in systematic reviews incorporating harms. Next, participants will receive a number of scenarios and will work together in small groups to plan a search strategy for a comprehensive evaluation of harms. The scenarios will be drawn from real-life situations to cover a wide range of potential harms. At the end, the groups will give feedback on their search protocols and any points raised will be discussed further. Examples from existing reviews will be provided by the facilitator, as well as tips and tricks to solve specific issues, and examples of sources of support and help available. [Health Equity: Implications for Systematic Reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473931/health-equity-implications-for-systematic-reviews) Background: This is a core training session from a Cochrane Methods Group. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions includes a chapter on equity and specific populations. A Cochrane Interactive Learning module has been developed to accompany this chapter. This workshop aims to introduce all systematic reviewers to equity methods and provide tips for including equity considerations in all reviews. Average results may obscure differences in outcomes across specific populations, who may experience health inequity. Systematic reviews can explore the robustness of findings across specific populations, who may experience health inequity. Equity is defined as the absence of avoidable differences in health outcomes. Objectives: Participants will understand how to 1) incorporate equity considerations into their systematic reviews and 2) report equity considerations completely and transparently. Description: Participants will be introduced to the mnemonic \"PROGRESS-Plus\" and how it can be used to formulate questions and design methods to consider health equity (PROGRESS-Plus: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/language/culture/language, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital). We will discuss how to consider specific populations such as older adults, migrants, and those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We will introduce participants to guidance for reporting equity-focused reviews (PRISMA Equity 2012) and the GRADE Working Group guidance on considering health equity in guideline development. We will discuss the importance of stakeholder engagement in systematic reviews. Participants will work in small groups to discuss hot topics in the consideration of health equity in systematic reviews and how to implement equity assessments in all Cochrane reviews. [Demystifying R Part 1: How to use Shiny apps in information retrieval](/colloquium-2023/session/1473921/demystifying-r-part-1-how-to-use-shiny-apps-in-information-retrieval) Background: Information specialists increasingly rely on software tools for information retrieval. Tools created with the coding language R are of particular interest because R is both free and open source. These tools can be easily customized and extended. In addition, it is relatively easy to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) for R packages (so-called Shiny apps), which are particularly useful for people without coding experience. This is the first part of a two-part workshop. Part 2, submitted by Sarah Young, will present practical hands-on activities using R Coding and the RStudio coding environment. Objectives: The workshop aims to help participants incorporate R into their workflow and to demystify coding jargon. In addition, they will gain hands-on experience with individual Shiny apps that can help improve efficiency in information retrieval. Description: The workshop has a high level of interaction. It will cover the following topics: - Short introduction to R, with a focus on Shiny apps. - Hands-on activities with various Shiny apps including: 1) litsearchr (https://elizagrames.shinyapps.io/litsearchr/), development of search strategies using text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks; 2) citationchaser (https://estech.shinyapps.io/citationchaser/), citation chasing using Lens.org; and 3) citesource (https://github.com/ESHackathon/CiteSource), comparison of source contributions at different stages of the review process and generation of search summary tables. - Group discussion about the benefits and challenges of R tools for evidence synthesis, including identifying opportunities for collaboration and learning Our workshop is aimed at information specialists, librarians and other researchers who would like to learn the basics of R and try out different Shiny apps in a hands-on environment. If possible, please bring a laptop. No previous programming experience is required. The workshop is relevant to patient care because the use of software tools can lead to more efficient production of evidence syntheses, making them available in a more timely manner. In addition, the tools used in the workshop will help to create more robust searches, which are the basis for the accuracy and reliability of evidence syntheses, and ultimately help to improve the quality of the evidence used to inform decisions about patient care. [Break](/colloquium-2023/session/1623985/break) [Non-randomised studies and mixed methods](/colloquium-2023/session/1578370/non-randomised-studies-and-mixed-methods) [Editorial processes [Methodological and translation](/colloquium-2023/session/1578364/knowledge-translation) [Engaging stakeholders, building developing partnerships](/colloquium-2023/session/1578357/engaging-stakeholders-building-capacity-developing-partnerships) [Living evidence - from concept to reality](/colloquium-2023/session/1516284/living-evidence---from-concept-to-reality) We need trusted, up-to-date guidelines to stimulate clinicians to change their practice and provide patients with the best care. This is vital in a world where mistrust has become the norm, from anything to the news, body image or fake science. Credible guidelines must be independent, based on reliable information and - critically and demonstrably - in line with the latest research. Turning this vision into reality is not straightforward. Timelines for identifying new research, evaluating data, reviewing and amending guideline recommendations typically stretch from months into years. A new collaboration, the Global Alliance of Living Evidence (GALE), is attempting to demonstrate how this can be done, drawing on recent successes during the pandemic. This Special Session will provide an opportunity to hear from leaders in the field and to use live voting to track audience opinions. The session will explore the potential for new technologies such as artificial intelligence to support the process, and to consider what this means for future Cochrane Reviews. Target audience: Anyone with an interest in living systematic reviews, in particular those keen to collaborate with others to develop the approach and share ideas. Format: There will be some initial presentations followed by a group discussion to explore challenges and identify potential solutions. [Mind the gap! Building the evidence base for co-producing evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1463370/mind-the-gap-building-the-evidence-base-for-co-producing-evidence-synthesis) Cochrane is committed to the co-production of its evidence. The proposed Co-production Methods Group will support this by spearheading methods research to establish best practice; supporting the development and sharing of methods of co-production; sign-posting Cochrane Review authors to resources aimed at supporting best practice; maintaining and developing learning resources of learning resources; supporting learning and dissemination activities; and updating co-production guidance in Cochrane Handbooks. This session is an opportunity for stakeholders to come together to examine the current state of evidence, listen to one another, identify gaps, evidence, information and practice and to determine the Cochrane Community's priorities for future work to extend and improve the practice of co-production. Objectives: - Bring together stakeholders in co-production and build a community of people with an interest in improving methods - Engage in a lively multi-stakeholder dialogue to understand and consider various perspectives on co-production - Describe the current state of co-production in evidence production in Cochrane - Explore the evidence base for co-production of evidence synthesis - Identify future priorities for the Co-production Methods Group This interactive Special Session will bring together researchers, consumers and other stakeholders from the Cochrane Community and other Methods Groups, and partner organizations. The aims and objectives of the proposed Co-production Methods Group will be described and discussed. Participants will explore definitions of co-production and who the stakeholders are of systematic reviews and other forms of research. Researchers and consumers will share examples of methods research including the ACTIVE project, involvement in Living Systematic Reviews and rapid evidence production, and resources to support co-production. Presenters will describe current research, including the MuSE project. Participants will discuss organizational policy, and the nature and extent of co-production within Cochrane and the wider community, including the Cochrane Consumer Network, and consumer perspectives on current practice. Drawing on all of the preceding information and discussion, participants will identify and rank future priorities for the Co-production Methods Group. Target audience: People with an interest in the methodology of stakeholder engagement and involvement Format: Discussion [MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA: Interactive web applications to conduct meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473937/metadta-and-metabayesdta-interactive-web-applications-to-conduct-meta-analysis-of-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies) Background Diagnostic tests form an essential part of current medical practices aiming to distinguish between patients with the disease and healthy individuals. They are used across a diverse range of healthcare settings and are often a pre-requisite to identifying treatment options and enabling access to services. Recommended statistical methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies require the fitting of complex non-standard statistical models, which can be a barrier to their application. MetaDTA (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/dta_ma/) is a free interactive online application which, for meta-analyses DTA studies using the bivariate model, plots the summary receiver operating characteristic curve, encourages sensitivity analysis and incorporates quality assessment results from the QUADAS-2 tool. MetaBayesDTA (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/MetaBayesDTA/) is a version that extends the functionality to allow for imperfect gold standards, subgroup analysis, meta-regression and comparative test accuracy evaluation. Both apps produce visualisations which facilitate the communication of results to all stakeholders, including patients and healthcare professionals. Due to the rich feature-set and user-friendly \"point and click\" interface of these apps, this workshop should appeal to a wide audience, including non-statistical experts. Objectives To illustrate how MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA can be used to conduct DTA meta-analyses (using methods recommended in Version 2 of Cochrane Handbook) and for participants to get hands-on experience of using the apps in a structured and supportive environment. Description This workshop will provide an introduction to MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA and offer participants experience using these web-based applications. During this workshop, we will: i. Demonstrate how MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA can be used to conduct a Cochrane DTA meta-analysis using an example from a Cochrane reviews; ii. Demonstrate the wide array of interactive functions available within MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA; iii. Provide participants with a dataset and worksheet designed to guide them, at their own pace, through the stages of conducting an analysis in MetaDTA and MetaBayesDTA; and iv. Provide time for questions, discussion and feedback. Topics covered will include loading data, customising summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) plots, obtaining statistics, visualising study quality results and covariate effects, conducting sensitivity analyses and exporting tables and figures. All participants must bring a laptop or tablet or may share with another participant. [Integrating the findings of a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) with the findings of a review of intervention effects](/colloquium-2023/session/1473943/integrating-the-findings-of-a-qualitative-evidence-synthesis-qes-with-the-findings-of-a-review-of-intervention-effects) QMIG Methods Workshop Background: Methods for qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)\u2014a systematic review method for bringing together qualitative studies\u2014are now well established, and decision-makers are able to access rigorous QES on issues such as patient experiences and contextual factors influencing intervention implementation. QES often generates theories and explanations about why and how interventions work. By integrating these theories with evidence on intervention effects, review teams can offer vital information to support the implementation of review findings in practice. However, the diversity of approaches for integrating QES and effectiveness syntheses can make it challenging for reviewers to understand how best to integrate. The Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group (CQIMG) develops and publishes guidance on conducting QES and integrating QES findings with evidence on intervention effects. In this CQIMG methods workshop, participants will learn to distinguish between two key integration approaches. Comparison of syntheses involves systematically comparing the QES and effectiveness synthesis findings; for example, the findings from each synthesis may be juxtaposed in a matrix, to illustrate where they are concordant and discordant and where there are gaps. Connection of syntheses involves using the findings of one synthesis (QES or effectiveness) to inform the data extraction and synthesis of a second synthesis; for example, the QES findings may be used to structure a subgroup analysis of the effectiveness data. Participants will draw on real integration examples and critically examine the diversity of methods and tools. Objectives: By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to - recognise and appraise approaches and tools for integrations; - describe challenges, and potential opportunities, for integration; and - apply lessons learnt to their own review activity. Description: This interactive workshop presents options for integrating QES and intervention effects data (10 minutes) using Cochrane, Campbell and other reviews as examples. Group exercises, supported by experienced facilitators, illustrate different integration methods and tools (50 minutes). Groups are encouraged to think reflectively (10 minutes) on strengths and limitations of diverse approaches. The session concludes with an open forum to address issues relating to participants' review activity (10 minutes). Timings allow 10 minutes for flexibility. [Synthesizing and presenting results when meta-analysis is not possible](/colloquium-2023/session/1473958/synthesizing-and-presenting-results-when-meta-analysis-is-not-possible) Background: In reviews in which meta-analysis is not used, authors commonly report results study-by-study or draw conclusions without reporting how findings were interpreted across studies. These approaches may leave decision-makers to make sense of the findings themselves and undermine confidence in the evidence. There are many circumstances that may preclude the use of meta-analysis of effect estimates. For example, when there is incomplete information reported about the intervention effect estimates (e.g., missing standard errors) or inconsistency in the reported effect metrics across studies. Planning for circumstances that may preclude meta-analysis can ensure that reviewers make the best use of available data and produce more useful syntheses for decision-makers. This workshop will cover structured summary, synthesis methods, and visual display methods that can be used in these circumstances (sometimes referred to as \"narrative synthesis\"). Objectives: To illustrate the importance of planning for scenarios in which meta-analysis is not possible through application in a practical example. To demonstrate the application of structured summary, other synthesis, and visual display methods. Description: Based on guidance in Chapter 12 of version 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we will use a combination of presentations, interactive exercises, and group work to cover the following topics: Scenarios that may preclude meta-analysis Other synthesis and presentation methods, along with their advantages and disadvantages, and guidance on when to use which approach Exploring extracted data to determine what other synthesis methods might be used if meta-analysis is not possible Suggestions for what to write in the protocol, the methods section of the review, and how to describe the results of the synthesis Participants will work through examples that illustrate different approaches to structured summary and statistical synthesis of data. [Introduction to meta-analysis 2: dealing with heterogeneity](/colloquium-2023/session/1473944/introduction-to-meta-analysis-2-dealing-with-heterogeneity) Background: The studies in a meta-analysis may vary in their included populations, how the intervention of interest was used, how outcomes were assessed, and in study design and conduct. This variability in study properties may lead to variability in the outcomes across studies. This variability in outcomes in a meta-analysis is called heterogeneity. Determining whether heterogeneity across studies is present in a meta-analysis and identifying its possible causes are critical components of any meta-analysis. Objectives: To provide review authors with the knowledge to understand and investigate heterogeneity across studies in a meta-analysis and to recognise the limitations of the methods available. This workshop is part of a series of workshops delivered by the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group. Description: We will address approaches to dealing with heterogeneity across studies in a meta-analysis. We first discuss potential sources of across-study variability and provide an overview of methods for identifying whether heterogeneity is present in a meta-analysis. We then focus on issues related to dealing with heterogeneity once it has been identified. In particular, we discuss whether or not to combine results; how heterogeneity is handled in the choice between fixed-effect and random-effects analyses; and the use of subgroup analyses (with a brief mention of meta-regression). Discussion will be supplemented with practical examples from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. [Complying with Cochrane's Conflict of Interest policy](/colloquium-2023/session/1473970/complying-with-cochrane's-conflict-of-interest-policy) Background: All Cochrane Library content must comply with Cochrane's conflict of interest (CoI) policy, which applies to all individuals involved in creating Cochrane Library content. The Research Integrity team and Cochrane's policy team are proposing this workshop to support authors, editors, and others interested in understanding the application of Cochrane's CoI policy and its related editorial policy on authorship. Authors bear primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with both the CoI and authorship policies prior to submission of a completed article, and Cochrane managing editors check for policy adherence when receiving a completed submission. At this stage, it can be difficult to correct breaches of the CoI policy without creating new breaches of Cochrane's authorship policy, such as ghost authorship (see \"Conflict of interest and authorship\" at https://community.cochrane.org/news/conflicts-interests-and-authorship-lessons-revised-policy). Noncompliance discovered at submission or later may result in an article's rejection, representing a major loss of effort for the author team and the loss of a timely article for the Cochrane Library. Objectives: Engage participants in - analyzing case studies of author CoIs to determine whether they comply with the CoI policy; - discussion about interpreting and applying the CoI policy; and - Q&A about the cases and related CoI/authorship scenarios. Description: Introduction (ca 15 minutes): Facilitators will introduce the framework of Cochrane's CoI policy (2020), its connection to Cochrane's editorial policy on authorship, and the most salient points for authors and editors. Case studies (three rounds, ca 20/25 minutes each): Participants will consult handouts showing the CoIs of a fictional author team, the topic of the fictional protocol or review, the text of Cochrane's CoI and authorship policies, and CoI support documents. In small group discussions, participants will decide a) whether the authors comply with the CoI and authorship policies and b) whether and how compliance could be achieved, if there is a breach. Organizers will then seek participants' decisions through an interactive on-screen survey and lead a whole-group discussion/Q&A for each case study. Conclusions (ca 5 minutes): Organizers will summarize support resources. [Systematic reviews of prognosis studies I: Introduction, design and protocol of systematic reviews of prognosis studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473918/systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies-i-introduction-design-and-protocol-of-systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies) Background: Prognosis studies are abundant in medical literature. Hence, systematic reviews of these studies are increasingly required and conducted to identify and critically appraise the existing evidence. A Cochrane handbook for prognosis reviews is currently being prepared describing guidance for conducting a systematic review of prognosis studies. The CHARMS tool is developed to provide guidance for design and conduct of the first steps of systematic reviews of prognosis studies. CHARMS can assist reviewers of prognosis studies in defining the review objectives and design of the review and creating the data extraction list to enhance critical appraisal of the primary studies. Objectives: This workshop will introduce participants to the Cochrane Handbook for Reviews of Prognosis Studies, the types of prognosis research, and explain the differences between prognosis and intervention studies. We will provide guidance on how to define a proper review question and how to design a protocol and data extraction form to enhance subsequent critical appraisal. Description: The workshop will start with an introduction to the different types of prognosis studies and to systematic reviews of prognosis studies. We subsequently discuss the key items important for framing a review question, the essentials of a protocol, and data extraction using the CHARMS checklist. The workshop will consist of interactive lectures and small group exercises. [Performing and disseminating review findings through art and design](/colloquium-2023/session/1473939/performing-and-disseminating-review-findings-through-art-and-design) Background: Interest in using multimodal, arts-based methods in the context of health-related research has been increasing recently. Its value lies not only in its ability to unearth complex, rich and nuanced data but also in how the process/processes can simultaneously facilitate the accessibility of evidence (MacGregor et al. 2022; West et al. 2022; Archibald & Blines 2021; Ball et al. 2021; Boydel 2019; Fraser & Al Sayah 2011). From a new materialist perspective, knowledge is not merely an independent, tightly bound entity to be used or consumed but is rather a dynamic construct that can adapt and change as it is applied and used in everyday contexts. Objectives: The objectives of this workshop include engaging in collaborative arts-based techniques to make sense of a specific case of systematically reviewed evidence, i.e., Factors that influence parents' and informal caregivers' views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination: A qualitative evidence synthesis (Cooper et al. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2021, Issue 10. CD013265. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD013265.pub2), and to demonstrate how this process can facilitate the production of embodied knowledge through active engagement with the evidence in tangible, material ways. Description: (1) Workshop participants will be introduced to the workshop and divided into subgroups (5 minutes); (2) each group will engage in a performative exercise based on an aspect of the reviewed evidence (20 minutes); (3) each individual will respond to their performative experience through a mark-making exercise using charcoal and/or ink on paper (20 minutes); (4) each group will be prompted through a process of cutting up their group's drawings and reassembling parts of it through collage to re-represent the evidence in graphic form on A3 paper (25 minutes); and (5) each group will present their graphic translation of evidence to the larger group (20 minutes). What will result could be regarded as an example of how multimodal arts-based engagement with systematically reviewed content in the context of healthcare can make the evidence more accessible\u2014and hence also applicable\u2014to those engaging with it, as well as how creative representation of evidence can possibly enrich the communicative potential of empirical data. [Practical advice for accessing patient-level data from a data sharing platform for evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473934/practical-advice-for-accessing-patient-level-data-from-a-data-sharing-platform-for-evidence-synthesis) Background: Since 2014, opportunities to request and access the patient level datasets collected in a clinical trial have become more commonplace. Vivli is an independent, non-profit organisation that has developed a global data-sharing and analytics platform. Patient-level data is available from 7,000 clinical trials that are provided by academic funders, pharmaceutical companies, and charitable funders. Objectives: This workshop will provide an: Introduction to the Vivli platform, including an overview of data available and hands-on group work on how to submit a request for data Overview of first-hand experience of using patient level data using the data sharing platform, Vivli, as a case study Discussion of some of the opportunities and challenges (e.g., when data needed to answer the hypothesis is not available via a single data sharing platform) associated with using patient level data Description: This session will be a mixture of hands-on practice of exploring the clinical trial data on the Vivli platform, the submission process, and what the resultant data and document package looks like. Alongside this, there will be a chance to hear from researchers who have used the platform and the perspectives of patient advocates and data providers, as well as an opportunity to ask questions about the data access process. Session Plan : Welcome and Introduction to IPD Meta-analysis and Data Sharing Platforms (10 minutes). Case study: Perspectives from a data requester, patient advocate, and data provider on the process for sharing data (20 minutes). Hands-on demonstration and activity: Using Vivli to submit a data request (10 minutes). How to formulate a data sharing request (20 minutes). --Account Creation --Overview of standard information in a data request form --Governance process. Criteria used by the Independent Review Panel (IRP) to review a request Group work: Practice filling out a data request using a Cochrane Protocol (15 minutes). Report Back: What was easy about this process? What was unclear? Discussion and Questions (15 minutes) Proposers: Catrin Tudur Smith (University of Liverpool), Rebecca Sudlow (Roche), Julie Wood (Vivli), and Alan Chant (Patient Advocate and Independent Review Panel member) [Demystifying R Part 2: An introduction to coding in R and RStudio](/colloquium-2023/session/1473950/demystifying-r-part-2-an-introduction-to-coding-in-r-and-rstudio) Background: Tools like R and Python are becoming increasingly useful in the conduct of systematic reviews and evidence synthesis. In R specifically, many tools have been developed to facilitate the systematic review process. Some of these tools provide vignettes and examples to help novice coders make use of the tools in a coding environment like RStudio, and others have graphical user interfaces that make them accessible to users without coding experience. Objectives: Building on Demystifying R Part 1 (workshop proposal submitted separately by Elke Hausner), this workshop will introduce learners to the basics of the R coding language and the RStudio coding environment, in the context of litsearchr, an R package that supports term harvesting, Boolean search construction, and search strategy testing, among other steps. Description: We will draw from recently developed Library Carpentry curriculum (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/) to provide a live coding, fully hands-on session. The workshop will cover the basics of RStudio, creating objects and variables, working with packages and libraries, and best practices for code documentation. This workshop is geared towards participants with no coding experience. Taking Part 1 of this series is optional but recommended. Participants will learn basic concepts of working with files, folders, and objects in R and RStudio, will understand different data structures, and will be introduced to litsearchr as a tool that can be incorporated into their systematic review workflows. Using open-source tools like R for evidence synthesis allows for more reproducible methods, expediting the evidence synthesis process, and improving transparency. Thus, this workshop will contribute to improved patient care through the facilitation of more efficient and transparent evidence synthesis products.

[Ensuring integrity in biomedical research](/colloquium-2023/session/1452906/ensuring-integrity-in-biomedical-research) We all need data we can trust. Cochrane policy requires that studies with serious research integrity problems, including fraudulent data, be excluded from Cochrane Reviews. This plenary will explore the scope and root causes of the problem of fraudulent and problematic research. Solutions to identifying and preventing the publication of research with serious research integrity problems will be discussed. The international panel of speakers will offer perspectives from a variety of disciplines on paper mills, tools to identify fraudulent studies, and what systematic reviewers and journals can do to improve research integrity. There will be ample time for audience participation in the discussion of proposed solutions.

Presenters: Health: Cochrane's Future Direction](/colloquium-2023/session/1561961/an-agile-scientific-strategy-for-global-health-cochrane's-future-direction) Cochrane, globally recognized as a trusted health evidence producer, is paving the way for the future by embracing transformative changes aimed at enhancing its global health impact. This Special Session at the Cochrane Colloquium will shed light on these transformative changes and demonstrate how they establish a pathway towards a pioneering scientific strategy. Underlining the need for adaptability, Cochrane is recalibrating its processes and methods to enhance experiences for both authors and users of Cochrane evidence. These transformational shifts, although substantial, are integral to maintaining the organization's relevance and influence in the dynamic global health landscape. At the core of these transformations is a strategic emphasis on 20 thematic areas that align with the health-related objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Collaborating with a range of stakeholders, Cochrane aspires to generate trusted evidence syntheses and champion their worldwide application, aiming for improved health outcomes globally and promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion. This session will outline the critical steps towards developing this scientific strategy, including a detailed overview of the transformational changes in progress. It will also offer an opportunity to delve into the focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and initiate a broader consultation process to select key themes. The session represents an invitation to engage with Cochrane's ambitious vision for global health and its commitment to fostering a culture of evidence-informed health and care worldwide. Target audience: Everyone [Maximizing the potential of data associated with Cochrane reviews: Opportunities and future directions for the new review data package](/colloquium-2023/session/1473975/maximizing-the-potential-of-data-associated-with-cochrane-reviews-opportunities-and-future-directions-for-the-new-review-data-package) Background: Sharing the data associated with Cochrane reviews beyond the analyses data opens up an array of benefits and opportunities, including: facilitating sharing and use of data; increasing opportunities for re-use and further analysis; increased potential to impact policy; increasing research visibility, discovery, impact and recognition; facilitating research validity through replication and verification; decreasing the risk of research fraud through transparency; facilitating collaborative research and reducing redundancy and research waste across siloed groups; use of real research in educational materials; enabling public understanding; and promotion of citizen science. Cochrane recently introduced a new data package available to download on published Cochrane reviews, which include included studies data, included study arms data and results data, risk of bias assessments and the support for judgements, analyses data and the review's references. This data package is organized in different data formats to facilitate re-use, including via RevMan or other tools such as Microsoft Excel and various statistical packages. These same data formats also underpin the route that enables authors to transfer data between Covidence and RevMan. Objectives: To gather feedback and ideas from the participants to determine new ways the data files could be used, as well as potential changes to the formats that will improve their overall usefulness or unlock new opportunities for use or re-use of review data. Description: We will review the different datasets contained within the data package and have a semi-structured discussion on each dataset, as well as brainstorm and prioritize additional datasets that could be included in future. [Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies: Introduction to meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473915/systematic-reviews-of-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies-introduction-to-meta-analysis) Background: For making informed decisions about medical tests, healthcare organisations and policymakers typically rely on information from studies that assess diagnostic accuracy, i.e., how well a test gets the diagnosis right in people who have and those who do not have the target condition. Therefore, it is essential that valid methods are used to produce high-quality evidence reviews that will be used to inform recommendations for patient care. This core workshop organised by the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group is designed for those who have a keen interest in gaining insight into test accuracy meta-analysis and how to use Review Manager (RevMan) to produce graphical summaries. Objectives: To introduce the concepts underlying test accuracy meta-analysis and recommended statistical methods and to demonstrate graphical capabilities within RevMan. Description: Using published examples, participants will learn of key challenges, best practice for conducting test accuracy meta-analysis and how to present results. Specifically, the workshop is based on the guidelines formulated in the new Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy. The workshop will be delivered through an interactive presentation, discussions and practical demonstrations using RevMan Web. Participants are expected to bring a laptop. Those who do not have a laptop will still benefit from the onscreen demo and discussions. Prior to the workshop, participants will be sent the RevMan file that will be used during the workshop. [Issues in Using, Interpreting, and Presenting Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cochrane Reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473980/issues-in-using-interpreting-and-presenting-patient-reported-outcomes-in-cochrane-reviews) Background: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials that include patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) provide crucial information for patients and clinicians facing challenging healthcare decisions. Based on emerging methods, guidance on combining PROMs in meta-analyses and interpreting results will likely enhance their usefulness for decision-makers. Objectives: In the context of GRADE summary of findings tables in Cochrane reviews, participants will be able to 1. identify the issues in retrieving, analyzing, and interpreting PRO results in clinical trials; 2. discuss preferred alternatives with an emphasis on the minimal important difference (MID) for aggregating across different PRO instruments measuring the same construct; 3. describe how to retrieve MIDs and introduce the concept of judging the credibility of MID estimates; and 4. present PRO results in GRADE summary of findings tables. Description: This workshop will use interactive lectures with questions to participants and small group discussions to address the challenges in including and interpreting PROs in Cochrane Reviews. Participants and facilitators will explore methods in analyzing and making PROs readily understandable to users and consumers of Cochrane reviews. These challenges involve making decisions on interpreting the magnitude of an effect (e.g., whether differences are trivial, small but important, or large). We will introduce approaches to pooling across different instruments measuring the same construct with emphasis on the concept of the MID (the smallest difference that would motivate a patient to use an intervention), allowing the dichotomization of continuous outcomes (e.g., the proportion of patients who achieve a MID). We will present methods for identifying and evaluating the credibility of MID estimates. During the workshop, issues will arise for discussion in breakout groups. At the end of these breakout sessions, each group will report back with the group's conclusions. This workshop is also recommended for participants attending a second workshop that will focus on evaluating MID credibility and the application of presentation approaches that rely on the MID in systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines. [Cochrane-Wikipedia Initiative: Hands-on workshop to help improve health content that people are accessing online](/colloquium-2023/session/1473986/cochrane-wikipedia-initiative-hands-on-workshop-to-help-improve-health-content-that-people-are-accessing-online) Background: Improving the quality and reliability of online health articles that are accessed regularly across the internet is a significant challenge. Millions of people access medical articles on Wikipedia each day across 286 different languages. On English language Wikipedia alone, 40,000 human health and medicine articles are viewed billions of times a year, often surpassing the viewership of more reliable sources such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for topics including information about COVID-19. Cochrane partnered with Wikipedia in 2014 with the joint goal of improving the reliability of health information accessed on Wikipedia. As of 2023, 3,400 Cochrane Systematic Reviews published in the past 10 years help inform evidence in medical articles shared on English Wikipedia. There are additional ongoing initiatives in other languages including Spanish, Dutch, French, Malay, and German Wikipedias. Many Cochrane community members and volunteers participate in this initiative, collaborating with the Wikipedia editing community and using high-quality and trusted evidence to correct errors of omission, expand medical articles, and remove unreliable or outdated content shared on Wikipedia. Objectives: The first objective of this workshop is to encourage more people with a background in interpreting and sharing evidence to consider Wikipedia in their knowledge translation and dissemination projects. The second objective is to enable these individuals with the skills that they need to move forward together and improve this commonly accessed resource using trusted evidence. Description: This workshop is a hands-on session that will introduce the project and provide an opportunity for participants to edit Wikipedia with in-person support from Cochrane's Wikipedian in Residence. Participants will have the following learning objectives: 1) describe how health-related evidence is shared on Wikipedia; 2) understand how to create a personal Wikipedia editing account; and 3) be able to add evidence from at least one trusted source to a health-related Wikipedia article. [Systematic reviews of prognosis studies II: Risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews of prognosis studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473919/systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies-ii-risk-of-bias-assessment-in-systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies) Background: Prognosis is a description of the probable course of individuals with a health condition. Review and synthesis of overall prognosis, prognostic factor and prediction model studies is a relatively new and evolving area. Critical appraisal of prognosis studies is challenging but essential to assess and identify biases sufficiently large to distort study results. The Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) and Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) tools are useful and reliable to assess risk of bias in studies of prognostic factors and prediction models, and the RoB-OPS tool is being developed for assessment of overall prognosis studies. The QUIPS tool can be used to assess risk of bias in studies of prognostic factors. It contains six important areas to evaluate the validity of prognostic factor studies and includes prompting items related to these six areas with suggestions for operationalization and grading. PROBAST is the tool for assessing the quality and risk of bias of prediction model studies. It consists of four domains and 20 signaling questions. Objectives: This workshop will familiarize participants with sources of bias in overall prognosis, prognostic factor and prognostic model studies and introduce participants to the QUIPS, PROBAST and RoB-OPS tools. Description: This interactive workshop will inform and train participants on systematic reviews of overall prognosis, prognostic factors and prognostic models. The workshop will be split into two sessions. The first session will give an overview of the different critical appraisal tools and guidance on how to use them. In the second part of the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to practice with these tools and interpret the results. [Searching for studies for inclusion in Cochrane Reviews: a core Cochrane methods introductory workshop for Cochrane Review authors and others](/colloquium-2023/session/1473952/searching-for-studies-for-inclusion-in-cochrane-reviews-a-core-cochrane-methods-introductory-workshop-for-cochrane-review-authors-and-others) Background: Searching for studies forms the basis of any systematic review, and the effectiveness of the searching in identifying the relevant studies for inclusion in the review has an impact on the reliability of the results of the review. Objectives: To provide Cochrane Review authors with guidance on searching for studies for inclusion in a Cochrane Review. Participants will gain an understanding of some of the issues and challenges involved, as well as practical advice on successfully conducting searches and working with librarians and information specialists to undertake searches. Description: Questions to be considered will include the following: where to search for studies, how to search efficiently and what to do with the search results. This session is primarily aimed at Cochrane Review authors and will focus on Cochrane policy on searching for studies as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Searching for studies) and the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards (methods.cochrane.org/mecir). The workshop will highlight each overall area addressed in the above chapter in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, including: - developing a search strategy using patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes (PICO); - sensitivity versus precision; - Boolean operators and controlled vocabulary; - going beyond MEDLINE/PubMed (identification and comparison of resources); - organizing and managing the search results and documenting and reporting the search process. The facilitator is the founding Co-Convenor of the Cochrane Information Retrieval Methods Group (IRMG) and lead author of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions chapter on searching for studies, and they also co-led the searching for studies element of the MECIR initiative. The session will include presentations, demonstrations, group discussion and hands-on exercises. An interactive approach will be adopted, and questions and comments will be encouraged throughout. Participants should bring their own laptops and be prepared to share with those who are unable to do so. [Conducting a Cochrane Methods Peer Review - Good Practice and Common Challenges](/colloquium-2023/session/1473982/conducting-a-cochrane-methods-peer-review---good-practice-and-common-challenges) Background: Cochrane is moving towards a central editorial service that clearly separates author and editorial roles in the evidence synthesis production model. As part of this process, the Cochrane Central Editorial Service sends every Cochrane review for consumer, clinical, search and methods peer review prior to publication. This robust process ensures that evidence published is accurate, reliable and useable. To ensure that this process remains efficient and useful for authors and results in high-quality systematic reviews, the peer reviewer reports should be of the highest standard, clear, consistent, and appropriately worded. Objectives: The objectives of this workshop are to highlight good practice in the creation of Cochrane Methods Peer Review reports; to provide practical, hands-on guidance to help editors identify and address common challenges during the peer review process; and to discuss the current opportunities available for getting involved in conducting editorial peer review. Description: The workshop will begin with a brief PowerPoint presentation, introducing the methods peer review process conducted by the Central Editorial Service, highlighting the key features of a good practice peer review report, and providing an overview of the most common challenges currently facing editors during the peer review process. The issues discussed will include (i) how to differentiate between when authors have made an objective error that requires 'correction' and a subjective decision that requires clearer 'justification', (ii) appropriate and consistent wording of the comments, and (iii) how to deliver consistent and appropriate recommendations on whether each article should be rejected, accepted or revised. Following this, the attendees will work in small groups with the facilitators to identify challenges in some real-life examples and discuss the best way to rectify and ultimately avoid the issues. The workshop will conclude with an open discussion regarding the current opportunities available to authors and editors who are interested in getting more involved in the editorial peer review process. [A hands-on introduction to NMAstudio: a web-application to produce and visualize network meta-analyses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473946/a-hands-on-introduction-to-nmastudio-a-web-application-to-produce-and-visualize-network-meta-analyses) Background: Evaluation of network meta-analysis (NMA) evidence can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large networks of interventions. Despite the fact that NMAs are increasingly adopted to inform decision-making, the lack of user-friendly software is still limiting their usage to a restricted community of users. Objectives: To present NMAstudio, a novel fully interactive web application that simplifies the NMA appraisal, while facilitating prompt production, interpretation and sharing of key NMA outputs. Description: This workshop offers the opportunity for the first hands-on practice with NMAstudio. A dataset will be provided to the participants and will be used to demonstrate the available features of our tool. The participants will upload the data and interact directly with an NMA network diagram. By clicking one or more nodes-treatments or edges-comparisons, we will show how NMAstudio can assist the users in each of the fundamental steps of NMA. In particular, we will show how to produce customized outputs such as boxplots of effect modifiers to check transitivity; pairwise, NMA and bi-dimensional forest plots; league tables coloured by risk of bias or confidence ratings from the CINeMA framework; incoherence tests; ranking plots and more. Importantly, we will also illustrate how to generate an access token that can be used to save the project and share it publicly. Overall, this workshop is intended to demonstrate how NMAstudio can help investigators interested in conducting a network meta-analysis, by enhancing the NMA findings while assisting with the interpretation of results and evaluation of the modelling assumptions. Note: Participants should preferably bring their own laptop to the session and/or can share with other participants. [Conducting Rapid Qualitative Evidence Synthesis: Why, when and how?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473935/conducting-rapid-qualitative-evidence-synthesis-why-when-and-how) QMIG Methods workshop: Background: As we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes questions need to be answered quickly in order to be useful for policy and practice. This applies equally to questions answerable by qualitative evidence synthesis. However, providing evidence quickly may carry implications for how systematic and rigorous the synthesis is and/or confidence in the review findings. Objectives: We aim to help attendees at this workshop to: Consider why and when a rapid approach to qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) could be useful; Replicate important decisions to minimise the impact of speed on review quality; and Consider the differences between a rapid review, QES and a rapid QES. Description: The presenters, co-convenors of the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group, will draw on working examples of a rapid QES published in Cochrane to illustrate key decisions that are needed when conducting rapid QES. We will use problem-solving activities with feedback to help attendees prepare for conducting a rapid QES.

This session will continue discussions from the earlier keynote session on research integrity, which will offer perspectives on paper mills, tools to identify fraudulent studies, and how systematic reviewers and journals can improve research and publication integrity. This Special Session aims to elicit further views and discussion from the audience on these and other challenges, to inform efforts to find and implement workable solutions. The session will conclude by describing how attendees can join efforts to improve the reliability of published biomedical and clinical research. Target audience: The Special Session will be open to all delegates. Attendees will not need to have joined the keynote session on research integrity to attend this session. Format: The session will commence with brief opening comments (5-10 minutes) to introduce the topic to attendees who did not attend the earlier keynote session. We then wish to maximize audience participation and discussions whilst retaining some structure so that we can capture audience opinions and ideas (60 minutes). The session will conclude with a brief summary of the major points raised and describe how attendees can help to improve the reliability of published biomedical and clinical research (10 minutes).

Although the general formula for VE calculation is straight forward on the first glance [VE=(1-VE_ratio)*100], one has to take into account that several different VE-ratio measures are used in individual studies, which are potentially included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These include, for example, risk ratios, odds ratios, hazard ratios, or incidence rate ratios. This cannot only lead to questions in VE calculation but also in issues regarding interpretation of a pooled estimate of different VE ratios. Moreover, visualization of VE estimates in forest plots is not yet possible in RevMan Web resulting in the need for alternative approaches, e.g., using the software R. Objectives: To explain, discuss, and interpret VE calculation, VE meta-analysis, and VE visualization in forest plots based on an exemplary systematic review on COVID-19 vaccination in children. Description: In this workshop, we would like to address all participants interested in deeper insights in VE methodology and meta-analyses of VE outcomes (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation). Previous knowledge on VE and statistics is advantageous, but not required. We will start with a short introduction on VE calculation. In group exercises, participants will calculate, interpret, present, and discuss VE for different outcomes and study designs. We will illustrate the clinical relevance by comparing VE with a calculated corresponding absolute effect for selected outcomes. Further, we will present different ways of VE visualization based on forest plots from different published examples, which we will discuss interactively with the workshop participants. We will demonstrate how to calculate and produce a VE forest plot in R, including subgroup and sensitivity analyses using simple, user-friendly R code from package 'meta', which has been implemented recently. The code will be made available to all participants after the workshop. After completing the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of VE calculation, visualization, and interpretation, which will be useful for an enhanced understanding and for conducting systematic reviews on vaccination effects. [Identifying who benefits most from treatments: How to analyse, present and interpret interactions and subgroup effects in meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473977/identifying-who-benefits-most-from-treatments-how-to-analyse-present-and-interpret-interactions-and-subgroup-effects-in-meta-analysis) Background: Researchers often wish to identify which individuals benefit more (or less) from interventions; this idea underpins the concept of stratified medicine. As single studies are typically underpowered for exploring whether participant characteristics determine an individual's response to treatment, meta-analysis can provide a solution. Whilst individual participant data provide the most power and analytical flexibility to investigate interactions between such characteristics and the intervention effect, aggregate data (AD) can also often be used. However, approaches to the analysis, presentation and interpretation of interactions vary widely. Objectives: In this workshop we aim to demystify interactions in meta-analysis and show how they can be explored using AD. Participants will (i) understand the purpose of subgroup and interaction analysis in trials and meta-analysis, as well as its strengths and limitations; (ii) explore the concept of aggregation bias and its consequences for interaction testing; (iii) extract and calculate a simple \"within-trial\" interaction effect using AD; (iv) understand how to use AD trial data to calculate subgroup effects compatible with \"within-trial\" interaction effects; and (v) explore how to present these interactions and subgroup effects clearly using novel implementations of forest plots. Material and examples are taken from Fisher et al., BMJ 2017 doi:10.1136/bmj.j573, and Godolphin et al., Research Synthesis Methods 2023 doi:10.1002/jrsm.1590. Description: The 90-minute workshop will consist of short slide presentations, group discussion and practical activity. We will begin by considering subgroups and interactions within a single randomised trial. Using real examples, participants will discuss interpretation of results and what can and cannot be concluded from the given data. Participants will learn how interactions from multiple trials may be pooled using meta-analysis. We demonstrate how this can be done with AD, using examples from the literature. Working in small groups, participants will perform a simple AD interaction analysis and discuss results and interpretation. For clinical decision-making, subgroup effects are key; therefore, we will also show how to use the entirety of available trial data to estimate subgroup effects consistent with the 'within-trial' interaction. Finally, participants will explore how to present interactions and subgroup effects on forest plots and learn how to perform these analyses using Stata. [Considering scope in the planning and completion of systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473964/considering-scope-in-the-planning-and-completion-of-systematic-reviews) Background: A burgeoning issue in evidence-based medicine is the scope and scale of how research questions are formulated. The scope of the review question and formulation of objectives have major implications on several stages of the systematic review process. This workshop will inform authors on how to consider scope when planning and conducting a systematic review. Objectives: (1) To evaluate how the scope of a research question and objectives need to be accounted for in the inclusion criteria of a systematic review. (2) To formulate analysis plans that target the objectives within a review and how analyses can be tailored based on the scope of a review question. (3) To consider how scope can impact the structure of a review in terms of writing up the results and summary versions of a manuscript. Description: This workshop will begin with a 5-minute introduction to the topic of scope and various examples of scope impacting review development. There will then be an activity during which participants will work in groups to plan a review on a generic topic. Ideally, if there were 50 participants, there would be 10 groups of 5, with half the groups working on a review topic in which the scope is too large and the other half working on a review topic in which the scope is appropriate. The activity will be divided into three 20-minute sections: 1. The first section will be on assessing an existing patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes (PICO) inclusion criterion for the review question and objectives. Participants will be asked whether they think the inclusion criteria is appropriate and what they would change. 2. The second section will deal with analysis plans. Participants will be asked what comparisons they would consider for the review, types of analyses, and whether all outcomes included in the review need to be analysed across all comparisons. 3. The final section will require participants to evaluate the results section and summary versions of the review. The final 25 minutes will be devoted to feedback from the activity and lessons learned from existing reviews in which scope has implicated review development. [Finding, critically appraising, and using a core outcome set (COS) to inform your systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473965/finding-critically-appraising-and-using-a-core-outcome-set-cos-to-inform-your-systematic-review) Background: A core outcome set (COS) is an agreed standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in a specific health condition. This would allow research to be compared and combined, ensuring all studies contribute usable information for the core outcomes. The involvement of relevant stakeholders, especially patients and health professionals, in COS development helps ensure the outcomes important to those groups are included. Many organisations, including Cochrane, now actively endorse COS use in systematic reviews to help ensure outcomes important to patients and other key stakeholders are considered. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions acknowledges the relevance of COS to defining review questions and planning the review, helping ensure the inclusion of patient-centred outcomes. By maintaining the free, searchable Core Outcome Measures for Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database, the COMET Initiative can help systematic reviewers to identify and use COS. Among a sample of Cochrane reviews from 2019, 7% referred to a COS when choosing outcomes, yet 35% of the remaining reviews could have considered a relevant existing COS. Most Cochrane Review Group editors (86%) thought that COS should definitely or possibly be used to inform the selection of review outcomes. Objectives: i. Describe the rationale for using COS in systematic reviews and demonstrate how the COMET database helps facilitate this. ii. Identify issues to consider when deciding whether a COS is applicable to a specific systematic review and whether a COS has been developed using reasonable methods. Description: This interactive workshop will be co-facilitated by Paula Williamson (Chair, COMET Management Group), Ian Saldanha (Department of Epidemiology, John Hopkins), Maureen Smith (Chair, Cochrane Consumer Executive), and Heather Barrington (COMET Patient and Public Involvement Coordinator). Workshop participants will discuss how they choose outcomes for their review. Searching the COMET database will be demonstrated. Participants will explore COS examples, assess their relevance to particular systematic review topics, and discuss how they might assess COS relevance to their own work. The COS minimum standards will be presented, and participants will be invited to assess the example COS against these standards. [Assessing risk of bias in comparative diagnostic accuracy studies using QUADAS-C](/colloquium-2023/session/1473932/assessing-risk-of-bias-in-comparative-diagnostic-accuracy-studies-using-quadas-c) Background: Diagnostic Test Accuracy reviews addressing comparative questions may include studies directly comparing index tests in the same study group. Because these comparative accuracy studies aim to estimate the difference in accuracy between tests (rather than solely the accuracy of each test), we need to consider additional sources of bias specific to test comparisons. The QUADAS-C tool, an extension to QUADAS-2, considers these additional sources of bias and is endorsed by Cochrane for assessing risk of bias in comparative accuracy studies. Objectives: To learn how to assess risk of bias in comparative accuracy studies using QUADAS-C. Description: First, we will briefly discuss possible study designs for comparing the accuracy of two tests (10 min). We will then brainstorm, in small groups, which shortcomings could be present across the domains Patient Selection, Index Test, Reference Standard and Flow and Timing (20 min). Subsequently, the structure of and items in QUADAS-C will be presented (10 min). Lastly, we will evaluate a comparative accuracy study in small groups using QUADAS-C (30 min), followed by a plenary discussion of any discrepancies between assessors (20 min). Importance to patients: Although this concerns a methodological topic and does not contribute directly to patient health, using biased research may lead to misleading recommendations about diagnostic tests. [Learning by doing: Introducing Cochrane Classmate](/colloquium-2023/session/1473981/learning-by-doing-introducing-cochrane-classmate) Background: Built on the premise that people often learn best by doing, Classmate was built to enable teachers of evidence synthesis to use the tasks available on Cochrane Crowd in their teaching environments. Classmate now offers trainers and teachers a range of tasks and learning activities that relate to producing and understanding high quality health evidence. The process is simple: a teacher logs into Classmate and selects the task or tasks they want their students to do. They set the timeframe in which the task is to be done and then invite their students to the task. They can put their students into groups or teams, and they can monitor their students' progress in the task. Classmate enables teachers to enhance or supplement their teaching; it provides students with the opportunity to contribute to real and needed tasks; and it helps Cochrane keep up to date with the ever-increasing amounts of primary research being produced. Objectives: Workshop participants will be introduced to the latest version of Classmate. This will include understanding what the platform does and how it works, as well as an introduction to the microtasking and microlearning concepts that are fundamental to both Classmate and Cochrane Crowd. Participants will also have the opportunity to set up and take part in a Classmate learning activity (and win some prizes!). Description: The workshop will begin with a series of short presentations introducing both Cochrane Crowd and Classmate. These presentations will cover what each platform does and the range of possible tasks available from study design identification tasks to PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) extraction tasks. For the remaining time, the workshop will be highly interactive. In teams, participants will be put into teams and join a live task, which we will set up together in the workshop using Classmate (crowd.cochrane.org/classmate). The workshop is open to all but likely to be especially appealing to consumers, trainers, teachers, and students. [Systematic reviews of prognosis studies III: Meta-analytical approaches in systematic reviews of prognosis studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473920/systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies-iii-meta-analytical-approaches-in-systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies) Background: Prediction models are commonly developed and validated for predicting the presence (diagnostic) or future occurrence (prognostic) of a particular outcome. Prediction models have become abundant in the literature. Many models have been validated in numerous different studies. Also, numerous studies investigate the (added) value of a prognostic factor/predictor/biomarker to existing predictors. In both situations, aggregating such data is important for making inferences on the predictive performance of a specific model or predictor/marker. Meta-analytical approaches for both situations have recently been developed. Objectives: This workshop introduces participants to statistical methods for meta-analysis in systematic reviews of prognosis studies. We will mainly focus on meta-analysis of the performance of a prognostic model. We discuss opportunities/challenges of the statistical methods and of common software packages. Description: In this workshop, we illustrate these statistical approaches and how to combine, quantitatively, results from published studies on the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model. We illustrate this with various empirical examples. In the second part, participants will work in small groups to interpret the findings of a published meta-analysis. [Applying the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in a meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473985/applying-the-instrument-to-assess-the-credibility-of-effect-modification-analyses-iceman-in-a-meta-analysis) BACKGROUND: Subgroup analyses are relatively easy to perform but can be difficult to interpret. Credibility is often low, whereas the risk of over-interpretation is high. ICEMAN is a structured approach generated through expert consensus and provides eight items for judging the credibility of subgroup effects identified in a meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: Learn how to apply ICEMAN to an apparent subgroup effect and, if credible, how to design a corresponding GRADE summary of findings table. DESCRIPTION: Participants will apply ICEMAN to examples from the literature. We will discuss, for each item, conceptual and practical challenges. The workshop does not include statistical exercises; the focus is on the interpretation and reporting of subgroup effects. Participants should bring their laptop, if available, and are welcome to discuss their own examples. Key references: (1) Schandelmaier et al.

Such analyses have become very popular due to their relevance for clinical decision-making. MetaInsight is a freely available user-friendly web-app with a \"point and click\" interface, including novel graphical displays to aid understanding and facilitate effective communication of the (often complex) results of an NMA to a range of stakeholders, including patients and decision-makers. It is actively used worldwide, with approximately 600 user hours per month, and is continuously being developed according to user needs. Objectives i. To provide an interactive demonstration of the functionality of MetaInsight v4 including user-interactive features and novel graphical visualisations; ii. To provide a user's experience of using MetaInsight for conducting network meta-analyses for National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and Cochrane reviews; iii. For participants to gain hands-on experience of MetaInsight by completing a worksheet which will guide them through the analysis of an NMA dataset using the app. Description This workshop will provide an introduction to MetaInsight for conducting NMA, including the perspectives of a current user of the app, and demonstrate the wide array of functions available within the app as well as 'tips & tricks' for running an analysis. Participants will be provided with 'hands-on' experience of using the app. They will be given an example dataset and worksheet designed to guide them, at their own pace, through the stages of conducting an analysis in MetaInsight. Topics covered will include the following: loading data; obtaining statistics using both Frequentist and Bayesian analyses; visualising the NMA results, including ranking statistics, using novel visual graphical displays; conducting sensitivity analyses; and a new feature for exporting a report of the analysis including all data inputs, results tables and figures, facilitating analysis transparency. There will be plenty of time provided for questions, discussion and feedback. Finally, there will be a brief discussion of the current limitations of the app and future planned developments. Participants will be required to bring a laptop or tablet or may share with another participant. [How to do a rapid review - updated methods guidance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473916/how-to-do-a-rapid-review---updated-methods-guidance) Background: Having quick access to systematically produced evidence syntheses is crucial in addressing urgent health questions. The Cochrane Rapid Review Methods Group (RRMG) has published interim guidance to facilitate the conduct of Rapid Reviews (RR) both within Cochrane and beyond (1). This guidance aims to provide support and direction for conducting effective and efficient RRs. Three years later, the RRMG updated the guidance integrating new knowledge on the conduct of RRs and feedback from users of the interim guidance. Objectives: In this workshop, members of the RRMG will present the updated RR methods guidance. Description: In a mix of short lectures, hands-on work, and examples of good practice and common pitfalls, participants will learn how to plan and conduct an RR according to the updated guideline. Learning outcomes Workshop participants know the recommendations from the updated Cochrane RR Methods Guidance. Workshop participants can use the guidance in practice.

The team working style session looks at the four basic ways that members of a team interact. You will explore these and find out your own preferred working style and how to work better with different working styles, so you can get on with people better. This is linked to a second session - The Art of Getting By: Influencing skills: Communication and Negotiation on Wednesday 6th September at 11.00-12.30, but can also be attended as a stand-alone session. Both sessions will be employing simple \"heuristics\" - ways of understanding complex situations and making better choices. They are so simple you can keep them in your head. The skills are generic, and you can employ them in your private life as well as your working life. You will even return home with a couple of heuristics to try out the same evening! [Maintaining our place as a trusted health evidence producer: the Future of Evidence Synthesis programme](/colloquium-2023/session/1463326/maintaining-our-place-as-a-trusted-health-evidence-producer-the-future-of-evidence-synthesis-programme) The global health, research and publishing landscape has changed beyond recognition since our organization began in the early 1990s - giving rise to both complex challenges and new opportunities for Cochrane. To maintain our hard-earned place as one of the world's most trusted health evidence producers, we need to adapt and directly address a diverse range of critical issues - from the loss of traditional funding sources and the move to a fully Open Access model, to the increasing demand for rapid evidence in new formats. To ensure Cochrane's future we are working to deliver a new model for producing Cochrane evidence syntheses through our [Future of Evidence Synthesis](https://futurecochrane.org/) programme. This transformational programme of work will roll out over the next three to four years and is made up of ten targeted projects, encompassing changes to our organizational structure, software, review development and editorial processes, policies and the format of Cochrane Reviews. This Special Session is an opportunity for people to understand better how key projects will impact on the Cochrane evidence synthesis ecosystem and what these changes will mean for people across the Cochrane Community. There will be an opportunity to ask questions about the programme and provide ideas that will contribute towards successful implementation. Target audience: Anyone interested in how Cochrane produces high-quality evidence synthesis in the future. Format: Presentations plus discussion / Questions & Answers [Diversity and Inclusion in Cochrane](/colloquium-2023/session/1547952/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cochrane) In the last few years, there has been an increasing debate on how scientific journals represent sex, gender, ethnicity and other aspects of human diversity. Moreover, the hegemony of the English language in scientific publications lays the foundation for structural inequalities for native speakers in other languages. Cochrane has conducted a listening and learning exercise to identify the challenges and opportunities in the area of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI). Now, we must work as an organization to promote inclusivity and minimize structural biases in our Collaboration. We selected some topics and recommendations to discuss in this special session. Please read the following report from Cochrane: [Cochrane launches report summarizing what we have heard from our diversity and inclusion listening and learning exercise](https://community.cochrane.org/news/cochrane-launches-report-summarising-what-we-have-heard-our-diversity-and-inclusion-listening-and-learning-exercise).

Poorly conducted systematic reviews can lead to inaccurate representations of the evidence, misleading conclusions, and reduced applicability, limiting their usefulness and ultimately contributing to research waste. Everyone in the research community (researchers, peer-reviewers, journal editors, funders, decision makers, clinicians, journalists, and the public) can help facilitate the conduct of robust systematic reviews that are published and communicated in a timely manner, reducing research waste and increasing the transparency and accessibility of all systematic reviews. Objectives: - To highlight some of the key issues around the quality and volume of evidence synthesis research published. - To discuss potential solutions to these issues. - To prepare action plans to make changes to personal or organisational ways of working to implement solutions/tackle the key issues moving forward in practice. Description: This 90-minute workshop will consist of: - A brief (10 min) presentation to outline the key issues identified from the research. - The audience will be split into small groups (we will aim for each group to include a mix of perspectives represented e.g., researcher, peer reviewer, publishers, and members of the public where possible). Each group will have a different issue and potential solutions to focus on and discuss. The discussion will be based around what changes individuals can make to help improve/resolve the issues highlighted and noting down achievable steps as part of a personal plan (20-30 mins). - The audience will then be asked to regroup into groups representing similar perspectives and continue to discuss the issues and solutions that could be made at an organisational level (relevant to their background/perspective) and again noting down potentially achievable steps (20-30 mins). - The final 20-30 mins will be used to share individual and organisational plans and encourage people to make an action plan at a personal and/or organisational level to facilitate change. [How to incorporate information on funding and conflicts of interest in trials when conducting a Cochrane Review: the TACIT tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473933/how-to-incorporate-information-on-funding-and-conflicts-of-interest-in-trials-when-conducting-a-cochrane-review-the-tacit-tool) Background: Industry funding and trial researchers' financial conflicts of interest are common in clinical trials and are associated with favourable trial conclusions and seemingly greater treatment effects. Information on funding and conflicts of interest is therefore considered important when interpreting trial findings. The Cochrane Handbook includes a section on conflicts of interest based on the concepts behind a new Tool for Addressing Conflicts of Interest in Trials (TACIT) to be used in the context of systematic reviews, e.g., Cochrane Reviews. TACIT provides a framework for collecting funding and conflicts of interest information for a trial in order to reach a judgement on whether there is notable concern about conflicts of interest affecting the design, conduct, analysis or reporting of the trial, and the sufficiency of information this assessment is based on. Objectives: To introduce participants to the concepts behind TACIT and provide practical experience with the tool. Description: The workshop will consist of two parts.1) Introduction: The empirical basis and the background behind the development of TACIT will be briefly presented, and we will introduce the tool framework and key concepts. 2) Using TACIT: Through a practical exercise in small groups the participants will be introduced to the tool. Participants will be guided in the usage of TACIT from retrieving funding and conflicts of interest information to judging whether a trial has notable concern about conflicts of interest and the sufficiency of information available for this assessment. In plenary, we will discuss the assessments by the individual groups and how information from TACIT may further inform Cochrane Review data analysis and interpretation of results. Participants may bring a laptop to assist them in the exercise, but it is not necessary for participation. See www.tacit.one for further information about the tool. [Systematic reviews of prognosis studies IV: The use of GRADE for assessing the certainty of evidence for questions of overall prognosis and prognostic factors](/colloquium-2023/session/1473929/systematic-reviews-of-prognosis-studies-iv-the-use-of-grade-for-assessing-the-certainty-of-evidence-for-questions-of-overall-prognosis-and-prognostic-factors) Background The GRADE approach is widely used for assessing certainty in inferences drawn from evidence. The GRADE approach has been adopted to assess certainty in evidence on overall prognosis and prognostic factors. Objective Present participants with an interactive session designed to understand and apply GRADE to evidence on overall prognosis and prognostic factors. Description We will engage participants on 10 topics related to the application of the GRADE for questions of prognosis. We will provide participants with examples from real systematic reviews. Participants will review the reviews and apply the GRADE guidance to determine the certainty. Study design: The participants will be engaged in discussions over the ideal study design when assessing evidence related to prognosis. Risk of bias: The domain will be introduced (high vs low risk of bias studies) with focus on considerations necessary for evidence related to prognostic factors (adjusted vs unadjusted associations). Inconsistency: We review the concept of inconsistency (and its relation to statistical heterogeneity). We will assess the impact of aberrant studies and their impact on the overall conclusion of the meta-analysis. Imprecision: The participants will review the different frameworks for assessment of imprecision, along with the difference between relative compared with absolute effect estimates. The workshop will provide an online calculator for determining absolute risks necessary for the assessment of imprecision under the partially contextualized framework. Indirectness: In this segment, the attendees will compare the research question of a systematic review to the characteristics of studies addressing the research question. We will provide guidance for circumstances when it is necessary to rate down our certainty for indirectness. Publication bias: Example of a systematic review will be provided in which the assessment of publication bias based on visual inspection (funnel plot) is different compared to the statistical test. Domains for rating up and special considerations with use of GRADE: Discussion on the three domains for increasing certainty, and challenges with making judgment with domains of GRADE that are highly interrelated. [Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies using QUADAS-2](/colloquium-2023/session/1473954/quality-assessment-of-diagnostic-accuracy-studies-using-quadas-2) Background: One of the key characteristics of a systematic review is the assessment of the quality of the included studies. If these individual studies are flawed, then the results of a meta-analysis and review in general are also flawed. To assess the quality of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies, we will practise the use of the QUADAS-2 tool. Objectives: Understand mechanisms that may lead to high risk of bias in DTA studies; understand the concept of applicability of DTA studies; understand additional sources of bias for comparative DTA studies; assess the quality of a DTA study using QUADAS-2; and interpret the findings of quality assessment. Description: This workshop organised by the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group is designed for individuals who are planning or currently undertaking a Cochrane DTA review, those involved in an editorial role or those who are using test accuracy evidence. The facilitators can tailor the workshop to accommodate the needs of individuals attending as far as possible but plan to address the following four topics: design and general aspects of diagnostic test accuracy studies; sources of bias and variability in diagnostic test accuracy studies; application of QUADAS-2 to a DTA study; a brief introduction to QUADAS-C; and reporting of the quality assessment results. The workshop will draw on the experience of the DTA Editorial Team as well as facilitators' own experience of undertaking DTA reviews across a breadth of topic areas. The workshop will be delivered through a mixture of interactive presentations, discussions and small group exercises. [Storyboarding as a multimodal analytical technique in a qualitative evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473927/storyboarding-as-a-multimodal-analytical-technique-in-a-qualitative-evidence-synthesis) Background: Multimodality is centralized around the fundamental question of how to use and combine modes of expression to organize, analyze, synthesize, interpret, and share research evidence. The use of multiple, engaging modalities, for example words in combination with images, establishes new audiences for research findings and promotes health equity by communicating research in an accessible, comprehensible way. Storyboarding is defined as the process of putting together images to arrange or illustrate a story in a specific sequence. This can be considered as a \"visual text of images\" (Hart, 2008; Naicker, et al. 2020). Visual storyboarding techniques can present themselves as a legitimate and rigorous method in a systematic review project (Hendricks et al. 2022). They can capture meaning, while at the same time embracing creativity, extending rigor, and increasing the review's appeal for a broader public. This analytic technique is useful for working with studies which include photos and other types of data. See published QES: Hendricks LA, Young T, Van Wyk SS, Mathe\u00ef C, Hannes K. (2022): https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811317 Objectives: This workshop aims to familiarize participants with the storyboarding as an analytical technique in QES, with the practical exposure of working with multimodal review data using art materials and open access software. Description: Participants will be introduced to types of multimodal data and the concept of storyboarding (5 min). Participants will be invited to write a short paragraph on a single experience (5 min). Following this, we will provide guided facilitation on using art for synthesis and break into small groups (5 min). The group will be tasked to create 6 block storyboard (templates provided) (30 min), with half of the small group using digital mediums and the other half using art materials, which they will then merge into a single storyboard (15 min). Following this, a group representative will be posted at the storyboard as the groups move around and listen to other stories (15 min). Participants will experience first-hand how storyboarding and art could be used to make sense of data in reviews. [How to use and evaluate OpenAlex tools for efficient automated updating of systematic reviews and maps in EPPI-Reviewer](/colloquium-2023/session/1473925/how-to-use-and-evaluate-openalex-tools-for-efficient-automated-updating-of-systematic-reviews-and-maps-in-eppi-reviewer) Background: Keeping on top of new evidence is a perennial challenge. Systematic reviews can quickly become out of date, and maintaining surveillance of new evidence can be resource intensive and costly. For example, identifying new eligible studies for updating systematic reviews and maps of research\u2014including those that have been transitioned to using a 'living reviews' approach\u2014conventionally involves running updated Boolean searches across multiple electronic databases and manual screening of all retrieved unique records. However, new tools and technologies are beginning to address this challenge. First, the OpenAlex dataset\u2014an open access, continually updated dataset and knowledge graph comprising more than 250 million records of research articles from across science\u2014can be considered a 'one stop shop' for published research in many topic areas, reducing the need to search many, or sometimes any, subscription databases. Second, the scope of a review can be 'learned' by machine learning algorithms, facilitating efficient identification of eligible studies from within large datasets. OpenAlex tools in EPPI-Reviewer make use of these important enablers to support efficient updating of systematic reviews and maps, using precise automated searches of this potentially comprehensive single source with machine learning. Objectives: To (i) introduce OpenAlex tools in EPPI-Reviewer; (ii) learn how to use these tools to set up automated study identification workflows for updating systematic reviews or maps of research; and (iii) discuss how to evaluate the ability of these workflows to efficiently identify new research. Description: Participants will need a laptop with wireless connectivity in order to gain practical 'hands-on' experience of using OpenAlex tools in EPPI-Reviewer. The workshop will cover how to use these tools to set up an example Cochrane intervention review for prospective updating via automated searches of the OpenAlex dataset. We will also demonstrate options for managing and screening records retrieved by these searches. Time will be allocated to a discussion of how these tools and methods should be evaluated. This session will be of interest to information specialists, review authors, and others interested in learning about new approaches to automate and optimise the updating process. [Interpreting systematic review findings](/colloquium-2023/session/1473978/interpreting-systematic-review-findings) Background: Systematic reviews are considered the gold standard of evidence for health professionals and are increasingly used to support decision-making in health care. Understanding review results is of paramount importance in translating research evidence into clinical practice. Critical thinking needs to be applied to read and/or use a systematic review, as interpretation of findings can be quite challenging when the available evidence is inconclusive or uncertain. Objectives: 1) To introduce the concept of clinical significance; 2) to explain the rationale behind the certainty of the evidence; 3) to give a brief overview of the \"Summary of findings\" table; and 4) to reflect on translating the results of systematic reviews into clinical practice. Description: This workshop will appeal most directly to new review authors and users of systematic reviews, including patients and their caregivers. We will give a short presentation at the beginning of the workshop (15 minutes) to outline the scope of the session and introduce key concepts. Then, participants will work in small groups under the guidance of the facilitators. We will try to ensure each group is formed by people with different backgrounds and expertise to bring different views and perspectives to the discussion. Based on specific clinical scenarios, we will use practical examples extracted from Cochrane reviews and Cochrane Clinical Answers. The groups will have time to read, think about the interpretation of the results, and discuss the implications for practice and/or further research. Each group will then share the work done with the participants. We will stimulate the debate on key issues, such as the relevance of outcome selection, basic interpretation of continuous and binary outcome measures, magnitude of the effects, importance of measuring heterogeneity, and impact of the risk of bias of included studies. One laptop per working group is needed. [Lessons from four years of Cochrane's Methods Support Unit: what are we asked and how do we answer?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473923/lessons-from-four-years-of-cochrane's-methods-support-unit-what-are-we-asked-and-how-do-we-answer) Background: Established in 2019, the Methods Support Unit (MSU) provides methods advice to editors and authors preparing Cochrane Reviews. We have helped people from 49 Cochrane Review Groups, dealing with more than 1,100 requests. These requests range from advice on a single methodological/statistical issue to a full review of a draft protocol or review. In addition, MSU has provided many hours of interactive training and authored guidance on key methods issues. As a result, MSU is in a unique position to understand the methodological and statistical concerns of Cochrane authors and editors and to provide accessible training of immediate usefulness. Objectives: Our workshop will highlight the 'Top Five' issues encountered by authors and editors working on Cochrane reviews. These are the key issues that generate questions for the MSU team and that we encounter when reviewing manuscripts. We will explain how to handle these issues through a series of interactive exercises and discussions. As a result, this workshop will help to strengthen evidence production for the future by tackling 'common errors' and ensure Cochrane continues to produce robust and trusted evidence. Description: We will use the most commonly asked questions as the basis for our workshop which will be delivered by experienced methodologists and statisticians. We will prepare materials and deliver a series of five 15-minute interactive sessions to teach attendees how to handle these issues. There will be plenty of time for questions and discussion. We will cover the following: Issues arising from including cluster and crossover randomised controlled trials. Use and misuse of the standardised mean difference effect measure. Risk of Bias 2.0: Bias due to deviations from the intended interventions: how is this different from the 'Blinding of participants and personnel' domain in Risk of Bias 1? What counts as a deviation from the intended interventions? How should the results of a network meta-analysis be summarised? Assessing imprecision in GRADE: what is an optimum information size? We did not involve patients or healthcare consumers in preparing this workshop, but we will pitch the session to be accessible to the widest possible audience. [Advanced meta-analysis 1: Random-effects methods to be implemented in RevMan](/colloquium-2023/session/1473951/advanced-meta-analysis-1-random-effects-methods-to-be-implemented-in-revman) Background: Meta-analysis is typically used to estimate the mean effect size of an outcome of interest. However, also of interest is estimation of the variability in the effect sizes (heterogeneity), because this allows assessment of the consistency of effects across studies and estimation of the likely effect of the intervention in an individual setting. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects method is widely used (and is currently the only method available in RevMan) to estimate heterogeneity, however, its performance has long been challenged. Objectives: To provide review authors with knowledge of new random-effects methods to be implemented in RevMan Web. This workshop is part of a series of workshops delivered by the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group and requires knowledge of the material presented at the workshop 'Introduction to meta-analysis 2: dealing with heterogeneity'. Description: Several alternative methods to the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects method have been proposed that have better statistical properties in specific scenarios. We will provide an overview of the new random effects methods to be implemented on RevMan Web. Specifically, we will introduce new methods to estimate the heterogeneity variance (and its confidence interval); calculate a confidence interval for the meta-analysis effect; and calculate a prediction interval. We will cover reasons for selecting a particular method; how the estimates should be interpreted; what the impact might be when updating Cochrane Reviews using the new methods; and what to write in a Cochrane protocol. We will use a combination of presentations, interactive exercises, and group work. [Social event at the Natural History Museum](/colloquium-2023/session/1623940/social-event-at-the-natural-history-museum) We're delighted to be hosting this year's social event at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) on Tuesday 5th September, starting at 7:30pm until late.

Address: Natural History Museum, Cromwell Rd, South Kensington, London SW7 5BD, UK |7:30 AM - 8:45 AM| Each Cochrane Methods Group is dedicated to a specific method or review type relevant to Cochrane Reviews. Methods Groups are usually led by a small group of senior and experienced methodologies (Convenors and Co-convenors) with a wider membership of experienced and/or interested researchers. They are involved in methods research, defining best practices and supporting implementation in Cochrane. This meeting will help in the strategic planning of the Methods Groups activities for 2023-2024. [Building trust through co-creation: re-imagining evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1452909/building-trust-through-co-creation-re-imagining-evidence) Generating evidence through the combination of scientific and lived experience has the potential to enable mutual trust between research and society. The aim of this session is to spark a lively discussion about addressing the impact of experiential knowledge and through that, building deeper understandings and relationships between researchers, research participants and people involved. In this session, we will explore why information and evidence as we know it may not be enough to support decision making, and reflect on examples that demonstrate ways to build trust and co-create evidence, with a discussion of differences as well as mutual learnings in the global south and global north. Keynotes: - Building Trust: Challenging division (Peter Beresford) - Co-creating Engagement and Evidence, Globally (Bella Starling) - From TB to COVID and Back Again: Community Engagement for Essential Evidence (Tasha Koch) - Using Creative and Participatory Methods to Research Prioritisation in Primary Care (Shoba Dawson) This session will be chaired by Richard Morley, Cochrane's Consumer Engagement Officer and Maureen Smith, Chair of Cochrane Consumer Network Executive. [Break](/colloquium-2023/session/1623982/break) [Communicating and implementing evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1578348/building-partnerships-and-implementing-evidence) [Going farther, faster together: Implementing the recommendations of the Evidence Commission report](/colloquium-2023/session/1463323/going-farther-faster-together-implementing-the-recommendations-of-the-evidence-commission-report) One year has passed since the publication of the report of the Global Commission on Evidence to Address Societal Challenges (henceforth the Evidence Commission). We see reasons for optimism, as well as reasons to double down on efforts to implement the report's recommendations. While government policymakers in some countries (like those newly elected in some Latin American countries) are open to new approaches to decision-making and evidence use, many policymakers, organizational leaders and professionals have largely returned to pre-pandemic approaches. While some funders and donors and some impact-oriented evidence producers have piloted coordination mechanisms, many evidence producers continue to operate without coordination and to generate significant research waste. While many citizens have become more aware of the potential value of evidence, many others have become more distrustful of decision-makers and evidence. This Special Session has two overarching objectives: - to provide an overview of the Evidence Commission's three implementation priorities - formalizing and strengthening domestic evidence-support systems - enhancing and leveraging the global evidence architecture - putting evidence at the centre of everyday life - to explore ways to promote, contribute to and/or lead efforts to implement the Evidence Commission's recommendations and implementation priorities. The Evidence Commission Secretariat and its partners in 12 countries are conducting Rapid Evidence-Support System Assessments (RESSAs) and sharing lessons learned through the RESSA Country Team Leads Group. The goal in each country is to: - identify what is going well that needs to be systematized and scaled up; - identify gaps that should be prioritized to address; and - work with decision-makers, organizational leaders, professionals and citizens to push for improvements. The Evidence Commission Secretariat and its partners are exploring ways to develop one or more viable models and to seek funding and the support of evidence producers to pilot the model and then to scale it up based on lessons learned. Efforts are also underway to partner with citizen-serving non-governmental organizations and citizen leaders to identify what works to: - help citizens judge what others are claiming or more generally find (and receive) reliable information; - make evidence available to citizens when they are making choices; - engage citizens in asking questions and answering them (with new research or with existing evidence); and - make evidence-based choices the default or easy option. Target audience: Evidence producers, evidence intermediaries and Cochrane Consumers. Format: This is a Special Session with brief presentations followed by interactive discussions with the audience to explore ways to promote, contribute to and/or lead efforts to implement the Evidence Commission's recommendations. [Have your say on Cochrane's future: Defining Cochrane's next strategy](/colloquium-2023/session/1467869/have-your-say-on-cochrane's-future-defining-cochrane's-next-strategy) Cochrane's vision of a world of better health for all people, where decisions about health and care are informed by high-quality evidence, is more important than ever, but how do we decide where to focus our efforts when working towards this ambitious vision? The answer is Cochrane's new strategy that will allow us to prioritize our efforts to make sure we are having the greatest impact possible. We can't do this without you! Cochrane is in the process of developing a new strategy to help us achieve our vision and mission, and to guide us through the opportunities and challenges of the next five years. Cochrane has always been a collaboration made up of brilliant people from all over the globe, so join us in this Special Session to have your say, which will help us produce a strategy that is meaningful to everyone in Cochrane. This session will give you the chance to hear first-hand from the Chief Executive Officer Catherine Spencer, about the plans for a new organizational strategy and you will get the chance to engage in this critical process, allowing you to have your say on Cochrane's future priorities and direction. There will be a mixture of presentations, questions and answer sessions, and small group conversations, to allow the greatest possible engagement from everyone present. We want the strategy to reflect Cochrane's global and diverse nature, so would particularly welcome delegates from low- and middle-income countries, many different languages and many different roles in the organization. Please join us to shape Cochrane's future! Target audience: Authors, group members, Cochrane Community. We should particularly welcome delegates from low- and middle-income countries, many different languages and many different roles in the organization, to ensure our strategy is diverse and inclusive. Format: Presentation then focus group discussions Additional facilitators: Pardo Pardo, Flavia Marcocci, Fiona O'Brien. [Transdisciplinary Approaches for Setting Research Priorities on Climate Change and Health: Engaging Decision Makers, Researchers, and Communities](/colloquium-2023/session/1473956/transdisciplinary-approaches-for-setting-research-priorities-on-climate-change-and-health-engaging-decision-makers-researchers-and-communities) Background: Climate change is having a profound impact on human, animal and planetary health. These impacts will also trigger social, economic and political changes, indicating the need for a wider understanding of the evidence landscape for identifying policy and practical solutions. There is a growing recognition of the importance of involving field workers, communities and indigenous people in setting research priorities to ensure they are contextually relevant, and the process is inclusive, where people most familiar with problems and issues in their regions are involved in such decisions. In this workshop, we will explore how decision-makers, funders and researchers can work together to set a research agenda for prioritizing evidence syntheses in this field. Objectives: Our workshop will provide an overview of how to involve decision-makers, researchers and indigenous people in setting research priorities on climate change and health. Description: - The workshop will begin with an overview of how climate change affects humans, animals and planetary health, including transdisciplinary approaches of One Health and Planetary Health. - This will be followed by a presentation identifying policy and practice needs. - Next, we will present how to undertake stakeholder mapping and create a decision-making framework. This will demonstrate how to untangle some of the complexities in this area. - Exercise: We will provide individuals with a report on future research needs with local decision-makers on response to disasters due to climate change that affected the health of the local community in the island of Palawan in the Philippines. The participants will analyse and appraise those results and how to translate them into questions for systematic reviews. - Discussion: We will open the session for a wider conversation on climate change and public health, how the issues raised will be applicable and generalisable to different sectors, and how an evidence ecosystem, such as Cochrane, fits into this. This workshop will provide participants with the knowledge and tools to engage in effective and inclusive priority-setting exercises that address the complex and wide-ranging issues related to climate change and health. [Introducing INSPECT-SR: a tool for detecting problematic randomised controlled trials in health systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473972/introducing-inspect-sr-a-tool-for-detecting-problematic-randomised-controlled-trials-in-health-systematic-reviews) Background: There is a growing awareness about the problem posed by untrustworthy randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in systematic reviews. It appears that some RCTs have been partially or entirely fabricated. We call trials subject to serious research integrity issues \"problematic studies\", and recent examples can be found in reviews of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. The Cochrane policy Managing Potentially Problematic Studies states that studies should not be included until serious concerns about trustworthiness have been resolved. However, there is no consensus around how to identify problematic studies. The INSPECT-SR (INvestigating ProblEmatic Clinical Trials in Systematic Reviews) project is developing a tool for identifying problematic RCTs in systematic reviews by combining empirical evidence with consensus methodology to develop a draft tool, which will then be refined through user testing. To date, the project has had input from over 70 people with expertise and experience in research integrity. Objectives: 1. To introduce the draft INSPECT-SR tool to workshop participants. 2. To provide training in the draft tool by way of application to real examples. 3. To gather feedback from participants which will be used to improve the tool. Description: This workshop will begin with a short (10 min) introduction to the draft INSPECT-SR tool and the workshop activity. Participants will work in groups to apply the tool to studies in Cochrane Reviews. The tool includes signaling questions in four domains. Illustrative examples are Inspecting results in the paper: Are the results substantially divergent from others in the meta-analysis? and Inspecting conduct, governance and transparency: Is the recruitment of participants plausible within the stated time frame for the research? The activity will be divided into 15-minute segments, corresponding to each domain. In each, participants will work in small groups to apply the signaling questions from one domain with support from facilitators (10 min), followed by facilitator-led discussion amongst all participants (5 min). The final 20 minutes will be devoted to overall discussion of participants' impression of the tool, including capture of user feedback via questionnaire. Consumer involvement The project has an expert advisory panel representing a variety of stakeholders, including two lay members. [How to plan and implement synthesis questions (part 1): using the InSynQ checklist and guide for question development](/colloquium-2023/session/1473960/how-to-plan-and-implement-synthesis-questions-part-1-using-the-insynq-checklist-and-guide-for-question-development) Background: This is the first of a two-part workshop. This session introduces the InSynQ (Intervention Synthesis Questions) checklist and guide which aims to facilitate the development and reporting of the questions addressed in systematic reviews. The concept of defining a review 'question' (the objective) and developing criteria for including studies in the review using the patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes (PICO) framework is familiar to most authors. However, without changing the review eligibility criteria, the synthesis can be structured to address different questions (e.g., broader or narrower) simply by grouping the interventions, outcomes or populations differently. The results of a systematic review are ultimately determined by these synthesis questions and the decisions authors take in deciding which studies are eligible to answer each question. Version 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions introduced the concept of 'PICO for each synthesis' to bring greater focus on the need to plan and report details of the synthesis questions addressed in a systematic review. InSynQ (InSynQ.info) provides a practical tool to help implement this guidance. Objectives To demonstrate the importance and process of planning the PICO for each synthesis (i.e., the grouping and comparisons) through application in a practical example; and To introduce the InSynQ tool and show how it can be used to develop and report synthesis questions in a protocol and review. Description: Based on the guidance in Chapters 2, 3 and 9 of the Cochrane Handbook, we will use a combination of group work, (fun) interactive exercises and short presentations to cover the following topics. Deciding how interventions and outcomes will be grouped (small-group work and discussion to plan a hypothetical synthesis) Using InSynQ to define your synthesis questions and PICO criteria for each comparison (interactive example) Workshop participants will gain an appreciation for the need to plan and fully specify their synthesis questions and an understanding of how InSynQ can be used for this purpose. [Question formulation and Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews: Accuracy and beyond](/colloquium-2023/session/1473968/question-formulation-and-interpretation-of-diagnostic-test-accuracy-reviews-accuracy-and-beyond) Background: Question formulation is a fundamental first step in the review process and guides decisions about eligibility criteria, definitions of test comparisons to be evaluated, assessment of applicability, planning of statistical analysis and the interpretation of results. Using test accuracy statistics to describe the practical implications of using a test is a recognised challenge for the interpretation of test accuracy reviews. The workshop will offer guidance, as formulated in the Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews, for formulating a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) review question, interpretation and presentation of results. Objectives: Understand what is meant by a testing pathway and representation of test comparisons Understand the importance of question formulation for judgments about applicability and for the interpretation of results Understand the importance of prevalence Understand how estimates of test accuracy can be used to describe the practical implications of using a test Description: This workshop, organised by the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group, is designed for individuals who are planning or currently undertaking a Cochrane DTA review, those involved in an Editorial role or those who are using test accuracy evidence. The facilitators can tailor the workshop to accommodate the needs of individuals attending as far as possible but plan to address the following four topics: The importance of setting and test comparisons as part of question formulation Anticipating and capturing sources of variability Common measures used to express test accuracy How estimates of test accuracy can be used to describe the practical implications of using a test Constructing Summary of Findings tables The workshop will draw on the experience of the DTA Editorial Team, as well as facilitators' own experience of undertaking DTA reviews across a breadth of topic areas. The workshop will be delivered through a mixture of interactive presentations, discussions and small-group exercises. [Advanced meta-analysis 2: Performing meta-analysis in the presence of rare events](/colloquium-2023/session/1473941/advanced-meta-analysis-2-performing-meta-analysis-in-the-presence-of-rare-events) Background: Rare events are a common problem in meta-analysis, particularly for secondary and safety outcomes. When the events are rare, standard meta-analytical approaches have important limitations and may lead to biased and imprecise results. Alternative methods have been proposed in the literature that outperform in terms of bias and precision compared with the standard inverse-variance (IV) method. This workshop is part of a series of workshops delivered by the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group. Objectives: The objective of this workshop is to provide guidance on handling rare events in meta-analysis. We aim to review the problems associated with the IV method and to describe several alternative methods that can be used instead. Description: In this workshop, we will review the properties of the IV approach and explain the reasons that render this method problematic when the studied endpoints are rare. We will explain the advantages of one-stage meta-analysis models over two-stage models in such cases and go through the assumptions and the properties of some of these models. The workshop will also include a practical part in which participants will apply different models in R using data from a clinical example involving rare events. By the end of this workshop, participants will have a good understanding of the problems related to meta-analysis of rare events and will be able to fit meta-analysis models appropriate for such datasets. [If, when and how to sample primary studies for inclusion in a qualitative evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473940/if-when-and-how-to-sample-primary-studies-for-inclusion-in-a-qualitative-evidence-synthesis) Background: Too much data can threaten the quality of a data synthesis in a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), and too little can limit transferability across multiple contexts. As a QES seeks to provide an interpretation of the evidence, it is not essential to identify and include every available, relevant study but rather only studies that adequately represent relevant data from diverse participants and contexts. Sampling can be considered within the study selection process to enable the review team to include a manageable number of studies in their review. Sampling methods are, however, not well articulated, and selecting an inappropriate sample introduces threats to QES rigour. Objectives: The objective of this workshop will be to guide participants through new Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group guidance on sampling using practical exercises to facilitate an understanding of the following: - the difference between comprehensive and theoretical/purposeful screening approaches; - what to do if the search identifies too few or too many studies; and - how to sample studies for inclusion in a synthesis. Furthermore, we will challenge participants to engage in problem solving and creative thinking which may lead to new methodological ideas in the field of sampling for study inclusion in a QES. Description: This workshop will begin with a brief presentation of the key terms and concepts participants need to understand to participate in the groupwork. Participants will then be broken into small groups. Each group will receive a case study of a QES to form the basis of their groupwork and discussion. They will work together to develop a sampling strategy for the QES they have been assigned. Throughout the workshop, we will shift between group and plenary discussion to resolve the case studies using participants' experiences and creative thinking. As sampling for study inclusion can take diverse forms, participants will be challenged to find solutions appropriate to the QES they are working with. QIMG Core methods workshop. [Scoping reviews: breaking down the what, why, and how](/colloquium-2023/session/1473963/scoping-reviews-breaking-down-the-what-why-and-how) Background: Evidence synthesis provides the best available evidence to decision-makers and is pivotal to well-functioning, rapid-learning health systems. Scoping reviews have grown in popularity within the evidence synthesis community. Scoping reviews are distinct from but related to systematic reviews and are suited to answering different research questions usually beyond the scope of a systematic review. Whilst systematic reviews are able to answer questions on the feasibility, appropriateness, meaningfulness and experiences of a particular intervention, scoping reviews identify and map evidence on a topic and identify main concepts, theories, sources and knowledge gaps. The conduct and reporting of scoping reviews is often inconsistent, and this workshop hopes to support further understanding in this area. Objectives: Our objective is to provide participants with information on the role of scoping reviews, the procedures for conducting and reporting scoping reviews and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines, introduction to new JBI methodology on the role of knowledge users and the methods of capturing, analysing, and presenting results of scoping reviews. Description: Following a short presentation, participants will be divided into small, facilitator-led working groups to discuss the provided scoping review exemplars to 1) determine whether the examples are correct using the JBI scoping review methodology and/or the PRISMA-ScR and 2) discuss what implications the exemplar scoping review has for other researchers, decision-makers, and patients. The workshop will then continue with a brief presentation and discussion on knowledge users' role in scoping reviews. The workshop will conclude with an expert panel where participants can ask questions about scoping reviews and their relevance to guideline development. Participants will have access to resources in the session (methodological guidance articles, infographics and decision-making trees) via Dropbox. [Preparing Cochrane Reviews for submission, editing and publication: common errors and how to solve them](/colloquium-2023/session/1473948/preparing-cochrane-reviews-for-submission-editing-and-publication-common-errors-and-how-to-solve-them) Background: All Cochrane Reviews and protocols are copy-edited by Cochrane's Production Service (CPS) before publication to improve clarity, consistency, accuracy and completeness. Any improvements that can be made to reviews earlier in the process will: - improve overall author, editor and copy editor experience; - reduce handling time; - reduce time between submission and publication; - improve the final quality of published reviews; - make reviews more accessible to readers, including patients and healthcare consumers; and thus - increase their use and implementation. The CPS team has identified a number of errors and issues that appear regularly in traditional reviews that will inform our workshop. Objectives: To equip attendees to identify and correct, and so avoid, common errors in reviews and protocols prior to submission and copy-editing. Description: The workshop will cover several common errors, covering elements of structure, formatting, style and consistency. Attendees will be talked through a variety of issues and then work either individually, or in small groups, on real-life exercises to help them to understand and master each point. We will discuss the answers and options for each within the workshop. We will discuss the appropriate use of resources, such as the Cochrane Style Manual, MECIR (Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews)/PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance, and the new Plain Language Summary requirements (introduced in 2021), alongside copy-editing checklists and other resources. Before the workshop, participants will be asked to submit examples of review text that have caused them concern during the course of preparing Cochrane Reviews for submission or copy-editing, and a selection of these will be used as practical, hands-on examples. During the workshop, we will identify areas where further guidance or additional resources would be helpful, which will inform future developments. Come and share your top tips for producing good content with people who care about making reviews the best that they can be before submission and publication! [Drawing conclusions from network meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473955/drawing-conclusions-from-network-meta-analysis) Background: Although the ability of ranking treatments is usually listed as one of the advantages of network meta-analysis (NMA), rankings fail to consider other pieces of relevant information and may lead to misleading conclusions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group has developed two frameworks for drawing conclusions from NMA: a minimally contextualized framework and a partially contextualized framework. The frameworks establish that drawing appropriate conclusions from NMA requires explicit consideration of estimates of effect for each pairwise comparison, their certainty of evidence, and the rankings. Objectives: For individuals considering conducting an NMA, to gain familiarity on how to draw conclusions from network meta-analysis appropriately considering the estimates of effect, the quality of the evidence, and the rankings. Description: This workshop will focus on the minimally contextualized framework for a single outcome. The framework allows for the classification of interventions in groups, from the most effective to the least effective (or from the most harmful to the least harmful, depending on the outcome). The workshop will begin with an interactive lecture providing details of the framework and then review a step-by-step template for applying it. Workshop participants will then break into groups of five or six to work through an example of a network meta-analysis, guided by facilitators when needed. Finally, the large group will discuss the results and other details of the use of the framework.

[Moving the Cochrane-WHO partnership forward: current and future activities and how to get involved](/colloquium-2023/session/1542253/moving-the-cochrane-who-partnership-forward-current-and-future-activities-and-how-to-get-involved) Cochrane has been a 'non-state actor in official relations' with the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2011. The partnership is one of Cochrane's largest and most impactful: around 76% of new guidelines issued by WHO in 2021 were informed by evidence from Cochrane Reviews. Discussions for a new programme of work will commence in the third quarter of 2023, so it is timely to revisit and renew the relationship between the two organizations. This session intends to update participants on the status of Cochrane's existing collaboration with WHO and on the organization's current and future priorities. It is also a chance for participants to hear from WHO representatives about opportunities to engage directly in this partnership, which ultimately aims to improve global health outcomes by ensuring health and care decisions are informed by trusted and timely evidence. After a brief introduction to the Cochrane-WHO collaboration and a short keynote from a WHO representative on current organizational priorities, the session will highlight key topics for discussion including: the use of rapid, living and curated evidence (and associated methods and innovative technologies) to inform WHO global guidance and ensure it remains up to date; expanding guidance and infrastructure to support better clinical trials and the reporting of their results; support for expanding areas of WHO's work, such as evidence relating to traditional medicine; and how to build or strengthen relationships with specific WHO departments, as well as regional and country offices. An open discussion will then follow. WHO guidance has a direct impact on the lives of billions of people worldwide. The primary activity of the Cochrane-WHO partnership is to ensure that WHO is able to draw on rigorously assessed, trusted and timely evidence for use in this guidance. Patients and consumers are encouraged to join the session. Target audience: Anyone interested in the Cochrane-WHO partnership Format: Presentation, panel discussion, open discussion with audience [Undertaking overview of systematic reviews - methods, challenges and the way forward (as identified by a group of clinical academics and methodologists who recently figured it all out)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473926/undertaking-overview-of-systematic-reviews---methods-challenges-and-the-way-forward-as-identified-by-a-group-of-clinical-academics-and-methodologists-who-recently-figured-it-all-out) Background: Overviews of systematic reviews (hereinafter referred to as 'overviews') are increasingly being used for the synthesis of evidence where the subject areas are broad and the evidence is rapidly expanding. Despite methodological advances and development of methodological guidelines, experience in their adoption is limited and many challenges remain. This proposed workshop will provide a forum for participants to learn more about methodological development in undertaking overviews and to share practical experiences. Objectives: (1) To raise awareness of tools and guidelines currently available in relation to the conduct of overviews; (2) to provide a forum for review authors to share their practical experiences and highlight potential challenges in undertaking overviews; and (3) to discuss potential areas for refinement of current tools and guidance and further methodological research. Description: This workshop will be a highly interactive event that offers opportunities for participants to learn more about methods for conducting overviews and for authors who have conducted overviews to share their experiences. The structure of the workshop will be aligned to key steps (and corresponding methods and challenges) for the preparation of an overview: (1) defining the research question and scope; (2) planning literature search; (3) selecting and mapping studies; (4) assessing the quality of systematic reviews; (5) extracting data; (6) synthesising and presenting evidence\u2014quantitatively and narratively; and (7) drawing conclusions and formulating recommendations. For each key step, we will invite participants to share tools and methods that they have used and issues that they faced, then supplement the discussion (where necessary) by drawing on the facilitators' own experience, having recently completed a highly complex overview of systematic reviews on perioperative oxygen therapy funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research. We will ensure discussions cover both practical issues (e.g., how to deal with overlapping evidence between systematic reviews and primary studies not covered by existing reviews) and theoretical underpinning (e.g., lumping versus splitting evidence in quantitative synthesis). We will utilise a mobile/online platform for real-time audience interaction to ensure that the workshop is truly participatory. [Cochrane Colloquium 2023 Overview of systematic review workshop plan v5.docx](https://colloquium2023-submissions.cochrane.org/sites/2023.colloquium.cochrane.org/files/uploads/users/u%5Buid%5D/Cochrane%20Colloquium%202023%20Overview%20of%20systematic%20review%20workshop%20plan%20v5.docx) [Comparing multiple interventions with network meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473942/comparing-multiple-interventions-with-network-meta-analysis) Background: Standard meta-analysis methods for clinical trials focus on comparisons of two interventions, such as a drug versus placebo or a new intervention versus standard practice. In clinical practice, there are rarely only two interventions under consideration. Extensions of meta-analysis to address three or more treatments have been the subject of much methodological research in recent years and are increasingly being applied. Most simply, indirect comparisons can be performed in ways that respect the randomization within each clinical trial. More complex forms are the so-called network meta-analyses, also known as multiple treatments meta-analyses or mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses. These allow the simultaneous analysis of clinical trials involving different treatments. Objectives: To introduce the concepts and methods of indirect comparison and network meta-analysis in the context of a Cochrane systematic review, following the Handbook Chapter drafted by the Cochrane Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group (CMIMG). Description: This workshop is aimed at statisticians, epidemiologists, and other quantitatively minded researchers who want to understand state-of-the-art statistical syntheses of clinical trials involving multiple interventions. The workshop will provide insights into network meta-analysis models that can be used to derive estimates for the relative effects of all treatments of interest. By the end of this workshop, participants will have an understanding of the role and potential of indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis in the evaluation of healthcare interventions: the principles, steps, and statistical methods involved and the biases that can distort indirect comparisons and network meta-analysis. [How to plan and implement synthesis questions (part 2): Implementing PICO in RevMan to streamline data extraction and analyses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473945/how-to-plan-and-implement-synthesis-questions-part-2-implementing-pico-in-revman-to-streamline-data-extraction-and-analyses) Participants will need to bring their own laptop. Background: This is the second of a two-part workshop. Defining your review 'question' (the objective) and developing criteria for including studies in the review using the PICO framework is a fundamental step in a systematic review. As well as this review-level PICO, the concept of 'PICO for each synthesis' was introduced in Version 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to bring greater focus on the need to plan and report each synthesis question addressed in a systematic review. The first session introduces the InSynQ (Intervention Synthesis Questions) checklist and guide for question development and reporting and demonstrates how to plan the PICOs for hypothetical syntheses. Once a review author has defined their PICO criteria for their review and each synthesis, early investment in setting this up in RevMan can streamline the review process going forward. Objectives: In this second session, participants will: Set up the review and syntheses PICOs, with associated groupings, in RevMan using the study centric data structure Gain an understanding of how this can streamline data extraction and facilitate completing your analyses Description: This workshop will: 1. Summarize the concept of PICO for each synthesis and the InSynQ guide (introduced in part 1). 2. Complete a practical exercise in RevMan covering: a. How to set up your predefined PICO criteria for your review and each synthesis. b. How to use the review and synthesis criteria in RevMan to inform your data extraction forms. c. How to import your extracted data from included studies into RevMan. d. How to set up and complete your analyses with just a few clicks (including how RevMan automatically transforms the results data from your included studies into the review's analyses). 3. Provide further information about the benefits of study centric data management in RevMan and how it makes systematic review production more efficient. Attendees are strongly encouraged to attend both sessions. [EPPI-Reviewer: review-production software that adapts to your needs](/colloquium-2023/session/1473973/eppi-reviewer-review-production-software-that-adapts-to-your-needs) Background: EPPI-Reviewer has been part of the Cochrane ecosystem of tools since 2015 and is available free of charge for Cochrane reviews; its role is to facilitate the review production of complex reviews. Unlike other software supporting review production phases, EPPI-Reviewer is designed with flexibility in mind and includes a wide range of cutting-edge machine learning and data services. EPPI-Reviewer is also a methodological research tool: its flexibility allows and facilitates methodological research and innovation; our current research focuses on enabling automation on the search and screening phases, integrating them both in ways that are specifically designed to support workflows for \"living\" systematic reviews. The same underlying technologies are expected to also drive significant innovations regarding data reuse and discoverability. Objectives: Introduce the core concepts behind the EPPI-Reviewer architecture and tools. Provide a general overview of how to use it according to different needs (meta-analyses, mixed methods, \"living\" systematic reviews, meta-ethnographies, etc.). Provide an introduction to our latest innovations and future plans. Description: The workshop will focus on the key elements of EPPI-Reviewer, concentrating on the features that are designed explicitly to support flexibility. Participants will be guided through the overall structure of the software, including highlights on the latest developments (living reviews, producing maps, and visualisations) and the ideas that inform our plans for the future. Practical exercises will focus on a few of the showcased features giving each participant the chance to try out the methodologies and approaches that best suit their use-case. This session is suitable for reviewers who are just starting to use EPPI-Reviewer, those who are ready to learn more, and those who are considering it for their future work. The ideal participant would have some experience in conducting systematic reviews (although beginners are welcome). Participants should bring their own laptop to the session, working in small groups will be encouraged. [Preparing for submitting your manuscript to the Cochrane's Central Editorial Service for Peer Review - observations from the Central Editorial Service Quality Assurance Team](/colloquium-2023/session/1473983/preparing-for-submitting-your-manuscript-to-the-cochrane's-central-editorial-service-for-peer-review---observations-from-the-central-editorial-service-quality-assurance-team) Background: Cochrane has recently been moving towards a Central Editorial Service that clearly separates review development roles (e.g., authoring/author support) from the editorial roles in the evidence synthesis production model. As part of this process, the Cochrane Central Editorial Service sends every Cochrane review for consumer, clinical, search, and methods peer review prior to publication. This robust process ensures that Cochrane reviews are accurate, reliable, and usable. However, the editorial process is often delayed, or the manuscript is rejected because methodological and reporting issues are identified during peer review. Authors and editors should be aware of the most common errors noted during the methods peer review process to help them identify, rectify, and ultimately avoid making these errors. Objectives: The objectives of this workshop are to highlight common methodological and reporting errors made in Cochrane Systematic Reviews; to provide practical, hands on guidance to help authors and editors address these errors; and to discuss the current opportunities available for getting involved in conducting editorial peer review. Description: The workshop will begin with a brief PowerPoint presentation, introducing the methods peer review process conducted by the Central Editorial Service and providing an overview of common errors identified during this process. The errors discussed will include (i) inappropriate prioritisation of comparisons and outcomes across the different sections of the review, (ii) inconsistent consideration of all 5 GRADE domains during the certainty of evidence assessment, and (iii) overinterpretation of the results leading to misleading and inappropriate conclusions. Following this, the attendees will work in small groups with the facilitators to identify these errors in some real-life examples and discuss the best way to rectify or avoid the issues. The workshop will conclude with an open discussion regarding the current opportunities available to authors and editors who are interested in getting more involved in the editorial peer review process. [What does good co-production in evidence synthesis look and feel like?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473984/what-does-good-co-production-in-evidence-synthesis-look-and-feel-like) Background: There is increasing interest in incorporating co-production in systematic reviews. However, there has been a lack of a unifying definition of co-production and the absence of a single definition can lead to 'conceptual stretching' and even misuse of the term. Rather than focus on a single definition, in this workshop, we consider the values that underpin co-production, including being human, inclusive, transparent and challenging, and how they can be enacted within evidence synthesis. Objectives: Participants will: Learn about the values that underpin co-production. Consider how co-production can be integrated within the development of a systematic review. Consider how the values that underpin co-production can be operationalised within their own evidence syntheses and systematic reviews. Description: Co-production requires a substantial shift in the way in which systematic reviews are produced, from conceptualisation to dissemination. This workshop will introduce participants to the values of co-production and how these can be used to inform the design and implementation of co-production within different types of systematic review (15 min). In groups, participants will have an opportunity to consider how the values of co-production can be implemented through considering different scenarios and case studies (30 min and 15 min feedback). In a final group discussion, participants will be invited to consider how the values of co-production can be enacted in their own evidence synthesis projects (20 min and 10 min summary). Throughout, the facilitators will also reflect on their own learning from implementing co-production in evidence synthesis, the emotions and 'feels' experienced as part of the process and the value that co-production brought, as well as sharing insight of what they would do differently in future. Relevance and importance to patients and the public: Whereas co-producing evidence presents a challenge to conventional ways of producing evidence in academic environments, it can also lead to evidence that is responsive to the needs of the public, patients and policymakers. Co-production can deliver evidence that actually matters to people and builds capacity and empowers individuals and communities whose voices have historically been marginalised. [GRADE target of certainty rating and implications for judgements regarding imprecision](/colloquium-2023/session/1473924/grade-target-of-certainty-rating-and-implications-for-judgements-regarding-imprecision) Objectives: This workshop will introduce participants to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) guidance on choosing targets of certainty of evidence and its implication on rating imprecision of evidence. Description: We will give a presentation to start the workshop, providing an overview of some basic concepts regarding GRADE certainty of evidence (target of certainty of evidence, possible thresholds/ranges of interest), practical principles on how to determine targets of certainty ratings, and GRADE updated guidance on imprecision ratings (primary approach for imprecision ratings in both systematic reviews and guidelines, situations in which one should consider rating done more than one levels for imprecision). Next, participants will receive examples from existing reviews. We will facilitate participants to discuss in these examples their judgements regarding the target of certainty ratings and how many level(s) to rate down for imprecision. After discussions, we will provide tips for each example. At the end, we will encourage participants to share their perspectives and opinions on the updated GRADE guidance presented. [Introduction to the RoB 2 tool for assessing risk of bias in a randomized trial](/colloquium-2023/session/1473971/introduction-to-the-rob-2-tool-for-assessing-risk-of-bias-in-a-randomized-trial) Background: Randomized trials provide evidence about the effects of healthcare interventions. However, trial results can be undermined by flaws in design, conduct, analyses and selective reporting. Therefore, assessments of risk of bias in results of the included randomized trials are mandatory in Cochrane systematic reviews. The revised risk of bias tool (RoB 2), published in 2019, is the recommended method for doing this. Objectives: To explain the key concepts that underpin RoB 2 and gain experience in using it to assess risk of bias in randomized trials. Description: We will present, implement and discuss the key features of RoB 2: specification of the result to be assessed and sources of information used; specification of the effect of interest (that of assignment to intervention, or adhering to intervention); five consolidated bias domains; signalling questions that lead to algorithm-guided risk of bias judgements within bias domains; and derivation of an overall risk of bias judgement for the assessed result. We will explore the five bias domains included within RoB 2: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in the measurement of the outcome and bias in the selection of the reported result. A worked example will be used to provide hands-on training and facilitate discussion. Participants will have the option to complete their assessments in a semi-automated Excel template and are encouraged to bring their own portable device to access detailed guidance that is available at www.riskofbias.info. Please note that the facilitators are unable to provide printed copies of the materials. [Break](/colloquium-2023/session/1624007/break) [Cochrane Lecture / Closing Plenary](/colloquium-2023/session/1452910/cochrane-lecture-closing-plenary) Forward together for trusted evidence Given the ever-growing potential for misinformation and disinformation in an interconnected world, the need for trusted evidence has never been greater. As we navigate a post-COVID-19 pandemic world, evolving data and technological opportunities, and the reality of change, ensuring that the evidence that informs health and care decisions is timely, trusted and relevant will be an ongoing challenge. This Cochrane Lecture explores a framework for sustaining and promoting trusted evidence that not only withstands scrutiny but actively guides informed decision-making by addressing emerging needs through a continuous feedback loop between evidence producers and users. The lecture will emphasise the importance of the interlinked pillars of relevance, equity, integrity, transparency, and rigour underpinned by collaboration between stakeholders and researchers as we journey forward together embracing diverse perspectives, experience and expertise to co-produce and deliver evidence that is not only trusted but makes a difference for patients and the public globally. Cochrane's annual prizes and awards will be presented at the end of the session. |11:05 AM - 11:15 AM| Background: There is increasing concern that a significant proportion of randomised trials included in Cochrane reviews may not be trustworthy. Applying a Trustworthiness Screening Tool (TST) has already had a clinically important effect on several reviews published by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Objectives: We wanted to assess the impact of removing untrustworthy randomised trials from already published Cochrane reviews on a defined clinical area (nutritional interventions during antenatal and postnatal period). Methods: We applied the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth TST to 375 randomised trials included in 18 Cochrane reviews. The TST has five domains (is the research governance trustworthy; are the baseline characteristics trustworthy; is the study feasible; are the results plausible; and is all relevant information available?). When additional information was needed, authors were contacted using a standard template. At least two attempts were made to contact the authors. At the end of the evaluation process, each study was classified as i) included (YES to all domains); ii) excluded (retracted study); or iii) awaiting classification (any NO to the TST questions). Results: 95/375 studies (25%) were removed, affecting 14/18 (78%) reviews. 13/18 reviews (72%) showed a difference in the Summary of Findings tables (direction and size of effects and/or GRADE ratings). 6/18 Cochrane reviews (33%) were judged to require updating because of important differences in their conclusions, implication for practice, and/or implication for research. Conclusions: Formal assessment of trustworthiness and inclusion only of studies that satisfy prespecified criteria for trustworthiness affects conclusions in a relatively large number of Cochrane reviews, with potentially important clinical implications for practice and research. The lack of consensus regarding the best tool(s) for assessing trustworthiness cannot be an excuse for ignoring this issue in future Cochrane reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: N/A. Statement on relevance and importance to patients: Our work found that removal of studies that did not fulfil prespecified trustworthiness criteria affected the conclusions of a third of the Cochrane reviews that we assessed. [Can we use GRADE to create new diagnostic criteria for a condition? An application of GRADE principles for establishing diagnostic criteria for a disease](/colloquium-2023/session/1473520/can-we-use-grade-to-create-new-diagnostic-criteria-for-a-condition-an-application-of-grade-principles-for-establishing-diagnostic-criteria-for-a-disease) Background: Although it is critical to consider downstream consequences of changing disease definitions and to avoid the perils of overdiagnosis, disease definitions and diagnostic criteria are sometimes required to be developed, modified, or updated. In 2021, a group in Australia was tasked with updating the guideline for the diagnosis and assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. However, there is currently no universally agreed approach to developing diagnostic criteria or assessment guidelines. Objectives: Our aim was to ensure that any new criteria or definitions proposed by our guideline group were as transparent as possible and supported by a rigorous development process. In line with best practice in guideline development, we aimed to use GRADE to assist with our guideline. However, there was no specific GRADE guidance currently for this type of guideline. Methods: We used a novel application of the GRADE approach to inform the development of our guideline. Firstly, to determine potential diagnostic criteria for FASD, we performed a range of systematic reviews using the GRADE for establishing certainty in prognostic factors to determine the association between particular exposures and outcomes with FASD. We then used adapted evidence to decision frameworks (EtDF) to make a recommendation regarding whether a particular diagnostic criteria should be considered in our final set of criteria. Following this, we created an overarching EtDF for our proposed diagnostic criteria for FASD. Results and Conclusion: Our proposed revised definition, criteria, and assessment guidelines for FASD are informed by rigorous systematic reviews and a transparent decision-making process. We believe these methods may be suitable for adoption or adaptation for other groups creating diagnostic criteria and revising disease definitions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Extensive engagement with people with FASD and their caregivers occurred during this project. [Operationalising decolonisation in systematic reviews: can current tools help to mitigate for bias?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473557/operationalising-decolonisation-in-systematic-reviews-can-current-tools-help-to-mitigate-for-bias) Background: Decolonisation of research methods refers to the undoing of colonial ideologies within academic thinking and broadening critical and theoretical positions within methodological approaches to address power imbalances and inherent biases. Trust in systematic reviews is underpinned by transparency, rigour, and objectivity at all stages of the review process. Frameworks, such as GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) and GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research), aim to improve transparency surrounding certainty or confidence in the evidence. A key element of these tools is to assess the overall directness or relevance of the synthesis findings to examine whether they offer a 'restricted' answer to the review question because of the populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes studied. Application of GRADE and CerQual could therefore be used to identify underrepresentation of important ethnic groups or marginalised populations in research. Objectives: To explore how GRADE and GRADE-CERQual could be employed to support decolonisation of systematic reviews. Methods: An exploration of how systematic reviews on issues known to disproportionately affect certain ethnic groups could use GRADE and CERQual to support interpretation of the evidence and decolonisation of research. We use case examples of reviews on conditions known to disproportionately affect people of African, African-Caribbean, and South-Asian descent, such as diabetes, to illustrate how reviewers might consider the directness of the evidence to those groups. Conclusions: Systematic review teams should routinely consider the potential for underrepresentation of important or marginalised ethnic groups as a restricting factor when applying the 'directness' dimension of GRADE or the 'relevance' dimension of CERQual. Review teams should consider providing equity statements in their summary of findings table to mitigate issues of colonial bias in research and to reduce the risk of perpetuating underrepresentation of marginalised populations. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No specific patient or healthcare consumer involvement was sought for this abstract because of the theoretical nature of the work. However, the authors both value and advocate for diverse stakeholder involvement in the systematic review process. [Evidence gap maps: a visual tool for promoting evidence and monitoring gaps in research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473493/evidence-gap-maps-a-visual-tool-for-promoting-evidence-and-monitoring-gaps-in-research) Background: Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) are visual tools that present the available evidence on different thematic areas and highlight gaps for future research. EGMs, constructed by international Non-governmental Organisation Sightsavers, summarize, appraise, and present evidence from systematic or literature reviews across different eye health conditions, including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and trachoma. Updating an EGM periodically allows us to monitor changes to the extent and quality of the evidence base and to refine the focus for future research. This presentation will focus on the methods used to develop and update the EGMs and discuss their potential in promoting rigorous, high-quality research and countering misinformation. Methods: After conducting a comprehensive literature search, we sift and extract data from all relevant reviews. Critical appraisal is conducted independently using the Supported Use of Research Evidence checklist, allowing us to attribute a confidence level of low, medium, or high to the review. We assessed the strength of evidence of the effect of each review. If the review reaches a conclusive answer to their research question using the available evidence, the evidence is classified as strong. If they were unable to answer the question because of insufficient evidence, the evidence is classified as weak. Otherwise, the evidence is inconclusive. Each review is displayed in a matrix where the columns show thematic areas relevant to the eye health condition, labelled as sectors and subsectors, and the rows show the strength of evidence. Updates are conducted in the same way as the original EGMs. Changes to the evidence base were assessed by comparing the numbers and percentages of included reviews across a number of areas, including the thematic focus, geographic representation, strength of evidence of effect, and methodological quality. Conclusion and patient and healthcare consumer involvement: EGMs allow policymakers and clinicians to plan their interventions based on the most up-to-date knowledge and high-quality research, which helps ensure that patients receive the best possible care. Updating the EGMs periodically allows researchers to monitor changes in the extent and quality of systematic review evidence and to prioritise future work to improve the evidence base and to close evidence gaps. [Unravelling active ingredients of task-shifting interventions in low-resource settings for common mental disorders: developing a taxonomy of intervention components and ranking their efficacy.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473435/unravelling-active-ingredients-of-task-shifting-interventions-in-low-resource-settings-for-common-mental-disorders-developing-a-taxonomy-of-intervention-components-and-ranking-their-efficacy.) Background: The global burden associated with common mental disorders is high, especially for people living in low resource settings. Although psychosocial interventions delivered by locally available lay or community health workers are effective, mechanisms of intervention response are poorly understood. One of the greatest barriers is that psychosocial interventions are administered as complex, multi-component \"packages of care\". Objectives: Our aim is to systematically review all the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have tested the efficacy of psychosocial interventions delivered through the task shifting modality to treat people suffering from common mental disorders (depression, anxiety, and related somatic complaints) in low resource settings, dismantle the intervention protocols creating a taxonomy of active intervention components, and reevaluate their efficacy. Methods: We will use the component network meta-analysis (cNMA) methodology. The major benefit of cNMA is the possibility to disentangle intervention components and explore their effectiveness separately or in various combinations (even in disconnected networks). cNMA increases statistical power by combining direct and indirect comparisons while fully respecting the randomized structure of the evidence. According to the additive cNMA model which we will implement, adding a component \"c\" to a composite intervention \"X\" will lead to an increase (or decrease) of the effect size by an amount only dependent on \"c\", and not on \"X\". We will denote the corresponding component specific incremental standard mean difference (iSMD) so that iSMDc = SMD(X+c) v. (X). Combining these component-specific iSMDs will allow the estimation of SMD between any two composite interventions. Results: A network of comparisons and a hierarchy that includes all intervention components expressed as iSMD, indicating the added benefit of adding a component to an intervention, will be presented. By selecting the most effective components it will be possible to outline a novel task shifting psychosocial intervention to be tested in future RCTs. Conclusions: These findings will set the basis for further investigations in the field of precision medicine. This project is funded by the European Union's HORIZON EUROPE research programme under grant agreement No 101061648 and is prioritized by Cochrane Global Mental Health. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: not applicable. [Prospective trial registration in the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473765/prospective-trial-registration-in-the-research-integrity-assessment-ria-of-randomized-controlled-trials-rcts) Background: The WHO and the Declaration of Helsinki require that every clinical study must be prospectively registered in a publicly accessible study registry (i.e., registration before enrolling the first patient). However, most evidence syntheses ignore violations of this fundamental moral and ethical principle. The Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) (doi:10.1002/jrsm.1599), a tool to assess adherence of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, and key elements of research integrity in clinical trials, assesses prospective registration and may help evidence synthesis authors to deal with studies which do not comply with the requirements. RIA was piloted in the updated Cochrane review \"Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19\" revealing that lack of prospective registration was the most frequent reason for the exclusion of studies according to RIA. Objectives: To evaluate trial registration in RCTs included in the study pool of COVID-19 systematic reviews (SRs) on interventional drugs and to analyse the impact with the application of RIA. Methods: We searched for SRs investigating at least 1 of 13 different interventions for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 in Medline/PubMed until 09 June 2022. We selected Cochrane and non-Cochrane SRs with the largest RCT pool, extracted all included RCTs, evaluated trial registration data, and applied the RIA domain 2 (prospective trial registration) to all RCTs. RIA was independently applied by two reviewers; conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: We identified 188 RCTs for RIA domain 2 assessment. Twelve RCTs were not registered and 176 RCTs were registered in at least 1 of 10 clinical trial registries. Using RIA, we assessed 109 prospectively registered RCTs as 'no concern, 51 non- or retrospectively registered RCTs as 'exclude, and 28 RCTs with inconsistent information between publication and registry record, missing information, inaccessible registry record, or no publication as 'awaiting classification (Table 1). Conclusion: Almost one in three studies on interventional treatments for COVID-19 has not complied with the international standard of prospective trial registration. Authors of evidence synthesis can use the RIA tool as a transparent mechanism to manage studies that do not adhere to the international standard. Patient and/or public involvement: none. [Impact of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) on conclusions of dentistry systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473875/impact-of-grading-of-recommendations-assessment-development-and-evaluation-grade-on-conclusions-of-dentistry-systematic-reviews) Background: The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach assesses certainty of evidence (CoE) in a systematic review (SR) and facilitates drawing appropriate conclusions that consider limitations of the evidence. However, GRADE is not widely used in dentistry SRs. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of using GRADE on conclusions in dentistry SRs. Methods: From a sample of 200 dentistry SRs of randomized controlled trials included in a larger methodological study, we selected a subsample based on the most frequently reported outcomes. We will use the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval to determine whether SRs not using GRADE are more likely to formulate inappropriate conclusions (i.e, conclusions relying on statistical significance, not considering limitations or formulating recommendations). For SRs not using GRADE, we will compare conclusions made by authors to conclusions we made based on our own GRADE assessments using the same effect thresholds as SR authors. We will calculate the number of conclusions that changed with respect to the described certainty (i.e., the extent to which authors recognized uncertainty, analogous to high, moderate, low, or very low CoE in GRADE) and magnitude of effect (i.e., whether the conclusions state there was a presence or absence of effect, negligible or important effect) after utilizing GRADE. Results: We present the results of a subsample of 19 SRs reporting the outcome of pain. Six (32%) used GRADE, and 13 (68%) did not. Two SRs formulated inappropriate conclusions; both did not use GRADE. For SRs without GRADE, our GRADE assessments changed 62% of conclusions with respect to the described CoE. Our GRADE assessments changed the described magnitude in 25% of conclusions. We will present results for additional outcomes currently under analysis. Conclusions: After completing all analyses, our conclusions will focus on the influence of GRADE on formulating appropriate conclusions which will provide insight into potential limitations that may arise when SRs formulate conclusions without GRADE assessments. Developing more transparent SR conclusions is relevant to patients as SRs are a valuable source of evidence for decision-makers. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients were not involved. [Missing and masked: equity in a systematic review of remote interventions for substance misuse.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473584/missing-and-masked-equity-in-a-systematic-review-of-remote-interventions-for-substance-misuse.) Background: To reduce inequity, knowing whether interventions 'work' is not enough; we also need to know whether vulnerable subgroups experience them differently. However, vulnerable groups may not have equal opportunity to participate in research and, hence, may be underrepresented or missing entirely. Unless study findings are reported by subgroup, any differences among those included will be masked. Objectives: As part of a systematic review (SR) exploring the effectiveness of remote therapies for drug/alcohol misuse, we undertook equity-related work with the objectives of understanding (1) who was excluded from the research, (2) who was represented in the study populations and (3) whether sub-groups experienced outcomes differently. Methods: For each included primary study we assessed (1) the exclusion criteria; 2) the sociodemographic characteristics reported using the PROGRESS-plus framework; and (3) whether substance use outcomes were reported by equity-relevant characteristics and, if so, whether there was any variation. Results: A total of 52 studies were included in the review, of which 47 had eligibility criteria with the potential to result in the exclusion of vulnerable subgroups, most notably those with mental health conditions (MHCs) and those without access to digital technology. Few studies justified the exclusions or reported how many people were excluded based on each criterion. Sociodemographic characteristics of the study populations were reported for all studies, although what the characteristics were and how they were measured varied. Most commonly and consistently reported were gender, age and ethnicity but it was rare that the study outcomes were reported by these or other factors. Conclusions: The exclusion of certain vulnerable subgroups from the research process and the lack of reporting of outcomes by potential axes of inequalities have important implications for the interpretation and generalizability of findings of SRs. Particularly troubling in our review was the frequency with which those with MHCs were excluded. Understanding how different groups experience interventions is key to allow practitioners to be able to make informed decisions about their adoption in specific vulnerable groups and to ensure that interventions do not inadvertently produce, or exacerbate, inequities. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: An advisory group from policy and practice inputted to all aspects of the SR. [Mapping the Maps: Methods and Uses of Evidence and Gap Maps.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473885/mapping-the-maps-methods-and-uses-of-evidence-and-gap-maps.) Background: Evidence and Gap Maps (EGMs) sit within a family of evidence synthesis methods that seek to address broader research questions. EGMs are a valuable tool in which a wider understanding is needed of existing research in a topic area and locating evidence gaps. They do not synthesise existing evidence, but by locating, categorizing, coding, and presenting the evidence in an interactive web based tool, with links to the primary research, they offer a valuable visualisation of existing evidence. Their popularity is growing, and they are particularly valued by policy makers. Objectives: We undertook a scoping review to address the following questions: 1) What methods are currently used in their development and updating; 2) to what extent do they adhere to recommended guidance; 3) what procedures are in place for updating and maintaining EGMs; and 4) what methods are in place to evaluate the use of web based EGMs. Methods: We developed a search strategy that included websites as well as database searches. We contacted hosting organisations to locate published EGMs. We used a piloted data extraction table to gather data. We only included EGMs with public facing online maps. We also retrieved any linked or supporting documentation. Results: We included 96 EGMs addressing a wide range of topics, though they were predominantly in the field of international development, social care, and public health. Their potential in health care is currently less well realised. Approximately 43% did not undertake critical appraisal of the evidence. More than half of the EGMs were not linked to a description of their methodology or information that described the search dates or plans to update the map. Conclusions: EGMs are an increasingly adopted approach in evidence synthesis and valued by policy makers. They are valuable tools for visualising evidence and highlighting gaps. Yet the guidance for their development is limited, and there is little standardisation in the processes of linking maps to the methods underpinning them. EGM processes must be more transparent and rigorous. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Extensive consultation with the public on views on EGMs [An assessment of the design-by-treatment interaction model for network meta-analysis inconsistency](/colloquium-2023/session/1473745/an-assessment-of-the-design-by-treatment-interaction-model-for-network-meta-analysis-inconsistency) Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a powerful method that simultaneously synthesizes evidence from studies addressing the same clinical question comparing multiple interventions. The method allows inferences based on direct and indirect comparisons in a network. However, NMA results are reliable only when the prerequisite assumptions are met. Of interest, the consistency assumption requires that direct and indirect evidence in a network is in agreement. The design-by-treatment (DBT) interaction model is considered the best method to date; however, its statistical properties have not been well studied for complex networks. Objectives: To assess the Type I error and Power of the inconsistency estimator from the DBT interaction model in triangular networks with arms denoted A, B, and C. Methods: A simulation study in which, over 10,000 repeated iterations, we will simulate network meta-analysis data over a range of scenarios, fit frequentist, random-effect network meta-analysis models, and estimate the inconsistency of the network using the DBT model. From the 10,000 iterations, we estimate the estimator's Power and Type I error based on the observed p-values. We consider varying values for the true odds ratio for the AB- (i.e., 0.65, 1.2, and 1.4) and AC-comparison (0.75, 1, and 1.4), inconsistency factor (0, 0.3, and 1), and number of studies between comparisons (1, 2, 5, and 10). Preliminary Results: The power of the inconsistency test ranged from approximately 0.5 to 0.75, depending on the simulation scenario. Furthermore, the Type I error of the test ranged from approximately 0.4 to 0.45. Preliminary results indicate that the main driver of Power and Type I error is the assumed inconsistency factor in the data-generating mechanism. Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that the DBT inconsistency estimator suffers from a high Type I error and lacks sufficient Power to reliably detect inconsistency in a network. This suggests that further methodological work in assessing network inconsistency may be necessary so that NMAs used in informing decision-making are trustworthy. We intend to expand the simulations in our study to reflect other types of networks observed in practice (e.g., different geometries). Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients were not involved at this stage of the project. [The implementation of policy to manage potentially problematic studies in Cochrane review updates - a meta-epidemiological study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473554/the-implementation-of-policy-to-manage-potentially-problematic-studies-in-cochrane-review-updates---a-meta-epidemiological-study) Background: Cochrane reviews are regularly updated to reflect the most up-to-date evidence on health interventions. In 2021, Cochrane introduced a new policy to manage potentially problematic studies that are eligible for inclusion in a Cochrane review. This includes the management of studies with retractions, expressions of concern, and concerns about the trustworthiness of the data. It remains unclear how well such a policy is implemented for published Cochrane review updates. Objectives: To provide an overview of the frequency of problematic studies included in Cochrane reviews and whether they have been excluded in Cochrane review updates according to Cochrane's new policy. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify intervention review updates published in 2022 and their previous version. We compared these two versions to identify studies that were included in the previous version and excluded in the 2022 update. We also identified retracted studies that were included in the previous version by searching the Retraction Watch Database and assessed whether these were excluded from the updated version. Additionally, we recorded whether and how Cochrane's new policy was implemented in the updates. Results: We identified 123 pairs of Cochrane reviews from 37 Cochrane groups. The previous version of these reviews was published between 1996 and 2021, with a median of six included studies and 607 participants. There were 16 (13%) reviews with at least one previously included study excluded in the 2022 updates, including 4 (3%) excluding at least one (median 4, range 1-54) potentially problematic study. The previous version of two (2%) reviews included at least one retracted study, and one (1%) review did not exclude them in the 2022 update. Sixteen (13%) updates clearly specified the methods to assess and/or handle problematic studies, including 4 (3%) using a trustworthiness assessment tool and 12 (10%) mentioning the handling of retracted studies. Conclusions: To facilitate the production of trustworthy evidence, it is imperative to identify and appropriately manage problematic studies eligible for Cochrane reviews. This study reflects the suboptimal implementation of Cochrane's new research integrity policy in review updates, suggesting further guidance is needed. [Challenges and potential solutions for reporting findings from multicomponent meta-regression models in GRADE summary of findings tables](/colloquium-2023/session/1473876/challenges-and-potential-solutions-for-reporting-findings-from-multicomponent-meta-regression-models-in-grade-summary-of-findings-tables) Background: We recently completed a Cochrane review of diabetes quality improvement (QI) trials that aimed to identify promising QI strategies (or combinations of strategies) to deploy in practice or examine in future research. We coded interventions according to the presence of absence of 12 QI strategies and assessed the association between intervention components and postintervention outcomes with Bayesian meta-regressions. This is atypical for a Cochrane review\u2014our analysis and output do not match the usual Cochrane processes\u2014and thus necessitated adjustments in our reporting of results to align with Cochrane procedures. Methods: We will describe the misalignment between the goals and outputs of our analysis with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach for producing Cochrane Summary of Findings (SoF) tables and our operationalizations and solutions. Results: The standard approach for producing an SoF table is to have a table for each intervention of interest. This was not feasible in our review, as studied interventions were diverse and rarely replicated and did not capture the full range of possible interventions that could comprise combinations of the 12 QI strategies. Most importantly, the standard SoF table was inconsistent with the goal of our analyses, which was learn across (diverse combinations of QI strategy) interventions to develop a theory of which QI strategies (or combinations) of strategies may be most promising for future practice or research. We therefore adjusted GRADE tables to report findings as they pertained to each QI strategy for each outcome. Additionally, we parsed data to inform GRADE assessments for each component (e.g., sample size, risk of bias, precision, consistency and directness) to rate certainty of evidence. Discussion: GRADE is a transparent tool for communicating review findings. Although the goal of our analyses did not match the standard setup of GRADE SoF tables, we found it feasible to adapt SoF tables to better align with our synthesis objective. Further GRADE guidance may be required to help guide future and ongoing similar reviews aimed at teasing apart active ingredients of interventions, rather than interventions as a whole. [How well do we consider equity in efficiency analysis studies of vaccines? A systematic review of equity-informative economic evaluations of vaccines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473514/how-well-do-we-consider-equity-in-efficiency-analysis-studies-of-vaccines-a-systematic-review-of-equity-informative-economic-evaluations-of-vaccines) Background: The Immunization Agenda 2030 prioritizes the populations without access to vaccines. Health equity has been increasingly incorporated into economic evaluations of vaccines to foster equitable access. Robust and standardized methods are needed to evaluate health equity impact of vaccination programs to ensure monitoring and effective addressing of inequities. However, methods currently vary and potentially affect the application of findings to inform policy decision-making. Objectives: To identify and summarize economic evaluations of the health equity impact of vaccines and immunization programs, focusing on the methods and applications. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Econlit, and CEA Registry up to December 15, 2022. We included articles that met the following eligibility criteria: full-text articles of economic evaluations estimating costs, outcomes, and health equity impact of vaccines across equity-relevant subgroups in any context. We summarized how health equity was incorporated and evaluated in the selected studies. We performed reporting quality assessment using the Consolidated Health Economic Reporting Standard (CHEERS) 2022 statement. Results: Twenty-one studies were included that performed health equity impact analysis to estimate the distributional impact of vaccines, such as deaths averted and financial risk protection, across equity-relevant subgroups. Eleven studies performed only health equity impact analysis as part of cost-effectiveness analyses to estimate the distributional impact and subpopulation incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of vaccines. Nine studies are Extended Cost-Effectiveness Analyses (ECEAs) that performed health equity impact analysis of vaccines with an estimation of the distributional financial risk protection. One study is a Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (DCEA) that performed a health equity impact analysis of vaccines incorporating equity-weighting and opportunity costs as the money was displaced to be spent on vaccines instead of other health services. These studies showed similar findings that introducing vaccines or improving vaccination coverage resulted in fewer deaths and higher financial risk benefits in subpopulations with higher disease burdens and lower vaccination coverage, particularly poorer income groups and those living in rural areas. Conclusions: Methods to incorporate equity have been evolving progressively. Vaccination programs can enhance equity if their design and implementation address existing inequities in order to provide equitable vaccination coverage and achieve health equity. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Mapping Reviews, Scoping Reviews and Evidence and Gap Maps (EGMs) - Same but Different. The 'Big Picture' Review Family](/colloquium-2023/session/1473895/mapping-reviews-scoping-reviews-and-evidence-and-gap-maps-egms---same-but-different.-the-'big-picture'-review-family) Background: Scoping reviews, mapping reviews and evidence and gap maps (EGMs) are evidence synthesis methodologies that address broad research questions, aiming to describe a bigger picture rather than address a specific question about intervention effectiveness. They are being increasingly used to support a range of purposes including guiding research priorities and decision-making. There is, however, a confusing array of terminology used to describe these different approaches. Objectives: In this commentary we aim to describe where there are differences in terminology and where this equates to differences in meaning. We demonstrate the different theoretical routes that underpin these differences. We suggest ways in which the approaches of scoping and mapping reviews may differ in order to guide consistency in reporting and method. Methods: We undertook a critical analysis of the methods and cited methods used in published scoping, mapping and EGM reviews and guidance. Results: Scoping reviews, mapping reviews and evidence maps are terms that are not used consistently within the literature, with different terms used to describe similar approaches and review objectives and sometimes the same term is used to describe different approaches. We show the scientific traditions that have shaped these approaches. Scoping reviews tend to have a more focused question and data extraction and analysis is richer than in mapping reviews and EGMs. EGMs have a unique place within the range of evidence synthesis approaches for greater transparency in identifying gaps in the evidence. EGMs are visual and interactive web-based tools. We propose that mapping and scoping reviews and EGMs have similarities that unite them as a group but with their unique differences. The accompanying graphic summarises these differences (Figure 1). Conclusions: Understanding these similarities and differences is important for informing the development of methods used to undertake and report these types of evidence synthesis. We hope this work will help to improve consistency in description and reporting. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Using arm-based network meta-analysis for binary outcomes for generalizability of findings across baseline risk values](/colloquium-2023/session/1473706/using-arm-based-network-meta-analysis-for-binary-outcomes-for-generalizability-of-findings-across-baseline-risk-values) Background: Differences in baseline risk (BR) across studies may be a source of heterogeneity in meta-analysis (1; see attachment for a full list of references); thus, generalizability of findings across subgroups of patients requires constancy of treatment effects across BRs (2). In the case of risk ratio (RR), its independence from BR cannot hold due to its range limitations (2). Odds ratio (OR), instead, is theoretically independent from BR (3), but this property may not hold in practice (4). Moreover, in the specific case of using OR in network meta-analysis (NMA), even factors affecting baseline risk but not conditional effect may lead to inconsistency (5). Thus, regardless of the outcome measure adopted, in the case of binary outcomes, treatment effects should be considered as likely dependent from BR. Objectives: To suggest a method making results from NMA for binary outcomes more reliable and generalizable, by expressing their dependence on BR, to equip clinicians and patients with better predictions of potential outcomes for each treatment option. Methods: The arm-based (AB) model from (6) estimates log-odds of risks for each treatment arm by allowing both for dependence between baseline risk and treatment effect and for random effects (guaranteeing evaluation of heterogeneity and inconsistency). After estimating the logit of the probability of baseline risk and treatment effect, marginal treatment and BRs can be derived and marginal estimates of the desired effect size calculated (4). Results: We will present an example of use of the AB model from (6) with a dichotomous outcome, showing pitfalls of the comparison-based approach using both OR and RR as outcome measures. Conclusions: The never-ending debate about whether OR or RR should be used as an effect measure seems to be focused lately on 'portability', i.e., on their possible independence from BR (7). Owing to the general implausibility of such assumption in practice for both outcomes, we argue that NMA for binary events should adopt an AB approach, in order to express how results depend on BR, regardless of the outcome measure adopted. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patient, public or healthcare consumer has been involved. [Breaking Ground or Breaking Bad? Examining the Fate of Preprints in Prevention Research with a Mixed Methods Study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473536/breaking-ground-or-breaking-bad-examining-the-fate-of-preprints-in-prevention-research-with-a-mixed-methods-study) Background: The availability of unsound or scientifically invalid work is a concern associated with preprint articles. The popularity of preprints in prevention research has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the consistency of results and conclusions of preprints in prevention research compared to peer-reviewed articles and to explore the perception of key stakeholders regarding the growing number of published preprints. Methods: The study employed a mixed-methods approach that involved the development of a Python-based Web crawler to search MedRxiv for prevention preprints from January 1 to September 30, 2020. We ran an update search one year later to identify which preprints were published. We dually screened all results for prevention articles and developed a scheme to classify changes in effect sizes and conclusions. We also conducted and analyzed 19 qualitative online interviews with stakeholders who have expertise in prevention. Results: The WebCrawler retrieved a total of 2,238 preprints, of which 594 were prevention research studies and 329 were epidemiological studies. Nearly half of these studies (48.9%) were published in peer-reviewed journals within one year, with a median time from upload to publication of 5.3 months (range: -0.1 to 11.3 months). Among published preprints, 16.8% of articles showed a change in effect size, which was a major change in 4.4% articles (i.e., a change greater than 25% of the original effect size). The conclusions changed in 43% of the studies, mostly in terms of style or wording (39%). Stakeholders perceive that preprints have advantages over peer-reviewed articles, including free access, fast submission, transparency, and feedback from colleagues. However, they also feel that preprints are not compatible with current quality standards and feedback culture and may have a detrimental effect on publication and career. Conclusion: A few prevention research articles experience changes in effect estimates and conclusions when they are published. Although these changes are small in number, they affect one in every 23 articles. Although preprints may seem like an attractive publishing option, there is still skepticism about their quality and potential consequences. We therefore warrant caution of using preprints of prevention research in decision-making. [India covid guidelines- a living synthesis and guideline process](/colloquium-2023/session/1473777/india-covid-guidelines-a-living-synthesis-and-guideline-process) Background: COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact worldwide on health, healthcare, societies, and economies. Evidence for interventions emerged rapidly but was difficult to examine systematically in a short span of time. Few guidelines used formal evidence synthesis and GRADE approaches, particularly when tailoring to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To address this gap, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India, partnered with the Clinical Infectious Diseases Society of India (CIDS), Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, Prof BV Moses Center for evidence-informed healthcare, and experts from 16 institutions in India and globally to form The Covid Management Guidelines India Group. Objectives: To produce guidelines for the management of patients with acute COVID-19 in secondary and tertiary care settings in India. Methods: The process incorporated GRADE and Cochrane Rapid Review approaches to identify and prioritise questions in areas of equipoise, screen and extract data from available studies, synthesise and determine certainty in the evidence, and enable expert working groups to produce recommendations or best practice statements tailored for India and other LMICs using the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework, which was all disseminated on a widely accessible platform: https://indiacovidguidelines.org. Results: In the course of the project, clinicians across the country were trained in the development of guidelines using formal evidence synthesis and the GRADE approach. The guideline group comprising core, steering, methodology, evidence synthesis, dissemination, and intervention expert working groups with clearly defined roles and responsibilities synthesised guidelines pertaining to the use of interventions used in the treatment of COVID-19, including antivirals, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulation, antibodies, respiratory support, and other supportive management. Although acceptability and applicability of the guidelines is being investigated formally through a survey, one example of impact is that one state (Kerala, India) adopted our recommendation on anticoagulation in the state's COVID-19 guidelines. An external advisory panel ensured scientific challenge and applicability to settings outside of those in which the experts practice. Conclusions: This unique partnership applied a transparent GRADE approach to ensuring scientific rigor and an evidence-based approach taking into account local contextual factors in making clear timely guidelines relevant to India. [Methods used in systematic reviews to conceptualise dimensions of health equity impacts of public health interventions: umbrella review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473480/methods-used-in-systematic-reviews-to-conceptualise-dimensions-of-health-equity-impacts-of-public-health-interventions-umbrella-review) Background: Systematic reviews of interventions often fail to adequately consider equity. This impairs their ability to inform policy and practice decisions that aim to account for differential impacts. Central to this issue is how the dimensions of equity impacts (e.g., socioeconomic status) are conceptualised, as this shapes how equity is treated in the conduct and reporting of reviews. Objectives: To describe the methods and frameworks (e.g., PROGRESS-Plus) used in systematic reviews to conceptualise the dimensions of equity impacts of public health interventions and issues encountered in their application. This complements a Cochrane review (Welch 2022) that surveyed the descriptive and analytic methods used to investigate health equity via PROGRESS-Plus. Methods: Umbrella review of systematic reviews that include a focus on equity impacts of public health interventions. We used electronic database searches supplemented with automated searches of the OpenAlex dataset. An active learning algorithm was used to prioritise title-abstract records for manual screening. We extracted data from a purposively selected sample of reviews. Results: We manually screened 2,060 prioritised title-abstract records, from which 322 full-text reports were assessed. We included 120 reports of systematic reviews. PROGRESS-Plus was the only formal method used for conceptualising dimensions of equity impacts, although most reviews that did not use it used equivalent dimensions (68/75 (91%)). Where intended methods were unable to be applied fully, this was usually because primary research studies did not report the necessary information (55/68 (81%)). Most reviews (87/120 (73%)) included an explicit rationale for focusing on equity impacts in general, but only 7% (8/120) justified their focus on (or exclusion of) specific dimensions. Authors highlighted challenges with applying these methods, including investigating constructs, such as socioeconomic status, that lack standardised operationalisation and measurement. Conclusions: PROGRESS-Plus is the predominant method for conceptualising dimensions of equity impacts of public health interventions and mostly appears to be sufficiently comprehensive to encompass the scope of such investigations. However, significant practical and conceptual challenges need to be addressed if reviews assessing these impacts are to more meaningfully contribute to cumulative and useful evidence bases. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None, but can contribute to more robust evidence production. [A digital map of systematic reviews on non-pharmacological interventions to inform policy making in infectious disease control](/colloquium-2023/session/1473494/a-digital-map-of-systematic-reviews-on-non-pharmacological-interventions-to-inform-policy-making-in-infectious-disease-control) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic accentuated the need for comprehensive evidence synthesis to guide decisions regarding infection disease control and preparedness. In Sweden, an investigator was tasked by the government with reviewing the Infection Control Act and analyzing the need for new regulations for future pandemics, with special considerations to measures that were effective during the COVID-19 pandemic. Against this background, SBU was requested to provide support to the investigator. Objectives: To facilitate policymaking by conducting an overview of systematic reviews of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) and present the results in an interactive, user-friendly format. Methods: A PICO was formulated comprising 10 NPIs used to prevent the spread of infections during outbreaks of COVID-19, SARS, MERS, Influenza and Ebola. A structured literature search for systematic reviews was conducted in Medline and Scopus. Eligible reviews were assessed for risk of bias using the AMSTAR checklist. The reviews were mapped according to risk of bias level and type of interventions and infections targeted and incorporated in a digital map. Results: Seventy-eight systematic reviews were identified and included in the map. Of those, 43 were assessed as having high risk of bias and 35 as having low to moderate risk of bias. Most reviews focused on the effectiveness of various physical distance interventions or the effectiveness of facemasks. The vast majority of reviews and primary studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital map facilitated navigation among the reviews and was used to support the legislative process. Conclusions: Digital maps may be a useful tool to present and visualize available evidence and evidence gaps in an intuitive and interactive format that facilitates navigation. They can aid decision-making in complex fields such as public health measures, where it is challenging but important to identify and take into account the best available evidence of potential benefits and harms. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [A novel modeling approach for producing treatment hierarchies in network meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473556/a-novel-modeling-approach-for-producing-treatment-hierarchies-in-network-meta-analysis) Background: Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows synthesising the evidence simultaneously on multiple treatments. A key output of NMA is the relative ranking of the treatments; nevertheless, it has attracted a lot of criticism. This is mainly because ranking is a very influential output and, thus, prone to over-interpretations even when relative effects imply small differences between the alternative treatments. To date, common ranking methods rely on score metrics which are calculated based on the summary effects. Such metrics lack a straightforward interpretation, although it is still unclear how to measure their uncertainty. Objectives: To introduce a new modelling approach for networks of interventions that produces treatment hierarchies accounting for the clinical importance of the study-specific relative effects as well as for their uncertainty. Methods: We adapt methodology previously suggested for ranking in sports tournaments into the context of NMA. We use extensions of the so called 'Bradley-Terry' models, which are a family of probabilistic models that aim to predict the outcome of pairwise comparisons. We first translate the study-specific relative effects and their confidence intervals into wins, losses, and ties based on predefined minimally clinically important differences between treatments. Then, based on the number of wins, our model estimates the 'worth' of each treatment which is used as an intuitive measure to rank the treatments. This approach naturally captures the uncertainty of ranking because the estimates of treatment worth are accompanied by confidence intervals. The model also allows to consider simultaneously multiple outcomes in ranking by implementing a vector of several contrasts for each outcome. Finally, study precision and other important characteristics, such as risk of bias, can be incorporated by an additional parameter that represents the 'importance' of each study. Results and Conclusions: We illustrate our model using a Cochrane NMA comparing 7 treatment classes for chronic plaque psoriasis. Our model is able to clearly indicate the two classes with the largest worth but also classes with similar worth. The latter is a major strength of our approach as it preserves from exaggerating unimportant differences between treatments and drawing spurious conclusions. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Comparison of effect estimates between preprints and a meta-epidemiological study of COVID-19 trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473616/comparison-of-effect-estimates-between-preprints-and-peer-reviewed-publications-a-meta-epidemiological-study-of-covid-19-trials) Background: Preprints have emerged as a major source of research communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, questions were raised concerning the reliability of their results. Objectives: To evaluate whether effect estimates differ between preprint and peer-reviewed journal randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Data were derived from the COVID-NMA (covid-nma.com) initiative, a living systematic review of RCTs evaluating preventive interventions, treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. Meta-analyses with at least one preprint and one peer-reviewed journal article evaluating pharmacological treatments vs. standard of care/placebo were included up to July 20, 2022. Predefined COVID-NMA 'critical outcomes' at 28 days were considered. A meta-epidemiological analysis estimated the difference in effect estimates [expressed as the ratio of odds ratio (ROR)] between preprint and peer-reviewed journal RCTs. An ROR of <1 indicated that preprint trials yielded larger effect estimates. Results: Thirty-seven meta-analyses (114 preprints, 70 peer-reviewed journal selected. Twenty-four meta-analyses assessed hospitalized patients (81 RCTs), and 13 assessed outpatients (33 RCTs). The median number of RCTs per meta-analysis was 2 (IQR, 2-4; maximum, 11). The median sample size of RCTs was 199 (IQR, 99-478), 68% were prospectively registered, 67% received industry or mixed funding, 79% were multicentric trials, and 75% had some concerns of overall risk of bias. Overall, there was no significant difference in effect estimates between preprint and peer-reviewed journal trials Post-hoc sensitivity of meta-analyses only two trials (ROR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.51-1.45; I2 = 22.2%; 2= 0.19) CI, 0.84-1.14; I2 = 0.0%; 2= 0.00) found consistent results. Conclusions: No important difference in the treatment effect between preprints and peer-reviewed publications was found, particularly in meta-analyses with at least three trials. Systematic reviewers and meta-analysts should assess preprint inclusion individually, accounting for risk of bias and completeness of reporting. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Peer review is a lengthy process that, during a pandemic, can inadvertently cost lives. Because of the demand for faster access to scientific knowledge, preprints offer a solution, particularly to patients. [Using GRADE-CERQual to assess confidence in findings from qualitative evidence syntheses: how well are review authors applying the approach?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473647/using-grade-cerqual-to-assess-confidence-in-findings-from-qualitative-evidence-syntheses-how-well-are-review-authors-applying-the-approach) Background: Assessing how much confidence users can place in qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) findings is important for producing trusted qualitative evidence on patients' experiences and perspectives of health issues and interventions. Applying the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in the evidence is a required step in a Cochrane QES. Use of GRADE-CERQual has increased rapidly globally. Objectives: We evaluated how GRADE-CERQual has been used in the literature by, firstly, describing GRADE-CERQual's uptake in QES; and, secondly, developing and applying reporting and fidelity criteria to identify good examples and areas for improvement. Methods: We undertook citation searches in six databases for 18 key publications on the GRADE-CERQual approach and also used keyword searches. Two researchers screened the output, and publications identified as evidence syntheses that used GRADE-CERQual went on to full-text coding and charting. Reporting and fidelity criteria were developed and then applied using NVivo12 software. We used qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistical approaches to analyse the data. Results: Our searches identified 1,312 records. Two hundred thirty-three of these were reviews claiming to have applied GRADE-CERQual. Approximately 41.6% (97 studies) had seriously misapplied the GRADE-CERQual approach and were excluded from further fidelity and reporting assessment. Serious misuses were applying GRADE-CERQual in quantitative evidence synthesis, interpreting it to be a critical appraisal tool, and applying it to review findings as a whole, instead of individual review findings. One hundred thirty-six studies applied it as intended to individual review findings. We categorised the most common reporting issues into three broad areas: labelling, terminology, and completeness. The most common fidelity issues centred on the conceptualisation and application of the four GRADE-CERQual components. Fewer fidelity concerns were identified in syntheses citing the most recent guidance compared to those citing earlier publications. Conceptual challenges were identified around distinguishing between quality and confidence, between themes and review findings, and between making assessments at the study level versus the review finding level. Conclusions: Findings from this evaluation help to inform new agendas for the field of QES, identify topics for further GRADE-CERQual guidance development, and support review authors to avoid common pitfalls and improve reporting and fidelity. [Operationalizing the GRADE-Equity criterion to inform guideline recommendations: Application to a Medical Cannabis guideline](/colloquium-2023/session/1473425/operationalizing-the-grade-equity-criterion-to-inform-guideline-recommendations-application-to-a-medical-cannabis-guideline) Background: Equity is at the forefront of clinical and public health practice and policy. The incorporation of equity in guideline recommendation requires additional considerations for development methodology. The GRADE working group proposed the consideration of equity in several stages of the guideline development process, such as applying an equity lens in the conduct of the evidence syntheses. However, there is no pragmatic guidance on how to collect evidence from systematic reviews to inform equity considerations in guideline recommendations. Objectives: We operationalized the GRADE-Equity criterion for collecting and appraising evidence from primary studies of systematic reviews to inform guideline recommendations. We demonstrated the application of this plan in a clinical practice guideline on prescribing medical cannabis for patients with chronic pain. Methods: We developed the operationalization plan through three steps. First, we reviewed guidance related to guideline development, including the GRADE-Equity series, GRADE evidence to decision (EtD) frameworks. Second, we drafted the operationalization plan using the four signalling questions for the \"impact on health equity\" criterion of the GRADE EtD and refined the draft based on analyses of reported equity considerations in primary studies. Third, we presented the plan to the steering committee of the medical cannabis guideline and developed an evaluation framework to pilot our approach using primary studies identified from systematic reviews of benefits and harms, values, and preferences. Results: We propose the following seven-step operationalization plan: 1) identify populations experiencing inequities, 2) examine available data for specific populations, 3) evaluate population baseline risk for primary outcomes, 4) assess representation of these populations in primary studies, 5) appraise analyses, 6) identify barriers to implementation of effective interventions for these populations, and 7) suggest supportive strategies to facilitate implementation of effective interventions. The evaluation of each study ranged from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the amount of detail provided in the studies. We present examples describing its application to the cannabis guideline. Conclusions: We present a pragmatic approach to inform equity considerations of systematic reviews informing guideline recommendations. The application of this approach in different topics is needed to test its reliability and feasibility. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: no. [Novel methods used when conducting an evidence gap map surrounding interventions for treating obstetric fistula](/colloquium-2023/session/1473577/novel-methods-used-when-conducting-an-evidence-gap-map-surrounding-interventions-for-treating-obstetric-fistula) Background: Evidence gap maps (EGMs) are a novel approach to establishing the breadth and depth of evidence on health. Their visual nature promotes knowledge translation to key stakeholders, including patients, practitioners and policymakers. The methods used to produce EGMs are systematic and rigorous but are open to challenges owing to their emerging nature in the canon of evidence synthesis. These challenges resulted in novel methods used within the production of an EGM surrounding interventions for obstetric fistula. Objectives: To describe two novel methods used in conducting an EGM of interventions for treating obstetric fistula. Methods: Although development of a framework is mandatory for EGMs, how stakeholders should be involved in establishing the framework is currently unclear. As such, a survey of key stakeholders (including patients and practitioners) was produced using Qualtrics to establish their perspectives on the most important interventions and outcomes to prioritise within the framework. The EGM was then produced in line with recommendations from the Campbell Collaboration and followed a prepublished protocol. Data synthesis was conducted in EPPI-Mapper. Sensitivity analyses using filters applied to the EGM were performed to determine where sufficient homogeneity to perform future evidence syntheses may be possible; this is not currently part of EGM guidance. Results: Involving key stakeholders in the development of the EGM formed the structure of the evidence map by arranging the framework by what was considered most important to them. However, only 39 responses were received; focus groups or individual interviews may have garnered further insight, particularly if carried out in areas of high fistula prevalence. The reporting of the sensitivity analyses highlighted deficiencies in the evidence base; only 7 of 28 included studies [a combination of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs] remained in the EGM and further illuminated the type of new primary data needed. Conclusions: Further guidance on stakeholder involvement in EGMs, as well as development in the technology and methodologies supporting the production of EGMs, may help to address some of the current challenges faced in their production. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients and the public were involved in answering the survey that determined the framework. [Inconsistency identification in Network Meta-Analysis via Stochastic Search Variable Selection](/colloquium-2023/session/1473537/inconsistency-identification-in-network-meta-analysis-via-stochastic-search-variable-selection) Background: The reliability of the results of a network meta-analysis (NMA) lies in the plausibility of the key assumption of transitivity, which implies that the effect modifiers' distribution is similar across treatment comparisons. Transitivity is statistically manifested through the consistency assumption, which suggests that direct and indirect evidence are in agreement. Several methods have been suggested to evaluate consistency. A common approach for testing network consistency suggests adding inconsistency factors to the NMA model. Objectives: To evaluate the consistency assumption of NMA in a Bayesian framework. Methods: We describe each inconsistency factor with a candidate covariate whose inclusion on the model relies on variable selection techniques. Our proposed method, Stochastic Search Inconsistency Factor Selection (SSIFS), evaluates the consistency assumption both locally and globally by applying the stochastic search variable selection method to determine whether the inconsistency factors should be included in the model. The posterior inclusion probability of each inconsistency factor quantifies how likely a specific comparison is to be inconsistent. We use posterior model odds or the median probability model to decide on the importance of inconsistency factors. Results: Differences between direct and indirect evidence can be incorporated into the inconsistency detection process. A key point of our proposed approach is the construction of a reasonable \"informative\" prior concerning network consistency. The prior is based on the elicitation of information-derived historical data from 201 published network meta-analyses. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated in two published network meta-analyses. Conclusions: SSIFS is a novel Bayesian method that evaluates the consistency assumption both globally and locally. The proposed method is publicly available in an R package called ssifs, developed and maintained by the authors of this work. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: - [How should we handle predatory journals in evidence synthesis?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473519/how-should-we-handle-predatory-journals-in-evidence-synthesis) Background: Synthesizers of evidence are increasingly likely to encounter studies published in predatory journals during the evidence synthesis process. Predatory journals and the studies published within them have caused significant disruption across the scientific landscape and present unique concerns within academia. This is due to the lack of transparent editorial oversight they employ, which may increase the risk that the studies published within these journals are erroneous or fraudulent. Objectives: Under the broader aim to develop methodological guidance for the use of studies published within predatory journals in evidence syntheses, the objective of this research was to explore the attitudes, opinions and experiences of experts in the synthesis of evidence regarding predatory journals. Methods: A global, descriptive survey-based cross-sectional study was carried out between April 1 2021 and June 1 2021. The survey was sent to prominent bodies in the field of evidence-based healthcare and systematic reviews, including JBI, Cochrane, Guidelines International Network (GIN), Campbell Collaboration and GRADE. The study utilized a self-administered questionnaire that was coded and disseminated online through Survey Monkey for data collection from the target participant. Because the target audience was those who had experience in evidence synthesis, survey logic was used to remove responses from respondents who lacked this experience. Results: Two hundred and sixty-four evidence synthesis experts responded to this survey. Most respondents agreed with the definition of a predatory journal (86%); however, several (19%) responded that this definition was difficult to apply practically. Many respondents believed that studies published in predatory journals are still eligible for inclusion into an evidence synthesis project. However, this was only after the study had been determined to be 'high-quality' (39%) or if the results were validated (13%). Only 32% of the respondents previously used a checklist or tool to identify a predatory journal. Conclusions: The results of this project identify that there is a need for more consensus-based guidance regarding the inclusion of studies published within predatory journals into an evidence synthesis project. While critical appraisal of these studies is an expected quality control method, evidence synthesis authors are urged to consider additional steps in their future evidence synthesis projects. [Applying GRADE-CERQual to interpretive review findings: Reflections on childhood vaccination acceptance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473388/applying-grade-cerqual-to-interpretive-review-findings-reflections-from-a-cochrane-meta-ethnography-on-childhood-vaccination-acceptance) Background: GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) was developed to support the increasing use of review findings from qualitative evidence syntheses within policy and decision-making. To date, the approach has mainly been applied to aggregative synthesis methodologies and descriptive review findings. Current GRADE-CERQual guidance suggests there is a need for testing with more diverse review methods and outputs, which will provide important insights for the ongoing evolution of the approach. Objectives: This presentation aims to contribute to the evolution of GRADE-CERQual by reflecting on our experiences of applying the approach to the findings that emerged from a Cochrane meta-ethnography on childhood vaccination acceptance. Specifically, we describe the similarities and differences, challenges, and dilemmas we experienced when applying the approach to the more interpretive versus more descriptive findings that emerged from our review. Results: We found that we were able to apply the core criteria and principles of GRADE-CERQual in ways that were congruent with the methodologies and epistemologies of a meta-ethnographic approach and associated interpretive findings. We also found that the practical application processes were similar for the more descriptive versus interpretive findings. The main differences we experienced related to the level of demand placed on the evidence supporting the review finding and the level of complexity involved with the decisions. Compared with the more descriptive findings, the more interpretive findings required supporting data that were richer, thicker, more contextually situated, and methodologically stronger for us to have the same level of confidence in them. Making the assessments for the more interpretive findings also involved greater dilemmas and more complicated forms of judgement, particularly for the component of coherence. We provide practical examples to illustrate these complexities and how we approached them. Conclusions: Our experiences of applying GRADE-CERQual to more interpretive review findings generated various challenges and quandaries which we highlight and hope will offer a platform for further engagement. This could enhance the usability of GRADE-CERQual and in turn the kinds of knowledge that count within health decision-making, with ultimate positive effect on patients and other evidence users. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in Journals](/colloquium-2023/session/1473448/improving-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-in-journals) Background: Journal editors are the gatekeepers of our research. With increasing evidence that Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) are beneficial to research and academia, some editors have expressed their desire to improve EDI of their journals. The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) established a minimum set of requirements aimed at improving EDI in scholarly publishing through a joint commitment action plan with more than 56 publishing organizations. There are several commitments in place to improve EDI in journals, however, their effectiveness is yet to be determined. Objectives: We provide practical approaches for editors, journal publishers, and peer reviewers to improve EDI in academic journals based on the six minimum standards set by the RSC. Methods: We searched publisher websites, empirical studies, and relevant resources that evaluated the impact of any approach to improve EDI in journals. Results: We suggest the following six approaches that journal editors can adopt to meet the RSC minimum criteria: (1) adopt a journal EDI statement with clear, actionable steps to achieve it; (2) promote the use of inclusive and bias-free language; (3) appoint a journal's EDI director or lead; (4) establish an EDI mentoring approach; (5) monitor adherence to EDI principles; and (6) publish reports on EDI actions and achievements. Peer reviewers need to support the author's needs whether they were language needs by directing them to language services or their clinical conditions that require accommodations. We also provide examples of journals that have implemented some of these strategies to improve EDI. Conclusions: EDI issues in academia are tightly intertwined with systemic oppression that is integrated in policies and regulations of academic progression. Publishers and journal editors need to test the feasibility of implementing these approaches and assess their impact on improving EDI. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: no. [Working with policy makers to maximise the utility of EGMs: experiences of Exeter Policy and Research Programme Evidence Review Facility](/colloquium-2023/session/1473796/working-with-policy-makers-to-maximise-the-utility-of-egms-experiences-of-exeter-policy-and-research-programme-evidence-review-facility) Background: Evidence and gap maps (EGMs) are used to summarize the quantity, quality, and main characteristics of an evidence base and are an interactive resource for evidence users to identify research that meets their specific interests and requirements. EGMs are of great potential utility for health and social care policy makers who wish to gain an overview of a broad evidence base to inform decision making. However, differences in expectations and understanding of EGMs and systemic review processes between researchers and policy makers means production of EGMs and ensuring their future utility is not always straightforward. Objectives: To discuss the challenges experienced by the Exeter Policy and Research Programme Evidence Review Facility whilst working alongside policy makers to produce EGMs to inform health and social care policy. Methods: To establish if an EGM is appropriate to meet the needs of policy makers, we work closely with them to understand the size and main features of the existing literature base through extensive scoping. We provide examples of previous EGMs to support policy makers' understanding of their functionality and consider how they may use the EGM. Policy makers are consulted on designing the framework and are given the opportunity to revise its format prior to publication of the final report. Results: Working with policy makers to create EGMs that are relevant and useful can be a protracted process, especially when a focused research question has not been identified. It is not always possible to structure the EGM according to the needs of policy makers or to identify the features of the evidence of interest because of limitations in reporting, which may only become fully apparent after commencing the mapping process. Conclusions: A better understanding of how EGMs are used to inform policy making would enable researchers to determine the potential strengths and limitations of this approach in different contexts. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: During development of the map, feedback from patients and members of the public is sought to inform the scope and format and ascertain the accessibility of the EGM. [Evaluation and development of a novel interactive Summary of Findings table for network meta-analysis. A qualitative user-testing study with clinicians](/colloquium-2023/session/1473818/evaluation-and-development-of-a-novel-interactive-summary-of-findings-table-for-network-meta-analysis.-a-qualitative-user-testing-study-with-clinicians) Background: Clinicians often need to evaluate comparative effectiveness of relevant treatment options for their patients. Network meta-analyses (NMAs) provide an important resource for clinicians to guide decision-making; however, these analyses are complex, and interpretation may prove challenging for users. Objectives: To evaluate and develop a novel interactive Summary of Findings table (the MATCH-IT tool) for network meta-analysis results, to support clinicians in interpreting and applying comparative effectiveness evidence into decision-making. Methods: We performed qualitative user-testing with a convenience sample of practicing physicians working in hospitals and general practice in Norway, Belgium, and Canada. User testing entailed a brief introduction with a clinical scenario, which was a think aloud session with participant-tool-interaction followed by a semi-structured interview. The tests were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using directed content analysis. The results informed the iterative development process of the MATCH-IT tool. Results: Five rounds of user-testing, with 26 participants in total, have resulted in four iterations with updates in the tutorial, layout, navigation functionality, and interphase, as well as the practical-issues-section. We have also added an FAQ section. Clinicians who participated in user-testing had been in clinical practice from 0 to 30 years (median 6, IQR 3-11). Most had little or no prior experience with interpretation of NMA results and sparse knowledge about GRADE methodology. Most clinicians perceived MATCH-IT as easy to interpret and navigate and appreciated its ability to provide overview of the evidence, although some of the interactive features proved to be difficult to discover intuitively. They perceived pictograms and inclusion of practical-issues-information as potentially useful features when interacting with patients. Categorization of results with colour coding to indicate both certainty of evidence and relative effectiveness of interventions was appreciated, and filtering functionality allowed participants to efficiently browse and focus in on the interventions believed to be most relevant for a given clinical scenario. Conclusions: MATCH-IT shows promise in supporting decision-making for clinicians when presented with results from NMAs. The tool has already been published within Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Clinicians were the subject for user testing, ensuring user friendliness for this key consumer group. [Impact of including conference abstracts in systematic reviews: analysis from a living systematic review and network meta-analysis of COVID-19](/colloquium-2023/session/1473721/impact-of-including-conference-abstracts-in-systematic-reviews-analysis-from-a-living-systematic-review-and-network-meta-analysis-of-covid-19) Background: Summarizing all available evidence while decreasing bias raises important methodological challenges for systematic reviews (SRs). Grey literature in SRs is important for minimizing the risk of publication bias but is often inadequately reported, which may reduce the credibility of the evidence synthesis. Objectives: To evaluate the extent of consistency between conference abstracts (CAs) and their final publications and the impact of including results from CAs on meta-analytic effect estimates and the certainty of the evidence (CoE) in our living systematic review and network meta-analysis (SRNMA) for COVID-19. Methods: We will conduct a retrospective review of all CAs included in our living SRNMA of drug treatments for COVID-19 until January 2023. For all CAs included in our living SRNMA with a subsequent final publication, two reviewers, working independently, will compare the results and risk of bias assessments of the CA and its final publication. To assess the impact of the inclusion of CAs on effect estimates and the CoE, we will include the outcomes most frequently reported in the CAs reporting data for interventions with existing recommendations according to the January 2023 World Health Organization guidelines. We will conduct two analyses, one including the CAs and one excluding them. We will compare the results of these analyses to evaluate the magnitude of the change in the pooled estimate and identify any changes to the CoE. Results: This work is in progress. We will describe the nature and frequency of discrepancies between CAs and their final publications. We will present how effect estimates and the CoE changed with and without the CAs. We will consider the direction of effect to be different, whether the effect changes from beneficial to harmful or vice versa, considering the thresholds of effectiveness established in the SRNMA. Conclusion: The results of this analysis will highlight the impact of including CAs in a living SRNMA, which can inform eligibility decisions for future evidence syntheses. Understanding the influence of including CAs in network meta-analyses can assist decision-makers with interpreting the results of evidence syntheses with CAs. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient partners were not involved in this study. [Incorporating Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion into Cochrane Systematic Reviews with AI](/colloquium-2023/session/1473386/incorporating-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-into-cochrane-systematic-reviews-with-ai) Background: Cochrane systematic reviews are a valuable source of evidence-based information for healthcare decision-making. However, it is important to ensure that the analysis of these reviews considers equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) to represent diverse populations better and address disparities in health outcomes. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) to incorporate EDI considerations into the analysis of Cochrane systematic reviews. Methods: A sample of Cochrane systematic reviews was analyzed using AI algorithms to identify EDI-related issues, such as disparities in study populations, missing data on diverse populations, and the under-representation of marginalized groups in the evidence base. The algorithms used machine learning techniques to analyze the data and provide insights into these disparities. Results: The study found that AI algorithms effectively identified EDI-related issues in the analysis of Cochrane systematic reviews. The AI-powered analysis provided insights into disparities in study populations and the under-representation of marginalized groups in the evidence base. The algorithms also provided recommendations for improving EDI considerations in future studies and systematic reviews. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of considering EDI in analyzing Cochrane systematic reviews. Using AI to incorporate EDI considerations is a feasible and effective way to ensure that the information is representative of diverse populations and addresses disparities in health outcomes. The study demonstrates the potential of AI to support EDI in the analysis of evidence-based information and to improve the quality and representativeness of Cochrane systematic reviews. In this study, patient and public involvement was incorporated through consultation with stakeholders and subject matter experts to understand the barriers and facilitators to incorporating EDI considerations in the analysis of Cochrane systematic reviews. This engagement helped to ensure that the AI algorithms developed in this study effectively addressed the needs and perspectives of diverse populations and that the recommendations provided were relevant and meaningful to patients, the public, and healthcare consumers. [The concept of \"evidence relevant to\" in the rehabilitation field: post COVID-19 condition mapping for the World Health Organization Guidance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473488/the-concept-of-\"evidence-relevant-to\"-in-the-rehabilitation-field-post-covid-19-condition-mapping-for-the-world-health-organization-guidance) Background: In the current absence of direct \"evidence on\" rehabilitation interventions for people with symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), we can search and synthesize the indirect \"evidence relevant to\" coming from interventions effective for these symptoms in other health conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) required this information to inform expert teams and provide specific recommendations in their Guidelines. So we defined \"evidence relevant to\" as the synthesis of evidence focusing on the rehabilitative management of impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions, informed by different health conditions presenting with similar symptoms. Objectives: We were asked by the WHO to synthesize the Cochrane evidence relevant to rehabilitation for PCC-related disease, cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. Methods: We searched the last 5 years' Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) using specific terms for each symptom, \"rehabilitation\" and their synonyms in the Cochrane Library. We extracted the available evidence and summarized it using maps. We grouped the included CSRs for health conditions and interventions, indicating the effect and the certainty of evidence. Results: Out of 5,734 CSRs, we found 32 for fatigue, 4 for exercise intolerance, 10 for arthralgia, 15 for dyspnea, 1 for dysphagia, 17 for cognitive impairment and 37 for anxiety and depression, published between 2016 and 2021. They provided data from several health conditions, such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, osteoarthritis and neurological disorders. Effective interventions for fatigue, exercise intolerance, dyspnea and arthralgia included exercise training and physical activities, telerehabilitation, multicomponent and educational interventions. Dysphagia was mainly treated with swallowing therapy, while cognitive aspects were managed with exercise, cognitive training and educational programs. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low and moderate/high in a few cases. We did not identify CSRs that specifically addressed postexertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, dysphonia and olfactory disease. Conclusions: The current findings served as the basis for the recommendations on treatments for PCC symptoms published in the current WHO Guidelines for clinical practice. These results are the first step of indirect evidence able to generate helpful hypotheses for clinical practice and future research. Patient involvement: NA. [Beyond Statistical Significance: Investigating How Systematic Review Authors Communicate Meaningful Differences of Nonsignificant Results](/colloquium-2023/session/1473767/beyond-statistical-significance-investigating-how-systematic-review-authors-communicate-meaningful-differences-of-nonsignificant-results) Background: For decades, statisticians and methodologists have severely criticized the undue reliance on strict p-value thresholds (usually 0.05) and the misinterpretation of statistical significance in medical research. Despite legitimate criticism, primary research and systematic reviews continue to rely heavily on statistical significance without taking a nuanced approach when interpreting nonsignificant effect estimates. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the language employed by Cochrane authors to emphasize differences in nonsignificant treatment effects they considered relevant. We also sought to measure the magnitude of these differences and determine whether they differed from statistically nonsignificant effect estimates that authors interpreted as similar or not different. Methods: We screened all Cochrane reviews of interventions published between November 2017 and 2022 for statistically nonsignificant effect estimates that authors presented as meaningful differences. We classified interpretations qualitatively and assessed them quantitatively by calculating two areas under the curve (AUC): one for the confidence interval (CI) exceeding the null, indicating a greater effect of one intervention, and another for the CI exceeding a minimal important difference. We compared the AUC of nonsignificant effect estimates that authors interpreted as meaningful with those interpreted as nonmeaningful. Results: We screened 2,337 Cochrane reviews, finding 139 cases that emphasized meaningful differences of nonsignificant results. Most commonly, authors used qualifying words (e.g., may/might/could) to express uncertainty (47.5%) and sometimes emphasized lack of significance (19.4%). In 27% of cases, authors made absolute claims about the greater efficacy or harm of one intervention without acknowledging statistical uncertainty, which could be misleading. The AUC analysis of the CIs is ongoing and will be available at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Nuanced interpretations of statistically nonsignificant results were rare in Cochrane reviews. Authors should consider these subtleties when interpreting nonsignificant effect estimates to ensure that meaningful differences are not overlooked and that conclusions drawn are as accurate and informative as possible. Future research should explore the most effective language for distinguishing and interpreting effect estimates so that knowledge users interpret this information correctly. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The choice of how to present statistically nonsignificant results can substantially impact the interpretation of results made by decision-makers. [Maximizing collaboration between university students and Cochrane](/colloquium-2023/session/1574623/maximizing-collaboration-between-university-students-and-cochrane) Background: Conducting Cochrane reviews can be challenging. These reviews are often carried out by healthcare professionals and experienced researchers because of their complexity and associated workload. University students must complete a research project to obtain an undergraduate or postgraduate degree. Thus, there is a vast potential for collaboration between students and Cochrane. Cochrane is present in universities and hospitals, so one potential partnership may be the realization of end-of-degree research projects and master/PhD theses based on Cochrane activities. Objectives: (1) To explore how to incorporate Cochrane activities into the undergraduate and postgraduate curricula, (2) to share the experiences of centres in promoting the participation of university students in Cochrane activities and (3) to promote networking among Cochrane trainers. Description: The workshop is directed at Cochrane trainers, coordinators and undergraduate and postgraduate curricula teachers. The session will highlight new opportunities to link Cochrane activities and university students. The workshop will include two short presentations (10 minutes each) and one interactive session (40 minutes). The group will reconvene for the final 30 minutes to gather feedback about synergies between students and Cochrane. The first presentation (Cochrane Sweden and Cochrane Austria) will focus on experiences with the Cochrane International Mobility scheme (see also https://www.cochrane.org/news/cochrane-international-mobility) and how this could be integrated into the university curriculum. The second presentation will show the experience of different Cochrane Centres (Cochrane Madrid, Iberoamerican Cochrane Centre-Barcelona and Cochrane Complementary Medicine-Switzerland) in integrating Cochrane activities and evidence synthesis methods into the medical degree curriculum. The main section of the workshop will be interactive. Participants will conduct a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the previously exposed proposals. Relevance to diversity: The integration of Cochrane activities in the university represents a unique opportunity to involve different stakeholders to support informed decisions in healthcare. [The Theory of Everything in Health Decision-Making: Step 2](/colloquium-2023/session/1473861/the-theory-of-everything-in-health-decision-making-step-2) Background: Clinicians, the public (including patients), policymakers, payers, regulators, and science communities invest considerable amounts of resources in making decisions at various levels using systematic reviews, health technology assessments (HTA), guideline recommendations, coverage decisions, selection of essential medicines and diagnostics, quality improvement, and policy and evidence briefs. With the World Health Organization (WHO), we have developed a conceptual approach that we call \"Theory of Everything (ToE) in health decision-making\" to connect the actors in this ecosystem. Our work, focusing on high-income countries, shows that criteria and methods that these actors use differ but that they frequently overlap and exist together (Sch\u00fcnemann et al., Lancet PH 2022). The widely used Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks form the connecting framework for our conceptual approach (Figure 1). This work has received broad attention, in particular by regulators, and in the guideline, HTA, and health policy community. These actors need to be linked together, and capacity is required to create interaction and decision consensus in and across jurisdictions. However, particularly in emerging economies and low and middle income countries (LMIC), the risk of sparse, redundant or conflicting decisions across the decision ecosystem may be costly. In particular, without coordination, actions by different stakeholders might contribute to decision instability and volatile national health policies. Objectives: We are evaluating the flexibility, gradualism, and completeness of the ToE through consideration of new perspectives and exploration of its applicability at LMIC level to understand barriers-enablers and necessary prerequisites. Methods: We are using a mixed-methods approach including surveys of existing and new stakeholders who play a role in the ecosystem, including regulators and industry, in high-income countries and LMIC, a Delphi approach, and actual work with countries to gain further insights regarding the applicability of the approach. Anticipated results and conclusions: At the Cochrane Colloquium we will report on 1) the update and expansion of the ToE; 2) case examples for countries of connecting the decision-making actors, and 3) a draft blueprint and roadmap for operationalization of the ToE in various settings. [How to rapidly review the literature when planning a new clinical trial - a practical guide](/colloquium-2023/session/1473632/how-to-rapidly-review-the-literature-when-planning-a-new-clinical-trial---a-practical-guide) Objectives: In preparation of a clinical trial, the existing evidence on the topic needs to be systematically reviewed to avoid research waste and to provide a rationale for the planned trial. If a current systematic review (SR) is not available, a new one should be conducted. However, such an evidence-based research approach is rarely used, and no guidance for clinical researchers exists. Therefore, we aimed 1) to develop a practical guide for clinical researchers to rapidly review the literature before starting a new trial and 2) to conduct formal usability testing of the guidance. Methods: We developed the guidance for clinical researchers in several steps: 1) literature search for existing rapid review (RR) methods guidance, guidance on conducting literature reviews specifically for clinical research, and relevant methods research; 2) literature selection including a relevancy rating; 3) data extraction; 4) consultation with our stakeholder panel on the first draft; 5) usability testing of the first interim version; and 6) final version of the guidance. Results: We screened 602 documents and included 24 existing guidances and 29 methods studies. We extracted and synthesized recommendations for each literature review domain (i.e., research question, eligibility criteria, screening, etc.). Our interim guidance consists of two documents\u2014the practical guide listing essential and optional tasks, explanations, and recommended tools, and a template with signaling questions, which allows users to efficiently complete and document the work process. The suggested approach consists of two parts: Part A \"Evidence from existing SRs and ongoing trials\" and Part B \"Evidence from primary studies.\" Decision points for \"How to proceed from here\" with several possible scenarios are presented. Conclusions: To make clinical research more evidence based, we developed a systematic approach for clinical researchers to rapidly review the literature when planning a new clinical trial. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The interim guidance and template will undergo formal usability testing, where the main target group of the guide\u2014researchers in the planning phase of a clinical trial\u2014will apply the guide, use the template, and provide feedback thereafter. [Is the FreemanTukey double arcsine transformation a reliable approach? for proportion meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473602/is-the-freemantukey-double-arcsine-transformation-a-reliable-approach-for-proportion-meta-analysis) Background: Proportion meta-analyses are frequently used in epidemiology to estimate the burden of disease. They are usually based on transformed proportions using FreemanTukey double arcsine transformations (FTT). Schwarzer et al. generated some controversy because they considered that this method produces seriously misleading results and proposed the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) as a more elaborate approach.[1] However, Suhail et al., using the same set of studies, reanalyzed the data and concluded that the FTT is the most reliable approach and remains the preferred transformation in proportion meta-analysis.[2] Objectives: To compare the reliability and robustness of FTT with GLMM in a large set of proportion meta-analyses. Results: Results will be shown at the colloquium. Methods: We will conduct GLMM[1] and FTT over a large set of proportions from a living systematic review and meta-analysis about safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant people (https://safeinpregnancy.org/lsr/) applying recommended safeguards[2]: a) avoiding the use of the average of the double arcsine and its variance for synthesis; b) using the inverse of the variance of the pooled FTT proportion; and c) modifying the confidence intervals to prevent numerical inaccuracies. Conclusions: It is important to verify the best approach to undertake proportions meta-analysis, which is critical for estimations in epidemiology and decision-making. References 1.

[Characteristics, reporting, and methods of trials included meta-analyses of systematic reviews: A meta-epidemiological review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473498/characteristics-reporting-and-methods-of-trials-included-in-time-to-event-meta-analyses-of-systematic-reviews-a-meta-epidemiological-review) Background: Previous studies demonstrated limitations in the reporting of time-to-event (TTE) analyses in trial publications. The challenges that systematic review authors face in trials they include for TTE meta-analysis remain unexplored. Objectives: To explore the characteristics, reporting and methods of trials included in aggregate data TTE meta-analyses of Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. Methods: We extracted data from trials included in pairwise, hazard ratio (HR)-based meta-analyses of primary outcomes and overall survival/all-cause mortality of 50 systematic reviews. Reviews were identified from the Cochrane Database and Core Clinical Journals through systematic searches (02/2020; MEDLINE). For reviews, trials and their outcomes, we extracted, in duplicate, data on review/trial characteristics, outcome definitions, general and TTE analyses and specific characteristics relevant to TTE analysis. Results: Reviews included 235 trials in eligible meta-analyses, resulting in 315 individual trial analyses. Most prominently assessed in trials (91%; 214/235) and reviews (88%; and follow-up specifications (56%; 175/ 315) for trial outcomes were frequently missing. Available TTE outcome data per trial were most frequently an HR combined with a log-rank p-value, survival curves and either time-point specific (16%; 50/315) or median survival times (15%; 47/315). The most prominently used individual measures were survival curves (83%; 263/315). HRs were reported for 76% (240/315) of trial outcomes. Review authors most frequently used reported HRs or recalculated TTE data from p-values (each 5%; 15/ 315), although TTE data sources were specified sporadically for individual trial outcomes. Reviews included most frequently intention-to-treat (64%; 202/315) and unadjusted analyses (25%; 80/315) but often did not specify either. Except for missing outcome data, for which numerical data were available in 57% (134/235), TTE relevant study characteristics, e.g., informative censoring and proportional hazards, were sporadically addressed in trial publications. Direct comparison to the reporting of their including reviews indicated that limitations and variability of trial reporting translates to the review level as well. Conclusions: Reporting of trials included in TTE meta-analyses of recent systematic reviews appears variable and limited, similar to their including reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Creating a systematic review infrastructure: Implementing Cochrane tools for students, teachers, researchers and clinicians in a university setting](/colloquium-2023/session/1473651/creating-a-systematic-review-infrastructure-implementing-cochrane-tools-for-students-teachers-researchers-and-clinicians-in-a-university-setting) Background: In 2017, Cochrane Sweden was launched, and a collaboration between the Medical Faculty, the Medical Degree (MD) Program and the Faculty Library was initiated based on a need for guidance and relevant learning activities for students, PhD students and researchers in systematic review methodology. The MD Program had defined scientific scholarship and evidence-based medicine (EBM) as core qualifications. The library and MD Program already worked together, and involving Cochrane Sweden became essential. Objectives: To collaboratively develop relevant learning activities, support and guidance for carrying out systematic reviews using Cochrane tools and methodology for our students, PhD students' teachers, researchers and clinicians. Methods: Relevant areas were identified where Cochrane tools could be implemented as stand-alone tools or integrated with other learning activities for our user groups. Identifying methods for support and methodological guidance were key elements in the implementation. Cochrane Interactive Learning (CIL), Covidence and RevMan Web (RMW) were consecutively implemented to meet the objectives. [Table 1- Overview of Cochrane tools implemented at Lund University, Faculty of Medicine] Results: The process of implementing, evaluating and improving the use of Cochrane tools for our user groups extends over many years. Cochrane tools have been implemented in the PhD program, MD program and the Master programs in Medical Science, Psychology and Public Health. The usage statistics and feedback on Cochrane tools show that they are appreciated and help users' understanding of review method and workflow. The number of Cochrane Reviews, other systematic reviews and reviews where students and researchers collaborate are increasing. The library's systematic review service has been expanded to include tools and methodological guidance in the review process. The \"Lund model\" has also become an inspiring example for other MD programs. Conclusions: Our collaboration and integrative approach have resulted in an infrastructure of Cochrane tools, people and competencies supporting systematic reviews and EBM. The synergies between the collaborating parts made the implementation of Cochrane tools possible. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our students, teachers, clinicians and researchers are given a solid foundation in EBM methodology, which has a strong potential to have a positive impact on patient care. [CEOsys - An ecosystem for COVID-19 evidence in Germany: challenges and lessons learned as a guide for future networks](/colloquium-2023/session/1473793/ceosys---an-ecosystem-for-covid-19-evidence-in-germany-challenges-and-lessons-learned-as-a-guide-for-future-networks) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic presented a major disruption worldwide. Given the extensive, rapidly evolving evidence, high-quality evidence syntheses that provide context-sensitive and up-to-date data were urgently needed as a basis for evidence-informed clinical and public health decision-making. CEOsys ('COVID-19 evidence ecosystem') was established as a national German network for living systematic reviews (LSRs) and living guidelines. Objectives: To describe the infrastructure, processes and impact of CEOsys and to discuss challenges faced and lessons learned when organizing and maintaining the network, which may provide guidance for future networks in view of pandemics and health-related crises. Methods: We present an experience report from representatives of the former CEOsys network (09/2020-12/2021; full list of collaborators: www.covid-evidenz.de), a project within the German Network of University Medicine (NUM). After describing its development, we outline CEOsys work processes and present our outputs before highlighting challenges encountered, adaptations made and lessons learned. Results: CEOsys gathered 18 university hospitals and 8 (non-)university partners. Processes included i.a. prioritization, conducting LSRs, supporting evidence-based guidelines and knowledge translation, backed by setting up a technical infrastructure and capacity-building. We published 12 COVID-19-related Cochrane reviews, supported three living guidelines (inpatient/outpatient treatment, school-based infection prevention) and developed 10 methodological approaches and 10 dissemination formats. Challenges included CEOsys' late initiation, prioritization, the continuously evolving knowledge on COVID-19 and revision of outcomes for LSRs or establishing a 'living' technical infrastructure. Based on lessons learned, the cooperation between clinicians and methodologists within CEOsys and the network's international collaborative partners (e.g., Cochrane International) represented major advantages. Mediated by the Institute for Medical Knowledge Management, CEOsys greatly benefitted from collaborations with guideline groups. Future networks should, for example, involve key stakeholders early on, aim for (inter-)national collaborations, balance traditional publishing of results and living documents and evaluate their impact on decision-makers and the public. Conclusions: CEOsys achieved rapid, high-quality and up-to-date evidence syntheses, collaboratively produced across multiple sites and on a broad range of issues. Our experiences are now taken up by the follow-up project PREPARED ('PREparedness and PAndemic REsponse in Germany'), which uses the infrastructure and processes established to design a blueprint for a more sustainable evidence ecosystem. [Identifying high priority methodological questions for conducting rapid systematic reviews: Preliminary results from an eDelphi study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473844/identifying-high-priority-methodological-questions-for-conducting-rapid-systematic-reviews-preliminary-results-from-an-edelphi-study) Background: Rapid systematic reviews (RRs) are a useful tool to provide healthcare decision-makers with the most up-to-date scientific evidence. Yet there remains much uncertainty about the most effective and efficient methods for carrying out RRs. In fact, there is even uncertainty about which are the main methodological concerns for RRs. Objectives: To elicit a consensus from RR researchers on what they consider the most important methodological questions when conducting RRs in time-efficient ways. Methods: People with experience in conducting and using evidence syntheses (researchers, knowledge users, policymakers, and healthcare providers) were invited to participate in an eDelphi study. A core group of experts generated an initial list of questions based on the available literature. Participants were then asked to rate and rank the importance of the methodological questions. Three survey rounds were performed to achieve a consensus. Items deemed of low importance were removed at each round. Items rated to be of high importance by 75% of participants were included in the final list. Results: Each survey round elicited feedback from 52 to 70 experts. Of participants, 78% self-identified as researchers, 13% as healthcare practitioners, and 9% as policymakers. More than 30% of participants reported 15+ years of experience in evidence synthesis. The first survey round started with 29 items, and new items were suggested. In the second round, 26 items remained on the list. In the final round, only 7 Items were believed to be of high importance by 75% of participants. Three items concerned the search strategy, two focused on study selection, and two focused on quality/bias assessment. Conclusion: Seven items were consistently identified as highly important methodological concerns related to RRs. A consensus meeting will be held to discuss additional items and to generate a summary document containing the final priority list. The results will be used to inform further research in this area, contributing to the development of reliable and rigorous RRs. Patient, public or healthcare consumer involvement: Given the emphasis on the methodological aspects of RRs, patients were not included. The eDelphi does include interested parties, such as guideline and policy developers and end-users. [Comparison of statistical methods used to meta-analyse results from interrupted time series studies: an empirical study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473473/comparison-of-statistical-methods-used-to-meta-analyse-results-from-interrupted-time-series-studies-an-empirical-study) Background: The interrupted time series (ITS) design is commonly used to evaluate large-scale policy change or public health interventions when randomisation is infeasible. In ITS studies, measurements are collected at regular intervals before and after an interruption. The pre-interruption period is used to estimate an underlying time trend that, when projected into the post-interruption period, creates a counterfactual for what would have occurred without the interruption. The impact of the interruption can then be quantified using a variety of metrics such as immediate and long-term effects. Several statistical methods are available for the analysis and meta-analysis of ITS studies. However, there has been no empirical evaluation of the impact of using different statistical methods to analyse ITS studies and meta-analyse their results. Objectives: To empirically compare meta-analysis results obtained from different meta-analysis and ITS analysis methods when applied to real-world ITS data. Methods: ITS datasets were sourced from published meta-analyses and reanalysed using two ITS estimation methods. The level- and slope-change effect estimates were calculated and combined using fixed-effect and four random-effects meta-analysis methods. We compared the meta-analytic effect estimates, 95% confidence intervals, p-values and estimates of heterogeneity across the statistical method combinations. Results: Of an eligible 40 reviews, data from 17 meta-analyses (including 283 ITS studies) were obtained and analysed. We found that the meta-analysis method choice did not systematically impact the meta-analytic effect estimates, standard errors and between-study variances, irrespective of the ITS analysis method. However, the meta-analytic confidence intervals and p-values were impacted by the meta-analysis confidence interval method, and the ITS analysis method used may modify this impact. Conclusions: The effect estimates, standard errors and between-study variance estimates were minimally impacted by ITS analysis and meta-analysis method choice. However, confidence intervals and p-values varied depending on the statistical method used, which may impact the interpretation of a meta-analysis. In conjunction with evidence from numerical simulation, this study provides insights into which methods to use in different scenarios, which may assist researchers in evidence synthesis of public health or policy interventions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients/consumers were involved in the design/reporting of this study. [The role of collaborative evidence networks in promoting and supporting evidence-based health care (EBHC) globally](/colloquium-2023/session/1473468/the-role-of-collaborative-evidence-networks-in-promoting-and-supporting-evidence-based-health-care-ebhc-globally) Background: The success of the global evidence-based healthcare (EBHC) agenda depends on individuals and organisations working together within a functioning evidence ecosystem. Collaborative evidence networks like JBI, Cochrane, Campbell and others, although differing in form and function, were all established with a common goal: to collaboratively produce, summarise and disseminate evidence to inform policy and practice to improve lives. Over the past 30 years, with the rise of digital technology, increasing recognition of the importance of evidence-based decision-making and the evolution of network structures, these networks have become central to the way evidence is synthesised, translated and implemented, yet little has been written about their strategic development or management. Objectives: To explore the strategic functions and form of the JBI Collaboration to understand the role of a collaborative evidence network in promoting and supporting EBHC globally. Methods: The network functions approach (NFA) was employed to map the form (governance, management and administrative structures) and core functions of the JBI Collaboration. Results: The results of the NFA mapping established the ways the JBI Collaboration enables development, exchange and dissemination of knowledge; the purposeful building of social capital; mobilisation of resources; and amplification and advocacy of members' work to increase the capacity and effectiveness of members in achieving their unified purpose. It demonstrated how participation in the network enables members to contribute to and draw on collective expertise; provides access to platforms and processes that broaden the dissemination and impact of members' work; provides access to scientific resources, training and opportunities for individual/institutional capacity building; and provides practical knowledge of how to solve complex health problems using JBI's model of EBHC. Conclusions: Collaborative evidence networks play a crucial role in bringing together diverse stakeholders from across the evidence ecosystem to drive the EBHC agenda forward. These networks combine formal and informal structures to facilitate collaboration to address complex global health issues. There would be value in cognate networks using the NFA to identify the areas of overlap, working together to systematically reduce duplication of effort and strengthen our understanding of how we can collaborate across networks to achieve impact in EBHC globally. [Risk factors for abstracts falsely excluded during single-reviewer screening - a methods study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473439/risk-factors-for-abstracts-falsely-excluded-during-single-reviewer-screening---a-methods-study) Background: Because of the growing need to provide evidence syntheses under time constraints, recent research has explored rapid review methods, which often employ single-reviewer literature screening. However, the single-reviewer screening process is error-prone; on average, 13% of relevant studies are missed. To date, it is unclear whether certain types of studies or publications have a higher risk of being falsely excluded than others. Objectives: The aim of our methods study with an observational design was to identify risk factors on a study-, abstract-, journal-, and reviewer-level for eligible studies to be falsely excluded during single-reviewer abstract screening. Methods: We used a database of 1,000 inclusion and exclusion decisions pertaining to 80 eligible references from a crowd-based randomized controlled trial assessing the accuracy of single-reviewer abstract screening. We gathered a list of potential risk factors for studies falsely excluded during single-reviewer abstract screening. One investigator collected potential risk factor variables independently, and a second investigator checked the data. We built a random forest model using R version 4.2.2 to identify variables that could predict the risk of false exclusion of studies. We split up the dataset into a training and a validation set. We trained the random forest classifier with the training set and used it to predict classes of \"single false exclusion\" for the validation set. We calculated Mean Decrease Accuracy and Mean Decrease Gini to rank the importance of the collected variables. Results: The random forest model ranked study design and the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) of the publishing journal as the variables with the highest importance for false exclusions. Cross-sectional studies, controlled-before-after studies, and publications in journals with an SJR 2.29 had a higher risk of being falsely excluded. Other variables, such as the screener being a native speaker, self-rated topic expertise, and previous review screening experience, were ranked as the least important. The model achieved a good area under the curve at 0.71. Conclusions: Our results indicate that study design and a low SJR of the journal may be important risk factors for studies to be falsely excluded during single-reviewer abstract screening. Investigators need to be cognizant of these risk factors when conducting reviews that include non-randomized evidence. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Rapid reviews generally involve patients and healthcare providers in the review process in order to focus on patient-relevant health outcomes. [Effect estimates can be accurately calculated with data digitally extracted from interrupted time series graphs](/colloquium-2023/session/1473521/effect-estimates-can-be-accurately-calculated-with-data-digitally-extracted-from-interrupted-time-series-graphs) Background: Interrupted time series (ITS) studies are frequently used to examine the impact of population-level interventions. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses including ITS designs may inform public health and policy decision-making. Reanalysis of ITS may be required for inclusion in meta-analysis. Although publications of ITS rarely provide raw data for reanalysis, graphs are often included, from which time series data can be digitally extracted. However, the accuracy of effect estimates calculated from data digitally extracted from ITS graphs is currently unknown. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of effect estimates calculated from digitally extracted data from ITS graphs. Methods: Forty-three ITS with available datasets and time series graphs were included. Time series data from each graph were extracted independently by four researchers using digital data extraction software. Data extraction errors were analysed. Segmented linear regression models were fitted to the extracted and provided datasets, from which estimates of immediate level and slope change (and associated statistics) were calculated and compared across the datasets. These estimates were then standardised for comparison across the datasets. For a particular dataset, standardisation was achieved by dividing the level and slope change estimates by the range of the outcome of the provided time series data (i.e., the maximum observed value of the outcome minus the minimum observed value); this yielded standardised effect estimates that could range from 0 to 1. Results: Although there were some data extraction errors of time points, primarily due to complications in the original graphs, they did not translate into important differences in the standardised level and slope change effect estimates (and associated statistics) (Figures 1 and 2). Conclusions: Using digital data extraction to obtain data from ITS graphs should be considered in reviews including ITS. Including these studies in meta-analyses, even with slight inaccuracy, is likely to outweigh the loss of information from noninclusion. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: There was no involvement with patient, public and/or healthcare consumers. [Building capacity in producing trusted evidence - Evidence Synthesis Ireland and Cochrane Ireland Fellowships](/colloquium-2023/session/1473784/building-capacity-in-producing-trusted-evidence---evidence-synthesis-ireland-and-cochrane-ireland-fellowships) Background: Evidence Synthesis Ireland (ESI), which includes Cochrane Ireland, aims to build evidence synthesis knowledge, awareness and capacity among the public, healthcare institutions, policymakers, clinicians and researchers on the island of Ireland. One way we do this is through the ESI Fellowship Scheme, launched in January 2019. Objectives: The scheme builds capacity in Fellows through developing the practical skills of how to plan, design, conduct and report an evidence synthesis. Fellows receive mentoring from evidence synthesis experts and contribute to reviews that have a strong policy and/or practice impact. Process: The scheme places Fellows virtually with experienced review teams nationally and internationally to gain hands-on evidence synthesis experience in a high-quality environment with one-to-one mentorship. Fellowships range from 6 months to 2 years and are unpaid, allowing those working full-time to apply. Benefits include free attendance at ESI workshops, co-authorship, \u20ac1000 travel bursary, access to Covidence, and networking/collaboration opportunities. Eligible applicants are clinicians/trainees, researchers, academics and/or postgraduate residents of Ireland/Northern Ireland. Fellows are selected through a competitive process and are expected to commit to 8 hours/week to the review in addition to theoretical training. Results: Fellows are placed on a range of review types: 50% on Cochrane reviews (reviews of effectiveness, qualitative evidence synthesis, rapid reviews, living reviews and diagnostic test accuracy) and 50% on other reviews (umbrella, overviews, scoping reviews, prognostic reviews, evidence and gap maps and mixed methods). To date, 68 Fellows have been placed. Fellows are mostly female (64%), over half have never completed a systematic review and 35% are early career. Fellows are academics (30%), healthcare professionals (35%), postdoctoral researchers (24%), clinician-academics and others (9%). Fellows report capacity built-in evidence synthesis competencies and illustrate this capacity through leading further reviews, collaborating with mentors and teaching evidence synthesis. Conclusions: ESI provides a unique opportunity for researchers to develop their evidence synthesis skills and contribute to evidence-based healthcare in Ireland. This model could be replicated by others to strengthen capacity in producing robust evidence. Patient relevance: The scheme is relevant to patients as it contributes to strengthening the capacity of researchers/clinicians to produce robust evidence. [Knowledge mobilisation of rapid reviews to inform health and care policy and practice: lessons from the Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre](/colloquium-2023/session/1473565/knowledge-mobilisation-of-rapid-reviews-to-inform-health-and-care-policy-and-practice-lessons-from-the-wales-covid-19-evidence-centre) Background: Policy and practice decisions must be evidence-based, but ensuring that research evidence is readily available and used by decision-makers is challenging. This was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when knowledge mobilisation strategies to bridge the gap between evidence synthesis and informing decisions were critical. The Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre (WCEC) was set up to ensure that health and social care policy and practice decision-makers had timely access to relevant COVID-19 research evidence. Objectives: To describe WCEC knowledge mobilisation methods for rapid evidence reviews, reflect on the impact, and share learning. Methods: Knowledge mobilisation methods were flexible to meet decision-makers' (our stakeholders') needs. We collaborated with stakeholders throughout to ensure we addressed their requirements and identified policy and practice implications, evidence impact and develop knowledge mobilisation plans. We identified barriers and facilitators to improving our methods over time and ensure all outputs are widely accessible. Results: Coproduction with stakeholders (priority-setting, review conduct, planning pathway-to-impact and knowledge mobilisation) built trust in our methods and evidence reliability. Reviews informed Welsh health and care decision-making during the pandemic and recovery periods, addressing current health and care pressures. From April 2021 to December 2022, 20 of our reviews informed Welsh Government guidance, moving to COVID alert level 0, schools reopening, a Public Health Wales campaign to raise vaccine uptake, and led to Welsh Government commissioning of carbon dioxide monitors in schools. A review of strategies to support learning and wellbeing among 16- to 19-year-old learners was a key piece of evidence included in the Welsh Government's 'Renew and Reform: Post-16 and Transitions Plan', and reviews on inequalities that were exacerbated during the pandemic (LGBTQ+, women and girls, people living with disabilities) informed a Welsh Government action plan. Recently, a review of the effectiveness of diagnostics centres is guiding the design and implementation of new community diagnostic centres in Wales (January 2023). Conclusions: Coproduction throughout supported knowledge mobilisation and led to the use of rapid reviews by scientific advisors and policy and practice decision-makers. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The WCEC had a public partnership group of 8 members who contributed to all our processes. [Machine-learning assisted screening increases efficiency of systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473504/machine-learning-assisted-screening-increases-efficiency-of-systematic-review) Background: Conventional systematic review (SR) methods are time-consuming and highly resource intensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning can help reviewers complete these tasks in less time and with fewer resources. PICO Portal (PP) is an AI-assisted SR platform that prioritizes articles for screening using several algorithms including both decision tree and deep learning models. Objectives: To assess the AI-assisted screening in PICO Portal. Methods: Our data set comprised eight completed SRs, each using two independent screeners, with a total of 56,728 records (range: 4,204 to 14,185) on a range of topics from social to biomedical sciences. For each SR, we simulated the screening using batches of 100 articles to train and build predictions for eligibility, re-ranking successive articles, and comparing the predicted eligibility with the actual results from the SRs. We plotted the proportions of title/abstract and full-text included records that were captured by the AI screening at the title and abstract level for each project and calculated a weighted average of this efficiency (by project size). We meta-analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the predictions versus the reviewers' final decisions using Stata 'metadta'. Results: We estimate that if the active learning AI predictions had been used, reviewers would have needed to screen only 20-50% of title/abstracts to capture 95% of eligible records (Figure 1). After screening 10%, 25%, 50%, and 70% of title/abstract records, the average project would have captured approximately 60%, 85%, 95%, and 99% of the records included in the title/abstract stage (Figure 2). Sensitivity was better than specificity (95% vs. 68%) (Figures 3 and 4). Conclusions: Based on our analysis, we estimate that 40-60% of screening effort can be saved using PICO Portal, an AI-assisted, web-based, SR platform. Future research should examine the impact of missing the final 5% of records on review conclusions and assess the resource-benefit ratio. Patient relevance and involvement: Our findings and future recommendations are from the researcher and funder perspective. Our conclusions directly impact the amount of time reviewers need to complete an SR. This work did not involve any stakeholders, patients, or consumers. [Is a new approach for rating the quality evidence of effect estimates derived from matched-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) needed?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473496/is-a-new-approach-for-rating-the-quality-evidence-of-effect-estimates-derived-from-matched-adjusted-indirect-comparisons-maic-needed) Background: In health technology assessments matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) are used when head-to-head randomised studies comparing a drug (therapy) in question and a comparator, e.g., standard care in the treatment of a disease, are not available. MAICs use individual patient data (IPD) from trials of one treatment to match baseline summary statistics reported from trials of another treatment. MAICs use an approach similar to propensity score weighting, whereby treatment outcomes are compared across balanced trial populations. Although the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approaches to rate the quality of treatment effect estimates from network meta-analysis (NMA) have been suggested, it seems that an approach for MAICs is missing. Objectives: a) To evaluate the prevalence of MAIC use in submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); and b) to explore how to rate the quality/certainty of the evidence in MAIC using the currently available approaches. Methods: Scoping searches of NICE website (without time restrictions) were conducted, and these will be supplemented with searches in Medline, Embase and Central. Prevalence data will be synthesised quantitatively. The existing GRADE and CINeMA approaches will be compared accounting for similarities and differences in the MAIC and Bucher methods. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that MAICs are predominantly being used for reimbursement decisions in oncology. Worryingly, a large proportion of submissions to NICE rely on unanchored comparisons whereby a common comparator arm is missing, and these types of MAICs make much stronger assumptions and are widely regarded as unfeasible. The work is still ongoing; we will have more findings by September 2023 to present at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Currently there is no guidance on how to rate the certainty of evidence of effect estimates obtained from MAICs. Although MAIC and Bucher methods share certain similarities, there are still distinct differences between the two. We believe a new approach is warranted, and determining certainty of evidence in MAICs may help decision-makers in making informed recommendations. [Providing evidence to the WHO, the experience of Cochrane Rehabilitation regarding the Rehabilitation 2030 initiative and the COVID-19 pandemic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473566/providing-evidence-to-the-who-the-experience-of-cochrane-rehabilitation-regarding-the-rehabilitation-2030-initiative-and-the-covid-19-pandemic) Background: Shortly after the launch of Cochrane Rehabilitation in December 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched \"Rehabilitation 2030: a call for action\" with the aim to strengthen and upscale rehabilitation services in health systems worldwide in response to the growing needs. Cochrane Rehabilitation collaborated with the WHO Rehabilitation Programme in several projects on rehabilitation interventions, in the framework of Rehabilitation 2030 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The aim was to provide methodological support and Cochrane evidence at the request of the WHO, to inform clinical recommendations and guidance on rehabilitation management. Methods: Different methods have been used according to the needs of the specific projects. For the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation (PIR), developed for 20 selected health conditions, we performed an overview of all the CSRs according to the inclusion criteria defined with WHO. The CSRs identified during the screening process were summarized using an evidence map. We grouped outcomes and comparisons of included CSRs indicating the effect and the quality of evidence to provide a comprehensive view of what is known. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we created an interactive living evidence map, based on priorities for research defined in collaboration with the WHO rehabilitation programme: limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest, the phases of the disease, and research questions at the rehabilitation micro, meso and macro level. Furthermore, indirect evidence on symptoms of post COVID-19 condition was extracted and synthesized from CSRs on the same symptoms in other health conditions. Results: Table 1 reports the results on the three main projects (PIR, 'Evidence on' COVID-19 and 'Evidence relevant to' symptoms of post COVID-19 condition) in collaboration between the WHO and Cochrane Rehabilitation. Conclusions: In its collaboration with the WHO, Cochrane Rehabilitation has developed different strategies and methodologies to respond rapidly to emerging questions regarding rehabilitation interventions. The aim is to inform clinicians as well as policymakers to allow evidence-based decision-making. These approaches could benefit other similar fields in healthcare in the future and inform scientists on further research needs. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Rapid reviews, how much do they comply with Cochrane recommendations in their methodology to provide reliable evidence?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473882/rapid-reviews-how-much-do-they-comply-with-cochrane-recommendations-in-their-methodology-to-provide-reliable-evidence) Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a large increase in rapid reviews (RRs) was identified. This is mainly because the design appears as an alternative to provide timely and rapid responses to emerging issues. RRs follow the method of systematic reviews, but they simplify or omit some steps to shorten the length of time in which the review is conducted. Objectives: To identify and describe which steps were performed and which were omitted in published RRs, according to the list of recommendations suggested by the Cochrane Methods Group. Methods: We searched databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Epistemonikos, and CINAHL) to identify RRs of interventions for COVID-19. Two investigators independently screened and selected reviews that self-reported as RRs and that at least delivered a meta-analysis. We will extract the data related to the methodology used by each RR and compare them with the recommended steps by classifying them as \"reported\" or \"omitted.\" We will analyze compliance for each study and for the totality of the included studies. To chart compliance, we will classify it as \"very high\" when compliance ranges from 76% to 100% (100% corresponds to reporting for the eight recommendations), \"moderate\" when between 51% and 75%, \"low\" when between 26% low\" when between 0% and 25%. Results: This is a work in progress. The results will describe the performance of the method in a certain group of RRs. We will present a summary table of the Cochrane Methods recommendations for RRs, identifying whether there was reporting or omission of the step for each recommendation. Conclusions: RRs are being used for decision-making both for everyday health and for public health policies, so it is essential that they are performed with a clear and specific method. We hope that the results of this analysis can inform whether an adequate method is being followed when carrying out RRs. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This study does not involve direct participation of patients or consumers. [Using simple microsimulation to estimate risk difference from a meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473454/using-simple-microsimulation-to-estimate-risk-difference-from-a-meta-analysis) Background: Absolute risk reduction or risk difference (RD) is a key effect measure required for decision-making and its confidence interval (CI) is the basis for imprecision judgments. Many methodology groups (e.g., Cochrane and GRADE) recommend obtaining RD from linear transformation of a risk ratio (RR) that is usually derived from a meta-analysis. This transformation uses an assumed baseline risk (BR) and follows the equation RD= RR X (RR-1). The 95% CI of RD is derived from the same equation using the 95% CI of RR. Objectives: In this proposal, we demonstrate several limitations to this traditional approach using a simulated case study and offer an alternative approach. Methods: We simulated a case study using a published systematic review [beta blockers vs. placebo on all-cause mortality in symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, RR, 0.79 (0.66-0.96)]. The first analysis was based on the traditional linear transformation of RR into RD using BR that we simulated from 0% to 100%. The second analysis is based on the proposed new approach which is a microsimulation in which RR is drawn from a Lognormal distribution with mean and standard error of the identified RR and BR is drawn from a Beta distribution which shape parameters were derived from a population-based study [Olmsted County, Minnesota, Mortality at 1 year= 0.29 (0.27-0.31)]. 10,000 simulations (draws) generated RD histogram with median, 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles (Open-source code in R). Results: The traditional approach (Figure 1) demonstrates these limitations: 1) RD CI does not incorporate uncertainty in BR and derives all its uncertainty from the treatment effect, 2) CI widens linearly as BR increases, making RD estimates imprecise in higher-risk populations (counterintuitive), and very precise in low-risk populations (potentially misleadingly precise as it ignores uncertainty in BR). The proposed approach (Figure 2), produces a joint distribution of RD that incorporates uncertainty in BR to resolve the limitations of the first approach. Conclusions: Simple transformation of RR into RD has many limitations and does not incorporate uncertainty in BR. An alternative proposed approach incorporates uncertainty in BR that was derived from a population-based study. Patient/public/consumer involvement: None. [Evidence Based Research Training School](/colloquium-2023/session/1473892/evidence-based-research-training-school) Background and objectives: The overall aim of the training school (TS) is to introduce to the participants the concept of Evidence Based Research (EBR) and support their ability to use existing evidence synthesis to justify, design and place results of the new study in the context of existing knowledge in order to avoid redundant research. Methods: The TS is targeted at Early Career Investigators and senior Clinical Health Researchers who are interested in how to perform EBR. Following several working meetings of the group that has knowledge of existing courses and training in Systematic reviews, Evidence-Based Medicine/Practice/Healthcare, etc., from various organisations such as Cochrane, JBI, GRADE, etc., and by analysis of the content of their curricula and by an iterative discussion in the group, pilot EBR TS were designed, which were tested in Tartu in 2019 and then evolved to synchronous on-line teaching and in the end were developed as an asynchronous on-line course on the Moodle and Canvas platforms. The evaluation form for participants was designed and applied, and feedback from teachers and facilitators of TS plus feedback from EVidence Based RESearch - EVBRES COST Action Programme Management Group and Core Group were received and analyzed with every new version of TS. Results: The curriculum and programme of TS were designed and tested. We taught the TS seven times to over 150 successful participants who finished the whole TS. TS is divided into 14 modules. Each module has its own specific interactive content. The overall rating of TS by our participants was 4.34 on a scale one (poor) to five (Excellent). Conclusions: The development of the EBR TS is a significant step in increasing awareness around EBR among researchers, raising the importance of the development of trustworthy and important evidence synthesis and primary research in the context of existing evidence and thus preventing research waste. Consumer involvement: Several colleagues originally inexperienced in EBR or Evidence-Based Practice education were involved in the design of the TS, so the TS development was co-informed by their needs in EBR knowledge and skills. [Boosting global and local partnerships to promote equitable access of COVID-19 guideline recommendations: case study in China](/colloquium-2023/session/1473758/boosting-global-and-local-partnerships-to-promote-equitable-access-of-covid-19-guideline-recommendations-case-study-in-china) Background: The eCOVID19 Recommendations Map and Gateway to Contextualization (RecMap) is a living platform presenting 7280 guideline recommendations. Funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), RecMap involves the collaboration of over 40 partner organisations globally and has launched a knowledge mobilisation (KM) project to benefit wider stakeholders in different countries. Objectives: To increase the awareness, use, and engagement of the RecMap among guideline developers in China and to identify barriers encountered in the KM activities. Methods: We used a co-design framework to guide our activities, where the RecMap central team, China team leads, voice of local stakeholders and public, and the context of China COVID-19 policies were considered in planning and iterating the activities. These activities include group discussion, local stakeholder consultation, guideline adolopment (contextualise and adopt recommendations from existing guidelines), plain language recommendation (PLR) translation, webinars, and social media release. We ensured an inclusive participation of age and gender, guideline developers from both clinical and research background, and public involvement. Results: We collaborated with China GRADE Centres, Cochrane China Network Affiliates, and Cochrane Campbell Global Ageing Partnership. We conducted 10 discussions and consultations with experts and held webinars with 1.4 million views. We found that local policies and language are key barriers for introducing and implementing RecMap recommendations in China. The restricted and unpredictable China COVID-19 policies in the past months have hindered our guideline adolopment progress, so it is important to test the feasibility of KM activity with local stakeholders at an early stage to avoid waste of time and resources. To encourage more Chinese to visit the English RecMap website, we prioritised translation of 40 PLRs into Chinese. After identifying mistakes in PLRs translated by volunteers, we established a workflow with professional translator, methodology editor, clinical editor, and citizen editor to co-produce Chinese PLRs to ensure quality and readability. Conclusions: The rapid global health challenges require us to establish a collaborative platform and streamline the collaboration process for each stakeholder spending less time and fewer resources on negotiating the mechanisms to achieve more efficient, effective, and equitable partnership outcomes. Public involvement: Citizen editor was involved in PLR development. [Evaluation of the Interim Cochrane Rapid Review Methods guidance - a mixed-methods study on the understanding of and adherence to the guidance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473427/evaluation-of-the-interim-cochrane-rapid-review-methods-guidance---a-mixed-methods-study-on-the-understanding-of-and-adherence-to-the-guidance) Objectives: The Cochrane Rapid Review Methods Group (RRMG) developed interim guidance to support authors in conducting rapid reviews (RRs). The objective of this mixed-methods study was to assess the adherence to and usability of this guidance. We also explored why some Cochrane authors of COVID-19-related reviews preferred doing a full systematic review (SR) over an RR (see published protocol: https://osf.io/3a8zb). Methods: We identified all reviews citing the Interim Cochrane RRMG guidance up to February 17, 2022, and performed an exploratory adherence analysis. We interviewed 20 RR authors to assess the comprehensibility of recommendations and reasons for any deviations. Further, we surveyed nine authors of COVID-19-related full SR. Results: We analyzed 128 RRs (111 non-Cochrane, 17 Cochrane) citing the Interim Cochrane RRMG guidance. Several recommendations were not followed by a large proportion of RR authors, whereas in some cases, full SR methodology was used instead of recommended abbreviations. The recommendations that were not followed by the most-analyzed RRs were the stepwise approach to study design inclusion (97%), limiting the number of outcomes (88%), and peer review of at least one search strategy (88%). The rationale for using a standardized title and abstract form was not obvious to some RR authors, and 39%/45% preferred dual independent screening of abstracts/full texts over screening only excludes dually. The most reported reasons for deviating from the guidance were time constraints, unclarities in the recommended approach, or inapplicability to the specific RR. Overall, the guidance was viewed as user-friendly. However, without pre-existing experience of SR conduct, applying the guidance was perceived as difficult. The main reasons for conducting a full COVID-19-related SR over an RR despite the time pressure during the pandemic were late availability of the guidance, preset mandate to conduct an SR, lack of methodological clarity, and inapplicability to the evidence base. Conclusions: Clarifications are warranted throughout the Interim Cochrane RRMG guidance to ensure that users with various experience levels can understand and apply its recommendations accordingly. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We interviewed RRMG guidance users for feedback on its comprehensibility and usability to improve the interim guidance. [Less Ethical Challenges, More Trial Compliance: Progress and Methodological Elements of Zelen's Design](/colloquium-2023/session/1473691/less-ethical-challenges-more-trial-compliance-progress-and-methodological-elements-of-zelen's-design) Background: Classical randomized controlled trials often meet difficulties in enrollment and compliance due to subjects' preference for the randomization scheme. Zelen's design can largely resolve these issues through randomizing subjects before informing stage. Objectives: This study systematically reviewed the progress of Zelen's design and its modifications in clinical research and clarified its methodological elements, advantages, and limitations. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted for Zelen's design from the inception of databases (PubMed, Cochrane library, CNKI, WanFang, and Vip database) to February 2023. The data were extracted, including sample size, population characters, length of follow-up, Zelen's model, group shifting, and statistical methods. Results: One hundred twelve trials were included. The range of sample size was from 15 to 23,024. The longest follow-up length was 17.2 years. The dominant disease in this design was mental disorders (21, 18.75%), followed by osteoarthrosis diseases (16, 14.29%), cancer (11, 9.82%), cardiovascular diseases (10, 8.93%), and others. Regarding types of consent, more than half of the trials used a double-consent (57, 50.89%), 32 (28.57%) used a single-consent, and others did not report the consent procedure. Twelve trials (10.71%) used a modified Zelen's design nested within an observational study. This design used a two-stage informed consent. Stage 1, patients were invited to participate in a cohort study; Stage 2, patients randomized in the experimental group were informed of the allocation result and inquired whether they would like to follow the treatment. Five trials used the McNulty-Zelen design, which could be applied in cluster randomized controlled trials and overcome the potential bias of the Hawthorne effect, e.g., trials involving educational interventions. Informed consent was obtained from a third party on behalf of the participants. Intention-to-treat analysis was the main population used in Zelen's design. Conclusions: Zelen's design has a broad application foreground in clinical trials. It also could adapt to research needs by combining with various observational studies. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients or consumers participated in research activities. [The Central Editorial Service: who we are, what we do, and what happens to your draft after submission](/colloquium-2023/session/1473846/the-central-editorial-service-who-we-are-what-we-do-and-what-happens-to-your-draft-after-submission) Background: Cochrane has embarked on an important change programme to transform the way that we produce high-quality, independent and timely evidence. By 31 March 2024, the editorial process for all submitted protocols, reviews and updates will be managed centrally by the Central Editorial Service. Objectives: To explain the rationale for and workings of the Central Editorial Service for both prospective authors and members of Cochrane entities. Description: The Central Editorial Service currently handles the editorial process for most drafts submitted for publication in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). This will progress to all content from 31 March 2024. The separation of the process of producing Cochrane Reviews from the editorial process to assess their suitability for publication in the Cochrane Library represents a major change for Cochrane. This talk will explain the rationale for the Central Editorial Service, and the difference between the Central Editorial Service and a Cochrane Review Group, which remains an understandable source of confusion for many Cochrane contributors. The presentation will explain the editorial process from submission, editorial assessment and peer review to the final editorial decision We will also signpost to other Colloquium workshops that authors may find helpful in preparing their Cochrane Reviews. [Colloquium 2023 Abstract - Central Editorial Service Oral Presentation.pdf](https://colloquium2023-submissions.cochrane.org/sites/2023.colloquium.cochrane.org/files/uploads/users/u17795/Colloquium%202023%20Abstract%20-%20Central%20Editorial%20Service%20Oral%20Presentation.pdf) [Developing capacity for the production and use of Living Evidence in decision making: The LE to Inform Health decisions project.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473900/developing-capacity-for-the-production-and-use-of-living-evidence-in-decision-making-the-le-to-inform-health-decisions-project.) Background: It is necessary to invest in strategies that allow groups and organizations in charge of developing evidence synthesis to inform clinical or health policy decisions and effectively incorporate new emergent evidence in the development of knowledge transfer (KT) products such as clinical practice guidelines (CPG), health technology assessment (HTA), and structured evidence summaries. Objectives: To develop and evaluate a capacity-building strategy for health sector organizations to incorporate the living evidence (LE) model in the development of KT products. Methods: The project was developed in three phases: P1. Definition of a guidance framework; P2. Training in LE strategy and supporting tools; P3. Applying the framework and acquiring knowledge in the development of real-life LE synthesis following the learning-by-doing methodology. Study population: Technical staff working on CPG, developing organizations, HTA agencies, and tertiary hospitals running institutional HTA. The Epistemonikos-L.OVE platform and tools were used as the technological enablers for the LE process. Each component of the capacity-building strategy was evaluated through online anonymous surveys. A final set of in-depth interviews were conducted to evaluate the whole capacity-building strategy used. Results: Phase 1: Based on methodological articles and brainstorming meetings, we developed a preliminary framework. After its testing among potential users and expert consultation, the final version of the framework was used in the next phases of the project. For phases 2 and 3, we enrolled 21 team members from a total of seven organizations. Six training workshops in the LE methodology and Epistemonikos tools were carried out. Participating organizations' teams developed a total of seven living evidence syntheses following the framework and using Epistemonikos tools. They maintained the evidence surveillance and related monitoring tasks for at least 8 months, which were reported on a monthly basis and made available at the project website (https://livingevidenceframework.com/en/platform/). Eighty-five percent of participants took part of the online survey and 68% of in-depth interviews to evaluate the capacity-building strategy. Conclusions: We addressed three basic needs to build a sustainable capacity among groups and organizations for the production and use of LE synthesis: the need for having guidance; for training; and for being supported during the process. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [Misinformation in COVID-19: nimble innovation within Cochrane to appraise the source](/colloquium-2023/session/1473665/misinformation-in-covid-19-nimble-innovation-within-cochrane-to-appraise-the-source) Background: During COVID-19, the public was put in danger by erroneous beliefs derived from poor-quality research amplified through social media. In the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG), we needed to be innovative with methods to address COVID-19 misinformation. Here, we will present this evolving response, leading to an approach to appraise research that caused unsubstantiated hypotheses. In this process, we adapted Cochrane methods to appraise comparative serological studies. Objectives: 1. To present the CIDG strategy to address the COVID-19 misinformation pandemic. 2. To outline novel methods for critically appraising comparative serological studies. Methods: The CIDG identified important areas of misinformation where our methods could provide an authoritative voice. This started with Cochrane Reviews of trials to help end the use of unapproved drugs for COVID-19 (chloroquine and ivermectin). Later, we identified a potentially misinformed hypothesis derived from laboratory research (\"microclots\" cause the post-COVID-19 syndrome [PCS]) leading to public demand for the treatment plasmapheresis. Because there were no randomized controlled trials, we rigorously appraised these laboratory studies using Cochrane principles in collaboration with laboratory scientists and thrombotic disorder specialists. Results: Cochrane Reviews of trials of chloroquine and ivermectin challenged fake and poorly conducted science in the public narrative; some trials were excluded from the ivermectin review based on a failure to fulfill the expected ethical and scientific criteria. These reviews were highly cited and used as the gold standard to state there was no evidence these treatments worked. Conducting a Cochrane Review of plasmapheresis for PCS was problematic, as trials had not been conducted and would be expensive. So we used novel methods to appraise the comparative serological studies that generated the hypothesis that microclots were associated with PCS. We identified bias across three domains: collection and handling of samples; experimental methodology; and reporting and interpretation of results. Conclusions: Sometimes policy needs systematic reviews that evaluate the rationale for a treatment to help justify whether a trial is worth doing. These can be laboratory studies with sera or animal studies. Cochrane principles and methods can be adapted to meet this need, but flexibility within Cochrane formats and editorial policies could facilitate this. [TRIPOD-SRMA: Reporting guideline for transparent reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prediction model studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473878/tripod-srma-reporting-guideline-for-transparent-reporting-of-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-of-prediction-model-studies) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of prediction model studies range in breadth and can aim to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence about existing models and their predictive performance. They differ in many important ways from SRs of intervention studies. Emphasis is on predictive performance of models obtained from internal or external validation, rather than effect sizes. Although TRIPOD provides guidance for reporting primary prediction model studies and PRISMA 2020 is available for SRs of interventions, there is currently no tailored guideline for reporting SRs of prediction model studies. Objectives: To develop a tailored checklist for the transparent reporting of SRs and MAs of diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies. Methods: We formed an executive committee responsible for developing TRIPOD-SRMA. Reporting items from existing guidelines such as TRIPOD, PRISMA 2020 and others were used to produce the initial checklist. A modified Delphi approach was then used to elicit views from a wider group of experts with experience of SRs and primary prediction model studies. In the first round, 86 individuals were invited to participate, of whom 43 participants responded and formed the Delphi panel. Online surveys were used to inform the consensus process on which items to include and gather feedback to refine the checklist. After two Delphi rounds and consideration of all feedback, TRIPOD-SRMA was finalised and approved by all members of the executive committee. Results: The new TRIPOD-SRMA checklist will be presented. It consists of 26 reporting items within six sections. Some reporting items remain unchanged or minimally modified from PRISMA 2020 as there are common elements to all SRs. However, 11 items have been tailored or included specifically to address SRs of prediction model studies. A checklist for abstracts is also included. Conclusions: TRIPOD-SRMA and the accompanying checklist for abstracts provide the first reporting guideline for SRs and MAs of prediction model studies. Use of TRIPOD-SRMA by journals and authors will help to improve transparency of SRs of prediction model studies and ensure readers can more easily evaluate the evidence for existing prediction models within a clinical field. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Incorporating data from atypical experimental study designs in systematic reviews: experiences from Cochrane Infectious Diseases](/colloquium-2023/session/1473535/incorporating-data-from-atypical-experimental-study-designs-in-systematic-reviews-experiences-from-cochrane-infectious-diseases) Background: For ethical, logistical and cost-related reasons, studies examining interventions to prevent occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases often use atypical experimental designs. Analysis methods for these study designs may be established, but inclusion of data from these studies in systematic reviews often raises unique challenges, which methodological experts at Cochrane Infectious Diseases must overcome by determining appropriate analysis approaches. Objectives: To present examples of atypical experimental study designs and outline how Cochrane Infectious Diseases authors have included data from these study designs in systematic reviews. Methods: We qualitatively reviewed examples of the inclusion of atypical experimental study designs in Cochrane Infectious Diseases reviews in recent years. We extracted information on the key features of these study designs and the analysis approach used by review authors to synthesise data from these studies. A descriptive account of the main issues that were encountered, and lessons learnt are presented. Results: We identified three key examples of inclusion of data from atypical experimental study designs in Cochrane Infectious Diseases reviews: namely, the inclusion of 1) interrupted time series studies in a review of space spraying for preventing malaria transmission; 2) experimental hut studies in a review of piperonyl butoxide combined with pyrethroids in insecticidetreated nets to prevent malaria; and 3) a cluster-randomised, test-negative study in a review of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes mosquitoes for preventing dengue infection. Review authors used various approaches to synthesise data from these studies. Conclusions: Even when studies with atypical experimental designs have been carefully planned, conducted and analysed, it is not always the case that study authors report effect estimates and standard errors that can be entered directly into RevMan. Review authors must occasionally calculate effect estimates that take special features of the data (for example, clustering or seasonality) into consideration. Where effect estimates and standard errors are reported by the study authors, literature presenting the development of the atypical experimental study design and accompanying analysis methods should be reviewed carefully. Collaboration between Cochrane statisticians is key to ensuring robustness of methods and results reported from reviews that include studies with atypical experimental designs. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Enhancing capacity for network meta-analysis in Sub-Saharan Africa](/colloquium-2023/session/1473806/enhancing-capacity-for-network-meta-analysis-in-sub-saharan-africa) Background: The use of network meta-analysis (NMA) in systematic reviews (SRs) of effects is increasing. Despite skilled researchers and biostatisticians in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with access to formal training in evidence synthesis, there is limited training in NMA. Objectives: To describe our experience with enhancing capacity for NMA in SSA. Methods: We developed two NMA online courses. The 8-week Primer in NMA SRs helped participants to find, appraise, interpret, and consider the use of NMA while the 5-week Global NMA Masterclass facilitated conduct of NMA using Stata and R. A multidisciplinary team collaborated to develop the content and format with text-based lessons, self-assessments, embedded lectures, asynchronous discussions, and weekly synchronous Q&A sessions. We integrated HIV/TB and COVID clinical examples. Participants provided feedback and facilitators reflected on implementation. Results: Forty-three participants (post-graduate students, clinicians, and decision-makers from various SSA countries) attended. They reported that the training was very relevant to their work. The self-directed, online learning approach enabled participants to learn at their convenience. However, some participants lacked motivation and commitment. As NMA is complex, requiring dedicated learning schedules, participants reported that they needed more time, and some would have preferred in-person learning. Using examples relevant to SSA and everyday problems encountered by clinicians made the learning more authentic. Conclusions: These were the first courses related to NMA offered in SSA. Harnessing the benefits of online learning while being cognizant of the challenges and striving to improve on the offering is key for future training. There is great potential to conduct NMA across SSA. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement in the development and offering of our courses. However, given the significant interest in the examples used in the NMA workshop (HIV/TB and COVID), and their impact on patients' lives and wellbeing, we would welcome public partnership in drawing attention to our findings. [Message Lab - a platform for research and improvement of public health messages](/colloquium-2023/session/1473809/message-lab---a-platform-for-research-and-improvement-of-public-health-messages) Relevance and importance to patients: The aim of the Message Lab is to help improve how evidence-based public health messages are communicated, so that the messages and underlying research are informative and correctly understood by patients and the public. Background: Well-designed public health messages can make people aware of what they can do (or not do) for their health and help them to make informed choices. On the other hand, poorly designed messages can confuse people, lead to poorly informed decisions, and diminish trust in health authorities and research. Objectives: To set up a platform to facilitate the design and evaluation of public health messages. Methods: Our starting point is evidence-based guidance for effective health communication, including the use of simple and familiar wording, clear visual design, and careful testing in target audiences. We will prioritise questions together with an international advisory group, focusing on important uncertainties about how best to communicate information about the effects of health interventions. These include, for example, how to communicate uncertainty about effects, the use of positive versus negative framing for different types of decisions, and the use of visual displays of intervention effects. We identified recruitment platforms that can be used for online randomized trials and platforms for user testing. We assessed these based on several criteria. We then tested selected platforms in a randomized trial comparing three ways of communicating the overall uncertainty of effects and comparing including the margin of error (confidence interval) with not including it. Results: In this presentation, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different user testing and recruitment platforms for online randomized trials, and we will present the findings of our trial of different ways of communicating the uncertainty of effects. Conclusions: The Message Lab offers an efficient way for researchers to test different methods of communicating public health messages and for health authorities to design public health messages that are effectively communicated.

Research enters the Evidence Pipeline and goes through tailored workflows involving crowdsourcing and machine learning, working together to produce accurate, reliable metadata about studies. The Evidence Pipeline has been applied at both the review level and at the repository level. At the review level, a workflow called Screen4Me helps to reduce author screening burden through assessment of title-abstract records; at the repository level, studies relevant for Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) or the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (CCSR) are identified using Crowd and machine, helping to keep these important resources up to date. Methods: This presentation will provide a detailed look at the main component parts of the Evidence Pipeline applied at the specific review level (via S4M) and at the data repository level (CENTRAL and CCSR). It will also describe our evaluation work on each component part and on the system as a whole in comparison to traditional methods. Results: At the time of writing, the Evidence Pipeline has been used (via the Screen4Me workflow) in over 100 Cochrane reviews. The mean reduction in screening workload for author teams is 72% with a mean time to screening task completion of ten days per review. At the repository level, 99% of RCTs in CENTRAL have been identified by the Evidence Pipeline. Conclusions: The Cochrane Evidence Pipeline aims to expedite the study identification process for reviews and other evidence synthesis outputs, offering significant workload reduction for author teams within the current review production paradigm, but is also enabling a new paradigm to emerge\u2014one that leverages economies of effort and scale to help create comprehensive, curated repos of studies for the EBHC communities who need it. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The Evidence Pipeline uses Cochrane Crowd which is Cochrane's citizen science platform. Anyone with an interest in health can join Cochrane Crowd. This collective effort has played a significant role in enabling the Cochrane Evidence Pipeline. [Do Cochrane and non-Cochrane editors and authors prefer reporting statements based on statistically significant differences or do they prefer non-binary options?](/colloquium-2023/session/1635101/do-cochrane-and-non-cochrane-editors-and-authors-prefer-reporting-statements-based-on-statistically-significant-differences-or-do-they-prefer-non-binary-options) Background: Background: For decades the p value-based interpretation and reporting of results dominated the publications. Nowadays, the scientific community agrees that this binary approach is not enough. A systemic reform is necessary for moving from this binary approach to some other non-binary options. Some of them, that were discussed in the last Cochrane Handbook version (2019), are the point estimate, the confidence interval, and the minimal important difference, suggesting some narrative statements. However, it is not clear how Cochrane and non-Cochrane editors and authors agree with this approach and, even more important, if all retrieve the same conclusions when they look at some specific results. Objectives: To evaluate how Cochrane and non-Cochrane editors and authors interpret results and which preferred reporting style is for them. Methods: We are conducting an online survey among healthcare professionals and consumers. These stakeholders have to choose the binary or non-binary option that better expresses the results for the following scenario: After exhaustive literature searches, a systematic review identified only two pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of drug X versus placebo (P) in patients with a rare genetic disease. The risk of bias for all domains was low in both RCTs (assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2 tool), and there was no methodological, clinical, or statistical heterogeneity between studies. The meta-analysis yielded the following results: Mortality risk: X 26%(10/39) and 45%(18/40) Risk 19% Risk CI: 95% Confidence Interval Results: will be shown at the colloquium. Conclusions: It will be interesting to see which preferred reporting statements are for the Cochrane and non-Cochrane communities, and to compare the preferences between authors and editors. Besides, we will know the level of agreement or disagreement in each group, which is critical for the efficiency of the editorial process. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Proper interpretation of study results is critical for the healthcare process [Non-randomised studies of interventions in systematic reviews - Limitations and opportunities illustrated with an exemplary review on COVID-19 vaccination in children](/colloquium-2023/session/1574269/non-randomised-studies-of-interventions-in-systematic-reviews---limitations-and-opportunities-illustrated-with-an-exemplary-review-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-children) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) often provide the highest certainty evidence for decision-making. However, if RCTs are not available to inform specific health questions, other study designs should be considered. This includes nonrandomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), which are frequently used in the field of vaccination. Objectives: The key objectives are to illustrate the limitations and opportunities of including NRSIs in SRs using an exemplary review on vaccination against COVID-19 in children. Methods: The exemplary review (https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(23)00078-0) followed Cochrane methodological standards. Drawing on the experience gained in the review process, practical challenges from study selection to interpretation of results will be illustrated. Further, limitations and opportunities of using NRSIs for informed decision making will be explored. Results: The following key challenges in conducting our review with NRSIs were observed: (1) diversity of study designs (e.g., traditional cohort, ecological or test-negative case-control studies) in the field of vaccination, introducing clinical and methodological heterogeneity. (2) Additional risks of bias beyond the ones known from RCTs that originate from several factors pre-, at-, and postintervention level, particularly relating to methods used for selecting the study population, assignment of intervention groups and implementation of the intervention. (3) NRSIs often present different measures of adjusted effects (e.g., risk ratios, odds ratios or incidence risk ratios), challenging the synthesis of vaccine effectiveness estimates. (4) The evidence derived from NRSIs in a fast-changing pandemic situation requires very careful interpretation in relation to applicability and transferability (e.g., baseline immunity of study population and general population or investigated virus variants). Conclusions: NRSIs are usually at a higher risk of bias and more heterogeneous in design than RCTs. Especially in fast-changing epidemiological landscapes, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, available RCT data were quickly outdated, whereas some NRSIs timely addressed changes in epidemiology (e.g., shift of variants). When considering concomitant limitations, our experience showed that NRSIs in this exemplary SR could be successfully used for timely information of health policy and practice. Consumer involvement: The paediatric working group of the Standing Committee on Immunisation (STIKO) in Germany was involved from prioritisation of the review question to interpretation of the findings. [Partnerships for practice improvement: JBI's collaborative approach to resources](/colloquium-2023/session/1473687/partnerships-for-practice-improvement-jbi's-collaborative-approach-to-developing-evidence-based-point-of-care-resources) Background: Developing clinically relevant, trustworthy, evidence-based resources to connect research to practice and assist with informing clinical decision-making is central to the improvement of healthcare outcomes. Development of such resources requires a multifaceted, coordinated, collaborative partnership approach. JBI has established a unique framework to engage and collaborate with key stakeholders across 32 specialty field areas to develop rigorous, up-to-date, clinically relevant evidence-based resources to inform clinical practice. Objective: To describe and discuss the JBI framework for collaborative partnership for practice improvement within the core activities of the JBI Transfer Science program. Results: Underpinned by a rigorous methodological approach, more than 5,000 evidence-based resources across 32 specialty fields have been developed using a collaborative partnership framework. The core components and key characteristics of the partnership approach (including a scientific methodology group, expert reference groups, field collaborators and scientific writers) will be presented alongside discussion of the practicalities, enablers and barriers of implementing this framework within specialty field groups. The individual and shared role and function of the group will be explored with supportive examples demonstrating impact on practice. Conclusion: Incorporating a strategic framework that focuses on collaborative partnerships, in which a shared common goal between the groups is to improve evidence-based practice, can assist with reducing the research-practice gap and improving care delivery. [Highlights and challenges of co-creating evidence-based knowledge translation tools for parents about the COVID-19 pandemic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473615/highlights-and-challenges-of-co-creating-evidence-based-knowledge-translation-tools-for-parents-about-the-covid-19-pandemic) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented need for trusted evidence. We have an established program to co-create knowledge translation (KT) tools for parents and families that merge the best available research evidence with parent experiences to support decision-making for their children's health. We received funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to conduct qualitative research to identify parents' experiences and information needs related to the pandemic and to co-create six KT tools. Objectives: Describe the process of co-creating evidence-based KT tools for parents and discuss highlights and challenges. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups with parents to understand their experiences and information needs related to caring for their children during the pandemic. We involved our established parent advisory group throughout the process to guide methods, pilot test processes, assist with recruitment, review KT tool prototypes, and participate in usability testing. Results: The following themes were identified among parents who had managed a child with COVID-19: dealing with uncertainty, anxiety, stress and stigma, and getting through it. Themes related to the pandemic more generally were the following: loss of skill (children), changes in physical health, children's and parents' mental health, and accessing trustworthy information. After discussing themes with the parent advisory group, three topic areas were selected for KT tool development: managing a child with COVID-19, socialization during and beyond the pandemic, and COVID-19 vaccination. Six tools were developed: animated video and interactive infographic for each topic (https://www.echokt.ca/covid/). Conclusions: A highlight and strength was working directly with parents. We involved our established parent advisory group as a partner on the funding application and throughout the project, and we believe this was critical to our success. Challenges included the number of KT tools (2 tools on each of 3 topics) developed using multiple methods (interviews, focus groups, living evidence synthesis) within a relatively short timeframe; changing evidence, information and protocols over time and across jurisdictions; reliance on external sources for evidence and information; appropriate messaging (informative vs. directive); and acknowledging and affirming parents' varied experiences. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Parents contributed to methods, pilot testing, recruitment, KT tool development, and usability testing. [Unlocking innovations for sharing and using Cochrane content with study centric data management and a focused review article](/colloquium-2023/session/1473562/unlocking-innovations-for-sharing-and-using-cochrane-content-with-study-centric-data-management-and-a-focused-review-article) Background: Cochrane was founded in 1993 and has grown into a global network producing gold standard evidence syntheses. Over those years we have been doing things in the same way and during that time the field has evolved. To maintain our place as one of the world's leaders in producing trusted evidence, we are making some big changes in 2023. Reviews will be shorter. Users of evidence are best served by a more focused article. This also makes writing and updating reviews simpler as you do not need to make changes in multiple places. The main body of the review will contain sections that are most useful to users of Cochrane evidence, with a clearer distinction between the main article and supplementary materials. With a shorter review, we are moving the structure to where it is needed most: the data. This change is powered by moving to study centric data management in RevMan, which comes with a host of benefits for authors. By improving the structure of data associated with Cochrane reviews, we can increase their impact by making it easier for policy makers, guideline developers, and others to reuse our evidence. Objectives: This presentation will provide an update on changes to the review format and data management for Cochrane reviews. It will cover: 1. Why has Cochrane changed the review format and how data are managed in RevMan? 2. What does it mean for review authors, editors, peer reviewers, and users of Cochrane evidence? 3. How the changes will unlock the potential for innovations in how we tailor our evidence for key stakeholders. Conclusions: The standardized review article with more structured data will result in a better experience for authors, with the reassurance that fewer words do not equate to lower standards. The process of producing Cochrane reviews will be more efficient, facilitating living reviews and unlocking the potential for innovations in how we tailor our evidence for key stakeholders. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: User experience testing and consultations informed developments. [Driving the evidence-based healthcare agenda forward: a qualitative reflexive thematic analysis of global health partnerships](/colloquium-2023/session/1473649/driving-the-evidence-based-healthcare-agenda-forward-a-qualitative-reflexive-thematic-analysis-of-global-health-partnerships) Background: The global evidence community has long recognised that collaboration is key to producing trustworthy, pragmatic evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for partnerships in developing rapid evidence-informed responses, streamlining global efforts, reducing research waste and ensuring the best-available evidence is accessible, transparent and understood. There is, however, growing concern about making partnerships equitable for\u2014and beneficial to\u2014all partners. Although collaboration has increased, vested interests, bureaucracy and inability to adapt remain limiting factors. The campaign for World Evidence-Based Healthcare (EBHC) Day 2022 focused on 'partnerships for purpose' within and across the global evidence ecosystem, calling on the global evidence community to share their experiences through blog submissions around the formation, development, maintenance, evaluation and outcomes of partnerships in EBHC. Objectives: To explore the challenges, facilitators and outcomes of global health partnerships promoting and supporting evidence-based healthcare. Methods: This is an inductive qualitative study of the 41 blogs published for the World EBHC Day 2022 Campaign. Analysis was conducted using reflexive thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke. Results: Numerous themes were identified across three research foci, including shared challenges experienced across partnerships relating to the lack of equity, diversity and inclusion policies, practice or understanding; navigating different operational systems and working practices; and programmatic misalignment. Results indicated that key facilitators for successful partnerships were dedicated resources for partnership management; commitment to information sharing, transparency and open communication; a focus on equity, diversity and inclusion; ensuring a common purpose and aligned values; and working to actively build trust, respect, relationships and social capital. Reported outcomes from partnerships included increased efficiencies and reduced duplication of effort; leveraging shared resources and expertise; addressing knowledge needs/gaps; increased funding opportunities; professional development; and expanded networks, increased reach and global impact. Conclusions: Since COVID-19, we have had to come to terms with a tectonic shift in how our partnerships and relationships will work in its aftermath. To this end, the findings from this study and the 41 blogs published for World EBHC Day provide valuable lessons for navigating new ways of working together. Patient, public, health consumer involvement: Several blogs were written by patient advocates. [Stakeholder involvement for investigating communication-based interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake](/colloquium-2023/session/1473679/stakeholder-involvement-for-investigating-communication-based-interventions-to-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake) Background: Long-awaited COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19 disease. However, vaccine hesitancy, identified as one of the top 10 threats to global health by the WHO, has proven to be an important issue in the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: Involve important stakeholder in the review process and investigate the effectiveness of communication strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine intention. Methods: Within this project funded by the Germany Research Foundation, we invited stakeholders to an online meeting to develop a relevant research question. The discussion was based on the findings of our prior scoping review, which maps current evidence on interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine intention. Together with relevant stakeholders from policy and research, we prioritised types of interventions and target populations and developed the PICO for a subsequent systematic review. We will discuss the implementation of the intervention strategies, identified in the systematic review, in another stakeholder meeting by the end of the project. Results: As the initial stakeholder meeting was so successful, most stakeholders agreed to further participate in the project and be involved in the upcoming systematic review. Thus, we had biweekly meetings until the end of the project with experts from the Robert Koch Institute and the NRW Center for Health. We conducted the planned systematic review of randomised controlled trials and included studies investigating communication-based interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, for any population. The policymakers were particularly interested in communication strategies, as these are easy to implement. Outcome measures, considered most relevant by the stakeholder, were COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine confidence and intention. We performed meta-analyses using Review Manager Desktop version 5.4. Our findings included 27 studies. Evidence from our meta-analyses shows that for COVID-19 vaccine uptake there may be a slight increase in vaccine uptake when education and information strategies or social norm strategies are applied, compared to no intervention. Conclusions: Our findings will have implications for policy decision-making in prospective vaccination promotion, not only regarding COVID-19. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Involving stakeholders in the review process ensured that relevant research questions are answered and facilitated translation and dissemination of the results. [Methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in dermatology: a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1635103/methodological-and-reporting-quality-of-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-in-dermatology-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: There has been an increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in dermatology over the past decade, however the quality of these studies is unknown. Objectives: To determine the change in the methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in dermatology over the past decade. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in dermatology published in the 10 highest ranked dermatology journals in 2010 and 2019. Included studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCA, CCRCT, CMR, HTA, and NHS EED. Methodological quality was assessed in duplicate by two independent investigators with the ROBIS tool and, for studies of interventions, the AMSTAR-2 tools. Reporting quality was assessed with the PRISMA 2009 and PRISMA-A 2013 statements. Results: We identified 27 systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in 2010 and 127 published in 2019. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of systematic reviews and meta-analyses at high/unclear risk of bias with ROBIS (Fisher's exact test = 1.00) or with critically low methodological quality using AMSTAR-2 (Fisher's exact test = 0.456), between 2010 and 2019. The difference in proportion of systematic reviews and meta-analyses at high/unclear overall risk of bias with ROBIS was -1.2% (95% CI -17.3%-14.9%) in 2010 (81.4%) than 2019 (82.6%) (Figures 1-2). There was evidence of a difference in proportion of PRISMA (t(26)=2.7, p=0.01), and very strong evidence of a difference in proportion of PRISMA-A (t(26)=4.2, p<0.001) checklist items adequately reported between 2010 and 2019. The difference in mean proportion of PRISMA checklist items adequately reported was 3.6 items more (95% CI 1.8 - 5.4 items more) in 2019 (mean=10.7 items, SD=2.4 items) than 2010 (mean=7.1 items, SD=2.9 items), and of PRISMA-A checklist items adequately reported was 1.1 items more (95% CI 0.2-2.0 items more) in 2019 (mean=5.6 items, SD=1.5 items) than 2010 (mean=4.4 items, SD=1.7 items) Conclusions: There was no improvement in the methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in dermatology between 2010 and 2019, but strong evidence of an improvement in the reporting quality. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Supplementing Systematic Review Evidence with Health System Data: A Target Trial Emulation of Triptan in Migraine Patients with Increased Cardiovascular Risk](/colloquium-2023/session/1473458/supplementing-systematic-review-evidence-with-health-system-data-a-target-trial-emulation-of-triptan-in-migraine-patients-with-increased-cardiovascular-risk) Background: A recent framework from the US Evidence-based Practice Centers advises that when evidence from systematic reviews is deemed insufficient for decision-making, electronic health record (EHR) data from health systems should be considered to fill the knowledge gap. A 2021 systematic review demonstrated that triptans improved pain and function for acute migraine attacks. However, the systematic review identified insufficient evidence about patients with increased risk of cardiovascular events who were often excluded from clinical trials. Objectives: To evaluate the safety of triptan treatments in migraine patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors using EHR data from a large tri-state health system. Methods: This target trial emulated a randomized clinical trial that hypothetically assigned patients to triptans or no triptan treatments. Eligible patients were adults (aged 18 years) with at least a 1-year history of migraines, confirmed cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or with at least two cardiovascular risk factors. Patients in the triptan group were matched with those in the no-triptan group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 60 days of starting treatments. Results: A total of 3,719 patients who received triptan were matched to 3,719 patients who did not receive triptans (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the cumulative incidence curves for MACE. The absolute risk of MACE outcomes was low (Table 2). At 60 days, 154 patients (4.14%) in the triptan group reported a MACE outcome compared to 37 patients (0.99%) in the no triptan group (RR: - 5.84). Patients significantly higher risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, and heart failure. Five patients (0.13%) in the triptan group died versus seven (0.19%) in the non-triptan group. Certainty in the evidence was judged to be moderate. Conclusions: This target trial emulation showed that triptans were associated with increased risk of MACE outcomes, raising the certainty of evidence in this outcome from insufficient, as was judged in a systematic review, to moderate. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Updating the web-based \"Right Review\" tool: an international Delphi process](/colloquium-2023/session/1473657/updating-the-web-based-right-review-tool-an-international-delphi-process) Background: A diverse range of evidence synthesis approaches have been developed to meet end users' (such as policy makers) knowledge needs. Examples include systematic reviews, rapid reviews, scoping reviews, realist reviews, network meta-analysis, meta-narrative reviews, and meta-synthesis. For researchers and those commissioning reviews, choosing the most appropriate method may be confusing. \"Right Review\" is a web-based decision support tool that guides users through a series of simple questions for recommending evidence synthesis methods suitable for their research question. Currently, the tool separates quantitative reviews and qualitative evidence synthesis. Objectives: To update the Right Review tool to establish a common set of questions for the synthesis of both quantitative and qualitative studies. Methods: A two-round modified online international Delphi was conducted (2021) with researchers, policy makers, health care providers, patients, and decision makers. Along with demographic questions, participants were asked to rate the importance and or clarity of the tool guiding questions, definitions of evidence synthesis types, and the tool output structure. A consensus definition of at least 70% agreement for each item was decided a priori. Any items not reaching consensus after round 2 were discussed by the international project steering committee (PSC). Results: Twenty-four experts from 9 countries completed round 1 and 12 round 2. A total of 46 items were presented in round 1, with 21 reaching consensus. Twenty-seven items were presented in round 2, with eight reaching consensus. Items not reaching consensus, including 8 tool guiding questions, 9 review definitions (predominantly related to qualitative evidence), and 2 tool output items, were brought forward for discussion by the PSC. Three items were removed entirely, and the remainder revised and edited and/or combined with existing items. Conclusions: The Delphi process informs the update of this tool which is free, practical decision support tool that helps reviewers choose an appropriate method. [Opioid use disorder treatment in Canada: knowledge sharing between regionalized networks](/colloquium-2023/session/1473509/opioid-use-disorder-treatment-in-canada-knowledge-sharing-between-regionalized-networks) Background: Opioid typically involving buprenorphine methadone as pharmacotherapy, is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and is a key response to growing opioid-related harms in Canada. OAT delivery in Canada varies between provinces/territories, including differences in prescribing requirements and primary care involvement. For provinces/territories that aim to improve OAT delivery, knowledge of other jurisdictions' policies, expected outcomes, and how they have been influenced by political, sociocultural, and health system factors, can inform clinical and policy decision-making. Objectives: To compare OAT prescribing policies across Canadian provinces/territories and understand how and why they occur. Methods: We conducted a comparative policy analysis, collecting data from policies, guidelines, reports, education/training materials, and published research articles on provincial health systems and drug policies. To describe and compare OAT across all Canadian provinces, we constructed timelines of OAT policies for each jurisdiction from 2014. Experts in each province (clinicians; policymakers) reviewed these to ensure accuracy and relevance. We classified these policies based on provider involvement; financial, personnel, and educational resources for providers; treatment settings; and costs to patients. We also examined any cross-provincial interactions and resource sharing. Results: In May 2018, Health Canada removed a federal requirement to obtain an exemption to prescribe methadone, which could increase patients' access to this treatment. After examining provincial policy changes before and after this decision, we identified patterns in OAT prescribing regulations: western jurisdictions (e.g., British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan) tended towards more restrictive prescribing requirements and oversight than their eastern counterparts (e.g., Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia). We also observed similar geographical patterns with recommendations for providers to use training/guidelines from either British Columbia (west) or Ontario (east). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that OUD treatment policies may be influenced by geographical, political, and/or professional networks. What is considered evidence or knowledge for decision-making may be shaped by these factors and local policymaking needs. Patient involvement: By engaging people with lived/living experience and decision-makers, further exploration of these factors and their effect on OUD treatment policies can better inform the development of contextually relevant and appropriate policies to improve OUD care. [Bringing Cochrane reviews to Polish professionals and consumers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473831/bringing-cochrane-reviews-to-polish-professionals-and-consumers) Background: Improving health literacy and increasing the use of reliable health information may reduce vulnerability to unreliable health-related information. Health professionals may help in translating the knowledge to nonprofessionals, but they often find it challenging. Objectives: To show our experiences and pathway of knowledge translation (KT) actions for consumers. Methods: We applied for funding from the Social Responsibility of Science. Project started in the November 2022 and will last for 2 years. The project is based on Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) and plain language summaries (PLSs). We started collaboration with health professionals to prioritise SR's topics which are deemed important to healthcare practice (e.g., physiotherapists) and to patients' groups with whom we already cooperate (e.g., cystic fibrosis patients). Prioritization was based on subjective assessments on a scale from one to ten of the utility of the topic for healthcare practice completed by two healthcare professionals independently. SRs which got the highest assessments and were deemed to be current were grouped into themes by health condition. Results from SRs will be shared using plain language summaries and additionally expressed in the form of infographics and animations. All necessary professional terms will be explained with comic drawings or short (1-3 minute) webinars. The aim for all is to make an easily readable and understandable \"information pill\" from each theme. All our experiences and expertise, gathered from our work as Cochrane Poland, will be structured to prepare the guide for Polish professionals to help in everyday KT. Results: Project is connected with translations of 120 PLSs per year and preparation of additional products (infographics, animations). We expect to have at least three topic themes expressed in plain language and described in graphic forms for presentation during the Cochrane Colloquium. Conclusions: Promotion of SRs among health professionals in Poland still needs effort, but translation of studies results' into easily accessible language for patients and lay audience is even more challenging and emerging. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our project mainly aims to bring professional knowledge from Cochrane SRs close to patients' everyday lives. [Methodological quality of systematic reviews on Chinese herbal medicine: a methodological survey](/colloquium-2023/session/1574147/methodological-quality-of-systematic-reviews-on-chinese-herbal-medicine-a-methodological-survey) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesise the best evidence of effectiveness and safety on Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Decision-making should be supported by the high-quality evidence of prudently conducted SRs, but the trustworthiness of conclusions may be limited by poor methodological rigour. Methods: This survey aimed to examine the methodological quality of a representative sample of SRs on CHM published during January 2018 to March 2020. We conducted literature search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE via Ovid, and EMBASE via Ovid. Eligible SRs must be in Chinese or English with at least one meta-analysis on the treatment effect of any CHM documented in the 2015 Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Two reviewers extracted the bibliographical characteristics of SRs and appraised their methodological quality using AMSTAR 2 (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2). The associations between bibliographical characteristics and methodological quality were investigated using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: We sampled and appraised 148 SRs. Overall, one (0.7%) was of high methodological quality; zero (0%), four (2.7%), and one-hundred forty-three (96.6%) SRs were of moderate, low, and critically low quality. Only 13 SRs (8.8%) provided a pre-defined protocol; none (0%) provided justifications for including particular primary study designs; six (4.1%) conducted a comprehensive literature search; two (1.4%) provided a list of excluded studies; nine (6.1%) undertook meta-analysis with appropriate methods; and seven (4.7%) reported funding sources of included primary studies. Cochrane reviews had higher overall quality than non-Cochrane reviews (P 0.001). SRs with European funding support were less likely to have critically low quality when compared with their counterparts (P = 0.020). SRs conducted by more authors (rs = 0.23; P = 0.006) and published in higher impact factor journals (rs = 0.20; P = 0.044) were associated with higher methodological quality. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the methodological quality of SRs on CHM is low. Future authors should enhance the methodological quality through registering a priori protocols, justifying selection of study designs, conducting comprehensive literature search, providing a list of excluded studies with rationales, using appropriate method for meta-analyses, and reporting funding sources among primary studies. [Use and methodology of framework synthesis in mixed-methods literature reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473821/use-and-methodology-of-framework-synthesis-in-mixed-methods-literature-reviews) Background: Framework synthesis (FS) is a method for synthesis of qualitative research in systematic reviews (SRs), which is being increasingly utilised to synthesise data from diverse sources to explore complex healthcare issues. While published guidance on conducting mixed-methods SRs and qualitative FS is available, there is little consensus on conducting mixed-methods FS. Objectives: To conduct a targeted literature review (TLR) to evaluate the current use and methodology of FS in mixed-methods literature reviews. Methods: This TLR was conducted according to a prespecified protocol. In February 2023, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (via Ovid) for mixed-methods reviews using FS. Records were reviewed by a single individual at the title/abstract and full-text review stages. Information was extracted on rationale for FS use, framework development, extraction, synthesis and integration of quantitative and qualitative data, quality assessment (QA), outputs and reported limitations of FS. Results: We initially identified 240 unique records, of which 123 were excluded at title/abstract review and 68 excluded at full-text review, leaving 49 peer-reviewed publications for analysis. All but four reviews were SRs, with two rapid reviews, one scoping review and one SR of SRs. Primary quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies were eligible for inclusion; secondary research or opinion were included in less than 25% of reviews. Two reviews only extracted author summary or interpretation of quantitative findings. The level of detail on how FS was conducted varied, with some detailing the process step by step and others only citing the method. Very few described how quantitative and qualitative data were integrated. Where reported, methods included convergent synthesis, whereby quantitative data are transformed into qualitative statements through narrative interpretation (\"qualitising\"), and the Pillar Integration Process, whereby data are listed by type and then matched to corresponding qualitative or quantitative data before further synthesis. Most reviews used QA tools designed to appraise multiple study designs; however, some did not perform formal QA owing to heterogeneity. Few reviews cited qualitative reporting guidelines. Conclusions: The volume of mixed-methods literature reviews using FS being published is increasing. With limited consensus on best practice, further guidance and improved transparency in reporting is required. [The Systematic Review Toolbox: an updated resource to support evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473579/the-systematic-review-toolbox-an-updated-resource-to-support-evidence-synthesis) Background: In 2014, the Systematic Review (SR) Toolbox was developed to gather tools that could support researchers undertaking an SR. As the breadth of evidence synthesis methodologies have expanded greatly since this time, we updated the SR Toolbox in 2022 to reflect these developments. We also analysed the software tools and guidance within the SR Toolbox at the time to identify gaps that could potentially be filled by new tools and guidance in future. Objectives: To describe the process and present the results of updating the SR Toolbox and analysing its content. Methods: In February 2022, we manually extracted all guidance documents and software tools within the SR Toolbox to that point on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet categorised records by types of evidence syntheses records as described by Sutton et al. (2019) and by the stage of process in undertaking evidence syntheses (e.g., searching, screening, and data extraction). A single reviewer extracted and analysed these records, with a second reviewer checking a proportion for accuracy. By using this spreadsheet and Microsoft Access, we updated the SR Toolbox and performed a simple quantitative analysis on the included records. Results: On 13 May 2022, we launched the updated SR Toolbox. At the time, 235 software tools and 112 guidance documents were included. Most guidance documents (N = 78) and software tools (N = 223) were applicable to systematic reviews of interventions. However, there were fewer included tools and documents that related to reviews of reviews (N = 66 software tools and N = 22 guidance documents) and qualitative evidence syntheses (N = 19). Most documents provided guidance on critical appraisal and quality assessment (N = 70), with software mainly focusing on searching (N = 84) and data synthesis (N = 82). However, there were very few tools or guidance documents that related specifically to stakeholder engagement (N = 5). Conclusions: The SR Toolbox can support those looking to undertake different types of evidence syntheses. However, there are currently gaps in the guidance and software tools available, which may warrant further research. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Global evidence, local adaptation (GELA): Enhancing evidence-informed guideline recommendations for newborn and young child health in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa](/colloquium-2023/session/1473752/global-evidence-local-adaptation-gela-enhancing-evidence-informed-guideline-recommendations-for-newborn-and-young-child-health-in-three-countries-in-sub-saharan-africa) Background: Despite progress in the health of newborns and children, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have not met the Sustainable Development Goals for under-five mortality. Consequences of COVID-19 are being felt on health systems and services, further hampering healthcare delivery to children alongside growing poverty, hunger and inequity. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are needed to bridge the gap between research evidence and practice directly impacting patient care, health system funding and access to health services. Objectives: The Global Evidence, Local Adaptation (GELA) project is working with ministries of health in South Africa, Nigeria and Malawi to maximise the impact of research through increasing decision-makers' and researchers' capacity to use global research to develop locally relevant CPGs for newborn and child health. Methods: From 2023 to 2025, we are implementing a multi-faceted, multidisciplinary research and capacity strengthening programme, adaptation methodology and digital platforms to support authoring delivery for contextually rich CPGs. This is delivered through partnerships with national CPG groups, including policy makers, epidemiologists and civil society representatives. Results: A 3-year project was successfully initiated in all countries. Steering Group members and Guideline Development Panelists were identified and are participating in various project-related activities. Recently, the teams completed a landscape analysis of CPGs in newborn and child health and concluded the priority-setting process identifying three topics for new CPGs for newborn and child health per country. Monitoring and evaluation activities are using a variety of approaches including integrated knowledge translation, observation of CPG groups and evaluation of capacity needs for decision-makers. Conclusions: Overall, the project is on course to achieve its targets with priority topics identified and CPG groups being convened. Our success is enabled through a project team of African and international leaders in the field of evidence-based healthcare and CPG methods who have partnered with national ministries in Malawi, Nigeria and South Africa, the World Health Organization headquarters (WHO HQ) and the Afro regional office and civil society groups. Ongoing evaluation will help us learn which aspects work well to reduce waste and save resources for our settings and may be scalable to other countries like ours. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Yes. [Abstracts of Cochrane reviews are getting longer, but this has no large impact on the reporting quality.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473447/abstracts-of-cochrane-reviews-are-getting-longer-but-this-has-no-large-impact-on-the-reporting-quality.) Background: In our previous study on the reporting quality of abstracts according to PRISMA-A, we found that abstracts of Cochrane reviews (CRs) were better reported than non-Cochrane reviews, differed significantly in length (median length: 507 words vs. 249 words), and appeared to be getting longer in recent years. However, the considered sample of CRs was too small to draw robust conclusions. Overall, there is a general lack of studies that address the quality of reporting or trends in the length of the abstracts of CRs. Objectives: To evaluate the reporting of abstracts of CRs according to PRISMA-A and to investigate the possible influence of the abstract\u00b4s length. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study based on all CRs indexed in Medline (via PubMed) until November 18th, 2022. Trend analyses were performed on the number of publications and length of abstracts over the years for all 15,188 abstracts. Then, PRISMA-A adherence was assessed by two independent reviewers for a random sample of a planned sample size of 440 abstracts. Results were stratified by the number of words and year of publication. Results: Overall, the median number of words in the abstract was 469 (IQR: 389-686 words), steadily increasing from 353 words in 2000 to 807 words in 2021, with less than 1% of the abstracts being less than or equal to 300 words (in 2000: 30.7%). Analyses on PRISMA-A adherence show a mean score of 6.1 fully reported items. Stratified by year, PRISMA-A adherence increases with increasing word count in 2000-2010 and 2011-2015, whereas there is no difference in PRISMA-A adherence by the abstract length in 2016-2022. Conclusions: Over the years, abstracts of CRs have become longer and longer, running up to 1,000 words. This conflicts with the Cochrane Handbook, which recommends a maximum length of 400 words before being adapted to MECIR in 2019, which has recommended a length of less than 700 words since 2012 but allows a length of up to 1,000 words. It is questionable whether such long abstracts meet the goal of presenting all essential contents of the article in an informative, accurate, appealing, and concise form. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement. [Frequency of use and reporting adequacy of Cochrane RoB 2 tool in non-Cochrane systematic reviews published in 2020: meta-research study](/colloquium-2023/session/1635102/frequency-of-use-and-reporting-adequacy-of-cochrane-rob-2-tool-in-non-cochrane-systematic-reviews-published-in-2020-meta-research-study) Background: Risk of bias (RoB) assessment is an integral part of the systematic review methodology. New version of the Cochrane RoB tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was published in 2019. It has been reported that the Cochrane RoB tool from 2011 was used inadequately in Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. There are insufficient data about the use of RoB 2 tool. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the frequency of usage of RoB 2 tool and the adequacy of reporting RoB 2 assessments in non-Cochrane reviews published in 2020. Methods: We conducted a meta-research study. We included non-Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions published in 2020. For the reviews that have used RoB 2 tool, we analyzed how the findings of the RoB 2 assessment were reported. Results: Among 3880 analyzed reviews, the authors most frequently reported use of the Cochrane 2011 RoB tool (N=2228; 57.4%), followed by Cochrane RoB 2 tool (N=267; 6.9%). From 267 reviews that reported using RoB 2 tool, 213 (79.8%) actually used RoB 2 tool. Among 213 reviews that used RoB 2 tool, 180 (85.4%) used all domains specified by the RoB 2 tool. In 26 (12.2%) reviews, erroneous statements were used to indicate RoB 2 assessment. Only 20 (9.4%) reviews presented a complete RoB 2 assessment through a detailed table with answers to all signaling questions. The judgment of risk of bias through RoB 2 tool was not justified by a comment in 158 (74.2%) of reviews. Only in 33 (14.5%) of reviews, the judgment in all domains was justified in the accompanying comment. Conclusion: The majority of non-Cochrane reviews published in 2020 still used RoB 2011 tool and many authors reported the results of RoB 2 assessment inadequately. Interventions for improving RoB 2 tool use in non-Cochrane reviews are warranted. Relevance and importance to patients: Efforts to improve research methodology and how studies are conducted can lead to better conducted and written studies, and better evidence that can be used for managing patients. [Interpreting the results of observational studies in the context of variation expected due to analytic flexibility](/colloquium-2023/session/1473610/interpreting-the-results-of-observational-studies-in-the-context-of-variation-expected-due-to-analytic-flexibility) Background: When investigators analyze data from observational studies, they make numerous potentially justifiable, but still subjective, analytic decisions on which direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of findings can be contingent. This allows investigators to test many alternative analytic specifications and selectively report results for the specification that yields the most statistically significant or interesting results. Objective: We present a novel approach to interpret the results of observational studies in the context of the variation expected because of analytic flexibility. We apply this new method to the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality. Methods: We reviewed all observational studies addressing the effect of red meat and all-cause mortality from a recently published systematic review and documented variations in analytic choices across studies. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 to 2014 linked with National Death Index and applied specification curve analysis\u2014a novel analytic method that involves defining and implementing all plausible and justifiable analytic specifications\u2014to investigate the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality. Our choice of analytic specifications was informed by analytic methods used in published studies addressing the same or similar questions. Results: We applied specification curve analysis to NHANES, including 10,661 participants. In total, we performed 1,208 unique analyses, 48 (3.97%) of which produced statistically significant results, 40 (83.33%) of which indicated red meat reduced all-cause mortality, and 8 (16.67%) of which indicated red meat to increase mortality. The specification curve analysis produced a median hazard ratio of 0.94 [IQR: 0.83 to 1.05]. Conclusions: Our results suggest that inconsistency in the reported results in the literature may be explained by differences in analytic methods. We encourage evidence users to interpret the results of observational studies in the context of variation expected due to analytic flexibility. Patient, public involvement: We did not involve consumers in this investigation. [Challenges of coordinating large-scale systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473853/challenges-of-coordinating-large-scale-systematic-reviews) Background: Large-scale systematic reviews are becoming more common owing to the rapid growth in publications on certain topics. They raise unique challenges for managing and coordinating the review process for which there is limited guidance. We will present the challenges we encountered and how we addressed them during two large Cochrane systematic reviews: Quality improvement strategies for diabetes care (n=553 trials) and Audit and feedback (n=290 trials). Objectives: To address the logistical challenges that are common in the coordination of large systematic reviews. Methods: We will compare the approaches to coordinating two large systematic reviews. We will focus on common logistical challenges such as recruiting and maintaining a team with enough availability to complete the project in a timely manner; delegating work and ensuring consistency between reviewers on a large team; and managing and housing a very large dataset. We will also compare tools for managing large reviews such as the systematic review programs DistillerSR and Covidence for usability and customisability as well as online repositories for external data storage. Results: The main challenge in coordinating large systematic reviews is dedicating enough resources to ensure the review can be completed before another update is required. Having a large team can be useful for keeping momentum going in screening and extraction; however, it is vital to ensure that reviewers are being consistent by using clear and specific instructions and having a training period for each reviewer. Smaller teams are better for ensuring consistency in reporting, but screening and extraction takes longer. The use of technology such as DistillerSR and Covidence facilitates the organisation of screening a large set of studies. DistillerSR offers more customisability but may be cost-prohibitive. Covidence links nicely with RevMan Web but may not be as user-friendly. An online data repository such as Zenodo is useful for streamlining the main review and preventing any issues with the Cochrane CENTRAL system when it comes time for publication; however, there is always a risk of repositories no longer being in service in the future. [A method for the rapid assessment of high-cost cancer drug indications in a hospital setting](/colloquium-2023/session/1473873/a-method-for-the-rapid-assessment-of-high-cost-cancer-drug-indications-in-a-hospital-setting) Background: Hospitals are usually the entry point of new technologies. Facing the challenge posed by the growing costs of cancer drugs, there is a need for healthcare providers to articulate systematic and timely formulary decision-making processes considering not only the efficacy and safety of these treatments, but also their economic impact and efficiency. Objectives: To develop a method for the rapid assessment of high-cost cancer drug indications (HCCDI) for formulary decision-making in a hospital setting. Methods: We identified and structured decision criteria from previous formulary decisions regarding HCCDI, and a literature review of decision frameworks in oncology and the Chilean health reimbursement system. We generated a criterion/indication combination score for two samples of HCCDI (solid tumors and hematologic oncology) by measuring their performance and translating it to a common 0-100 scale. From the consensus among clinicians, managers, pharmacists, and health economics researchers of the institution, we assigned weights to each criterion to calculate the aggregate scores. Finally, we validated each step of the process with the decision-makers. Results: The identified criteria were (1) absolute and relative difference in overall survival and (2) progression-free survival of the area under the Kaplan-Meier curves; (3) difference in the proportion of patients with severe adverse events; (4) improvement of quality of life; (5) incremental expected costs; and (6) efficiency. The inputs for the assessment of each HCCDI were high-quality studies identified through rapid reviews of electronic databases and health technology assessment reports. Aggregation of criteria 1-4 was named \"benefit index\". The quotient of the benefit index and the HCCDI costs was called \"efficiency index\". The costs were then used to calculate the indication's budget impact. Conclusions: We developed a formulary decision-making tool for the rapid assessment of HCCDI validated by decision-makers. The method has allowed us to assess 79 indications for solid tumors and 21 for hematologic oncology since 2019, facilitating the reproducibility of the decision criteria. Improvements in the principles regarding HCCDI formulary decisions contribute to a more egalitarian use of resources and patients' access to healthcare. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients, public, or healthcare consumers were involved in this project. |11:05 AM - 11:15 AM| Every country on earth is now facing a resource crisis that will not be resolved simply by focusing more on effectiveness; a new paradigm is required - value based healthcare (VBHC). The EU definition of VBHC is now adopted globally, except in the USA which is not committed to universal healthcare. Their the term 'value' is the relationship between outcomes and costs for the patients treated which would be classified as efficiency in all other countries, but Archie did not use the term Efficiency in that narrow way. Archie wrote that he was concerned about 'the optimum use of equipment and personnel ...to cover all these activities I have used the word efficiency'. He was clearly thinking about value, the first person to do so in modern healthcare. The EU definition has four dimensions - personal, allocative, technical and social, and all four are excellently introduced by Archie. Personal value resonates through his description of care in the prisoner of war camp. Allocative value is highlighted in his text on 'inequalities between diseases... the division of the medical budget amongst all the medical activities' (p76). Technical value is described in emphasising the need for the 'optimum use' of resources for not only problems of treatment but also '..screening, diagnosis, place of treatment and length of stay, and, if necessary, rehabilitation' (p2) and social value in describing the 'local pride' that people had for their 'cottage hospital' and how this influenced the flow of resources (p34). Effectiveness and Efficiency therefore introduced VBHC fifty years ago! As health services around the world come to understand that they cannot close the gap between demand and resources by ensuring that only effective interventions are offered, there is a huge opportunity for the Collaboration to lead the VBHC paradigm as it led the Evidence Based Healthcare Paradigm. This does not mean doing cost-benefit analyses. It means using the experience and judgement in all the groups to promote stewardship and provide advice on the best use of resources, on value, not just on effectiveness. [Involvement of children and young people in development of an evidence synthesis framework for what interventions best prevent childhood obesity](/colloquium-2023/session/1473822/involvement-of-children-and-young-people-in-development-of-an-evidence-synthesis-framework-for-what-interventions-best-prevent-childhood-obesity) Background: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of over 250 randomized trials of interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 18 years. Although we found that interventions targeting diet, activity, and both combined may have small beneficial average effects on BMI, considerable heterogeneity arose from different participant and intervention characteristics. To explore how intervention characteristics, and their synergistic effect, impacted on the intervention effectiveness in preventing obesity, we aimed to reanalyse the results of the studies. To achieve this, we developed a novel analytic framework that addresses key intervention characteristics that are likely to explain differential effects. As children are the direct target of most of the interventions in our review, we decided to ask them what features they think an intervention should have to work best at achieving its goal. Objectives: To describe the beneficial role that children and young people played in the development and implementation of our analytic framework. Methods: A literature review informed our preliminary analytic framework, which we discussed with our project advisory group (also including two young people aged 15+). We then organised two workshops with children and young people (in one instance also with their parents) in which we discussed our framework aims and asked the participants for advice on what intervention characteristics may impact its effectiveness. The coding of the trials according to the finalised framework is being undertaken in part by young people themselves. Results: By asking our panels of children and young people the simple question \"What should we do to prevent childhood obesity?\", it emerged that interventions they thought would be best received were fun, casual, enjoyable, interesting, and interactive. Additionally, our panel suggested that the credibility of the person delivering the intervention and the opportunity to choose activities (e.g., their favourite sport) are also important features. Conclusions: Working with children and young people in both the planning and conduct of our work has been a scientifically useful and personally stimulating experience. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Children and young people were involved in the development of the analytic framework. [Development of a health-system guidance implementation tool using a modified Delphi method and a formative evaluation approach](/colloquium-2023/session/1473688/development-of-a-health-system-guidance-implementation-tool-using-a-modified-delphi-method-and-a-formative-evaluation-approach) Background: Compared with clinical practice guidelines, the implementation context for health-system guidance (HSG) is more multi-layered and complicated because of the complexity of health systems, the diversity of evidence, and the highly context-sensitive and multifactorial policymaking process. Current guideline implementation frameworks and tools might not be suitable for relatively complex HSG implementation. Therefore, a comprehensive and well-organized theoretical framework to support the HSG implementation was developed. Objectives: Building on a theoretical framework we developed, this project aims to develop an operationalized tool for supporting global HSG implementation at national or subnational levels. Methods: First, a modified Delphi approach with two steps was applied, including the following: (1) generating items based on the theoretical framework and (2) using a modified Delphi method to select and refine items to be incorporated in the tool. Second, a formative evaluation approach with four steps was applied, including the following: (1) operationalizing the HSG implementation tool based on the Delphi-derived components (i.e., domains and individual items in each domain); (2) theoretically 'testing' the application of the tool with several HSG examples; (3) examining the face validity and usability through semi-structured interviews; and (4) finalizing the HSG implementation tool based on the above findings. Results: The main output of this study is an operationalized HSG implementation tool that can support HSG implementation at the national and/or subnational level. Also, we will learn about whether, how, and why the HSG implementers will use this tool and what could be done to make this tool more usable. The results will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: The operationalized tool will help HSG users identify potential factors that facilitate or hinder the HSG implementation process, and strategies can leverage facilitators and address barriers during their preparation for HSG implementation; on the other hand, the tool will help HSG developers integrate the implementation considerations during the development process of HSG. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: As the target population of HSG recommendations, the healthcare consumer representative will be invited to participate in the modified Delphi and formative evaluation processes to provide the related insights that contribute to the tool development. [Integrating Machine Learning into a Systematic Review Workflow: Testing the Cochrane RCT Classifier in a Research Consultancy Setting](/colloquium-2023/session/1473837/integrating-machine-learning-into-a-systematic-review-workflow-testing-the-cochrane-rct-classifier-in-a-research-consultancy-setting) Background: There is strong evidence that machine learning can substantially reduce the burden of manual systematic review (SR) screening. However, outside of Cochrane and some academic groups, the adoption and acceptability of tools is still weak. Objectives: To assess the accuracy of the Cochrane Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) Classifier to accelerate systematic review screening in a research consultancy setting. Methods: Our Review and Evidence Synthesis (RES) team are developing a semiautomated workflow (\"RESbot\"), which pieces together compatible tools to accelerate SR production. We have tested the Cochrane RCT Classifier as a potential candidate to include in the workflow to support screening. From December 2022 to February 2023, the classifier was tested on three SRs of RCTs covering interventions for renal denervation (Review A), postpartum depression (Review B), and schizophrenia (Review C). For each review, the search results were screened manually by two independent reviewers. The same results were run through the classifier, using both the \"sensitive\" and \"precision\" version. Classifier results were cross-checked against reviewer decisions. Results: For Review A, the search retrieved 2,795 records. Manual screening found 24 eligible trials. Loading the search results through the classifier reduced the volume to 1,504 (sensitive) and 701 (precision). The precision set contained 23 of the included trials and the sensitive set contained all 24. For Review B, 2,153 records were retrieved by the search. Manual screening found 22 eligible trials. The classifier reduced the volume to 1,594 (sensitive) and 1,265 (precision). Both sets contained all 22 trials. For Review C, 1,172 records were retrieved by the search. Manual screening found 20 eligible trials. The classifier reduced the volume to 823 (sensitive) and 548 (precision). Both sets contained all 20 trials. The reduction in screening burden across the tests ranged from 25.9% to 46.1% using the sensitive and 41.2% to 74.8% using the precision setting. Conclusions: The Cochrane RCT Classifier performed well in our tests, with no trials missed across the three reviews using the sensitivity setting and only one trial missed using the precision setting (in Review A). Our findings support the wider adoption of this classifier to accelerate review production. [Meta-analysis: what is it all for?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473479/meta-analysis-what-is-it-all-for) Background Meta-analysis has grown increasingly complex in recent years, with a growing range of alternative and sometimes conflicting methods for combining studies, weighting studies, estimating heterogeneity, calculating confidence intervals, and so on. It is increasingly difficult to decide what methods to use, and it is difficult for stakeholders to understand the methods and be confident of their validity. Objectives To challenge the growing complexity of meta-analysis by seeking to return to the first principles for meta-analysis and considering why we perform meta-analyses at all. Concepts It will be argued that there are two key purposes for meta-analysis: 1. To summarise the evidence in identified studies of an intervention. 2. To investigate a deeper \"scientific truth\" about the intervention. The talk will make the case that the growing complexity in meta-analysis stems from a confusion of the two stated purposes of meta-analysis: by making the flawed assumption that a simple summary of evidence extracted from publications can tell us about the truth underlying the included studies. The talk will demonstrate that a simple \"assumption-free\" weighted average approach to meta-analysis is always valid if we are aiming only to summarise the available evidence. This also applies when considering heterogeneity. A simple approach has limitations, particularly with few studies or data, but shifting to more complex methods does not solve the problems. Conversely, identifying the \"truth\" about an intervention requires strong assumptions about the studies that are likely to be flawed. Alternatively, it requires a more complex analysis approach, with better data, such as an individual participant data meta-analysis. Conclusions We need to be clearer on what the purpose of any meta-analysis is and be honest about its limitations. Simple, conventional approaches may be best when we are restricted to summarising evidence in publications. Greater clarity will ensure that patients and stakeholders have a better understanding of what any meta-analysis is actually telling them and what it can't tell them, without unhelpful methodological complications. This should support greater understanding of the strengths and limitations of meta-analyses. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement. [Strengthening the global evidence base on public health and social measures through a WHO research initiative](/colloquium-2023/session/1473678/strengthening-the-global-evidence-base-on-public-health-and-social-measures-through-a-who-research-initiative) Background: Public health and social measures (PHSM) refer to nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented by individuals, communities and governments at all levels. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PHSM have been applied globally at an unprecedented scale and time span. PHSM have protected both lives and livelihoods, but they have also had negative health, social and economic consequences for individuals and societies, particularly for those living in vulnerable conditions. Producing robust evidence on the effectiveness and negative impacts of PHSM and understanding factors influencing adherence to measures is crucial to equitable and context-specific decisions and strengthening emergency preparedness and response. However, the complexity of PHSM and ethical, legal and feasibility limitations related to PHSM research in an emergency context, especially randomized controlled trials, have hampered systematic evaluation of PHSM. Objectives: The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a global initiative in 2021 to build robust data and research evidence to better understand the effectiveness of PHSM and improve precision in future PHSM decisions and policies. Methods: The initiative is taking a comprehensive approach to strengthen the evidence base on PHSM spanning from conceptual work to promoting primary research production and evidence use in policy. Results: The initiative's research pillar promotes the production of trustworthy and actionable evidence on PHSM through (i) a conceptual framework on PHSM fostering a common and comprehensive understanding of PHSM and their impacts, (ii) a series of global evidence syntheses on the effectiveness and impact of PHSM, factors influencing the adherence to measures as well as social protection policies for protecting livelihoods, (iii) a global research agenda for setting priorities for research production for the next decade, (iv) a suite of study protocols to collect high-quality, comparable and timely data on the effectiveness of PHSM in various settings during an emergency, and (v) a research database serving as a one-stop repository of primary studies and living systematic reviews on PHSM. Conclusions: The WHO PHSM initiative aims to produce and catalyse evidence that is comparable, high quality, equity focused and policy relevant to support decision-makers to make evidence-informed decisions about PHSM to better protect communities during future emergencies. [Bringing a patient perspective to understanding interventions that aim to reduce length of stay in hospital: a mixed methods synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473731/bringing-a-patient-perspective-to-understanding-interventions-that-aim-to-reduce-length-of-stay-in-hospital-a-mixed-methods-synthesis) Background: Hospital-led, multicomponent organisational strategies that aim to enhance recovery after surgery are associated with improved clinical outcomes. Less is known about aspects of interventions or their delivery which can lead to better patient outcomes. Objectives: To establish which aspects of multicomponent interventions to enhance recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in hospital are associated with better outcomes for older adults admitted to hospital for planned procedures. Methods: Working in partnership with expert clinical advisors, older adults, and carers with experience of hospital stays for planned procedures, we undertook a mixed methods synthesis. We first conducted a quantitative review (of comparative studies reporting length of stay and patient reported outcome or experience measures) and a qualitative review (of the experiences of patients, carers and staff of interventions received/delivered). We then developed a logic model based on patient perspectives represented in the qualitative review and discussions with clinical stakeholders and our patient and carer groups. The logic model was used as the focus of a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to integrate the findings of the quantitative and qualitative reviews. Results: A complex balance of intervention components trigger successful interventions: these represent approaches that allow patients to understand their treatment (e.g., through providing information in different formats), to ask questions about their treatment (through spending additional time with patients), and to build supportive relationships (through having a consistent point of care) and strategies that facilitate patients to monitor their own progress (goal-focused) and challenge themselves in recovery (through early mobilisation). Limitations: We did not consider the efficacy of different clinical procedures (largely unseen or unknown to most patients) that may also influence outcomes; evidence for some of the components came from weak studies; most studies screened patients with more complex needs out of the intervention; poor or absent reporting meant that we had to discard or combine some elements identified within the logic model. Conclusions: Grounding our synthesis in the experiences of patients, carers, and clinicians enabled us to generate meaningful implications for policy and practice that go beyond measuring success in terms of reducing time spent in hospital. [Scope, quality and reporting of clinical practice guidelines for newborn and child health in South Africa, Nigeria, and Malawi.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473780/scope-quality-and-reporting-of-clinical-practice-guidelines-for-newborn-and-child-health-in-south-africa-nigeria-and-malawi.) Background: Low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by high rates of under-5-year-old mortality, often caused by preventable conditions. High-quality, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) may play a key role in improving clinical management and quality of care and, thus, in reducing child mortality. However, limited availability or poor accessibility, inadequate reporting and low-quality methodologies of available CPGs may undermine their utility and expected impact in improving quality of care and outcomes. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review to identify CPGs for newborn and child health published in South Africa, Nigeria, and Malawi and to assess their quality. Methods: We searched key websites (June-July 2022) for published national and subnational de novo or adapted CPGs addressing newborn and child health in the three countries. Pairs of reviewers screened for eligibility, extracted information from included CPGs (scope, condition or topic, target population and end users, developers, methods), and appraised their quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. Data were analysed descriptively in Microsoft Excel and STATA-17. Results: We included 40 CPGs. Most provided guidance on communicable diseases (19/40), whilst eight on non-communicable diseases. The majority of CPGs did not report on methods for assessing the certainty of evidence (7/40), of which one CPG reported using GRADE. Overall, CPGs scored well on clarity of presentation (median 81%, IQR 67-94), and scored poorly on AGREE II domains rigour of development (median 11%, IQR 4-32) and editorial independence (median 6%, IQR 0-27). Similar trends in AGREE II domain scores were observed across all countries. Conclusions: We highlight gaps in methodological and reporting quality of CPGs for newborn and child health across the three countries, which may impact our credibility of recommendations. Gaps in guidance were identified as the topics of CPGs often did not align with country-specific disease burdens. CPGs specifically addressing malnutrition, neonatal disorders, and trauma related-mental health disorders need to be considered. We further highlight a lack of regional and national CPG repositories which may impact on access to and use of CPGs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct patient involvement in the conduct of our research. [Defining Racial Health Equity (RHE): A Landscape Review of Definitions, Terminology and Related Concepts](/colloquium-2023/session/1473737/defining-racial-health-equity-rhe-a-landscape-review-of-definitions-terminology-and-related-concepts) Background: Vast gaps in healthcare access exist within the United States, particularly across racial and ethnic groups. Promoting health equity has become a priority of the US government and major health organizations; however, a national consensus on shared definitions of these terms does not yet exist. In this study, we will compile, evaluate, and synthesize \"racial health equity\" (RHE) definitions via a landscape review. Inclusion criteria will encompass systematic reviews, primary literature, narrative reviews, and healthcare guides that include RHE definitions. Defining RHE is a first step to centering and advancing racial health equity. Objectives: To evaluate RHE terminology and definitions from key health organizations, primary articles, narrative reviews, and systematic reviews and to compile and synthesize findings to evaluate research gaps and make recommendations for future research. Methods: We developed a three-part search strategy to encompass RHE definitions. First, definitions of RHE were compiled from major health organizations with relevance to high-income countries. Second, for systematic reviews, we used a comprehensive search strategy in MEDLINE, Psychinfo, the Cochrane Library, and Campbell systematic reviews since 2020. Third, for primary research articles and narrative reviews, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychinfo, and the Campbell Collaboration library, with no date restriction. Both systematic search strategies were developed with a research librarian. Study title/abstracts and full texts will be screened by two reviewers and disputes will be resolved by consensus. Results: Health equity definitions largely differed across healthcare organizations, although some definitions were shared and cited the same original source. Few major healthcare organizations reported explicit definitions of RHE, although it was commonly listed as a priority. Preliminary search results of RHE across primary research articles yielded ~2,500 articles. Search results of systematic reviews identified >7,500 citations. Conclusions: Defining racial health equity is a first step toward establishing actionable interventions to further research and reduce health inequities. This landscape review is part of a larger research project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, investigating racial health equity in systematic reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This study and the parent project were reviewed by multiple diverse stakeholders in healthcare. [Stakeholder involvement to enhance the relevance and accessibility of a Cochrane review of physical rehabilitation after stroke](/colloquium-2023/session/1473648/stakeholder-involvement-to-enhance-the-relevance-and-accessibility-of-a-cochrane-review-of-physical-rehabilitation-after-stroke) Background: In 2013-2014, our Cochrane systematic review relating to physical rehabilitation after stroke was produced with involvement of stroke survivors, carers and health professionals (\"stakeholders\") who made key decisions about the review scope, structure and presentation of results. In 2022-2023, we conducted a major update of this review, again involving key stakeholders to ensure continued relevance and impact of this review. Objective: To describe and reflect on the stakeholder involvement in this Cochrane review of physical rehabilitation after stroke. We will: Describe involvement using the ACTIVE framework (who, how, when, level of involvement) and any impact/changes; Reflect on what did/did not work well. Methods: We recruited a group of stakeholders, comprising people with lived experience of receiving or providing physical rehabilitation after stroke in the UK, aiming for a group with a range of different experiences. We held a series of pre-planned meetings, each with a specific goal in relation to informing the review. We held two international webinars to gain international perspectives. Stakeholders provided reflections and feedback. Results: The stakeholder group comprised three stroke survivors, four carers and seven physiotherapists. To date, we have held four online meetings, supplemented with additional sub-group meetings, recorded presentations and email communication. Two further meetings are planned. A total of 124 people (including patients, carers, professionals and reviewers), from three continents, attended the international webinars. A complex new framework to describe physical rehabilitation following stroke was co-produced. This framework informed the grouping of studies within the review analyses. The group highlighted the need for additional comparisons and subgroup analyses to make the results meaningful and relevant. Wording of key results and implications for practice was co-produced. Barriers and facilitators to successful involvement were identified. For example, online meetings created challenges to equitable participation; use of recorded presentations were an efficient and successful way of keeping stakeholders up-to-date and informed. Conclusions: Stakeholder involvement influenced the review, ensuring analyses focused on questions that were meaningful and relevant and that results were clearly communicated to end users of research. This example contributes to a growing body of evidence about methods of involving stakeholders in Cochrane reviews. [The improved Systematic Review Data Repository Plus (SRDR+): A free, \"FHIR-ed up\" tool for screening, data extraction, and data sharing](/colloquium-2023/session/1473609/the-improved-systematic-review-data-repository-plus-srdr+-a-free-\"fhir-ed-up\"-tool-for-screening-data-extraction-and-data-sharing) Data Sharing Making data gathered during systematic reviews (SRs) publicly available could reduce unnecessary duplication, support analyses for secondary research questions, and facilitate methodological research. However, only a third of recent SRs have data availability statements, and among those, only 13% have downloadable data from a website/repository. What Is SRDR+? The Systematic Review Data Repository Plus (SRDR+) is a free, online platform for screening and extracting, archiving, and sharing data gathered during SRs. Since inception, it has had 10,083 user accounts from 117 countries. Data have been made publicly available (open access) for 225 SRs containing 19,898 studies on numerous topics. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funds SRDR+. Key Features of SRDR+ SRDR+ is an open-source relational database that allows machine learning-informed screening, flexible data extraction and risk of bias assessment, data adjudication, and data sharing. Newly enhanced SRDR+ features include (1) a data comparison tool to help adjudicate duplicate independently extracted data and (2) a single location for handling citations for abstract screening through full-text screening, data extraction, and data export. SRDR+ can also share data that were not initially extracted into SRDR+ (i.e., data can be imported from other platforms). \"FHIR-ed up\" Data Sharing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for electronic exchange of health data. The Evidence-Based Medicine on FHIR (EBMonFHIR) initiative is developing standards for sharing SR data, such as citations, study design, population/intervention/exposure/outcome definitions, results, risk of bias, and certainty of evidence. We are enabling SRDR+ to fully comply with FHIR to facilitate data sharing and allow interoperability of SR data with other platforms, including for guideline development (e.g., MAGICapp) and study registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov). SRDR+ FHIR-enabled resources will be available via a representational state transfer (RESTful) application programming interface (API), which facilitates backwards compatibility, and will be human readable through the Fast Evidence Interoperability Resources (FEvIR) platform. Plan for the Colloquium Presentation We will provide an overview of SRDR+ and demonstrate progress in making SRDR+ fully FHIR enabled. Patient Involvement Although no patients were involved in this abstract, various SRDR+ projects have involved patient collaborators and contain data for patient-important outcomes. [Reliably estimating interactions and subgroup effects in aggregate data meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473638/reliably-estimating-interactions-and-subgroup-effects-in-aggregate-data-meta-analysis) Background: A key question for meta-analysis is to reliably assess whether treatment effects vary across different participant subgroups. Traditionally, these interactions have been estimated using approaches known to induce aggregation bias, so we previously recommended a within-trial approach to provide unbiased estimates for binary or ordered-categorical patient-level treatment-covariate interactions. However, patients, clinicians, and policymakers need reliable estimates of treatment effects within specific covariate subgroups, on relative and absolute scales, in order to target treatments appropriately, which estimation of an interaction effect itself does not provide. Objective and Methods: Our objective is to describe further developments to the \"within-trial\" framework by providing practical methods to (1) estimate within-trial interactions across two or more subgroups; (2) estimate subgroup-specific (\"floating\") treatment effects that are compatible with the within-trial interactions and make maximum use of available data; and (3) clearly present these data using novel implementation of forest plots. We describe the steps involved and show how the methods can be applied using detailed aggregate (\"summary\") data either extracted from trial publications or obtained directly from trial authors. We demonstrate the within-trial framework by applying it to two examples taken from previously published meta-analyses in which detailed aggregate data were available. Results: In our first example, a meta-analysis of the effects of interleukin-6 antagonists on outcomes for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, we show how the method can be used for a binary covariate. Our second example, a meta-analysis of the effects of postoperative radiotherapy on survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, allows us to demonstrate the framework for a categorical covariate with three levels. We demonstrate how to implement these methods using a newly developed command (metafloat) in Stata. Conclusions: Our within-trial framework allows straightforward estimation of a range of within-trial treatment-covariate interactions, compatible subgroup-specific treatment effects, and corresponding forest plots to clearly and effectively demonstrate how treatment effects differ across patient subgroups. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: One patient and one member of the public are involved in the dissemination of the results of this study, including advising on how best to present the methodology to various audiences. [An Evidence Ecosystem Evaluation for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare-Acquired Infections in China](/colloquium-2023/session/1473507/an-evidence-ecosystem-evaluation-for-the-prevention-and-control-of-healthcare-acquired-infections-in-china) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for healthcare, especially the increase in health-acquired infections (HAIs), which has put significant pressure on the development of social and economic policy in China. At present, the number of HAIs-related research and policy reports is gradually increasing and gaining attention from different stakeholders. At the same time, the current scope of HAIs research, translation, and implementation in China is unclear and cannot further effectively support evidence-informed decision-making. Objectives: To evaluate the current evidence ecosystem of HAIs prevention and control in China and identify key issues and challenges to improve it in the future. Methods: We established a national and international multidisciplinary working group. There were two stages for this evaluation. First, we systematically searched seven main databases (PubMed, Web of Science [WoS], Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], Virtual Interactive Platform [VIP], and Chinese Biomedical Database [CBM]) for all HAIs-relevant documents such as clinical trials, models, reviews, guidelines, policies, and implementation systems from their individual inception to Feb 20, 2023. Reviewers working in pairs and independently selected documents according to the inclusion criteria and extract information. For included documents, according to their type, their evidence quality was assessed. Second, referring to the MAGIC (Making Grade the Irresistible Choice) evidence ecosystem, reviewers evaluated the completeness of the HAIs prevention and control ecosystem in China through the processes of evidence production, synthesis, dissemination, implementation, and evaluation. Results: Our search identified 28,126 documents. The detailed results will be shown at the conference. Conclusions: Relevant research and documents on HAIs are growing rapidly. However, repeated research in the same field leads to serious research waste and an incomplete evidence ecosystem. It is suggested that policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers should refer to the current evidence ecosystem before making decisions to fill the research gap. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Engaging racially and ethnically diverse stakeholders in evidence syntheses: A review of reviews and guidance documents](/colloquium-2023/session/1473670/engaging-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-stakeholders-in-evidence-syntheses-a-review-of-reviews-and-guidance-documents) Background: The conduct of systematic reviews and other evidence syntheses often involves narrowly focused questions addressing proximal and individual behavioral causes for health outcomes, without considering that distal social determinants of health deeply influence health behaviors and health outcomes. Addressing pervasive racial health inequities, often driven by social determinants and structural racism, requires disrupting research norms by centering marginalized groups. Evidence synthesis guidance does not routinely require incorporating racial health equity across review processes, and a national consensus on how to center racial health equity in evidence syntheses is currently lacking. A key aspect of rethinking methods in the context of racial health equity is revisiting the purpose, nature, and outcomes of engaging stakeholders\u2014including patients, clinicians, community organizations, purchasers, payers, health systems, policy makers, and training institutions\u2014in reviews. Objectives: (1) To systematically review and characterize current practices in engaging stakeholders in evidence syntheses of interventions to improve racial health equity and (2) to compile and synthesize extant guidance for engaging diverse stakeholders in evidence syntheses. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration databases, relevant synthesis and stakeholder organization web sites, and reference lists of salient papers. We included evidence syntheses addressing effects of interventions that aimed to improve racial health equity or methods/guidance documents that addressed approaches for engaging diverse stakeholders in syntheses. Two reviewers independently screened citations. One reviewer will conduct data extraction and quality assessment, with verification by a second reviewer. We will conduct descriptive analysis of key characteristics related to engagement. Results: Our database and additional searches identified more than 7,500 citations. Screening and extraction are ongoing, but preliminary signals suggest that few reviews of racial health equity interventions explicitly report involving stakeholders. Guidance relevant to stakeholder engagement typically does not directly address engaging racially or ethnically diverse stakeholders but does speak to general equity and ethics considerations. Conclusions: This review of stakeholder engagement specific to racial health equity, part of a larger Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded project, will help advance our understanding of current and needed guidance for involving racially/ethnically diverse stakeholders. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Protocol review by technical experts. [Development and co-design of a behavioral activation intervention targeting depression among people with dementia for the Swedish context](/colloquium-2023/session/1473668/development-and-co-design-of-a-behavioral-activation-intervention-targeting-depression-among-people-with-dementia-for-the-swedish-context) Background: Approximately 40% of people with dementia experience depression. Whilst psychological interventions are effective for the treatment of depression in dementia, access remains low. A behavioural activation self-help intervention, with support to the person with dementia to use the intervention provided by an informal caregiver, who themselves receives guidance from an occupational therapist (or other trained healthcare professional), may represent a solution. Objective: To develop a behavioral activation intervention targeting depression among people with dementia for the Swedish context together with key stakeholders. Methods: Semistructured interviews and focus groups were held with people with dementia (n=8), informal caregivers (n=19), healthcare professionals (n=18), and nongovernmental organisations (n=7) and analysed using manifest content analysis. A Public Advisory Group, consisting of informal caregivers of people with dementia (n=4), worked alongside the research team to support the interpretation and sense-making of research findings and codesign of the intervention. Results: An overarching theme, 'Tailoring and flexibility', resulted from interviews and focus groups. Stakeholders expressed a need to adapt intervention material to increase relevancy and representativeness by (1) adding multiple case stories to illustrate different life situations, age groups, and ethnic backgrounds and to increase relevance to Swedish society and culture; (2) designing new illustrations, as proposed illustrations were perceived as old-fashioned and reinforced ageing and dementia stereotypes; and (3) reducing text to minimize treatment burden. Stakeholders also expressed a need for flexibility concerning intervention delivery and expressed a need for choice concerning (1) location of guidance sessions to enable face-to-face sessions to be delivered in a familiar, safe and convenient environment (e.g., home or familiar community setting); (2) mode of guidance (e.g., face to face, telephone, online); and (3) amount of guidance (e.g., frequency and number of guidance sessions). Conclusions: Results informed the development of a tailored intervention, optimised to improve acceptability, feasibility and relevancy for people with dementia and depression. A planned feasibility study will further examine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Public involvement: Our Public Advisory Group has worked closely together with the research team to support the interpretation and sense-making of research findings and codesign the intervention to increase acceptability and relevancy of the intervention. [The development and testing of the Scientific, Transparent and Applicable Rankings tool (STAR) for clinical practice guidelines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473644/the-development-and-testing-of-the-scientific-transparent-and-applicable-rankings-tool-star-for-clinical-practice-guidelines) Background: Clinical practice guidelines are a critical tool for guiding physicians in clinical practice. Guidelines have been evaluated from different perspectives using various tools. However, the existing evaluation tools have several limitations. First, these tools do not address some key elements of guideline quality, such as guideline applicability, transparency of the processes and methods used for development, and prospective registration. Second, some of the evaluation tools have not been adequately assessed for reliability and validity. Third, most evaluation tools have a limited scope such as methodological quality, reporting quality, or implementation. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of a guideline is time-consuming because it requires the use of multiple tools encompassing different dimensions. In addition, there may be an overlap of items across different evaluation tools. Fourth, interpreting the results of multiple tools in combination and comparing them across different guidelines is challenging. Objectives: To overcome these barriers and to improve the quality of Chinese guidelines, we formed a working group to develop a unified, comprehensive, and practical evaluation tool named STAR. Methods and Results: A scoping review was developed to formulate the initial items related to the three dimensions of scientificity, transparency, and applicability; two rounds of Delphi expert survey resulted in a total of 39 items grouped into in 11 domains. Based on a hierarchical analysis of the results of the importance survey, each domain and each item were given weights that reflect their relative importance. Finally, a consensus on the final STAR rating tool was reached in an expert consensus meeting. The tool was tested and found to be reliable, valid, and easy to use. Conclusions: STAR may be the first tool that uses scientific approach to assign different weights to the domains or items of guideline evaluation, and it is applicable to registered guidelines that have voluntarily applied to the research center for ranking and providing relevant supporting materials. [Equity considerations in the conduct of evidence syntheses in partnership with patients and other stakeholders](/colloquium-2023/session/1473591/equity-considerations-in-the-conduct-of-evidence-syntheses-in-partnership-with-patients-and-other-stakeholders) Background: There is an increased recognition of the value of coproduction and working in partnership with stakeholders to produce trusted and equity-sensitive evidence syntheses. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who are impacted by health research including patients, caregivers, the public, policymakers, healthcare providers, and program managers. Objectives: (1) To summarise the equity considerations included in existing frameworks and guidance for conducting evidence syntheses in partnership with stakeholders; (2) To map evidence on the impact of stakeholder engagement in conducting evidence syntheses across equity characteristics; and (3) To develop a logic model for equitable partnerships with stakeholders when conducting evidence syntheses. Methods: This study was conducted as part of the ongoing work of the Multi-Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) Consortium, an international group of over 120 members representing stakeholders, such as patients, healthcare providers, policymakers, research funders, and guideline developers from various organizations (e.g., WHO, GRADE, AHRQ, RAND, JBI). We conducted a scoping review and systematic evidence map. We searched six bibliographic databases (2010-2022) and grey literature for publications describing guidance or evaluations of stakeholder engagement during an evidence synthesis. We extracted data in duplicate and identified equity considerations using the PROGRESS+ equity framework. We engaged stakeholders in the development of our logic model and preliminary recommendations. Results: This presentation will include preliminary recommendations for equitable partnerships with stakeholders when conducting evidence syntheses, including: (1) Identification and recruitment of diverse stakeholders, (2) Power-sharing and equitable decision-making during review conduct, (3) When and how to engage stakeholders to promote equity-sensitive syntheses, and (4) Potential impacts and outcomes of stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses on health equity. Conclusion: The findings from this project will inform the upcoming MuSE Consortium guidance for stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses and will be integrated into training delivered by the Cochrane Equity Thematic Group. The results will be particularly relevant and important for patients, as the guidance will be coproduced with their leadership and will promote their engagement in conducting reviews to ensure that evidence used for health decision-making includes equity considerations. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The MuSE Consortium includes stakeholder coleads representing patients, the public and consumers. [Co-designing outcomes for a review on self-harm and suicide prevention interventions: Are we failing our young people?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473613/co-designing-outcomes-for-a-review-on-self-harm-and-suicide-prevention-interventions-are-we-failing-our-young-people) Background: Involvement of end users in the production of reviews has mostly been limited to consultative review of researcher-authored protocols with involvement in outcome identification far less common. To address this gap, for a recent Cochrane review on suicide and self-harm prevention interventions in education settings, we collaborated with young people (YP) to codesign review outcomes that were relevant to them. Objectives: The key objectives were to understand how our codesigned outcomes compared with outcomes that are usually included in self-harm intervention trials and the extent to which YP have been involved in the design and conduct of the trials included in the review. Methods: Five participatory codesign workshops were completed with 32 YP to codesign outcomes and reflect on how these outcomes compared with those measured in self-harm intervention and prevention interventions. The codesigned outcomes included in the review were better for more coping skills and safer environments (i.e., more acceptance and understanding at home/school). We did not further refine these into more narrowly defined outcomes through the researcher/clinician lens but took a scoping approach and included all constructs relevant to them. Results: YP offered notably different views about what the most important review outcomes should be, emphasizing the broad diversity of experience and recovery. Importantly, the outcomes that they codesigned highlighted significant idiosyncrasy in what YP perceive as helpful and pointed to important targets of intervention. They also highlighted the importance of moving away from clinical, deficit-based and individually focused outcomes to more holistic and strengths-based outcomes. In the 51 trials included in the review, a large range of constructs relevant to the codesigned outcomes were used. However, very few trials measured the impact of improvements in these constructs on self-harm. Involvement of YP in designing these trials varied significantly but was very limited in most studies. Conclusion: The findings clearly elucidate the lack of alignment between what recovery from self-harm means (in terms of outcomes) for young people between YPs and researchers. Thus, involvement of YP in the 'upstream' stage of research is essential to ensure that review outcomes measure what is actually relevant to them. [Building acceptance for machine learning in study selection within a systematic review institution: Experiences from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health](/colloquium-2023/session/1574271/building-acceptance-for-machine-learning-in-study-selection-within-a-systematic-review-institution-experiences-from-the-norwegian-institute-of-public-health) Background: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health's (NIPH) machine learning (ML) implementation team within the Cluster for Reviews and Health Technology Assessments sprung from the need to produce more health technology assessments and systematic reviews, faster, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduced and scaled up ML among nonspecialists through using off-the-shelf software, beginning with a 6-month team whose mandate was to explore potential benefits of ML. We then continued with a team to build acceptance and use of the tools through teaching and peer support. Objectives: To present our experiences with starting up and implementing an ML team for evidence synthesis. More specifically, we will present key elements of our team's strategy, including: - Embedding process and performance evaluations into existing commissioned reviews (i.e., how we \"tested\" ML functions within ongoing work) - Creating tailored training materials and providing peer support - Onboarding new team members and keeping up to date - Managing workflow changes - Fostering acceptance and implementation of ML Conclusions: We will conclude by discussing lessons learned and the role of a nonspecialist, implementation-focused ML network or working group in providing training to evidence synthesis organizations. [Likelihood Ratio Meta-Analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1574272/likelihood-ratio-meta-analysis) Background: A CI in an updated meta-analysis may not have the expected coverage if the investigator does not account for whether the earlier meta-analysis failed to reject the null hypothesis. Objectives: To discuss the method of likelihood ratio meta-analysis (LRMA) in relation to Cochrane's usual method of meta-analysis. Methods: A likelihood ratio-based approach is used in a meta-analysis to pool data from separate studies to quantitatively assess where the total evidence points. A log-likelihood ratio function is used for the measure of association in each study. Those functions are summed to obtain a combined function from which a total effect estimate, and 'intrinsic' confidence interval, can be retrieved. Results can be presented in a familiar forest plot format. An LRMA is demonstrated using an example of the influence of a concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) on adherence to biologic DMARDs (bDMARD) in rheumatoid arthritis. The example includes population-based cohort studies of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis between January 2007 and March 2014 in five Canadian provinces, and the US IBM MarketScan database. The outcome of discontinuation of bDMARD therapy is compared between patients who are concomitant versus non-concomitant users of csDMARDs. Results: The study population comprises 20 221 new users bDMARDs: those use of csDMARD therapy is not statistically significantly associated with reduced discontinuation of bDMARD treatment in a random effects LRMA in these patients (hazard ratio=0.90, 95% intrinsic CI=0.79-1.02). The association is statistically significant when using usual random effects meta-analysis (95% CI=0.81-0.99). In the hypothetical scenario where the IBM MarketScan data were added after the original analysis, the 95% intrinsic CI remains unchanged at 0.79-1.02, but the 95% CI becomes uninterpretable. Conclusions: LRMA yields the same point estimate as a usual meta-analysis but with a 95% intrinsic CI that is wider than the traditional 95% CI. The intrinsic CI is more readily interpretable. Further, with LRMA, there is no need to account for previous statistical significance in an updated analysis. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [A real-world example demonstrating the application of Cochrane guidance to ensure transparent synthesis of evidence addressing a broad policy question](/colloquium-2023/session/1473707/a-real-world-example-demonstrating-the-application-of-cochrane-guidance-to-ensure-transparent-synthesis-of-evidence-addressing-a-broad-policy-question) Background: Specifying questions and criteria at the level of each synthesis can enhance the transparency of reviews and help ensure that reviews address questions of importance to decision-makers. Version 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions introduced the concept of 'PICO for each synthesis' to bring greater focus on the need to plan and report details of the synthesis questions addressed within a systematic review. The results of a systematic review are ultimately determined by these synthesis questions and the decisions authors take in deciding which studies are eligible to answer each question. Without changing the review eligibility criteria, a synthesis can be structured to address different questions (e.g., broader or narrower) simply by grouping interventions, outcomes, or populations differently. Yet this level of specification is uncommon and can be challenging in broad systematic reviews such as those commissioned to address policy questions. Objectives: To describe our approach to question specification in a broad systematic review commissioned to inform government decisions about health insurance rebates, including: Use of an analytic framework and staged consultation to pre-specify a proposed structure for synthesis, agree on the final PICO for each synthesis, and triage studies for analysis. The benefits of this approach for decision-making, workflow, and relevance of the synthesis. Methods: This was 1 of 16 reviews each examining the effects of a natural therapy in any population (condition, injury, risk factor) on any health outcome. Following guidance in Chapter 3 of the Cochrane handbook, we prespecified a framework with proposed population and outcome groupings for synthesis (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-022-02015-1). We compiled an aggregate list of populations and outcomes from included studies organised by the framework. Populations and outcomes were prioritised by the commissioners, enabling us to finalise the synthesis PICOs and triage studies for meta-analysis. Results: The synthesis examined effects on six outcomes (pain, fatigue, sleep, mental health, quality of life, physical function) from 234 studies categorised into 20 population groups. For patients, the approach underpins transparent synthesis of evidence commissioned to inform decisions that affect their health. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: through the commissioner (www.nhmrc.gov.au/health-advice/all-topics/complementary-medicines/natural-therapies-review). [Implications of centering racial health equity in systematic reviews: results of qualitative interviews with stakeholders](/colloquium-2023/session/1473666/implications-of-centering-racial-health-equity-in-systematic-reviews-results-of-qualitative-interviews-with-stakeholders) Background: Evidence synthesis guidance does not routinely require incorporating racial health equity across synthesis processes, and a national consensus on how to center racial health equity in evidence syntheses is currently lacking. Diverse stakeholder voices\u2014from patients, clinicians, community organizations, researchers including systematic reviewers, purchasers, payers, research funders, health systems, policymakers, and training institutions\u2014can inform new guidance on the processes, methods, analyses, and dissemination of systematic reviews that center racial health equity. Objectives: To obtain diverse stakeholder perspectives on (1) definitions of racial health equity; (2) optimal scope, team composition, methods, interventions, dissemination, and translation approaches that facilitate centering racial health equity in systematic reviews; and (3) measures of success and priority areas for centering racial health equity in systematic reviews. Methods: We will conduct 25 to 35 one-on-one interviews with stakeholders representing varied perspectives. We will use both deductive and inductive approaches to qualitative analysis linking codes to our research questions and formulating cross-cutting themes across multiple interviews and stakeholder groups. Results: Preliminary results point to key nuances in how racial health equity is defined. Stakeholders support centering racial health equity in systematic reviews, particularly when wide racial disparities are documented. While reviews should continue to focus on effectiveness of interventions, stakeholders also point to the importance of systematically assessing the context and implications of disparities in etiology, access to care, and uptake of interventions. Stakeholders suggest broadening evidence inclusion to qualitative data to have a mixed synthesis review process that provides additional context to racial health inequities. Stakeholders also suggested expanding systematic review methodology to require analytic frameworks to frame questions in ways that consider racial and ethnic centricity. In terms of stakeholder involvement, stakeholders emphasized including those with lived experience in review teams from the beginning of a review and compensating them for their contributions. Conclusions: This qualitative exploration of stakeholder perspectives, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, will help contextualize our understanding of current practices, gaps in methodological guidance, and future research directions for centering racial health equity. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Included among interviewed stakeholders. [Involving people in determining outcomes for a proposed Health Technology Assessment surrounding pelvic organ prolapse](/colloquium-2023/session/1473407/involving-people-in-determining-outcomes-for-a-proposed-health-technology-assessment-surrounding-pelvic-organ-prolapse) Background: Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) is an expectation when conducting research, including Health Technology Assessments (HTA), and is increasingly expected as a key component of evidence syntheses. When determining outcome measures for a proposed HTA evaluating nonsurgical interventions for treating pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in women, we wanted to ensure our research was of most relevance to women with the condition. Here, we describe the methods we used to collaborate with women with POP. Objectives: To describe the PPIE methods that informed the scope of our evidence synthesis HTA proposal. Methods: In November 2021, we held a workshop with women with POP to discuss our research question, its relevance to women with the condition, and what interventions and outcome measures they would like to see included in our evidence synthesis. Following this, we designed a survey using Qualtrics, which was distributed via PPIE networks and patient groups in the UK in May 2022. From this, we derived an initial ranking of outcomes and time-points. We brought these results to an online workshop with women with POP hosted on Zoom in December 2022. Here, we gave a background to the proposed project and used Mentimeter to derive a final ranking of outcome measures and follow-up times of most importance to attendees. Results: Following our process, four outcome measures of most relevance to women with POP were chosen for the proposed project. Long-term follow-up (at 12 months or more) was identified as the most important time-point at which to assess change in these outcomes. Our discussions within the workshops also identified other areas through which the proposed project could be made more relevant to women with POP. Conclusions: The involvement of women with POP in our proposal has greatly enhanced the relevancy of our research to patients and the public. People undertaking Cochrane reviews may wish to consider adopting or adapting this approach to help ensure their research is of most relevance to their population of interest. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: PPIE was conducted throughout our work. [Tools and methods for assessing the transferability of health technology assessment results across jurisdictions: a systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473825/tools-and-methods-for-assessing-the-transferability-of-health-technology-assessment-results-across-jurisdictions-a-systematic-review) Background: There has been a growing interest in using Health Technology Assessment (HTA) as a tool for supporting decision making in health policies. However, the complexity of HTA methods and a lack of local expertise have limited its usage in many countries. The World Health Organization has taken measures in recent years to encourage countries to conduct and use HTA, including through resolutions from the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Region Regional Committee, which in 2019 called for increased investment in strengthening national institutional capacities for evidence-informed policy making through the use of HTAs. Given the limitations in national technical capacities, there is a focus on adapting HTA results from other settings to the national context of countries. Objectives: To systematically review the tools developed for HTA transferability and evaluate their strengths and limitations. Methods: The systematic review was conducted between 1995 and 2021 and included studies that introduced tools, methods, and frameworks for transferability of HTA results across jurisdictions. Databases, such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, Web of Sciences, EconLit, Economic Working Papers Database, Health Economic Evaluation Database, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched, along with relevant bibliographies. The data were extracted and assessed by at least two reviewers and synthesized using both tabulation and narrative approaches. Results: A total of 10,375 documents were evaluated, resulting in 17 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These 17 studies consisted of 13 newly developed tools (methods) that were appraised based on 12 critical elements, including ease of use, rapid screening criteria, and factors affecting transferability. The majority of the models were checklists, with only a few deemed suitable for full HTA. Three models have been validated through published studies, but there is no evidence of utilization in the countries of the EM region. Conclusions: Although the existing tools provide valuable resources for evaluating transferability, there remains a need for a more comprehensive tool to support decision-makers in low-resource settings considering country context and capacity. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: not applicable. [Abstract on sys rev on HTA transferability tool WHO EMRO. docx.pdf](https://colloquium2023-submissions.cochrane.org/sites/2023.colloquium.cochrane.org/files/uploads/users/u17779/Abstract%20on%20sys%20rev%20on%20HTA%20transferability%20tool%20WHO%20EMRO.%20docx.pdf) [ChatGPT and large language models for systematic review tasks: What are the opportunities for improvement?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473417/chatgpt-and-large-language-models-for-systematic-review-tasks-what-are-the-opportunities-for-improvement) Background: The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted technologies leave many wondering about the current capabilities, limitations, and opportunities for integration into scientific endeavors. Large language models (LLM) - such as ChatGPT, designed by OpenAI - have recently gained widespread attention with their ability to respond to various prompts in a natural-sounding way. Systematic reviews (SRs) utilize secondary data and often require many months and tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to complete, making them attractive grounds for developing AI-assistive technologies. Objectives: To evaluate the responses of ChatGPT to SR tasks to assess applicability, correctness, and potential usefulness to reviewers. Methods: We gave ChatGPT a set of SR tasks during a live webinar attended by over 400 people and evaluated the responses, considering our own expertise and attendees' comments. Results: When tasked with developing an SR question and eligibility criteria, ChatGPT appropriately formulated a structured question based on the requested PICO elements and produced criteria related to PICO, study design, language, and publication dates. ChatGPT failed to write a PubMed search strategy for a given SR question: while the output matched the structural components of a search, it was unusable due to fabricated pseudo-MeSH terms and inappropriate and incorrect filters. When tasked with screening 27 titles for a given question, ChatGPT correctly identified 8/10 eligible articles while also including one ineligible article. When tasked with summarizing multiple abstracts, ChatGPT accurately identified relevant results from 2/3, but misidentified background information from the third as results. In all tasks, ChatGPT's response required interpretation and expertise to assess validity. Many attendees expressed hesitancy and distrust of ChatGPT for completing SR tasks. Conclusions: While ChatGPT and LLMs show some promise for aiding in SR tasks, the technology is in its infancy and needs development for such applications. In addition, great caution should be taken by all, particularly non-content experts, to critically evaluate any content produced by LLMs due to much of the output appearing, at a high level, to be valid, while some was erroneous and in need of active vetting. Consumer involvement: The webinar was public; anyone could attend and comment. [From Agenda to Action: Collaborative Evidence Networks and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](/colloquium-2023/session/1473396/from-agenda-to-action-collaborative-evidence-networks-and-the-united-nations-sustainable-development-goals) Background: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015 to replace the Millennium Development Goals. As we approach the midway point towards the 2030 target date, it is timely to reflect on the contribution of those in the evidence synthesis community to achieving these important global objectives. The Global Commission on Evidence concluded that both coverage and quality of evidence syntheses was uneven, that many of the reviews were out of date, and many did not include studies from low- or middle-income countries. Objectives: This study sought to determine alignment of published JBI systematic and scoping reviews to the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Global Health and Well-being) and to understand author awareness of the goals and their relationship to their work. Methods: A desktop audit of systematic and scoping reviews published in the journal JBI Evidence Synthesis was undertaken followed by a short author survey. Results: The results of this pilot study indicate that the SDGs are not currently a significant consideration for most authors, but there is a desire to learn more and integrate them into their prioritisation processes. Fundamental to maximising the potential of evidence syntheses and the achievement of the targets set out in the SDGs (particularly SDG-3) are issues relating to policy, partnership, and prioritisation. The results of this pilot clearly highlight the need for the global evidence community to work together in partnership to ensure that policy and practice relevant reviews are being prioritised. Conclusions: Although the SDGs are not the only driver to influence the prioritisation of evidence syntheses, they are an important consideration and part of our collective social responsibility. Cooperation and coordination of effort to prioritise evidence syntheses would assist in avoiding research waste, duplication of effort, and the conduct of irrelevant reviews. It is time to think about resetting and recommitting our mutual agendas to transform the evidence ecosystem, maximise the limited resources available to us, and truly make a global impact on health outcomes.

[Importance of consensus methods and involving end users to develop evidence-based materials when evidence is scarce: a Red Cross example](/colloquium-2023/session/1473528/importance-of-consensus-methods-and-involving-end-users-to-develop-evidence-based-materials-when-evidence-is-scarce-a-red-cross-example) Background: Up to 20% of children and adolescents worldwide experience mental health problems. Because young people find it easier to talk to their peers than to adult family members, teachers, or professionals, training them in how they can support each other is very important. Objectives: The project aimed to develop materials to train children and youth in how to support their peers in the context of mental health problems. Because (very) low certainty evidence about the association between peer support and mental health problems was anticipated, the secondary objective was to develop a formal consensus method to collect good practice input from a broad group of stakeholders. Methods: We systematically collected evidence about mental health risk or protective factors related to how children/adolescents interact with their peers (Q1), and about educational programs aimed at social skills and mental health (problems) (Q2). Next, a modified Delphi consensus method was developed and statements describing the potential content and characteristics of interventions, based on the identified evidence, were sent out to 23 stakeholders, including content experts and mental health peer workers. All statements for which consensus could not be reached were discussed in two face-to-face meetings. Results: For Q1, we included 160 observational studies with very low certainty evidence about factors, such as peer support, peer influence, peer rejection/acceptance, friendship quality/intensity, and bullying. For Q2, we included 9 systematic reviews resulting in evidence conclusions of moderate to low certainty on the effectiveness of peer support programs. This resulted in 146 Delphi statements; for 77% of the statements, consensus was reached after a first Delphi round, the face-to-face discussions, and a second Delphi round. Forty-one statements were not withheld. The accepted statements were used to formulate the content and characteristics of peer support interventions. Conclusions: Because the evidence about the content for our peer support program was of very low certainty, the input of various stakeholders, from academic experts to peer workers, was indispensable. To receive input from all profiles (including end users, to assure relevance for practice) and to obtain formal consensus, we successfully used a modified Delphi consensus method. [Towards More Scientific Meta-Analyses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473854/towards-more-scientific-meta-analyses) Background: Meta-analysis typically estimates a quantity that differs from the implicitly intended estimand; typically, standard approaches estimate the average effect of a treatment for a population of imperfect studies, rather than the true scientific effect that would be measured in a population of hypothetical perfect studies. We advocate for an alternative approach, called response-surface meta-analysis, which models the relationship between study design quality and effect size in order to estimate the effect in the hypothetical ideal study. Objectives: We demonstrate how we can extend meta-regression to perform response-surface meta-analysis, as well as how resulting estimates can differ from estimates obtained by traditional methods. Methods: We perform a response-surface meta-analysis by performing a meta-regression with design quality as a covariate and reporting the predicted mean and confidence interval at the ideal design quality. We apply this approach to a simulation study with a known true effect, as well as an empirical example published in the Cochrane Library. Using a univariate measure of design quality in the synthetic example and risk of bias as a proxy for quality in the empirical example, we compare estimates from response-surface meta-analysis with those of traditional approaches. Results: In the simulation study, response-surface meta-analysis usually covers the true effect within one standard error. In contrast, we obtain overly biased results from traditional fixed-effects and random effects meta-analyses. In the empirical study, although the original analysis favors the intervention, response-surface meta-analysis does not provide strong evidence for the superiority of the intervention. Conclusions: Response-surface meta-analysis reframes meta-analysis as an endeavor to estimate the true scientific effect that would be measured under a perfect study, rather than to summarize the existing population of imperfect studies. More work is needed to standardize the response-surface approach, such as determining a rating system for design quality. We hope this work will help to encourage clarity on the causal estimand of interest in meta-analysis. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: N/A. [The regulatory process for drug approval needs independent meta-analytical evidence: is Cochrane a possible candidate? The case of psychotropic medicines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473746/the-regulatory-process-for-drug-approval-needs-independent-meta-analytical-evidence-is-cochrane-a-possible-candidate-the-case-of-psychotropic-medicines) Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are responsible for scientific evaluation and approval of medicines. Approval of new drugs is based on the evaluation of individual clinical studies conducted by manufacturers who produce new compounds. Concerns have been raised regarding the rules governing approval of medicines, quality and transparency of evaluations. Objectives: To critically review regulations for drug approvals in Europe and the U.S. and to ascertain whether the use of meta-analytical approaches may inform regulatory decisions. Mental disorders are used as a paradigmatic example in view of several medicines already available for these conditions. Methods: We reviewed EMA and FDA regulations for approval of new drugs for mental disorders. Additionally, as case examples, regulatory trials for three recently approved drugs for mental disorders (esketamine, paliperidone 3-months long-acting and cariprazine) will be meta-analyzed to summarize evidence available at the time of approval. Results: FDA and EMA require at least two \"positive\" trials showing superiority over placebo, or noninferiority over active comparators, to grant marketing authorization for new psychotropic medicines. The use of meta-analytical techniques is not a requirement. We will present the results of meta-analyses of regulatory trials of esketamine, paliperidone 3-months long-acting and cariprazine and of network meta-analyses including these medicines. Such examples will show that pooling available evidence for efficacy and tolerability outcomes may offer an added dimension to the evaluation of new medicines, especially for comparing new medicines with those already on the market. Conclusions: Evaluation of new medicines should be complemented by regulatory meta-analyses of all relevant clinical studies performed at the time of approval, including network meta-analysis if feasible, and individual participant data (IPD). This would be especially relevant in areas where several medicines already exist, as it would inform regulatory authorities on comparative efficacy and acceptability of new drugs compared with those already available. Regulatory meta-analyses should ideally be conducted by independent organizations such as Cochrane. Cochrane may work in consultation with regulatory authorities in developing transparent and high-quality overviews of existing evidence to complement data from clinical studies during the regulatory approval process. Patient/public/healthcare-consumer involvement: Results will improve quality of care. [What is the level of expertise of ChatGPT in the domain of systematic reviews and meta-analysis?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473698/what-is-the-level-of-expertise-of-chatgpt-in-the-domain-of-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analysis) Background: ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. Although it has demonstrated a strong understanding and cognitive ability in numerous fields, its comprehension of topics related to systematic review and meta-analysis is currently not well-understood. Objectives: To determine ChatGPT's level of understanding of knowledge related to systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We learned the methods for intervention systematic reviews and meta-analyses systematically from the Cochrane Handbook. Then, the core research team members discussed and identified 10 questions related to systematic reviews and meta-analyses and obtained relevant answers by asking ChatGPT. Three investigators independently assessed the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses and rated them on a scale of 1-10, with a score of 10 indicating a perfect answer. Finally, the average accuracy of the three researchers for each question was calculated. The primary outcome measure was the total score of the 10 questions, which was calculated as (the mean score of question 1 + the mean score of question 2 + ... + the mean score of question 10) / 100 x 100%. Results: Ten questions and answers related to systematic review and meta-analysis were generated (Figure). The three researchers scored the 10 questions 91, 86, and 86, respectively. The average score was 87.7. The highest average score was 9.7 for Q4, indicating that ChatGPT provided the most accurate response to that question. The lowest average score was 7.3 for Q9, indicating that ChatGPT's response to that question seemed to deviate from the truth to a greater extent. Conclusions: ChatGPT has a relatively high level of understanding of systematic reviews and meta-analysis knowledge, which is limited by the level of knowledge of the respondents, and a study with a large sample is needed to further validate the results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Analysis of the proportion, role, function, and reporting quality of patient and public involvement (PPI) in systematic reviews and meta-analyses: A cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473491/analysis-of-the-proportion-role-function-and-reporting-quality-of-patient-and-public-involvement-ppi-in-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is essential to guarantee that systematic reviews are pertinent and significant to those impacted by a health condition and to those using systematic reviews to guide health policy or practice. Therefore, the BMJ issued a new policy requiring that all submitted manuscripts must include a PPI declaration in their Methods section under a subheading called Patient Involvement in 2014. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically analyze the proportion, role, function, and reporting quality of PPI in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: We will conduct a hand search for all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in BMJ journals from 2015 to 2022. Two investigators will independently extract data from the \"Patient Involvement\" section of the systematic reviews. Our analysis will include the proportion, quantity, and role of PPI in systematic reviews. We will also assess, based on the 12 stages proposed by the Cochrane Involving People learning resource, the specific function of PPI in developing questions, planning methods, writing and publishing protocols, running searches, selecting studies, collecting data, assessing risk of bias, analyzing data, interpreting findings, writing reviews and publishing, and disseminating them. Lastly, using the ACTIVE framework and GRIPP2 checklist, we will assess the reporting quality of the PPI in systematic reviews. Results: We initially included 270 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Detailed results will be presented at the 2023 Cochrane Colloquium. Conclusions: The conclusions will be presented at the 2023 Cochrane Colloquium. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Development of a free tool for data estimation and conversion for meta-analysis (DECoMA)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473510/development-of-a-free-tool-for-data-estimation-and-conversion-for-meta-analysis-decoma) Background: Over the last 20 years, there has been a significant rise in the number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses being published. These types of studies are highly valued as they are believed to offer the highest level of evidence if carried out correctly and can offer clear and trustworthy summaries for clinical decision-making. However, researchers of meta-analyses may encounter the problem of missing mean and standard deviation (SD), often resulting in only median, interquartile range, or range data being available. Unfortunately, these data cannot be directly used for meta-analysis. Some estimation and conversion methods have been proposed, but there is currently no user-friendly tool available based on multiple scenarios of missing SD. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop a useful tool that can find sample mean and SD for common scenarios. Methods: Two researchers extensively reviewed relevant methodologic references such as textbooks and systematic reviews. Based on the work, they compiled a list of possible scenarios in which there were inadequate data for meta-analysis and sought out formulas for finding sample mean or SD in each case. Results: The working group double-checked the scenarios and corresponding solutions, and the identified 10 primary scenarios can be categorized into two broad categories. The first category involves circumstances in which descriptive statistics of a single group are available (within-group circumstances). The second category involves situations in which effect estimates of two treatment groups are available. Then, the working group developed an Excel tool for estimating and converting the data in each scenario. The solutions in the tool are primarily based on the Cochrane Handbook and a methodology study. Conclusions: Researchers need to understand the circumstances and solutions of missing data before conducting meta-analysis, and appropriate data processing could improve precision and quality of evidence. Conversely, excluding certain irregular outcome reporting in a meta-analysis may lead to imprecision and biased estimates. Therefore, familiarity with the different scenarios and the tools available to address them is crucial for researchers to conduct a high-quality meta-analysis. [Using a co-design approach to increase the awareness, use and engagement of a digital map of COVID-19 recommendations](/colloquium-2023/session/1473750/using-a-co-design-approach-to-increase-the-awareness-use-and-engagement-of-a-digital-map-of-covid-19-recommendations) Background: The eCOVID-19 Recommendations Map & Gateway to Contextualization (RecMap) is an online tool containing 7,200 COVID-19 recommendations and is the product of collaboration with more than 40 organizations around the world. Our knowledge mobilization (KM) project is currently supported by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) to enhance the reach of the RecMap by engaging with 10 different groups of knowledge users. Objectives: The project aims to increase the awareness, use, and engagement of the RecMap using a codesign strategy. Methods: A committee of stakeholder representatives, staff, and investigators was established to develop our RecMap KM plan. The committee meetings allow members to build a shared understanding of goals, provide input on decisions, and foster mutual learning. Our target audience focuses on a range of RecMap beneficiaries and intermediaries across Canada (community leaders working with migrants and refugees, policymakers, media, public health professionals, and Indigenous Peoples) and globally (nondigital public in Cameroon, parents, professionals working with marginalized communities in Slovakia, Cochrane members in Africa, and guideline developers in China). Results (Anticipated Value): A framework, informed by a systematic review of codesign approaches, was developed by our committee (Figure 1) and guides the KM plan for engaging each target audience. The framework contains four components: an aim, principles, activities, and outcomes. Our team is currently conducting unidirectional activities through webinars, storytelling, and media press releases. We are learning about our audiences' needs through interviews and workshops. The RecMap is also being integrated with other websites, and plain-language tools are being developed and translated. We anticipate that the RecMap user base will increase and that identified barriers and facilitators will lead to RecMap improvements. Conclusions: A diverse network of knowledge users and a KM framework were established through a codesign approach, enabling the implementation of RecMap-related activities. Our results will inform future disease-specific recommendation maps that are tailored to the needs of potential users. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: To ensure an effective KM plan for our digital health tool, we have engaged stakeholder representatives from all 10 groups throughout the designing, planning, and implementation stages. [NMAstudio: a fully interactive web-application for producing and visualizing network meta-analyses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473545/nmastudio-a-fully-interactive-web-application-for-producing-and-visualizing-network-meta-analyses) Background: In the last decade, various software tools have been developed for network meta-analysis (NMA), but presentation and interpretation of findings from large networks of interventions remain a challenging task. Objectives: We developed a fully interactive online tool called 'NMAstudio', aimed to facilitate the production and visualization of key NMA results through a direct connection between a customizable network plot and all NMA outputs. Methods: In NMAstudio, users can upload their data and interact with the network diagram by clicking one or more nodes-treatments or edges-comparisons. Based on their selection, different outputs and information are displayed: (a) boxplots of effect modifiers assisting the evaluation of transitivity; (b) pairwise or NMA forest plots and bidimensional plots if two outcomes are given; (c) league tables coloured by risk of bias or confidence ratings from the CINeMA framework; (d) incoherence tests; (e) comparison-adjusted funnel plots; (f) ranking plots; and (g) evolution of the network over time. Pop-up windows containing extra information and guidance are enabled. An access token can also be generated by the user and can be used to save their project and further share it publicly to foster reproducibility. Results: We illustrate NMAstudio using a comprehensive network of 20 drugs for chronic plaque psoriasis, and we demonstrate how our tool simplifies the visualisation of complex networks and facilitates checking of assumptions as well as interpretation and sharing of results. Conclusions: In summary, our web application provides a truly interactive, flexible and user-friendly tool to display, enhance and communicate the NMA findings. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Introduction to a new risk of bias tool for network meta-analysis (RoB NMA tool)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473499/introduction-to-a-new-risk-of-bias-tool-for-network-meta-analysis-rob-nma-tool) Background: Network meta-analyses (NMAs) provide comparative evidence about the effects of all healthcare interventions for a given condition. However, NMA results can be undermined by flaws in design, conduct, analyses and reporting. Several tools are available for the critical appraisal of an NMA. However, none aim specifically to assess the risk of bias (RoB) in an NMA. Objectives: To describe a new RoB NMA tool to assess the risk of bias in an NMA, developed using rigorous methodology. Methods: As an international steering committee, we developed a protocol and made conceptual decisions about the tool's structure. We developed the tool using a multistep approach: definition of the scope of the tool; conduct a methodological review to compile a preliminary list of concepts related to bias in NMAs [1]; web-based Delphi survey to collate expert opinion regarding the quality of NMAs [2]; an online survey to solicit decision-makers' needs [2]; and refinement through piloting. Results: The RoB NMA tool includes three domains: bias arising from the network characteristics/geometry, bias arising from potential effect modifiers, and bias arising from statistical synthesis. The three domains comprise a total of 16 statements which can identify potential limitations of the NMA, leading to a judgement about the risk of bias within each domain (low, high or unclear risk of bias). The tool should be used to identify potential limitations in the way an NMA was conducted that may lead to bias in its results or conclusions. The RoB NMA tool should be conducted as a supplement to the assessment of the risk of bias in the underlying evidence review, for example, using the ROBIS tool. Piloting of the RoB NMA tool is ongoing. Conclusions: The development of the RoB NMA tool was evidence based and included piloting and refinement. We believe that the RoB NMA tool will allow objective rating of the RoB in an NMA. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Prioritising topics, formulating questions, and selecting outcomes for a World Health Organization nutrition guideline](/colloquium-2023/session/1473789/prioritising-topics-formulating-questions-and-selecting-outcomes-for-a-world-health-organization-nutrition-guideline) Background: Developing trustworthy guidelines requires considerable investment of resources and time. This makes priority-setting of topics and questions a key aspect of guideline development. Explicit and thorough prioritization engaging a range of appropriate stakeholders enhances the relevance, potential utility, and uptake of priority recommendations by end users. Objectives: To identify priority topics, formulate questions, and select outcomes for a World Health Organization nutrition guideline. Methods: The guideline steering group and external guideline methodologists partnered to coordinate the prioritisation. We aligned the approach with WHO methods, and good practice for priority-setting, including an explicit and comprehensive process involving stakeholder engagement, information management, consideration of values and context, and opportunities to review decisions. Draft guideline questions were informed by four commissioned scoping reviews, areas of uncertainty needing guidance identified by member countries or implementing organisations, and past WHO meetings, with inputs from the guideline development group (GDG) at an initial scoping meeting. Working groups refined draft questions into proposed PICO formats, which the GDG prioritised according to clear criteria (online survey). Informed by survey results, the most important questions were agreed upon by the GDG at a consensus meeting, after which the GDG scored outcomes online according to importance. All contributors declared interests. Results: The 16 prioritised guideline questions comprised intervention effectiveness (treatment and prevention), prognostic, and diagnostic questions. Our approach took us iteratively through pre-prioritisation and prioritisation stages, as well as post-prioritisation, in which broad questions required further splitting into several focused sub-PICOs to unpack complexity (e.g., effect modification and baseline risk differences) and enable identification of relevant evidence by systematic reviews for the questions and evidence-to-decision criteria for recommendations. A systematic process enabled the consideration of social determinants of health, equity, human rights, and gender throughout the process, guided by PROGRESS-Plus stratifiers. Documenting the approach aided transparency, and inclusivity facilitated stakeholder buy-in. Conclusion: This priority-setting process was complex, time-intensive, and recursive but clearly valuable and necessary to direct efforts and resources to the most important needs for guidance, representing a step towards improving delivery of evidence-informed care and key outcomes. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Stakeholders included guideline implementers and researchers. [Lessons learned from developing an evidence-based guideline for psychosocial support by Red Cross volunteers: Involving end users throughout the process](/colloquium-2023/session/1473445/lessons-learned-from-developing-an-evidence-based-guideline-for-psychosocial-support-by-red-cross-volunteers-involving-end-users-throughout-the-process) Background: Organisations such as youth movements or companies regularly request trained volunteers from the Belgian Red Cross to provide group psychosocial support after the occurrence of potentially traumatic events. Objectives: The Belgian Red Cross' Social Intervention Service and the Centre for Evidence-Based Practice (CEBaP) have updated the manual that is used to train volunteers in providing psychosocial support according to the principles of evidence-based practice. This manual was revised given that it was previously developed based on expert opinion. Methods: CEBaP researchers performed a systematic literature search of existing systematic reviews using The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycNET to collect evidence on the effectiveness of acute, brief, and preventive psychosocial or psychological group interventions after potentially traumatic events. Evidence conclusions were translated into recommendations, which were discussed with an expert panel consisting of Red Cross volunteers (i.e., the end users), academic researchers, and practitioners. Results: We identified eight observational and seven experimental studies providing evidence of low to very low certainty. Previous recommendations needed significant changes based on the evidence conclusions, the input from the expert panel, and existing evidence-based guidelines. These were, however, not in line with the Red Cross volunteers' previous experiences with providing psychosocial support, which complicated the acceptance and implementation of the new recommendations. Conclusions: This experience highlights the crucial aspect of building evidence users' trust in evidence. Apart from involving end users in the expert panel, we believe that trust can be increased by engaging users early on and continuously during the process of evidence-based practice and by explaining the principles, strengths, and limitations of evidence-based methodology at the start of the process. In return, input and feedback from experienced users may provide valuable insights for evidence synthesizers. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Although these interactions require a considerable time investment, they may benefit all parties, including researchers, evidence implementers, and the target audience. [RankHeat Plot: An R Shiny tool for presenting multiple network meta-analysis outcomes](/colloquium-2023/session/1473394/rankheat-plot-an-r-shiny-tool-for-presenting-multiple-network-meta-analysis-outcomes) Background: The increased number of outcomes and competing interventions assessed in a network meta-analysis (NMA) increases the difficulty of interpreting results and hence challenges their use in everyday clinical practice and policy. Objectives: To facilitate evidence-based decision-making on a clinical topic with multiple outcomes per intervention through a graphical representation of NMA results, the rank-heat plot. We are currently developing the rankheatplot R package and R Shiny app and will disseminate the first version at the conference. Methods: The rankheatplot R Shiny app can be used in any type of discipline and disease using an NMA of multiple interventions compared in different studies obtained from any type of review (i.e., systematic review, rapid review, overview of reviews). The rank-heat plot was first developed and published in 2016. It has been cited in more than 120 publications (Google Scholar) and has been used in multiple areas such as geriatrics, pediatrics, neurology, and oncology. It is already part of the viscomp R package, which presents multiple visualization approaches on component NMA. We developed an interactive web application at https://rankheatplot.com/ to produce the rank-heat plot when the study-level data for each outcome are available and without performing the NMA analysis outside the tool. The tool can be used for any type of data. Results: The rank-heat plot allows the fast identification of the most likely best and worst interventions, with respect to their effectiveness and/or safety, in a given outcome. It can also identify interventions that have not been studied for an included outcome. The rankheatplot app currently performs analyses in a frequentist framework importing intervention outcome results from the netmeta R package. In the next version of the tool, we plan to incorporate the option of conducting the analysis in a Bayesian framework, as well as outputs based on clinically important effects (e.g., minimal clinically important difference). Conclusions: The rank-heat plot summarizes results on all interventions and all outcomes, providing information regarding the ranking of interventions per outcome. The tool can be used to facilitate interpretation and decision-making based on NMA synthesis. No patients were involved in the development of this tool. [Ten Top Tips for using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473570/ten-top-tips-for-using-the-risk-of-bias-2-rob2-tool) Background: In 2019, Cochrane adopted a new tool (RoB 2) for assessing risk of bias in randomised controlled trials. The tool incorporated new advances in bias research and differed markedly from its predecessor in how it was applied. Cochrane introduced a phased implementation of the RoB 2 tool, with mentored support from the Cochrane Methods Support Unit (MSU) to assist authors who were new to using it. The MSU team noticed some commonly occurring misconceptions and misapplications by authors. These could potentially lead to inappropriate assessments of bias which could affect certainty in evidence. Objectives: To compile a list of 10 top tips to help authors apply the RoB 2 tool. Methods: From June 2019 to December 2020, the MSU team assessed 144 reviews and protocols and made a record of the most common misapplications and misconceptions in using RoB 2. We made them into a short list of 10 useful hints and tips for any review authors, not just Cochrane authors, new to using RoB 2. Results: The top tips cover all domains of the RoB 2 tool and are as follows: 1) State the effect of interest. 2) State the outcome to be assessed. 3) Pilot the tool to achieve consistency. 4) Apply the tool to a specific numerical result. 5) Answer all of the signalling questions. 6) Consider whether baseline imbalance reflects problems with the randomisation process rather than chance. 7) Do not assume that a lack of blinding increases risk of bias. 8) Participants changing interventions is not always a cause for concern. 9) Avoid arbitrary thresholds for missing data and consider the analysis used. 10) A 'statistical analysis plan' can be a protocol or a trial register entry\u2014but check the date it was registered. Conclusions: The list of top tips with their explanations can help authors to answer some of the less familiar concepts covered in the new RoB 2 tool as well as offer practical suggestions. We think this will help authors avoid some of the common pitfalls the MSU saw with authors new to using the RoB 2 tool. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Systematic reviews to inform health and social care policy: Incorporating patient and public perspectives](/colloquium-2023/session/1473802/systematic-reviews-to-inform-health-and-social-care-policy-incorporating-patient-and-public-perspectives) Background: The Exeter Policy Research Programme Evidence Review Facility is commissioned to produce systematic reviews to inform health and social care policy. With the focus and direction of each review determined by the priorities of our government stakeholders, it is vital our processes incorporate perspectives from patients and members of the public. Objectives: Discuss our experiences of incorporating the perspectives of patients and members of the public into systematic reviews commissioned to inform government policy. A public collaborator will co-present this presentation. Methods: Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) is embedded within our organisational structure and throughout the review process. A public collaborator is a core member of our team, and we have a standing PPIE group of 15 individuals with an interest in the production and use of evidence syntheses for decision-making. Supported by our PPIE facilitator, they are involved in early scoping and refinement of research requests and development of an involvement plan. Further involvement from individuals with specific topic-related lived experience is sought as projects develop. Training needs of patient and public collaborators are observed with bespoke training to address areas of uncertainty provided by the research team. Reporting of PPIE activities and their impact on the review process and presentation of findings are standard components of all our outputs. Results: Delivering evidence syntheses to inform government policy involves lengthy negotiations to develop focused research questions, alongside changing research priorities and political sensitivity. In this context, incorporating meaningful PPIE throughout the review process can be challenging. The broad scope of topics and fast-paced nature of the work adds further complexity. Embedding PPIE within our organisational structure as well as having a flexible and responsive approach ensures we maximise opportunities for incorporating patient and public perspectives. Embedding PPIE within our organisation empowers patient and public representatives to have their say on issues which matter to them. Conclusions: Patients and members of the public make an invaluable contribution towards our work. Although involvement within the process of conducting reviews for policymakers is not always straightforward, their insights help ensure that government policy reflects the needs of individuals using UK health and social care services. [Identifying guideline needs for newborn and child health in South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria: a priority-setting exercise](/colloquium-2023/session/1473559/identifying-guideline-needs-for-newborn-and-child-health-in-south-africa-malawi-and-nigeria-a-priority-setting-exercise) Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest under-five mortality rate globally. Evidence-informed guidelines are key in supporting healthcare decision-making. The GELA (Global Evidence, Local Adaptation) project aims to enhance the capacity to use global research to develop locally relevant guidelines for newborn and child health in three SSA countries, either de novo or through adaptation of existing guidelines. To achieve this, we first carried out a priority-setting exercise. Objectives: To identify priority newborn and child health topics in South Africa (SA), Malawi, and Nigeria that require guidelines. Methods: We followed good practice for priority-setting, including stakeholder engagement, online surveys, and consensus meetings. We established national Steering Groups (SGs) to help prioritise topics and advise on the process. Members represented government, health professionals, academia, and NGOs; all declared their interests. A variety of stakeholders were engaged via online surveys to rate the importance of topics. Survey results informed national consensus meetings with SGs, in which final priorities were identified. Non-participant observations of SG consensus meetings were conducted to gain insights into processes, dynamics, and contexts. Results: Initial priority topics were identified and added to online surveys, which were open for 3-4 weeks in 2022. Surveys were completed by 37, 23, and 78 people in SA, Malawi, and Nigeria, respectively; similar proportions of participants completed all sections (SA 66%, Malawi 61%, Nigeria 68%). The surveys identified 9, 10, and 8 topics in SA, Malawi, and Nigeria, respectively; these informed several SG consensus meetings. Through voting or discussion at these meetings and scoping guidelines, the top three priorities, per country, were identified. SG meeting observations revealed similar and different capacity gaps (e.g., guideline development process), stakeholder dynamics (e.g., certain dominant voices), and procedural challenges (e.g., voting resistance). These may have impacted the priority setting process and outcomes. Conclusions: Dynamic and iterative stakeholder engagement enabled identification of priority topics for guideline development on newborn and child health. Contextualised priority-setting, though highly recursive and time-intensive, is essential, as shown by the limited overlap in topics prioritised. Patient and stakeholder involvement: Civil society organisations were invited to contribute to the priority setting survey. [How to extract, analyse and present results in scoping reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473622/how-to-extract-analyse-and-present-results-in-scoping-reviews) Background: The extraction, analysis and presentation of results in scoping reviews can be challenging. Inconsistencies and inappropriateness in the analytical approaches undertaken during the analysis and presentation of the data within scoping reviews has been a recurrent issue. Additionally, scoping reviews can include a variety of evidence sources, such as peer-reviewed primary research, reviews, and grey literature, such as guidelines, organizational reports, policies, government documents and blogs. This variety of evidence levels and sources creates challenges when trying to extract, analyse and present the results in a cohesive manner. Objectives: This presentation aims to clarify the process of extracting data from different sources of evidence, discuss what data can be extracted (and what should not) and how to analyse extracted data, including an explanation of basic qualitative content analysis, and offer suggestions for the presentation of results in scoping reviews. Methods: Using best-practice examples and drawing on the expertise of the JBI Scoping Review Methodology group, and a member who is an editor of a journal that publishes scoping reviews, this discussion will expand on existing guidance. Results: Examples of the data extraction process and specifically what can be extracted from the included evidence sources (and what should not) will be presented. The use of basic qualitative content analysis within scoping reviews, including when it should and should not be used, will be showcased. Furthermore, suggestions for the presentation of results in scoping reviews will be discussed. Conclusions: The extraction, analysis and presentation of findings within a scoping review can be challenging because of the variety of evidence sources that scoping reviews can typically include and the absence of specific guidance for reviewers. This discussion will hopefully address these challenges and guide how to extract, analyse and present data within scoping reviews. It is hoped that scoping review authors will use this guidance to improve the quality and clarity of published scoping reviews and make conducting and reporting scoping reviews easier. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [The revised JBI critical appraisal tool for the assessment of risk of bias for randomized controlled trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473518/the-revised-jbi-critical-appraisal-tool-for-the-assessment-of-risk-of-bias-for-randomized-controlled-trials) Background: JBI (formally known as the Joanna Briggs Institute) offers a suite of critical appraisal instruments that are freely available to evidence synthesisers. These instruments have been developed by JBI and collaborators and approved by the JBI Scientific Committee following extensive consultation. Following recent developments within the science of risk of bias assessment, it has been acknowledged that the existing suite of instruments are not aligned to these developments and conflate and confuse the process of critical appraisal with that of risk of bias assessment. Objectives: Here, we introduce the revised critical appraisal tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and detail the key changes made from the previous iteration. Results: Methods: The JBI Effectiveness Methodology Group (EMG) began the update procedure by cataloguing the questions asked in each JBI critical appraisal tool for study designs that employ quantitative data. These questions were ordered into constructs of validity (internal, statistical conclusion, comprehensiveness of reporting, external) following DELPHI-like methods. For questions that were related to the internal validity construct, they were further catalogued to a domain of bias through a series of mapping exercises. Finally, questions were then separated based on whether they were answered at the study, outcome, or result level. Findings: A strength of the JBI critical appraisal instruments has been their flexibility to facilitate assessments of risk of bias following different approaches. However, due to their presentation, using the tools following a domain-based approach was not intuitive to all users. By presenting the questions to the validity of construct they belong and the domain of bias they address, users of the tool are better placed to follow a domain-based approach using these new tools if they choose. The revised instrument also identifies which questions address internal validity and which questions should be addressed at different hierarchal levels. Conclusions: The revision to the JBI critical appraisal instruments aims to provide greater flexibility to users of these tools. It is expected that this work will increase the usability and applicability of these instruments while maintaining consistency with modern advances in evidence synthesis. [Co-Producing a resource for intervention development: The Nature on Prescription Handbook.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473677/co-producing-a-resource-for-intervention-development-the-nature-on-prescription-handbook.) Background and Objective: There is increased interest in nature-based interventions (NBIs) to support mental health. These interventions are complex, operating across sectors, with a variety of activities, populations and environments. Previous research has highlighted poor elucidation of how and why context influences the outcomes observed in NBIs. In the United Kingdom, a rise in social prescribing, where people are supported into community/voluntary organisations, has expanded without concomitant evidence-based guidance to underpin intervention development. This presented an imperative to work with stakeholders to coproduce a nature-based intervention development resource. Methods: A realist review was conducted to develop initial programme theory and inform a set of stakeholder interviews. Interviews explored identified mechanisms in the context of real-world experience. Subsequently, a workshop series engaging a wider pool of providers was carried out to refine guidance documentation. Results: The realist review [n=1,343 results identified through database searches (n=5), plus reference scanning of key topic reviews, and grey literature review] identified 10 key mechanisms through which health and well-being benefits are likely to accrue through NBIs (Being outside, Making a difference, Being in a group, Physical activity, Personal achievement, Having fun, Personal growth, Creativity, Caring, Relationship to Nature). Interviews (n=13) helped to define pathways linking these mechanisms to 10 specific intervention activities and four types of outcomes. Preliminary guidance based on this logic model was developed. In workshops (n=4) (44 participants), theoretical exercises allowed providers to consider implementation of the guidance for their particular context and requirements; the results were used to refine the guidance. Conclusion: Coproduction allowed us to integrate the best available evidence with contemporary experience, to produce an evidence-based handbook which has validity for providers and is based on robust programme theory. Relevance and Importance to Patients: The handbook has more than 2,100 downloads, from 60 countries. It has been accessed by activity providers, health professionals, professional institutes, government departments and local authorities. Ongoing commissioned work, testing the feasibility of nature-based activities reached through social prescribing, builds on our programme theory. The aim is to provide patients with access to interventions that are appropriate, effective and safe. [Prioritising Cochrane reviews on the prevention and treatment of obesity: a mapping and stakeholder consultation project](/colloquium-2023/session/1473406/prioritising-cochrane-reviews-on-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-obesity-a-mapping-and-stakeholder-consultation-project) Background: The WHO notes that worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. In 2016, over 650 million adults were obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers. Clinical practice and public health guidelines on the prevention and treatment of obesity rely on the availability of up-to-date synthesised evidence. It is therefore important for Cochrane to produce timely and relevant reviews that can inform such guidelines. Objectives: To identify reviews in the Cochrane Library (CL) related to obesity. To identify relevant guidelines and note the evidence gaps highlighted by these guidelines. To develop research questions from these evidence gaps. To map the list of CL reviews against these questions. To consult with stakeholders to prioritise questions for future reviews. Methods: In Phase 1, we undertook systematic searches for Cochrane reviews published at any time and for relevant guidelines. We identified evidence gaps and formulated research questions for these gaps. We then mapped the existing Cochrane reviews against the formulated questions to identify areas where new reviews or updates of reviews are needed. In Phase 2, we developed an online questionnaire, identified stakeholders, and asked them to prioritise the questions for which Cochrane reviews are needed. Results: Table 1 describes the outputs at each stage of the process. We identified 36 reviews and 7 protocols, as well as 22 eligible guidelines. We formulated 49 research questions that could be addressed by Cochrane intervention reviews. The Gap Map highlighted that none of the existing Cochrane reviews were both up-to-date and comprehensively answered the developed questions. We therefore included all the questions in our consultation with stakeholders. Thirty-six expert stakeholders participated in an online consultation exercise. Table 2 provides our 'top ten' review questions as prioritised by stakeholders. Conclusions: This project identified priorities for reviews in the critically important area of obesity. We recommend that Cochrane authors address the prioritised review questions, in consultation with evidence users. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We involved people with lived experience of obesity in our consultation and sought expertise from people from indigenous backgrounds. [Risk of bias tools: a systematic review of usability](/colloquium-2023/session/1473398/risk-of-bias-tools-a-systematic-review-of-usability) Background: Inappropriate design, conduct and analysis of studies can lead to biased estimates of outcomes. Therefore, risk of bias (RoB) assessment of included studies is a crucial step in systematic reviews. Several tools exist to facilitate RoB assessments. Despite their widespread use, their usability is not well summarised. Objectives: To review published findings of studies evaluating commonly used RoB tools. Methods: We included RoB tools listed in the Library of Assessment Tools and InsTruments Used to assess Data validity in Evidence Synthesis (LATITUDES) Network. We conducted a forward citation search from the primary report for each RoB tool. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and potentially relevant full texts. We included studies with the objective of evaluating the design and/or usability of an included tool. We summarise the structure and features of the different included tools, as well as similarities and differences between the tools. For each tool, we outline included study characteristics and methodology. Employing a deductive approach, one reviewer will use NViVo software to extract information meeting prespecified codes developed by the team (e.g., comments on usability of the tool, specific challenging items, and recommendations for future development). If other relevant information arises, we will move to an inductive approach and add new codes (which will be discussed within the team). Results: This review is in progress. Results will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Risk of bias assessment is an important part of the systematic review process. The findings of this review are expected to inform the development and updating of RoB tools, which in turn may positively affect the robustness of evidence production. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [The power of storyboarding as an analytical tool in QES: From review to fieldwork to dissemination](/colloquium-2023/session/1473465/the-power-of-storyboarding-as-an-analytical-tool-in-qes-from-review-to-fieldwork-to-dissemination) Background: Storyboarding in research can be used as a dynamic way to engage in the research process and as a form of data collection. Storyboarding can express a story for both participants and researchers to engage in, and it creates an opportunity between various stakeholders to form a shared language. Objectives: We aimed to test the utility of the qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) analytical method 'synthesis by storyboarding' against the lived experiences of young women living with perinatal infections of HIV (YWLPIHIV). Methods: As part of a larger study to explore treatment adherence for YWLPHIV, we conducted a QES up to November 2021, which included 47 studies, and synthesized 9 storylines (Hendricks et al. 2022). We analyzed the data using 'synthesis by storyboarding'. As a second phase, we conducted a primary study. First, we interviewed YWLPHIV about their experiences of their treatment adherence, and then we asked them to edit the QES storyboard to reflect their own lived experiences. Results: At first, most participants sat in silence, then some had highly emotive responses. We found that each YWLPHIV could relate to elements on the storyboard, including loss of parents, anxiety of disclosure, the emotional rollercoaster of adherence as a teenager, and desire to live without fear of judgement. Even though the storyboard was comprehensive, further detail could be added using their stories. Conclusions: Storyboarding was found to be a useful analytical method in QES. YWLPHIV found the storyboards to be reflective of their own adherence journeys. This innovative visual synthesis created an opportunity for YWLPHIV to engage in review-level findings, make sense of their own stories, and contribute further insights to the identification of evidence gaps. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Using storyboarding, the YWLPHIV felt included because they were able to engage in and comment on the review, something they thought impossible at first: \"Ek het nooit gedink dat ek die hele ding kan lees nie!\" (I never thought I would be able to read this whole thing!). We further used the storyboard as a 1mX1m cloth exhibit on which young women placed their own personal objects that shared their story of adherence for public engagement. [Scoping reviews for WHO guidelines: using a two-tiered search strategy to balance efficiency and comprehensiveness](/colloquium-2023/session/1473555/scoping-reviews-for-who-guidelines-using-a-two-tiered-search-strategy-to-balance-efficiency-and-comprehensiveness) Background: Scoping reviews (ScRs) aim to comprehensively map available evidence on a particular topic, and both primary studies and systematic reviews (SRs) may be eligible for inclusion. For well-developed topics, primary studies are usually included in the often numerous SRs available, and thus, restricting scoping to SRs may be sufficient, particularly if these include recent SRs. For less well-developed topics, a balance between including SRs and primary studies may be needed to ensure adequate representation of the available evidence, while maintaining efficiency. Objective: To describe a two-tiered search strategy for time-sensitive ScRs where different considerations necessitated tiered searching. The ScR topics included lesser-known interventions with scant evidence or new interventions and settings with an immature evidence base and limited synthesised evidence. Methods: We developed and applied two-tiered searching in two time-sensitive ScRs for World Health Organization (WHO) nutrition guidelines, supported by an information specialist. Comprehensive a priori frameworks of all possibly eligible interventions were developed. The first-tier search was limited to SRs. Following data extraction, the frameworks were used for gap analyses identifying interventions or strategies not covered by the eligible SRs. These analyses informed the targeted second-tier searches to identify eligible primary studies addressing these gaps. Results: After including eligible SRs, the frameworks enabled quick identification of eligible interventions or strategies not covered by SR evidence. The first-tier search resulted in 15 eligible SRs (from yield n=492) and the second-tier search in 12 eligible primary studies (from yield n=1,699) for one ScR. For the other ScR, the first-tier search resulted in 69 eligible SRs (from yield n=1,448) and the second-tier search in 24 eligible primary studies (from yield n=545). This tiered approach produced manageable yields and improved efficiency when compared with broad searching for SRs and primary studies across multiple interventions, which often results in prohibitively high yields. Conclusions: This strategy enabled the efficient production of comprehensive ScRs informing the prioritisation of key guideline questions within time-sensitive policy windows. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. The ScRs are informing WHO public health nutrition guidelines aimed at achieving the best health outcomes possible for the public. [Working together to prioritise and synthesise evidence about promising alternative models of healthcare delivery for a more sustainable health system](/colloquium-2023/session/1473869/working-together-to-prioritise-and-synthesise-evidence-about-promising-alternative-models-of-healthcare-delivery-for-a-more-sustainable-health-system) Background: Healthcare expenditure is growing at an unsustainable rate in developed countries. A recent scoping review identified several alternative healthcare delivery models with the potential to improve health system sustainability. Objectives: To (1) obtain input and consensus from an expert Delphi panel of policy, clinical, and consumer stakeholders about alternative models they considered most promising for increasing value in healthcare delivery in Australia, and (2) synthesise the evidence about the effects of three priority models. Methods: The panel first reviewed a list of 84 models obtained through a preceding scoping review and contributed additional ideas in an open round. In a subsequent scoring round, the panel rated the priority of each model in terms of its potential to improve healthcare sustainability in Australia. Consensus was assumed when more than 50% of the panel rated a model as (1) very high or high priority or (2) not a priority or low priority. Results: Eighty-two of 149 invited participants (55%) representing all Australian states/territories and wide expertise completed round one; 71 completed round two. Consensus on high priority was achieved for 59 alternative models; 14 were rated as (very) high priority by 70% of the panel. Top priorities included models for delivery and coordination of primary and/or secondary care for older adults living in aged care facilities, home versus hospital delivery of intravenous anti-cancer therapy for adults with cancer, and early discharge hospital at home versus in-hospital care for people with various conditions. These priorities have informed three new Cochrane reviews. No consensus was reached on 47 models, but no model was deemed low priority. Conclusions: Input from an expert stakeholder panel identified healthcare delivery models not previously synthesised in systematic reviews that were a priority to investigate and led directly to new Cochrane reviews. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Consumer advocacy organisation representatives contributed to the Delphi panel. [Challenges in using RoB2: worked example from a systematic review of remote therapies for alcohol and drug misuse.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473797/challenges-in-using-rob2-worked-example-from-a-systematic-review-of-remote-therapies-for-alcohol-and-drug-misuse.) Background: RoB 2, the revised Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), aims to increase the reliability of assessments. Objectives: To share our experience of using RoB 2 in a systematic review on remote alcohol and drug misuse therapies. Methods: An experienced review team conducted 53 RoB 2 assessments of 45 RCTs for two substance use outcomes (several studies reported both outcomes). Results: We experienced the following challenges: 1. Prespecifying the outcome: Our review included heterogeneous studies evaluating complex interventions with a range of outcomes. With no preferred outcome indicated by review commissioners, to prespecify an outcome we had to familiarise ourselves with the studies prior to quality appraisal, despite this not being considered best practice. Recommendation: Guidance should recognise that not all reviews include a homogeneous study set, with a standardised outcome measure. As an alternative to prespecification of outcomes, reviewers could prespecify 'decision rules', for example, to select the most reported outcome. 2. Assessing and reporting multiple outcomes: Studies with multiple eligible outcomes, required time-consuming and largely repetitive assessments. Although some aspects of RoB 2 are specific to each outcome included, others apply to the whole study. Recommendation: Adapt RoB 2 to allow for multiple assessments of a single study. 3. Interpreting statistics and trial methodology: RoB 2 demands sophisticated understanding of methodological aspects such as randomization procedures and handling missing data. Recommendation: More examples and scenarios should be included in the guidance. 4. Difficulty navigating the guidance: The application of RoB 2 to our set of complex studies necessitated frequent referral to the training videos and the full guidance, as we found the crib sheet lacked sufficient detail. Repeated rounds of piloting and development of a review-specific guidance document were also necessary to ensure consistency of application. Recommendation: Consolidate guidance into a single, multilayered resource, making it easier to delve deeper into explanations and examples when needed. Conclusions: Application of RoB 2 is challenging and time-consuming even for an experienced review team. Broad and/or complex reviews may be particularly susceptible to these challenges. We propose user-friendly ways to revise the RoB 2 tool and guidance documents. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre: Mapping policy evidence-needs to support evidence-based decision-making](/colloquium-2023/session/1473551/health-and-care-research-wales-evidence-centre-mapping-policy-evidence-needs-to-support-evidence-based-decision-making) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a need for timely, high-quality evidence outputs to inform health and social care decision-making. At the Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre (2021-2023) we developed an inclusive approach to include stakeholder involvement, including public contributors, across all stages of our research processes (research question prioritisation; rapid evidence synthesis; rapid primary research; knowledge mobilisation) to support evidence-based decision-making. This enabled 19 reports to be referenced in Welsh Government COVID-19 relevant papers including infection control, education policy and tackling gender inequalities. Objectives: As we transition to the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre (March 2023), we describe our refined collaborative approach to ensure our work addresses the most important policy needs to achieve impact. Methods: We are conducting a policy mapping exercise in collaboration with the Welsh Government 'Science Evidence Advice' and 'Knowledge Analytical Service' teams, involving a 45-minute online discussion with policy leads. We explore policy drivers, evidence needs, the type of evidence required (evidence synthesis or primary research) and timeframes. Potential research questions are then considered for adoption onto our work programme. They require a clear pathway to impact, equity and cost considerations and are themed with 'A Healthier Wales policy'. Prioritisation includes discussions with the Welsh Government evidence teams; our coapplicant team with domain and methods expertise, including public contributors; and our expert steering committee, to avoid duplication with external research groups. This will be followed by a similar evidence-mapping exercise with Welsh NHS and Social Care leads. Results: We have completed 25/30 meetings; 92 potential research questions have been identified and will undergo prioritisation as above. Most target the long-term policy aims of improved population health and wellbeing, better quality and accessible services, and higher value health and social care, with fewer questions focused on the health and social care workforce. Conclusions: Our mapping exercise prioritises the needs of evidence users and ensures that evidence addresses priority questions that are important to them. Partnership with Welsh Government evidence providers and public contributors reduces unnecessary duplication and ensures maximum impact. Public involvement: Throughout our processes to ensure the evidence is relevant and important to patients. [Method and tools for implementing comparative effectiveness research: a Dutch example](/colloquium-2023/session/1574273/method-and-tools-for-implementing-comparative-effectiveness-research-a-dutch-example) Background: Both conventional and new treatment strategies often lack scientific evidence of effectiveness. Still, they demand finite resources. In the Netherlands, healthcare professionals, health insurers and patient advocates work together to systematically prioritise, execute and implement comparative effectiveness research (CER). After results come available, they are promptly interpreted and adopted in clinical guidelines. All Dutch hospitals have organisational infrastructure with which participating in CER and implementation of new knowledge is stimulated. Description: With the growing demand for healthcare, increasing challenges in staff shortage and new treatment strategies popping up every day, the challenges we face to keep healthcare available and of high quality are tremendous. For the past 5 years, we have worked in a nationwide collaborative to 'close the quality circle'. We experienced what is needed for different stakeholders to work together and develop tools to enable everyone to contribute. And even though we have made great progress, there is still a lot to learn. Therefore, we need the knowledge and experience from all participants who are working in policy making, patient involvement, healthcare research and management of healthcare organizations. In this presentation, we share the Dutch method of lowering barriers (example 'Veldnorm'), stimulating participation (web-based monitoring of research) and collaborating with all parties who have a role in healthcare. What was effective in the Netherlands so far? What can we learn from others? Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The collaboration and way of working together in the Netherlands is necessary to keep our healthcare available to all. The Netherlands Patients Federation is one of the contributors to this collaboration. We closely work together with patient advocates in all aspects of prioritising and executing CER and implementing results. [Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews: Development and Dissemination of the PRIOR Statement](/colloquium-2023/session/1473582/preferred-reporting-items-for-overviews-of-reviews-development-and-dissemination-of-the-prior-statement) Background: Overviews of reviews were originally conceived by Cochrane to offer a \"friendly front-end\" to their systematic reviews. Overviews are useful for decision-makers (healthcare providers, policy makers, patients) because they bring together systematic reviews on related topics (e.g., different interventions for a given condition) in a single product. The Cochrane Handbook provides methodological guidance; however, to date, there has been no reporting guideline for overviews. Consistent and transparent reporting is critical to support the production and use of trusted evidence. Objectives: Describe the development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) reporting guideline and discuss dissemination strategies. Methods: We followed the approach recommended by the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network. An international team from eight countries and four continents developed PRIOR, including members with various roles (e.g., reviewers, methodologists, journal editors, public, representatives of organizations that produce reviews). Multiple stages occurred: establishing a team and protocol, establishing the need for a reporting guideline through evidence reviews of published overviews, systematic reviews of existing methodological guidance, modified Delphi to identify relevant items for reporting, and development of the guideline. Results: PRIOR consists of a checklist (27 main items, 19 sub-items), explanation and elaboration document, and flow diagram. A manuscript describing PRIOR was published in the British Medical Journal (doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2022-070849). PRIOR is also available through the EQUATOR Network (https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/reporting-guideline-for-overviews-of-reviews-of-healthcare-interventions-development-of-the-prior-statement/). Conclusions: PRIOR fills an important need for an evidence-based reporting guideline to support authors of overviews of reviews. Active efforts are needed to ensure effective dissemination and uptake. Dissemination plans include communication strategies and materials (e.g., infographics, tip sheets, blog shots), education modules (e.g., slide decks), presentations (e.g., webinars, workshops), and contacting editors of journals that regularly publish overviews of reviews to encourage endorsement and use by authors and peer-reviewers. Regular evaluations of the reporting quality of published overviews are important to assess the impact of PRIOR and to identify areas that warrant additional detail or clarity. Wide adoption of PRIOR from overview authors will help in the production and use of evidence by decision-makers. Patient/public involvement: Members of the public or patients were involved in the Delphi, attended consensus meetings, and were co-authors. [Introducing LATITUDES, a library of assessment tools and instruments used to assess data validity in evidence syntheses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473527/introducing-latitudes-a-library-of-assessment-tools-and-instruments-used-to-assess-data-validity-in-evidence-syntheses) Background: Evidence syntheses provide the most reliable form of evidence for decision-makers. A formal assessment of the validity of included studies is an essential component of any systematic review. This requires a formal risk of bias (RoB)/quality assessment tool. Many tools are available, usually designed specifically for different study designs and/or topic areas. Objectives: To introduce the LATITUDES Network, a library of assessment tools and instruments used to assess data validity in evidence syntheses. Methods: We are establishing LATITUDES to increase the robustness of evidence syntheses by improving the process of validity (RoB/quality) assessment. Our goals are to increase the use of key tools, help people use tools more effectively, improve incorporation of the validity assessment into the review and disseminate best practice in validity assessment. Results: LATITUDES (www.latitudes-network.org) aims to improve the overall quality of research syntheses by improving the process of validity assessment. The LATITUDES website will be launched formally at the Colloquium. We will provide a complementary initiative inspired by the EQUATOR Network (www.equator-network.org), an influential international resource to improve the reporting and transparency of health research studies. The LATITUDES network will index validity assessment tools developed for healthcare studies in an online library. Key RoB tools will be highlighted to help reviewers identify the optimum tool for their review. Project outputs and communication will focus around a freely available online platform featuring the library, key tools, toolkits, online training materials and links to courses and events. Conclusions: LATITUDES aims to be the primary resource networking reviewers to key information when planning and conducting validity assessment for their review. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Center and NIH Pathways to Prevention programs: A decade-long partnership in closing evidence gaps](/colloquium-2023/session/1473725/ahrq-evidence-based-practice-center-and-nih-pathways-to-prevention-programs-a-decade-long-partnership-in-closing-evidence-gaps) Background: The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)'s Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program produces evidence reports to inform healthcare decision-makers such as funding agencies supporting new research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s Pathways to Prevention (P2P) Program, established by the NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), uses inclusive, transparent, unbiased, and rigorous processes in its workshops to engage U.S. federal agencies, researchers, stakeholders, and the public; identify scientific gaps in disease prevention; and develop a research agenda to move the field forward. Since 2013, the EPC Program has partnered with NIH-ODP by providing systematic reviews for P2P Workshops that support research recommendation development aimed at closing evidence gaps. Objectives: (1) To describe EPC review and P2P workshop processes used by the AHRQ and NIH to identify and prioritize key research gaps and develop an actionable plan to address them; (2) to provide a summary of previous reviews and workshops including accomplishments resulting from these efforts; and (3) to share lessons learned from this longstanding AHRQ-NIH partnership. Methods: A descriptive review of past systematic reviews and workshops since P2P program inception was conducted including portfolio analysis of funding opportunities and grants resulting from the AHRQ-NIH partnership. Results: Eleven P2P workshops, all supported by EPC systematic reviews, were convened since program inception, covering a wide range of topics including opioids for chronic pain, health equity in preventive services, and youth suicide prevention. Accomplishments include 26 high-impact journal publications and several NIH funding opportunities yielding 20 grant awards supported by over $66M in funding aimed at closing evidence gaps identified by the AHRQ-NIH partnership. Recommendations from independent unbiased panels presiding over P2P workshops helped create action plans in further partnership with other federal agencies. Solicitation of public comments on draft evidence reports and panel recommendations allowed transparency and encouraged stakeholder engagement. Conclusions: Synergies from close collaboration between evidence review producers and research funders can result in a robust strategy to identify crucial evidence gaps that hinder delivery of evidence-based care to patients. An inclusive process that engages unbiased experts, researchers, and the public helps develop research agenda that ultimately improves patient outcomes. [Is Quality Appraisal Enough? Confidence in Heterogeneous Interventions' Effectiveness](/colloquium-2023/session/1473808/is-quality-appraisal-enough-confidence-in-heterogeneous-interventions'-effectiveness) Background: Quality appraisal (QA) tools, e.g., RoB 2, are used to assess the likely risk of bias caused by methodological limitations of studies included in systematic reviews. Objectives: To consider the utility of standard QA tools and other methodological issues that, whilst ostensibly not reflecting an individual study's quality, undermine confidence in a body of primary evidence. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of controlled studies evaluating structural adolescent contraceptive interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We planned a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to explore differences between studies we categorised as 'likely effective' and 'likely ineffective'. However, methodological our confidence in this categorisation. Furthermore, these methodological issues were not captured by standard QA tools. Results: We included 17 studies with heterogeneous study designs. Some methodological characteristics, e.g., whether outcomes were self-reported, were captured in standard QA tools. However, others, such as variable lengths of follow-up and different baseline levels of the outcome measure, could not be. Similarly, heterogeneity in the exact outcome measure used and who was included in the sample for that particular outcome all affected the comparability of effectiveness without being methodological limitations per se. Variation in these characteristics influenced our confidence in comparing and categorising the interventions' effectiveness. These methodological concerns were spread throughout the set of studies, i.e., both the 'likely effective' and 'likely ineffective' sets. Conclusions: QA tools do not capture all of the factors that can affect reviewers' confidence in studies' findings or the comparability of findings. This is particularly likely for topics lacking standardised measurements, or heterogeneous methods, which is not unusual in the fields of public health and development. Reviewers should be aware of the risks of over-relying on standard tools in determining their confidence in studies' findings. Although we could have only included a narrow set of studies with comparable methodological characteristics, this would have prevented synthesis and limited our findings. Reviews have a role in highlighting methodological heterogeneity and calling for greater consensus on methods and outcomes among primary researchers. PPI: Two advisory groups were convened. One, comprising global decision-makers and evaluators, met twice. Another, involving Mozambican adolescents, met once. [Producing Cochrane reviews with multi-stakeholder synergic involvement. An experience with treatments for multiple sclerosis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473880/producing-cochrane-reviews-with-multi-stakeholder-synergic-involvement.-an-experience-with-treatments-for-multiple-sclerosis) Background: Involvement of key stakeholders and evidence users in the planning and development of systematic reviews (SRs) improve their overall quality and usefulness, facilitate uptake and reduce health inequities. Synergy among entities influencing or making decisions in health is important to avoid conflict, duplication of efforts and resource waste. Objectives: To present an example of harmonization in decision-making on disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) involving the Cochrane Review Group for MS and Rare Diseases of the CNS (CRGMS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre on Evidence Synthesis and Guideline Production of Bologna, Italy (WHOCC) and the MS International Federation (MSIF), a nonprofit organisation. Methods: The CRGMS produced four SRs, two with pairwise and two with network meta-analysis (NMA), including 30 DMTs for MS. The SRs served as the evidence base for clinical practice recommendations developed according to the GRADE methodology by two international multi-stakeholder guideline panels (MSIF Off-Label Treatments panel, MOLT and MSIF Essential Medicines Panel, MEMP) appointed by MSIF. A productive interaction between the CRGMS and both guideline panels at the SRs planning and development stage helped to identify outcomes that are meaningful for persons with MS and clinicians. Imprecision in the NMA estimates was assessed within a fully contextualised approach where thresholds between different magnitudes of effect were set by means of health state utility values, determined through scoping reviews and guideline panel judgement. The WHOCC contributed to the evidence base for domains on cost and resource use of the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework. Results: An application for the inclusion of the first-ever DMTs for the treatment of MS in the 23rd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) was submitted by MSIF and the WHOCC, based on the evidence base that informed rigorously developed recommendations by two highly representative multi-stakeholder panels on the use of labelled and off-label DMTs. Conclusions: Involvement of key stakeholders in the planning and development stages of Cochrane reviews of intervention, together with mutual collaboration among different actors in the ecosystem of health decision-making, may facilitate Cochrane becoming a knowledge translation-oriented organization. [Global Evidence, Local Adaptation: Integrated Knowledge Translation strategies to enhance evidence-informed newborn and child health guidelines in three African countries](/colloquium-2023/session/1473642/global-evidence-local-adaptation-integrated-knowledge-translation-strategies-to-enhance-evidence-informed-newborn-and-child-health-guidelines-in-three-african-countries) Background: The Global Evidence, Local Adaptation (GELA) project aims to maximise the impact of research on poverty-related diseases by increasing researchers' and decision-makers' capacity to use global research to develop locally relevant guidelines for newborn and child health in Malawi, Nigeria and South Africa. To facilitate collaboration with stakeholders, we adopted an integrated knowledge translation (IKT) strategy within GELA\u2014systematically mapping and engaging decision-makers and stakeholders and ensuring ongoing communication and dissemination. Given limited research on IKT in African settings, we documented our team's IKT capacity, skills and process for developing and implementing IKT in these countries. Methods: Six IKT champions and a coordinator formed the GELA IKT Working Group. We gathered information on our baseline IKT competencies and processes within GELA, and opportunities, challenges and lessons learnt, from April 2022 to March 2023 (Year 1). We held (1) five 2-hour Working Group meetings during Year 1 (slides and video recordings); (2) developed process documents (flowcharts and templates); and (3) recorded our experiences with developing and implementing the country-specific IKT strategies. Results: Figure 1 outlines the process followed to develop and implement country-specific IKT strategies. All KT champions have similar training in evidence-informed decision-making, but their training in IKT varied. KT champions felt it was challenging to carry out a comprehensive mapping of stakeholders, determine stakeholders' level of interest and influence on GELA using the power-interest matrix, and identify realistic indicators for monitoring the country-specific strategies. Champions drew on existing relationships with national Ministries of Health and other stakeholders within their respective countries to identify new and relevant stakeholders. Implementation of initial stakeholder engagement activities required heterogeneous and iterative approaches to achieve similar KT goals. Conclusions: Our experiences of adopting an IKT approach within GELA can help colleagues in similar African settings intentionally and systematically plan for IKT, as well as communication and dissemination of project outcomes. The flexible and evolving nature of IKT can help champions and researchers tailor activities and processes according to stakeholder needs and preferences in their context. There is a need for further research on indicators for monitoring and evaluating IKT. [Mismatch between overall and pairwise overlap analysis in a sample of overviews: A methodological review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473433/mismatch-between-overall-and-pairwise-overlap-analysis-in-a-sample-of-overviews-a-methodological-review) Background: Overlap of primary studies among systematic reviews (SRs) is a key methodological challenge for overviews. There are limited reports of the methods being used to deal with overlap by overview authors. The corrected covered area (CCA) is a widely accepted method to assess overlap, but no detailed CCA assessment of a representative sample of overviews has been made using an overall and a pairwise approach. Objectives: To describe the approaches used to deal with the overlap within overviews, and to estimate and compare the assessment of overlap using an overall and a pairwise approach. Methods: We searched PubMed for overviews published in 2018. Two independent authors conducted the screening process. We described the strategy used for assessing overlap and calculated overall and pairwise CCA for each overview using the GROOVE tool. Results: We analysed a random sample of 30 out of 89 eligible articles (Figure 1). Eleven did not address the overlap. Of the remaining 19, the most common strategies used were visual representation (11/19) and discussion of overlap as a limitation (10/19). Median overall CCA among the included overviews was 6.7%. The pairwise analysis showed that 52.8% of SR pairs had slight overlap, whereas 28.3% had very high overlap. Our analysis showed that 8/30 overviews with overall slight or moderate overlap had at least 20% of pairwise nodes (pairs of SRs) with high overlap, and 2/30 overviews with high overlap had at least 20% of pairwise nodes with slight or moderate overlap (Figure 2). Figure 3 provides an example of an overview with moderate overall overlap and a high proportion of highly overlapped pairs of SRs. Conclusions: Reported strategies for addressing overlap vary considerably among overview authors. The pairwise approach for assessing the CCA revealed highly overlapped pairs of SRs in overviews with overall slight overlap and vice versa. We encourage authors to complement the overall CCA assessment with a pairwise approach. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients or consumers were involved in this research. [ABSTRACT FIG 1 COCHRANE.png](https://colloquium2023-submissions.cochrane.org/sites/2023.colloquium.cochrane.org/files/uploads/users/u17038/ABSTRACT%20FIG%201%20COCHRANE.png) [ABSTRACT FIG 2 COCHRANE.png](https://colloquium2023-submissions.cochrane.org/sites/2023.colloquium.cochrane.org/files/uploads/users/u17038/ABSTRACT%20FIG%202%20COCHRANE.png) [ABSTRACT MA) of randomised trials (RCTs) is considered the gold standard for evaluating whether an intervention is beneficial and further to identify which individuals benefit most from the intervention. However, IPD requires considerable time and resources from both reviewers and trial investigators. It is therefore important that IPD is used optimally. Objective and Methods: Our objective is to elucidate some key considerations and possibilities for optimal IPD use throughout the entire course of an IPD MA project using an example to demonstrate the potential benefits this brings. Firstly, it is critical that appropriate and complete data is collected, thoroughly checked, and documented. Units and coding systems, precise outcome definitions, and covariate adjustment factors should be harmonized across trials. Prior to analysis, missing data, power for treatment-covariate interaction analysis, design complexities, and non-proportionality of hazards (for time-to-event outcomes) should be considered at the trial level. Considerations at the meta-analysis level may include scale of effect measure (e.g., relative vs absolute), avoidance of aggregation bias when analysing treatment-covariate interactions, and consideration of multiple interactions and/or higher-order interactions. Finally, results should be presented and described clearly so as to be understood by different stakeholder groups. All methods should be detailed in advance within protocols and analysis plans. Results: In our example, an IPD MA of RCTs investigating the long-term benefits of adding docetaxel chemotherapy to standard of care for men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, we demonstrate considerable gains from maximising the use of collected IPD. This includes identification of clinically important complex interactions which may not have been identified using simpler methodology. Conclusions: Given the considerable effort, resources, and time it takes to collect IPD, it is important to plan, check data, and undertake analysis in a manner which fully maximises its potential. Considering detailed investigations at the trial level can greatly inform the eventual MA, bringing substantial benefits. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Two patient representatives have been involved in the design, interpretation, and dissemination of our example meta-analysis. Both are supportive of the importance of maximising the value of IPD in our MAs going forward. [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for living systematic reviews (LSRs)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473544/preferred-reporting-items-for-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-prisma-extension-for-living-systematic-reviews-lsrs) Background: There is substantive variation in how living systematic reviews (LSRs) are reported. An extension to the current Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement is needed to better address the unique aspects of LSR reporting. Objectives: To develop an extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Methods: We followed the EQUATOR Network's guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines. The methodology included a literature review to identify possible new items or elements, a survey of stakeholder groups' representatives on the proposed additions, and online discussions with those representatives. We then drafted the checklist extension and associated flow diagrams for final feedback and approval. Results: PRISMA-LSR includes four new items on (1) living mode parameters, (2) changes to the methods, (3) changes to the results, and (4) authors and their roles. It also includes a number of new elements under existing PRISMA 2020 items on identification of the report as 'living' in the title, versioning, justification for adopting the living mode, plans for retirement from the living mode, updating collected data and risk of bias information for a previously included study, analytical methods specific to the living mode, a description of what triggered the current version, illustration of results of the search and selection processes of in the different versions, limitations related to the living mode, changes since the preceding version to the implications of the results, planned changes to review methods in upcoming versions, changes since the preceding version in sources support, competing interests, and accessibility of data, code, and materials. The extension also addresses the LSR status which serves to inform about the status of the review in interim period between published versions. The checklist is designed for full reports, a modular approach, and is designed to allow flexibility to users. Conclusions: PRISMA extension for LSRs accounts for the unique aspects of LSR reporting and can be used by authors and publishers to guide and standardize LSR reporting. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Improving the reporting of LSRs is essential for providing stakeholders with synthesized evidence in a timely manner. [The problems with systematic reviews: working towards the solutions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473482/the-problems-with-systematic-reviews-working-towards-the-solutions) Background: Systematic reviews are the gold-standard of evidence syntheses and underpin decision making which affects outcomes for patients and health consumers. Our living systematic review has found 485 articles documenting 67 discrete problems relating to the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews which can potentially jeopardise their reliability or validity.[1] A dedicated website has been created (https://systematicreviewlution.com/) to thematically categorise and elaborate these issues around four overarching domains relating to systematic reviews being 1) comprehensive, 2) rigorous, 3) transparent, and 4) objective. The next phase of this research is to engage researchers working in systematic review to discuss the challenges around the trustworthiness of systematic reviews and explore solutions to the problems identified. (PROSPERO: CRD42020181371; Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/2hmv9/) Objectives: To perform a prioritisation exercise of the problems with systematic reviews identified by consulting with researchers internationally and across disciplines to improve future systematic reviews. Methods: Corresponding study authors of the 485 included papers will be invited via email to take part in a prioritisation exercise. Systematic review problems will be ranked based on relative importance, the severity or risk posed, and the ease of solution for the 67 problems identified thus far. Study methods for this work will be prespecified and registered with the OSF. Results: Results of the prioritisation exercise with researchers will be twofold: 1) The project website will be expanded to incorporate the results of the engagement with researchers and to increase the value of www.systematicreviewlution.com as a research resource in systematic reviews and 2) A corresponding journal article will be used to further promote the research findings. Conclusions: Systematic reviews have a pivotal role in medical decision-making due to apparent comprehensive, rigorous, replicable, and objective processes. In addition to outlying the many problems that systematic reviews are prone across these domains we will work with the research community to ensure that outputs which inform patient care represent trusted evidence.

[Developing digital resources to teach secondary school students to think critically about health information and choices: human-centred design](/colloquium-2023/session/1473794/developing-digital-resources-to-teach-secondary-school-students-to-think-critically-about-health-information-and-choices-human-centred-design) Background: Many people find it difficult to make decisions about what to believe or do regarding their own and others' health. To avoid being misled by misinformation and to make good choices, people must be able to understand and apply some basic concepts. We developed the Informed Health Choices (IHC) secondary school resources to help students learn and use nine such concepts. Objectives: To develop digital IHC secondary school resources that increase students' ability to think critically about health information and choices, are compatible with the curricula in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, and are suitable for use in low-resource settings with limited digital infrastructure. Methods: We used a human-centered design approach, drawing extensively on the experiences and perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including teachers, students, and curriculum developers, over a 2-year period. In Phase 1, we conducted four preliminary studies, including context analyses and an overview of systematic review of teaching strategies for critical thinking. In Phase 2, we carried out three iterations of content development, collecting data through user testing, individual and group interviews, and school pilots; brainstorming solutions to problems; creating new versions of the resources; and triangulating analyses and solutions with curriculum developer offices. Results: Four main challenges persisted throughout development: the Student-computer mode of lesson plans (which we deactivated), time for scheduling and teaching lessons, correct comprehension of the concepts, and use of engaging examples that were not misleading. The final version of the resources includes lesson plans for ten 40-minute lessons (for use in classrooms equipped with either a blackboard/flipboard or a projector), teachers' guide, and extra resources, including materials for teacher training. Conclusions: We developed lessons to teach secondary school students to think critically about health information and choices: https://besmarthealth.org/. They are open-access, work in low-resource settings, and are adaptable/translatable. Relevance to public: Teaching young people to think critically about health actions has the potential to protect them from unnecessary suffering, harm, and resource waste. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Using a human-centered design approach, teachers, students, and curriculum developers were continuously involved in developing the intervention.

Therefore, before embarking on an IPDMA project, researchers and funders should ascertain if it is worth their investment and, if so, how best to proceed. Objectives: In this talk, aimed at a broad audience, I discuss the role of power calculations in IPDMA projects and how they reveal (1) whether the project is capable of identifying meaningful clinical effects and, if so, (2) which studies to prioritise for IPD collection. Methods: Firstly, IPDMA investigators should identify the set of studies likely to provide their IPD and extract key characteristics, such as number of participants and outcome events per group, and covariate distributions. Using this information and assumptions about true study effect sizes, Fisher's information can be applied to derive the approximate standard error of each study's effect estimate. Then, these are used to calculate the anticipated standard error of the IPDMA summary result, and subsequently the IPDMA power. Results: Real applications will be showcased (rather than statistical formula), focusing on IPDMA projects of randomised trials examining treatment-covariate interactions (treatment effect modifiers) at the individual level. Continuous, binary, and survival outcomes are covered. In one example, an IPDMA of 31 trials has 42% power for a treatment-sex interaction but 90% power for a treatment-age interaction. The calculations also reveal the contribution of each study towards power, to help inform which studies should be prioritised for IPD collection. I show that a study's power contribution depends on covariate distributions not just total participants or events. Conclusions: Careful assessments of power and sample size should be an integral part of planning and commissioning IPDMA projects, in advance of IPD collection. Alongside other information (e.g., risk of bias assessments), power calculations help direct investment toward high-quality IPDMA projects most likely to provide trusted evidence that informs clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.

Wiley, Chichester; 2021 [Conceptualizing the reporting of living systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473896/conceptualizing-the-reporting-of-living-systematic-reviews) Background: Although the production of living systematic reviews (LSRs) follows the core principles of systematic review methodology, their key distinguishing feature is the continual incorporation of relevant new evidence as it emerges. Objectives: As part of an effort to develop an extension of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement for LSRs, we discuss conceptual issues relevant to the reporting of LSRs and highlight a few challenges. Methods: The issues discussed are based on a scoping review of the literature and discussions amongst authors. We also build on previous work related to updating systematic reviews. Results: We first describe aspects of the LSR production process relevant to reporting. The production cycles differ by whether the literature surveillance identifies new evidence and whether newly identified evidence is judged to be consequential. This impacts the timing, content, and format of LSR versions. Second, we discuss four types of information that are specific to the reporting of LSRs: justification for adopting the living mode, LSR specific methods, changes between LSR versions, and LSR updating status. We also discuss the challenge of conveying changes between versions to the reader. Third, we describe two commonly used reporting formats of LSRs: full and partial reports. Although partial reports are easier to produce and publish, they lead to the scattering of information across different versions. Full reports ensure the completeness of reporting. We discuss the implications for the extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Conclusions: The extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs would need to account for LSR specific information to report. A dynamic publication platform that decreases the burden of production and publication of full reports would facilitate complete and timely reporting of LSRs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: There was no involvement. Improving the reporting of LSRs is essential for providing stakeholders with synthesized evidence in a timely manner.

When a systematic review or protocol manuscript is submitted for publication to Cochrane Public Health (CPH), Methods Editors conduct an initial triage review and complete methods review. Objectives: To identify common methodological errors requiring amendment in manuscripts and increase awareness of the available guidance to reduce their occurrence in future reviews. Methods: We conducted a retrospective audit of written feedback provided by CPH Methods Editors to authors of a protocol or review manuscript submitted for publication between July 2019 and June 2022. A data extraction form was used to document methodological issues identified in written feedback documents. Four Methods Editors piloted the data extraction form on two manuscripts, after which one Methods Editor extracted data for the remaining documents. Results: Forty-six feedback documents relating to twenty-seven reviews were identified. Examples of the errors identified related to the following: application of risk of bias domains, inconsistency between the methods described and used in the analysis, application of synthesis methods other than meta-analysis, inconsistent reporting of results in different sections of the review and incomplete reporting of results. Some of these errors had important implications for the conclusions of the review. In addition, it was common for manuscripts to lack details necessary to allow readers to understand and appraise the methods used. Some errors required authors to review and edit their manuscripts for consistency or to refer to existing guidance, e.g., on risk of bias assessment or synthesis other than meta-analysis. Data extraction for this project is in progress, and complete results will be reported in the presentation. Conclusions: These results present an opportunity for authors to plan for and appropriately implement methods guidance to avoid common errors in future reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The public were not involved in this study. Enhancing the methodological strength of published systematic reviews ensures reliable support for the public and other decision makers. [Teaching school children about evidence-based health care: Cochrane UK's outreach programme](/colloquium-2023/session/1473399/teaching-school-children-about-evidence-based-health-care-cochrane-uk's-outreach-programme) Background: Since 2016, Cochrane UK has been delivering interactive sessions to teach teenagers about Evidence-Based Health Care (EBHC), its importance, and its relevance in our everyday lives. Objectives: The sessions aim to introduce young people (particularly those interested in studying healthcare subjects at university) to Cochrane's work by exploring what randomized controlled trials are, how systematic reviews are produced, and why they are a particularly trustworthy source of evidence. We also aim to help school children critically question the trustworthiness of claims they read or hear about health and consider how the media can misrepresent health information. We also aim to increase their understanding of the importance of using reliable, evidence-based sources of information. Methods: We have developed the sessions with input from the whole Cochrane UK team, including experienced healthcare professionals. Typically, two members of the Cochrane UK team run the sessions, at least one of whom has experience working as a healthcare professional. Results: As of early 2023, we have reached over 2,500 school children, the majority of whom have been 16-18 years old with an interest in studying healthcare-related subjects at university. We began by running face-to-face sessions in schools and then shifted to delivering online sessions during the pandemic. To date, we continue to predominantly deliver online sessions. We have also run sessions in partnership with Widening Access teams at various UK-based medical schools. Conclusions: Over time, we have learned that hosting online sessions has been the most effective way to reach as broad an audience as possible. We typically advertise the talks through Cochrane UK newsletters and social media, as well as via our existing connections with schools and universities. This enables us to make the best use of resources and to reach children throughout the UK. We plan to continue this outreach work in this way. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We use feedback from school children and teachers to refine these sessions, making the content more relevant and engaging over time. In this way, members of the public are directly involved in this project. [Data sharing: experiences accessing individual participant data for a collaborative meta-analysis on umbilical cord management strategies at preterm birth.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473640/data-sharing-experiences-accessing-individual-participant-data-for-a-collaborative-meta-analysis-on-umbilical-cord-management-strategies-at-preterm-birth.) Background: Meta-analysis (MA) using individual participant data (IPD) is regarded as the gold standard, allowing more complex analyses (e.g., subgroup analysis), verification of published findings, inclusion of unpublished data, and some outcome harmonisation. Although researchers and funding agencies show strong in-principle support for data sharing required to perform such projects, rates of actual data sharing are frequently low. Objectives: To document the experiences of obtaining IPD for a large individual participant data on Cord Management at Preterm birth (iCOMP), a large collaborative IPD and network MA in neonatology. Methods: Lead and senior investigators for eligible trials were approached and asked to share IPD. We recorded the number (%) of trials in which the trialist responded favourably/declined or did not respond, the number of trials that actually shared their IPD, methods used, and barriers in sharing IPD. Results: Of 118 eligible studies identified for inclusion in iCOMP, 82 (69.5%) agreed in-principle to share IPD. Three (2.5%) trials were uncontactable, and 36 trials (30.5%) did not respond even after multiple contact attempts. Among those who responded, 14 trialists (17%) declined or were unable to share data, frequently citing data access issues because of the trial's age. Twenty-one trials (17.8%) did not share data despite initial agreement. We received data from 61 (51.7%) trials. A median of 23 (IQR 25) emails were sent from data request to receipt. The longest data acquisition period for a study was 831 days. Sixty datasets were received directly from the trialist and one dataset in the publication appendix. Data were shared in different formats with Microsoft Excel the most common. Additional barriers included lengthy processes for data sharing agreements and ethics requirements. Conclusions: Data sharing is a resource-intensive and repetitive process which is often plagued by challenges. Streamlined processes and alternative arrangements, such as depositing into a data commons or data trust needs to be developed to better facilitate future collaborative IPD-MA. Sharing experiences in running and collecting data for IPD MA enables mitigating similar challenges in future projects. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: A consumer representative was part of our advisory group and authorship team. [Should aggregate data be included where individual participant data are unavailable? Lessons from a large individual participant data meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473614/should-aggregate-data-be-included-where-individual-participant-data-are-unavailable-lessons-from-a-large-individual-participant-data-meta-analysis) Background: Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses (MAs) allow more comprehensive analyses (e.g., individual-level subgroup analyses) and enable in-depth risk of bias and trustworthiness checks. Yet often not all eligible studies have IPD available, leading to concerns about data availability bias. Methods have been proposed to combine IPD with aggregate data (AD) from publications, albeit some have raised concerns about lower quality of AD. Limited guidance exists on when to combine IPD with AD. Objectives: To develop a checklist on whether to combine IPD and AD and apply this to a large IPD-MA in neonatology. Methods: We conducted a literature review and consulted methods experts to collate proposed guidance. Checks were reviewed and consolidated by an advisory group of content and methods experts and documented in a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The checks were applied to the large IPD-MA of 104 eligible studies, in which 61 provided IPD and 43 only AD. Results: The developed checklist encourages researchers to use a range of prespecified criteria for comparing IPD and AD studies, including checking differences in key baseline and study characteristics, effect sizes, risk of bias, integrity concerns, and analysis methods (Table). In the large IPD-MA, we found major differences between IPD and AD in baseline characteristics, risk of bias, and integrity assessments (Table). We also found much larger effect sizes for some outcomes in the AD studies, indicating potential systematic differences between IPD and AD trials. Thus, the advisory group decided to only include IPD studies for the primary analysis, but present combined sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In our case study, AD studies appeared to have higher risk of bias, be less trustworthy, and have much larger effect sizes. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing differences between IPD and AD, to not dilute the high-quality data derived in an IPD-MA with potentially lower quality AD. The developed checklist can be easily adjusted to inform future IPD-MAs. Relevance to patients: IPD-MAs frequently inform how patients are treated. For instance, our case study will form the evidence base for upcoming international guidelines. A consumer representative was part of our advisory group and authorship team. [Specifying the 'PICO' for each synthesis: current practice and development of the InSynQ (Intervention Synthesis Questions) checklist and guide](/colloquium-2023/session/1473624/specifying-the-'pico'-for-each-synthesis-current-practice-and-development-of-the-insynq-intervention-synthesis-questions-checklist-and-guide) Background: Methods guidance prompts systematic review authors to define their questions and specify criteria for including studies in the review. Less emphasis has been given to specifying criteria for each synthesis (the 'PICO [population, intervention, comparator and outcome] for each synthesis'), although choices about the structure of the synthesis have important implications for review findings, particularly in reviews addressing multiple research questions. Methods: We examined the extent to which PICO criteria were specified for syntheses (comparisons) in 100 randomly sampled systematic reviews published in 2018 from the Health Evidence and Health Systems Evidence databases. We used evidence from this study to draft the InSynQ (Intervention Synthesis Questions) checklist and guide for development and reporting of synthesis questions in systematic reviews of interventions. We conducted two online webinars and a public evaluation survey to invite feedback and refine the final version. Results: Authors commonly group studies for synthesis based on population, interventions, outcomes and methodological characteristics, but the use of these groups is often incompletely reported. For example, of 41 systematic reviews that identified or used intervention groups as the basis for comparisons, 28 (68%) mentioned the groups in the background or methods; 12 (29%) defined the groups in enough detail to replicate allocation of studies to groups; 6 (15%) provided a rationale; and 24 (59%) stated that the groups would be used to define comparisons. Having identified aspects of reporting that are often incomplete, we developed the draft InSynQ checklist and guide (http://InSynQ.info). Revisions made in response to feedback led to the final 11-item checklist with refined wording and an additional item on consumer and stakeholder involvement. Conclusions: Complete reporting of synthesis questions and the PICO for each synthesis helps ensure that the questions addressed in a review are clear and supports transparent decisions about the eligibility of studies for each synthesis. The InSynQ checklist and guide is designed to help authors develop and report synthesis questions completely. Further feedback is invited to inform future versions. Patient, public and/or consumer involvement: Evaluation of the draft checklist was open to the public. These findings promote clear communication of research questions of importance to consumers and transparent reporting of reviews. [Piloting the Informed Health Choices resources in Barcelona primary schools: A mixed methods study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473569/piloting-the-informed-health-choices-resources-in-barcelona-primary-schools-a-mixed-methods-study) Background: The main objective of the Informed Health Choices (IHC) project is to teach people to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices. For this purpose, the IHC learning resources were developed for primary school children. Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore students' and teachers' experiences when using the IHC resources in primary schools in Barcelona (Spain). Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study for piloting the IHC resources in a convenience sample of primary schools in Barcelona. The intervention included a workshop with teachers and nine lessons with the students. We collected data using multiple approaches, including ad hoc questionnaires, non-participatory observations, and semi-structured interviews. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally, we formulated recommendations for using the IHC resources in this setting. Results: Two schools, with a total of 143 students in 4th and 5th grade (9 to 11-year-olds) and six teachers, participated in the study. One school followed the suggested IHC teaching plan and completed all the lessons; the other school modified the plan substantially and did not complete all the lessons. Overall, students and teachers from both schools understood, were interested in, and were able to apply the content of the lessons. During the lessons, students used the IHC resources (mainly the textbook), and teachers used them in a variable way. Teachers adapted the IHC resources to increase student participation and used Information and Communications Technologies to support their teaching. We observed more facilitators than barriers to teach the lessons. The teachers suggested some ideas to improve the lessons based on the activities they developed and implemented. We proposed seven recommendations for using the IHC resources in this setting. Conclusions: It is feasible to use the IHC resources in Barcelona primary schools; however, these resources should be adapted to promote classroom participation. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The IHC resources can empower children around the world to make well-informed health choices as adults. [Interactive website for communicating the results from a living systematic review and network meta-analysis for COVID-19](/colloquium-2023/session/1473720/interactive-website-for-communicating-the-results-from-a-living-systematic-review-and-network-meta-analysis-for-covid-19) Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, living systematic reviews with network meta-analyses (NMAs) summarized the growing evidence base to assist with decision-making. However, such evidence syntheses can produce an overwhelmingly large amount of information necessitating additional strategies for communication of findings. Objective: To describe how an interactive website was developed and used to present results from a living systematic review and NMA addressing COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment. Methods: A working group of health research methodologists, clinicians, and knowledge users brainstormed ideas for the website including what information to include and what functions to make available. We collaborated with a web developer who utilized results from the working group discussion to draft the website, incorporating subsequent feedback from the working group until we approved the final version. Results: The website (www.covid19lnma.com) provides a summary of the results of each living systematic review including the number of patients, studies, interventions, and outcomes included alongside a table categorizing interventions from the most to the least effective/harmful for all outcomes. Additionally, users can select an intervention and comparator to generate a summary of findings (SoF) table that includes plain language summaries per outcome. This interactive feature allowing users to generate SoF tables for pairwise comparisons of interest to them is unique to this format of publication. Launched in August 2021, the website has had a steady flow of traffic with users around the world. Updates are made as new results become available with the date of analysis provided to end users. Conclusions: Interactive websites can summarize the results of NMAs while providing users with the ability to tailor these results for their needs while overcoming challenges with publication delays to ensure timely access to information. By incorporating plain language summaries, such a website can also facilitate knowledge translation to the general public. Studies are required to understand whether these websites increase access to and improve understanding of NMA results and how to best improve them. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient partners were not involved in the development of the website. [Strategies for maximizing IPD retrieval in IPDMA: A mixed method study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473421/strategies-for-maximizing-ipd-retrieval-in-ipdma-a-mixed-method-study) Background: Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is regarded as the ideal approach for providing evidence on intervention effect estimation because it can derive standardized outcome definitions and use a consistent analysis method. Our previous study has summarized the methodological and reporting quality of published IPDMA (BMJ 2021;372:n736). However, the current practices and perceived best strategies in IPD retrieval are still unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore the perceived and practical strategies in IPD retrieval. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Email addresses of IPDMA authors were identified through PubMed. An e-questionnaire with 32 questions, related to the authors' demographic, their views and practices on different strategies in conducting IPDMA, was created based on literature. Qualitative email interviews were then conducted to gather in-depth information about their barriers and perceived strategies to maximize the IPD retrieval. Descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and linear regression models were used to analyze the data collected from the e-questionnaire while content analysis was undertaken for the qualitative interview. Ethics approval was granted by the university institutional review board. Results: Of 151 respondents, most were male (62%), aged 35 years (80.1%), and academic staff (69.5%) and had >5 years of experience (80.1%). The mean successful rate of retrieving the IPD data was 67.2%. A total of 64.2% included their primary studies in the IPDMA and 44.4% provided authorship for primary study authors as incentive. Email was the most common method to contact study authors (90.1%) and share data (67.5%); it was also ranked the most effective way of requesting IPD. Linear regression models revealed that those (i) aged 65 years, (ii) who were academic staff as the first contact person, and (iii) who had a primary study included in the IPDMA had significantly higher success rates. Two main categories were identified from the email interview qualitative responses: (i) 'Contributors of successful IPD retrieval' and (ii) 'Reasons for failed IPD retrievals'. (See Tables) Conclusions: It was revealed that senior academics working in the field with primary data themselves had a higher chance to retrieve the IPD. Providing authorship of the IPDMA publication to the primary study author may also help to improve the success rate. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Challenges and innovations in evidence synthesis and evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473607/challenges-and-innovations-in-evidence-synthesis-and-evaluation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic instigated unprecedented challenges for clinical and policy decisions. In response to these challenges, the pandemic also resulted in much-awaited innovations. Objective: To perform a scoping review describing challenges and innovations in evidence synthesis and evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched medical research databases, up to July 2022, for articles describing challenges or innovations in evidence synthesis and evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a reflexive thematic analysis to generate themes that summarize and describe the data. Results: We identified 91 references, reporting on 21 and 20 unique challenges and innovations, respectively. Salient challenges included the volume and rapidity of published COVID-19 research (often of poor quality), which precluded efficient identification of practice-changing research. To help evidence users navigate the volume of research, several initiatives produced living databases and catalogues of COVID-19 studies. During the pandemic, the scientific community very enthusiastically embraced preprint servers to allow for the rapid dissemination of potentially lifesaving research. The medical community, however, expressed concerns that preprints may lead to the dissemination of research that contains errors or fraudulent or fabricated data. Most of the evidence guiding the treatment of patients with COVID-19 came from platform trials\u2014adaptive trials designed with the option to add and remove arms based on accumulative evidence. Although there are many trials addressing pharmacologic interventions, there were few trials addressing nonpharmacologic interventions to curb transmission, despite their widespread global implementation. The pandemic also resulted in a breakthrough for living systematic reviews and guidelines, which, unlike traditional reviews and guidelines that are only up to date at a single point in time, are updated as new evidence emerges. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to evidence synthesis and evaluation but also spurred critical innovations. As the pandemic shifts from an acute threat to a long-term public health issue, now is a critical time to evaluate and learn from our response to inform future preparedness efforts. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: While we did not include consumers as part of this review, several publications included in our review describe challenges and innovations related to consumer involvement. [The People's Review: a protocol for a systematic review powered by the public.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473634/the-people's-review-a-protocol-for-a-systematic-review-powered-by-the-public.) Background: Awareness and understanding of systematic reviews and the role that they play in healthcare is quite low in the general population. Existing work by Cochrane aims to better support people to make sense of and co-produce health evidence. The People's Review will actively involve the public in the planning, production and dissemination of a systematic review, which will help them understand how evidence guides healthcare provided by a health service and everyday health decision-making. Our work builds on the success of The People's Trial, in which members of the public designed, planned and took part in an online randomized trial (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05984-1) with the aim of improving the understanding of clinical trials. Objectives: The People's Review aims to increase the public's understanding of what systematic reviews are, how they are developed and why they matter. A secondary aim is for reviewers to learn more about and develop ways to involve people in systematic reviews. Methods: The People's Review includes a systematic review with public involvement throughout, from designing the research question through to knowledge translation. It will be conducted online in a multi-phase approach through a custom-built, open-access website. We will design, produce and share educational material (e.g., animated videos) to support the public's understanding at each phase of the review. Public contributors will make key decisions about the review and participate in review tasks, utilising a 'learning by doing' approach. The ACTIVE framework for stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews will inform this review. Results: The People's Review is in the early stages of development. At the colloquium, we will present a protocol detailing how we plan to involve the public throughout the review. Conclusions: The People's Review, if successful, will increase the public's capacity for critically appraising and using systematic reviews (including Cochrane reviews) to inform everyday health decisions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The People's Review Steering Group includes four public partners who are supporting the development of this project. The wider public will then be invited to contribute to decisions and tasks related to the review when the website is launched through a widespread social and traditional media campaign. [Consolidating tools for assessment of risk of bias for individual participant data meta-analysis: a case study.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473617/consolidating-tools-for-assessment-of-risk-of-bias-for-individual-participant-data-meta-analysis-a-case-study.) Background: In 2019, Cochrane released a revised Risk of Bias (RoB2) tool to address limitations of the previous tool. Since then, difficulties with implementation, adherence, and time taken to complete assessments have been reported. For large Individual Participant Data (IPD) Meta Analyses (MAs), applying RoB tools leads to additional challenges and opportunities. Objectives: To develop a modified RoB tool combining elements of the original Risk of Bias (RoB1) with RoB2, incorporating checks assessing RoB using IPD, and implementing this in a meta-analysis (MA), including IPD from 59 trials and aggregate data (AD) from 33 trials. Methods: We collated data from all included trials, and reviewed data availability for all outcomes. Content and methods experts were consulted to develop a consensus on domains and response options. Assessments were completed by two trained team members, and disagreements resolved in consensus meetings including a third team member. Remaining items were resolved by an advisory group, including members with extensive clinical, biostatistical, systematic reviews, and consumer experience. Results: Instead of assessing RoB for each outcome, as done in RoB2, or for each study, as done in RoB1, the developed checklist (Figure) pre-specified RoB to be assessed per outcome category. These included primary outcome mortality, delivery room outcomes, beyond delivery room outcomes, and long-term outcomes. We judged RoB to be nearly identical for each category as most commonly either all or no follow-up outcomes were blinded. Additional checks utilising IPD were completed, assessing random allocation and incomplete outcome data. Overall RoB for each study, per outcome category, was judged as high, some concerns or low, matching RoB2. The modified RoB was implemented for all 92 trials. Availability of IPD and direct contact with investigators enabled higher rates of certainty for each domain, and strong consensus across raters compared to AD trials. Conclusions: RoB1 and RoB2 have shortcomings for application in large IPD-MAs. A modified RoB tool for application in a large IPD meta-analysis was successfully developed and implemented within our study. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: It is essential to assess RoB of trials included in IPD-MAs, as these frequently inform patient care guidelines. [A living network meta-analysis of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: Novelty at the frontier of living evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1473747/a-living-network-meta-analysis-of-treatments-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-novelty-at-the-frontier-of-living-evidence) Background: Choosing between the many effective disease-modifying therapies (DMARDs) for rheumatoid arthritis requires timely, high-quality systematic review of the best available evidence. 'Living' systematic reviews fast-track evidence synthesis without compromising rigorous systematic review methods. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is an attractive option for comparing rheumatoid arthritis treatments, but the development of 'living' NMAs presents unique methodological challenges. Objectives: Our aim is to establish a sustainable, living NMA off DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis and to facilitate the evolution of living NMA methods. Methods: We are conducting three linked Cochrane living systematic reviews and living NMAs of DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis using methods recommended by the Cochrane Living systematic Review Network, supplemented by new methods developed for this review. The three reviews will compare all current DMARD therapies for three separate populations of rheumatoid arthritis patients, grouped by prior therapy received (DMARD-na\u00efve, DMARD-inadequate response, biologic DMARD- inadequate response). Results: Several novel and emerging methods for the production of a living NMA have been incorporated and are described in five categories (\"The 5 A's\"). 1. Accessibility: All raw data extracted will be formatted and hosted with the model code on the Open Science Framework in order to promote research efficiency and transparency. 2. Automation: Novel computer code has been developed to automatically read and format extracted data and generate GRADE tables. 3. Alliances: International collaborations aim to provide 'global evidence for local recommendations'. 4. Applicability: These living NMAs will provide a direct living evidence base for living rheumatoid arthritis guidelines. 5. Atomisation: Identification, categorisation and extraction of data from RCTs is performed as 'microtasks' by a trained 'crowd' of volunteers. Conclusions: Near real-time incorporation of evidence into systematic reviews is now possible, with incorporation into living guidelines as the next step. Novel methodologies will streamline the NMA process and inform living NMA methods. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Trained 'crowd' of volunteers contributed to step 5. [Introduction to the WISEST (Which Systematic Evidence Synthesis is best) Project: Developing an automated clinical decision-support algorithm to choose amongst systematic review(s) on the same topic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473437/introduction-to-the-wisest-which-systematic-evidence-synthesis-is-best-project-developing-an-automated-clinical-decision-support-algorithm-to-choose-amongst-systematic-reviews-on-the-same-topic) Background: Knowledge users (KUs) need the highest-quality studies to make decisions about which interventions and policies should be used. The most reliable way to answer questions is with a systematic review (SR). AMSTAR and ROBIS tools are used to assess quality/bias in SRs. However, no automated tool currently exists to assess the quality/biases in SRs (Figure 1). Objectives: (1) Develop a set of features to extract from SRs related to quality/bias; (2) develop a labelled dataset of 10,000 SRs; and (3) test, train and validate models and compare their accuracy. Methods: A structure was proposed by the international steering group, and features were collected using a methods review and a survey. We used the results of a previous study comparing the tools which mapped an item's concept across the three tools. A core team reviewed them and determined their feasibility in being automatically identifiable and predictable by our model (rather than through a manual process). A flowchart of activities is proposed (Figure 2). Five organisations with databases of preappraised SRs will supply the SRs. Duplicates will be removed and topics will be mapped. If topic fields, settings or conditions are missing, we will fill these gaps with a search for SRs. We will use ML Random Forests and DL Neural Network classification models such as Facebook's StarSpace and Fasttext. We will use a 'supervised' learning model which learns by making predictions given examples of data. Results: The proposed structure is found in Figure 1. The 21 items mapped from AMSTAR 1 and 2 and ROBIS will be used as the quality features. Other features chosen include PROGRESS-Plus items related to sex, gender and equity, 20 methods features (e.g., number of databases searched, PICO, and meta-analysis model used) and 10 results features (e.g., effect estimates and adverse events). SRs were collected and cleaned and the other features were extracted in duplicate. Testing will begin in March 2024. Conclusions: An artificial intelligence tool that critically appraises SRs would dramatically reduce the financial and human resources currently needed to appraise SRs and update SR databases (e.g., McMasterPlus, HealthEvidence and SysVac). Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Level of scientific evidence needed to make an informed health decision among researchers, healthcare workers and consumers: a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473532/level-of-scientific-evidence-needed-to-make-an-informed-health-decision-among-researchers-healthcare-workers-and-consumers-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: The hierarchy of evidence is considered as widely known to evidence-based medicine experts. However, it remains unknown how nonexperts understand it and how they use it in decision-making. Objectives: To assess what level of evidence is needed for different stakeholders in the healthcare system to make treatment effectiveness decisions. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to February 2022 using an online survey. The participants were researchers, healthcare workers and consumers from Croatia. The survey had six scenarios about the same medical treatment presented within different study designs and in random order. Participants were asked to assess whether the descriptions presented a sufficient level of evidence to conclude that the treatment was effective. Results: A total of 584 participants were eligible for inclusion (97 researchers, 201 healthcare workers and 286 consumers). Participants were mainly women (N=434 (74%), median age 43.5, interquartile range 33-52). For researchers, as the number of participants and degree of variable control in the study design increased, the perceived level of sufficient evidence also increased significantly. Among consumers, no significant differences were observed in scores between cross-sectional study, cohort study, randomised controlled trial and systematic review. Healthcare workers' assessments were significantly lower for case studies and case series compared to other study designs (Figure 1). Conclusions: Consumers and healthcare workers did not increase their certainty about the effectiveness of the therapy when higher-level study designs were presented compared to lower-level study designs. There is a need to implement educational courses on basic research methodology in lower levels of education and as part of the Continuing Medical Education for all stakeholders in the healthcare system. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Healthcare consumers were involved in the study as participants. Educating patients and other stakeholders in the healthcare system would lead to more informed decision-making. [Data sharing policies across the health research lifecycle: a cross-sectional analysis of global funders, ethics committees, trial registries, journals and data repositories](/colloquium-2023/session/1473403/data-sharing-policies-across-the-health-research-lifecycle-a-cross-sectional-analysis-of-global-funders-ethics-committees-trial-registries-journals-and-data-repositories) Background: Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses rely on the availability of raw IPD. Yet, calls for open data and data sharing seem to often go unheard and many IPD meta-analyses struggle to attain sufficient IPD. The practice and culture of data sharing might be improved if data sharing policies were prominent and actionable at all stages of the research process. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of data sharing policies across the health research lifecycle and identify pathways to improve rates of data sharing. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, describing the epidemiology of data sharing policies of major stakeholders across the health research lifecycle. We included the following major stakeholders in medical research: the largest public, philanthropic, and private funders, all national ethics committees, all primary clinical trial registries, the 5 highest-impact journals for each of the 59 fields of medicine, and all research data repositories. We assessed each stakeholder for the presence of a data sharing policy, magnitude of support for data sharing (data sharing mentioned, recommended, or required), policy characteristics, and COVID-19 specific policies. Results: We included 935 stakeholders: 110 funders (55 public or philanthropic, and 55 private), 124 ethics committees, 18 trial registries, 273 journals, and 410 data repositories. Data sharing was required by 41% (45/110) of funders, no ethics committees or trial registries, 19% (52/273) of journals, and 6% (24/410) of data repositories (Figure 1). Private pharmaceutical and biotechnology funders were 6.3 times more likely than public funders to require data sharing. Among those requiring data sharing, limited guidance was provided on what, when, who with, how, and why to share data. No stakeholders required data sharing specifically for COVID-19 studies. Conclusions: Increased data sharing rates are crucial to enable IPD meta-analysis. Calls for data sharing have accelerated, but major stakeholders across the health research lifecycle provided limited requirements or guidance to ensure the scientific and ethical imperatives for data sharing are met. We see particular opportunities to increase data sharing rates for public funders and ethics committees. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: IPD meta-analyses frequently inform guidelines that directly inform how patients are treated. [Integration of Machine Learning in a living systematic review of baseline risks of Venous Thromboembolism complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19](/colloquium-2023/session/1473830/integration-of-machine-learning-in-a-living-systematic-review-of-baseline-risks-of-venous-thromboembolism-complications-in-hospitalized-patients-with-covid-19) Background: Living systematic reviews (LSRs) of prognostic studies rely on screening many observational studies that are not clearly labeled. Objectives: To assess the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm for screening in an LSR for venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related outcomes and baseline risks in patients with COVID-19. Methods: As part of a guideline development project for the American Society of Hematology (ASH) on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19, the team conducted an LSR to establish and maintain relevance of the baseline risk for VTE-related outcomes. The search was conducted in September 2020 (baseline search) and updated monthly until July 2021. At baseline, the search identified 69,560 citations. The team trained an ML classifier algorithm using the manual screening of the baseline search to partially automate the screening process for the next search iterations. The algorithm ranked captured citations based on likelihood for inclusion, with those appearing on top as most likely to be included. The algorithm was integrated in a new software, \"Laser AI,\" which will allow the team to screen prioritized citations in future updates. In this study, we screened manually, in duplicate and independently, a sample of 5% (n=3,478) of captured citations at two iterations of the living search and that were not allocated the highest likelihood for inclusion. In parallel, we retrospectively applied a model trained on the most recently screened documents to the initial set of search results to explore how the data distribution changed over time. Results: We manually screened in duplicate and independently 3,478 citations, of which 377 were included at title/abstract level and full text screening is ongoing. We will compare these results with the algorithm's classification to measure the algorithm's performance (precision, recall, accuracy, and specificity). We will also assess whether there were identified studies eligible for inclusion that were not selected for screening and if they affected the pooled baseline risk for VTE. Results will be ready by March 31, 2023. Conclusions: The efficiency and relevance of LSRs for prognostic studies can be enhanced when combining manual with ML-directed screening. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: N/A. [The numerous typologies and taxonomies of evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473621/the-numerous-typologies-and-taxonomies-of-evidence-synthesis) Background: Evidence synthesis is a constantly evolving field. There is now a plethora of evidence synthesis approaches used across many different disciplines. Historically, there have been attempts to organize the types and methods of evidence synthesis in the form of classification systems, typologies, or taxonomies. This scoping review sought to identify all the available classification systems, typologies, or taxonomies; identify how they were developed; their characteristics; and the types of evidence syntheses included within them. Objectives: The objective of this scoping review is to identify evidence synthesis types and previously proposed classification systems, typologies, or taxonomies that have guided evidence synthesis. Methods: This review has been developed in consultation with evidence synthesis taxonomy initiative advisory group, which includes over 100 evidence synthesisers. Utilising JBI guidance for scoping reviews, MEDLINE (Ovid); (Elsevier); JSTOR; and grey literature search has identified 292 evidence sources for inclusion, and they are currently undergoing extraction. This scoping review considered documents such as discussion papers, commentaries, books, editorials, manuals, handbooks, and formal guidance from major organizations. Results: This review identified many different types of classification systems identified for categorizing evidence synthesis approaches. These systems varied in how they were formatted, their characteristics, the evidence synthesis approaches included, and how they have organized evidence synthesis types. Lastly, this scoping review identified differing terminology relating to evidence synthesis types being utilized across fields and how this could be perpetuating confusion and poor conduct of evidence synthesis. Conclusions: The development of typologies, taxonomies, and classification systems of evidence synthesis have not as yet been conducted through a systematic process, nor with extensive stakeholder engagement from members of the academic community. They have also been criticized for being incomplete and lacking consistency in the terminology. Although many of the pre-existing categorisation systems serve as a useful reference point for researchers, a comprehensive, continuously updated, and community-approved evidence synthesis taxonomy is needed. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Yes, through the ESTI advisory board (100+ members). [\"Info without side effects\" - Development and application of a checklist for lay users for evaluating online health information](/colloquium-2023/session/1473643/\"info-without-side-effects\"---development-and-application-of-a-checklist-for-lay-users-for-evaluating-online-health-information) Objectives: The internet is an important resource for health information (HI). However, many users have difficulties in deciding whether the information they found online is trustworthy and objective. We aimed to develop and validate a checklist for helping laypersons with evaluating the trustworthiness of online HI. Methods: We searched for existing checklists and conceptual research for HI assessment and extracted all items/indicators. After we categorized, deduplicated, and translated items into German, six HI experts identified the most pertinent items in a modified Delphi process (\"item-shortlist\"). The item-shortlist was tested by laypersons for comprehensibility and applicability (cognitive tests, n=19) and usability (assessment of 15 selected HI, n=20). The research team applied the item-shortlist to 100 HI, and two researchers independently assessed the objective certainty of evidence for each HI. These assessments were used to determine the predictive validity of the items. Results: We extracted a total of 1,740 items from 73 documents. After all reduction and modification steps, we tested a shortlist of 23 items. The claimed strength of evidence of the HI relative to the objective certainty of evidence for the specific health topic was used as outcome measure to test the predictive validity regarding the correctness of the HI of each item as well as a set of items. To create the final checklist, we considered the laypersons' qualitative results, the effect estimates of each item, the inter-reliability measures among laypersons, among experts, and between laypersons and experts. The final checklist comprises the following 6 items: absence of advertisement, balanced presentation of information, citation of sources, limited use of technical terms, presence of a publication date, and a medical disclaimer. It will be published on the project webpage https://www.infos-ohne-nebenwirkung.at/. Conclusions: The creation of a checklist for the assessment of online HI that can be understood and used by laypersons is a great challenge. The final checklist has to be tested with further HI test sets to strengthen its validity. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We involved potential users of the checklist in two stages of the development process of the checklist to ensure the comprehensibility and applicability of the checklist. |11:05 AM - 11:15 AM| Background: There are an increasing number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in paediatric pain, but the quality of these studies is unknown. It is imperative that RCTs in paediatric pain are of high quality. Objectives: To determine the risk of bias and reporting quality of RCTs in paediatric pain. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of RCTs in paediatric pain which were published in full text in 2021. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Scopus. Risk of bias was assessed with the RoB 2 tool and reporting quality was assessed with the CONSORT 2010 statement. Risk of bias was assessed as either high, some concerns or low, and reporting quality was assessed as adequate if 75% of items in the reporting guideline were reported. All studies were screened and assessed in duplicate by two independent investigators. Results: We identified 212 RCTs in paediatric pain published in full text in 2021. Almost three quarters of RCTs (n=154, 73%) were at high risk of bias, and almost all other RCTs (n=57, 27%) had some concerns (see Figure 1). Only one RCT (0.4%) was at low risk of bias. Few RCTs (n=27,13%) were adequately reported and none reported 50% of items in the abstract. There were no author characteristics associated with risk of bias. RCTs that were blinded were more likely to be at a lower risk of bias and adequately a conflict of interest were prospectively registered or reported the use of reporting guidelines were more likely to be adequately some PedIMMPACT outcomes, specifically symptoms and adverse events and the global judgement of satisfaction with treatment, were associated with reduced risk of bias and improved reporting paediatric pain are at the high risk of bias and have poor reporting quality. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Clinical trial register searches for systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials involving interventions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473542/clinical-trial-register-searches-for-systematic-reviews-of-randomized-clinical-trials-involving-interventions) Background: Cochrane guidelines recommend broad electronic bibliographic database (EBD) searches and additional clinical trial register (CTR) searches to inform systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving interventions. This two-step approach limits the number of unidentified RCTs to prevent the synthesis of biased results. Clinical trial registration is performed prospectively for RCTs; thus, the publication status does not interfere with the availability of the CT registration within the register. Performing broad CTR searches by themselves may be a more efficient approach to identify RCTs for SRs of RCTs involving interventions. Objectives: To evaluate how broad CTR searches compare to broad EBD searches in identifying RCTs for SRs of RCTs involving interventions. Methods: We performed identical searches in the CTRs of ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, as well as the EBDs CENTRAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE, and compared whether we could identify the same RCTs. Our search was based on a subset of RCTs from an SR that studied the underrepresentation of people with chronic kidney disease from cardiovascular trials. Results: We identified 128 eligible RCTs, of which 68 (49% [95% CI 42 - 58]) were identified by both search approaches. The EBD search missed 54 (43% [95% CI 34 - 51]) of the eligible RCTs. Of these, 37 were still ongoing and 13 were missed although available in the searched EBDs. Three RCTs missed by the EBD search had not been published while having a study completion date before 2020. One RCT had been published in a journal that was not indexed in the EBDs searched in our study. The CTR search missed 11 (8% [95% CI 5 - 15]) of the eligible RCTs. Of these, seven were not identified by the CTR search although available in the included CTRs. We were unable to locate a CT registration for four of the RCTs missed by the CTR search. Conclusions: Broad CTR searches are suitable to inform SRs of RCTs involving interventions. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement. Our study has implications for the methodology of SRs of RCTs involving interventions. [From Evidence to Action: Implementing Cochrane Systematic Reviews Into Clinical Practice](/colloquium-2023/session/1473871/from-evidence-to-action-implementing-cochrane-systematic-reviews-into-clinical-practice) Background: One of the tenets of Cochrane's knowledge translation strategy is to encourage policy makers and healthcare managers to integrate Cochrane evidence into clinical practice. Cochrane reviews are among the most valuable, high-quality sources of evidence for improving quality and care delivery, but strategies used by healthcare organizations to implement the findings of these reviews are less well-understood. Objectives: To describe the knowledge translation and implementation strategies used by Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a healthcare delivery system serving more than 4.6 million patients, and the Evidence Scanning for Clinical, Operational and Practice Efficiencies (E-SCOPE) program, to integrate Cochrane systematic reviews into clinical practice. Methods: E-SCOPE staff identify published Cochrane reviews through searches of the Cochrane library and other scientific databases. A priority is placed on identifying high-quality Cochrane reviews of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that yield improved health outcomes, quality, and/or efficiency of care delivery. E-SCOPE staff then work closely with clinical and operational stakeholders to interpret and translate Cochrane evidence into a feasible implementation plan, leveraging existing organizational processes and resources. E-SCOPE project managers oversee implementation efforts, facilitate practice owner identification, and as needed, create measurement plans utilizing data drawn from electronic health systems and other data sources. Results: The E-SCOPE program has implemented 18 practices based on results from Cochrane systematic reviews to improve the overall quality of care provided to patients. The time from review publication to implementation averages 16 months (ranging from 4 to 36 months). Conclusions: E-SCOPE enhances Cochrane knowledge translation processes by making optimal use of Cochrane reviews, translating the evidence and findings to clinical stakeholders, and leveraging existing organizational channels for practice implementation. Prioritizing the identification of practices with an established, high-quality, and high-confidence evidence base is generalizable and can efficiently and effectively promote adoption of Cochrane reviews within any healthcare system. Approaches to knowledge translation prioritizing Cochrane systematic reviews have the capacity to significantly improve the quality and delivery of patient care. Examples of Cochrane review-based E-SCOPE initiatives will be discussed. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient values and preferences are key determining factors in every implementation plan undertaken by E-SCOPE. [Presenting the results of a systematic review to non-experts: the Dissemination Checklist](/colloquium-2023/session/1473633/presenting-the-results-of-a-systematic-review-to-non-experts-the-dissemination-checklist) Background: The results of Cochrane Reviews are packaged and presented in many different ways, including through tweets, podcasts, plain language summaries, and journal reports. Regardless of product type, media, or audience, all dissemination products should ideally provide a reasonable representation of the evidence, as well as a good user experience. Objectives: Cochrane's Dissemination Checklist aims to improve the quality and consistency of dissemination products and to improve communication with non-experts (i.e., people not familiar with systematic review methodology). Methods: Development of the checklist was led by Cochrane Norway with support from an advisory board. We conducted a literature search and framework analysis and then went through several cycles of feedback and revision. Results/ Conclusions: Cochrane's dissemination checklist is a tool for anyone preparing a dissemination product to share the results of a Cochrane intervention review. The checklist is aimed at people creating dissemination products that present review findings. If you are building awareness about a review without presenting the findings, you might find some helpful tips here as well. You can use this guidance when you plan the dissemination of a Cochrane review, create a dissemination product, or create or improve a dissemination product template. The checklist covers a range of issues, including considering and involving your target audience in your dissemination product, ensuring a reasonable representation of the evidence, using plain language, structure and readability, connecting with people, and ensuring transparency and building trust. There are three layers to the checklist and guidance: 1. A one-page overview of the checklist. 2. The checklist with a brief description of what each checklist item means and a set of minimum expectations. 3. Full guidance, with examples and references. This layer includes the information you need to fully apply each checklist item. The checklist was first made available in 2021 and is available here: https://training.cochrane.org/online-learning/knowledge-translation/how-share-cochrane-evidence/dissemination-essentials-checklist. At the link, you can also find a series of videos that walk you through the checklist. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The checklist includes guidance regarding how you should consider and involve your target audience in your dissemination product. [Core outcome sets and Cochrane systematic reviews: Promising findings and opportunities for progress](/colloquium-2023/session/1473606/core-outcome-sets-and-cochrane-systematic-reviews-promising-findings-and-opportunities-for-progress) Background: Core outcome sets (COS) represent agreed-upon minimum outcomes that should be reported in all studies in a given topic area. Among the first 100 Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) published in 2019, 7 (7%) cited a COS in relation to choosing outcomes. A relevant COS existed but was not mentioned (or cited) for 27 of the remaining 93 SRs (29%). Among Cochrane Review Group editors surveyed in 2019, 86% felt that COS should definitely/possibly be used in Cochrane SRs. The Cochrane Handbook now recommends including outcomes from relevant COS. Objectives: (1) Examine whether authors are currently considering COS to inform outcome choice for Cochrane SRs. (2) Understand author barriers and facilitators of using COS in Cochrane SRs. Methods: We examined the extent to which all Cochrane SRs published in the last 3 months of 2022 and all Cochrane protocols published in 2022: (a) cited a COS, (b) searched for COS, and (c) reported outcome inconsistency among included studies and/or noted the need for COS. We will conduct an online anonymous survey of authors of these SRs to identify barriers and facilitators of using COS to inform outcome choice. Results: Among the 88 eligible SRs, 13 SRs (15%) cited a COS and 1 additional SR (1%) mentioned searching for COS. Among the 74 SRs that did not cite or search for COS, 17 SRs (23%) reported outcome inconsistency among included studies and/or the need for standardized outcomes/COS. Among the 231 eligible protocols, 24 (10%) cited a COS and an additional 14 protocols (6%) searched for COS. Twenty-three of the 37 protocols that searched for COS (62%) found and used one. At the Colloquium, we will describe how the SRs and protocols that cited COS used those outcomes. We will also present insights from the author survey. Conclusions: Although more than twice the Cochrane SRs (16%) and protocols (16%) in 2022 are considering COS than Cochrane SRs in 2019 (7%), the persistent problem of outcome inconsistency merits greater use of COS in Cochrane SRs. Patient Involvement: Although no patients were involved in this abstract, COS are developed with various stakeholders, including patients. [Interventions during study design and conduct to reduce the risk of bias in interventional studies: a scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473637/interventions-during-study-design-and-conduct-to-reduce-the-risk-of-bias-in-interventional-studies-a-scoping-review) Background: Interventional studies may have high risk of bias, which can mislead medical practice and waste research funding. Reducing or predicting the risk of bias during study design or conduct would help to address this issue. Objectives: To describe interventions during study design and conduct to reduce the risk of bias in interventional studies. Methods: This was a scoping review of three electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane (ClinicalTrials.gov, ANZCTR, WHO ICTRP, MedNar, National Guideline Clearinghouse, WHO Guidelines summaries, Analysis & Policy Observatory, Open Grey). Records were included if they described the implementation or effectiveness of an intervention during study design or conduct which aimed to reduce the risk of bias in interventional studies. Results: We screened 17,334 records from the electronic bibliographic databases and 15,591 records from the grey literature databases. We identified four studies which were eligible for inclusion. These assessed (1) report writing aids, (2) material incentives for study participants, (3) third-party interventions (independent clinical events committee), and (4) education and training for researchers. At the study design stage, a more rigorous participant screening process and systematic participant tracking programme can be designed to ensure a lower rate of lost follow-ups. Financial incentives can be designed for young participants, which will help to increase their response rate and participation. During the conduct phase of the study, an independent clinical committee can avoid the inherent bias of the investigator in judging event outcomes, reduce the risk of bias, and correct the results. Report writing aids could address the current situation of poor adherence to clinical reporting guidelines and significantly reduce the risk of selective reporting. Conclusions: We identified a few interventions that have reduced risk of bias, which do not encompass all the risks of bias faced by interventional studies. These interventions require adequate research funding and staff support and cannot be applied to all interventional studies. We also identified various pathways to reducing the risk of bias by intervening during study design which have yet to be tested in practice. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Searching clinical trials registers: guidance and recommendations for systematic reviewers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473405/searching-clinical-trials-registers-guidance-and-recommendations-for-systematic-reviewers) Background: Clinical trial registers provide information on planned, ongoing and completed trials, both published and unpublished. Gold standard systematic reviews mandate searching trial registers because it allows retrieval of unpublished information, thereby reducing publication bias and research waste and improving reliability of the generated evidence. However, searching trial registers is often challenging, and guidance is lacking. Objectives: We aimed to address this gap by providing step-by-step guidance on how to search clinical trial registers to harness their full potential. Methods: We developed guidance based on 1) a literature review, 2) information available on trial registry websites, 3) a consensus workshop with information specialists, trial registry staff and systematic reviewers collating their experiences and expert opinions, and 4) an online survey of Cochrane information specialists and health technology assessment reviewers. Results: We derived several key steps encompassing guidance for where to search, formulating the search strategy, conducting the search, screening registration records, obtaining data and updating and reporting searches (Figure 1). For each step, we highlight key differences to searching bibliographic databases, demonstrate practical application using a case study, and offer recommendations such as which registers to search [World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov as a minimum]; avoid using filters (e.g., by participant age or study type); and adjust search strategies for each registry. Conclusions: Clinical trial registers are rich in data, and this guidance outlines how best to find and harvest trial information from them. The recommendations can be used to retrieve unpublished results data directly from the registry or via communication with registrants. They may also facilitate identification of evidence gaps to inform research prioritisation, identification of ongoing trials for collaborative methodologies such as prospective meta-analysis, assessment of publication bias, and planning of updates of traditional or living systematic reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This guidance was tested by two first-time registry users as well as several experienced systematic reviewers. Implementation of these methods will help to streamline evidence synthesis, reduce bias and enhance the reliability and validity of systematic reviews, ultimately leading to better health outcomes. [Effects of allocation concealment and blinding in trials addressing treatments for COVID-19: A methods study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473611/effects-of-allocation-concealment-and-blinding-in-trials-addressing-treatments-for-covid-19-a-methods-study) Background: Allocation concealment (the concealment of the randomization sequence from personnel enrolling participants) and blinding (the concealment of the arm to which participants have been randomized from one or more individuals involved in a trial) have long been considered important to prevent bias in randomized trials. Objective: Assess the impact of allocation concealment and blinding on the results of COVID-19 trials. Methods: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database (up to February 2022). We included randomized trials that compared drug therapeutics with placebo or standard care in patients with COVID-19. We performed random-effects meta-regressions comparing the results of trials with and without allocation concealment and blinding of healthcare providers and patients. Results: We identified 488 trials. We found that, compared with trials with allocation concealment, trials without allocation concealment may estimate treatments to be more beneficial for mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, duration of hospitalization, and duration of mechanical ventilation, but results were imprecise. We did not find compelling evidence that, compared with trials with blinding, trials without blinding produce consistently different results for mortality, mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospitalization. We found that trials without blinding may estimate treatments to be more beneficial for hospitalizations and duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: We did not find compelling evidence that COVID-19 trials with and without blinding produce consistently different results, but trials without allocation concealment estimate treatments to be more beneficial compared to trials with allocation concealment. Our findings have implications for the design of future COVID-19 trials and trials to inform future health emergencies and for systematic reviewers, guideline developers, and clinicians who are interpreting and applying evidence from these trials. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We involved patient partners in selecting the outcomes of interest. [Forward Together: An Evidence-Based Practice Partnership](/colloquium-2023/session/1473593/forward-together-an-evidence-based-practice-partnership) Background The University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Nursing Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program initiated an innovative partnership with Children's of Mississippi (COM) hospital to teach DNP students and COM nurses (COMNs) how to translate evidence into practice. The project engaged stakeholders to prioritize the individual evidence needs of five COM units and build relationships among evidence-based practice (EBP) champions. Academic/practice partnerships can enhance educational programs and help nurses become well-positioned to lead change and improve the quality and safety of healthcare delivery. Objectives The purpose of this partnership was to pair DNP students with COMNs and train them to: -Develop clinical leadership skills to lead change; -Define EBPs for the clinical area; -Conduct unbiased clinical audits (CAs) and engage in quality improvement (QI) processes; -Design and execute strategies to implement EBPs. Methods Five COMNs were paired with five DNP students to address priority questions identified by hospital leadership. All completed an evidence implementation training program (EITP) that included two, week-long intensive workshops. In the intervening 6 months between the workshops, the pairs led evidence implementation projects (EIPs) using CA methodology on five COM units. JBI Evidence Summaries were used to identify current evidence and CA criteria for each EIP. Compliance with EBPs were measured at baseline and after implementing strategies while prioritizing the needs of the evidence users at the clinical sites. Results Overall Hospital leadership identified the COMNs as QI Champions who have the skills and tools to continue to lead EIPs within the organization. EIP reports were submitted for publication, and 4/5 (80%) were accepted for publication. Impact on patients and healthcare consumers Positive patient and organizational outcomes were achieved with the EIPs. CAs revealed improvements in compliance (32%, 38.5%, 43%, 47%, and 78%) with EBPs on all five units. Conclusions The EITP improved DNP scholarship and provided a framework for translating evidence into practice in a short period of time. This innovative academic/practice partnership benefits DNP students, clinical nurses, and healthcare organizations. Other organizations can use this as a model to implement partnerships to improve the quality and safety of healthcare delivery using evidence. [Did randomized trials evaluating pharmacological treatments for non-severe COVID-19 prioritize patient-important outcomes in their results?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473867/did-randomized-trials-evaluating-pharmacological-treatments-for-non-severe-covid-19-prioritize-patient-important-outcomes-in-their-results) Background: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) played a key role during the COVID-19 pandemic. CPGs oriented decision-making in a period of high information requirements and massive research generation. One of the fundamental steps in the development of CPGs is the prioritization of the outcomes that will inform the recommendations. In this process, various stakeholders, including patients, rate and select the most relevant outcomes for decision-making. Ideally, these are the outcomes that researchers should address in the studies that inform such CPGs. However, the reporting and selection of outcomes in primary studies are not necessarily in accordance with the CPG. Objectives: To assess if randomized trials evaluating pharmacological treatments for nonsevere COVID-19 prioritize patient-important outcomes in their results. Methods: We will include randomized trials evaluating pharmacological treatments for nonsevere COVID-19 identified in the COVID-19 living systematic review. We will consider the outcomes used in the COVID-19 living guidelines of the World Health Organization as the list of outcomes critical and important for decision-making (admission to hospital, death, quality of life, adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and time to symptom resolution). Results: This project is in progress. We will describe the frequency that each outcome is reported in the included trials. We will also describe how many of the outcomes are reported at the trial level. In addition, we will describe whether authors present their results in a manner that can be included in a meta-analysis. We will perform a description by subgroups: funding sources and the availability of a published protocol before/after the publication of the first version of the World Health Organization guideline (September 2020). Conclusions: This study can evaluate whether the initiatives that promote the measurement and reporting of patient-important outcomes have had an impact on the development of COVID-19 randomized trials. In addition, we can know if there is any factor that affects prioritization. This study is relevant to patients because the selection and reporting of outcomes should be patient centered. [A comparison of different forward citation chasing tools for complementary searches for Cochrane systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473840/a-comparison-of-different-forward-citation-chasing-tools-for-complementary-searches-for-cochrane-systematic-reviews) Background: Forward citation chasing, defined as the use of a citation index to retrieve references that cite a source, is currently recommended as a complement to find all possibly relevant research for systematic reviews (SRs). Recently, new tools have been developed to ease this task, but their performance has not been compared yet. Objectives: To compare the performance of different forward citation indexes and tools for forward citation chase in a sample of Cochrane SRs. Methods: We searched for Cochrane SRs with at least two published versions 5 years apart. Starting from an 'index reference set' (i.e., references of the included studies in the original version of the SR, plus the reference of the original SR itself), we conducted a forward citation search using the following resources: Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar, Citationchaser, Paperfetcher, and Citation cloud. We assessed the performance of each tool regarding the identification of the 'target reference set' (i.e., primary study references included only in the updated version of the SR but not in the original version) in terms of sensitivity and precision. Results: Preliminary, median sensitivity and precision results were, respectively, From our preliminary analysis, WoS showed the best performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity for conducting forward citation searches. The full findings of our research will be presented at the colloquium. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Developing infographics to communicate COVID-19 rapid review conclusions in South Africa](/colloquium-2023/session/1473547/developing-infographics-to-communicate-covid-19-rapid-review-conclusions-in-south-africa) Background: The South African National Department of Health (NDoH), members of the National Essential Medicines List Ministerial Advisory Committee (NEML-MAC) on COVID-19 Therapeutics, and the South African GRADE Network, co-led by Cochrane South Africa (SA) and the Centre for Evidence-Based Health Care, collaborated on rapid evidence reviews to inform the National Essential Medicines List and Guidelines for COVID-19 management since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A strategy was needed to communicate the findings of these rapid reviews to healthcare professionals managing COVID-19 in South Africa (SA). Objectives: To develop infographics of rapid reviews to aid access for healthcare professionals to reliable, high-quality evidence to inform decisions around COVID-19 management in SA. Methods: We collaborated with a graphic designer to create relevant infographics from rapid reviews. Infographic topics were prioritised in consultation with the NEML-MAC on COVID-19 Therapeutics. We worked with the designer to ensure correct content and readability. The final graphics were sent to the NEML-MAC on COVID-19 Therapeutics members for a final content check and sign off. Infographics were then shared with the NDoH and uploaded on their website (https://www.health.gov.za/covid-19-rapid-reviews/). Results: Four infographics of rapid reviews were developed for the use of baricitinib (Figure 1), inhaled corticosteroids (Figure 2), oral corticosteroids (Figure 3) and ivermectin (Figure 4) to treat COVID-19. These were shared on the NDoH website, on social media and among academic networks. A COVID-19 inpatient and outpatient management algorithm infographic is also currently under development. Conclusions: It is important to translate research into digestible information packages for healthcare professionals to access and be able to use. Infographics are a useful means to communicate these findings in an understandable and readable product which can be shared easily and widely. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Shared with healthcare professionals through the NDoH website, social media and professional networks. [Comparison between randomized clinical trials designating an outcome as primary and those designating the same outcome as secondary](/colloquium-2023/session/1473627/comparison-between-randomized-clinical-trials-designating-an-outcome-as-primary-and-those-designating-the-same-outcome-as-secondary) Background: An outcome may be selected as a primary or a secondary outcome in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Researchers may expect a larger effect size from this outcome when it is selected as a primary outcome than when it is selected as a secondary outcome, leading to expectation bias. Objectives: To compare the effect estimates between RCTs selecting an outcome as a primary outcome (RCT-POs) and those selecting the same outcome as a secondary outcome (RCT-SOs) assessing the same clinical question. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study on RCTs. We screened six high-impact journals (the Annals of Internal Medicine, The BMJ, JAMA, JAMA Internal Medicine, The Lancet, and PLoS Medicine) published between 2017 and 2022 for meta-analyses that assessed the efficacy of clinical interventions and produced statistically significant estimates. In each meta-analysis, RCT-POs were included in the exposure group, whereas RCTs-SOs were in the control group. The ratio of risk ratio (RRR), hazard ratio (RHR), or odds ratio (ROR, with OR transformed from SMD) between RCTs-PO and RCTs-SO were pooled to form a single estimate by random-effects meta-analyses. We planned to include 100 meta-analyses. Results: This was an interim analysis. A total of 59 meta-analyses were identified, including 27 assessing medical products and 32 assessing other interventions. Six hundred six RCTs were included, comprising 259 RCT-POs and 347 RCT-SOs. On average, RCT-POs produced an effect estimate 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.30, I2=44.0%) times greater than RCT-SOs. RCT-POs assessing produced an effect estimate 1.24 (95% CI: 1.12-1.38; I2=44.3%) times greater than RCT-SOs, whereas RCT-POs assessing other interventions produced an effect estimate 1.09 (95%: 0.93-1.29; I2=44.7%) times greater than RCT-SOs. Conclusions: RCT-POs generally produced an effect estimate 18% greater than RCT-SOs, implying that the expectations bias could significantly distort the results of RCTs, especially those assessing the efficacy of medical products. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [Mechanical ventilation core outcome set uptake in Cochrane systematic reviews. A cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473450/mechanical-ventilation-core-outcome-set-uptake-in-cochrane-systematic-reviews.-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Core Outcome Sets (COSs) are defined as an agreed standardized set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare. They help in reducing waste in research by improving the consistency of outcomes measured in trials and other research on the same health condition, ensuring that all important outcomes are measured. Systematic reviews of interventions summarise all the available evidence on a given topic and are used to inform healthcare decision-making. Frequently, the choice of outcomes for a systematic review raises concerns due to clinical trialists and systematic reviewers being interested in different types of outcomes. Cochrane reviews are well known for their rigorous methods and high-quality standards, with the relevance of COSs in defining review questions and planning the review acknowledged in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In 2019, a COS was published for trials testing any intervention intended to modify mechanical ventilation (MV) duration in critical care. This specific COS uptake in Cochrane systematic reviews has not been assessed. Objectives: To assess the uptake of the MV COS in Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We included completed Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols of Cochrane systematic reviews of any intervention related to mechanically ventilated patients through a search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We extracted key information on participants, interventions, comparators, and MV COS outcomes. We also extracted data related to outcomes not included in the MV COS. For reviews or protocols published after 2019, we analysed the citation of the MV COS. Results: We assessed 310 Cochrane reviews and protocols for eligibility. We will show the complete results at the London Colloquium. Conclusions: We will show the conclusions at the London Colloquium. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Understanding the health impacts of climate change: search filter development for exposure pathways](/colloquium-2023/session/1473852/understanding-the-health-impacts-of-climate-change-search-filter-development-for-exposure-pathways) Background: Climate change is the great challenge facing humanity in the 21st century. It has a wide range of health impacts that policymakers need to act upon. High-quality evidence syntheses (ES) are vital for policymaking. Search filters\u2014validated combinations of search terms on a specific topic\u2014play an important role in ensuring robust search methods for ES. Developing search strategies for climate health is complicated by the breadth of impacts and by the fact that relevant studies may not be labeled as related to climate change. Currently, no validated search filters for climate health studies are available. Objectives: Our aim is to develop and validate search filters for MEDLINE to identify studies on health-related impacts of climate change per exposure pathway. Methods: Climate change impacts human health via several pathways: extreme weather events, heat stress, changes in air quality, changes in water quality and quantity, effects upon food supply and safety, vector distribution and ecology, and social factors. We conducted a search for climate health-related ES in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest and Theses February 2021. The search yielded 8,614 records after deduplication. These were dually screened and 110 climate-related ES were identified for inclusion, classified into exposure pathways, and sorted by number of included studies. We extracted each included study from the first 79 ES, classified each study according to exposure pathway, and checked each study for indexing in PubMed. Results: We present an ongoing project by the Cochrane Climate-Health Working Group to develop MEDLINE search filters for the seven major exposure pathways through which human health is affected by climate change. We extracted 2,327 studies and are currently developing and validating search filters per pathway. Conclusions: We will present the development and validation of climate health search filters for different exposure pathways and will discuss challenges encountered. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We describe information retrieval methods; therefore, patients or healthcare consumers were not involved. However, robust search methods for climate health ES are of interest to the global health community. [Powering transformative change through collaborative action: The Healthcare Information for All Strategy](/colloquium-2023/session/1473415/powering-transformative-change-through-collaborative-action-the-healthcare-information-for-all-strategy) Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), poor quality of care in low- and middle-income countries contributes to 5.7-8.4 million deaths annually. Failure to apply and access reliable healthcare information is a leading cause of preventable deaths and suffering worldwide. Healthcare Information for All (HIFA) is a global social movement born in 2006, with a commitment to promote communication, understanding and advocacy among all stakeholders in the production, exchange and use of reliable healthcare information. Objectives: To understand the HIFA mission, vision and strategy to promote universal access to reliable healthcare information and prevent misinformation and to identify collaborative approaches to strengthen global health communication and coproduction of evidence-based health information. Methods: HIFA utilises a \"Theory of Change\" model whereby HIFA's inputs, activities and outputs translate into essential outcomes and impact (Figure 1). The impact of HIFA contributes to meeting basic needs, empowering communities and achievement of global health goals like Universal Health Coverage and Sustainable Development Goals (Figure 2). HIFA evaluates 'value co-creation' across several domains, using quantitative and qualitative indicators, including value for HIFA members and participating organisations. Results: With more than 20,000 multidisciplinary members from more than 180 countries, 274 country representatives, interacting over 6 global forums in 4 different languages, and 434 international support organisations, HIFA continues to evolve as a robust global health information system (Figure 3). Accomplishing instrumental milestones (Figure 4), the HIFA strategy describes seven strategic shifts necessary to accelerate progress towards universal access to reliable health information (Figure 5) Conclusions: With a visionary future, HIFA's priority is to convene key stakeholders to accelerate progress towards universal access to reliable healthcare information. Amidst challenges with funding and staff infrastructure, HIFA continues to engage strategically with the WHO to develop initiatives such as the WHO-HIFA Collaboration Plan (Figure 6) to identify best practices, opportunities and challenges from stakeholders and support multilingualism in global health. Healthcare consumer involvement: HIFA is an organisation for the people, by the people. The members represent the full spectrum of healthcare providers and consumers including patients, caregivers, general public, policymakers, researchers, social scientists, etc., whose contributions are fundamental to the advocacy of Estimates in Randomized Controlled Trials of Chinese Herbal Medicine: A Meta-Epidemiological Study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473539/trial-characteristics-and-treatment-effect-estimates-in-randomized-controlled-trials-of-chinese-herbal-medicine-a-meta-epidemiological-study) Background: Previous meta-epidemiological studies based on Western medicine have found several trial characteristics influencing the effect estimates of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, whether there were similar associations in Chinese herbal medicine RCTs is unclear. Furthermore, the characteristics specific to Chinese medicine have not been investigated. Objectives: This meta-epidemiological study aimed to explore potential trial characteristics associated with treatment effect estimates in Chinese herbal medicine RCTs, including both Chinese medicine-specific characteristics and characteristics common to Chinese and Western medicine. Methods: Three English databases and two Chinese databases were searched for systematic reviews on Chinese herbal medicine treatment published from January 2011 to July 2021. The difference in effect estimates was presented as the ratio of odds ratio (ROR) for binary outcomes and the difference in standardized mean differences (dSMD) for continuous outcomes. The two-step method was used for meta-epidemiological analyses. Results: We included 91 systematic reviews, comprising 1,338 RCTs. For binary outcomes, RCTs with syndrome differentiation (ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.39), adopting Chinese medicine formula (ROR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.34), of low risk of bias in incomplete outcome data (ROR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.52) and selective outcome reporting (ROR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.24), and having sample size 100 (ROR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42) tended to have greater effect estimates. For continuous outcomes, RCTs based on Chinese medicine diagnostic criteria (dSMD: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.41), judged -0.70, 95% CI: -0.99, -0.42), rated as incomplete outcome data (dSMD: -0.02) showed larger effect estimates. Conclusions: Our findings will provide empirical evidence for developing a critical appraisal tool specific to assessing risk of bias of Chinese herbal medicine RCTs. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patient or member of the public was involved in conducting this study. [Learning effects of an evidence-based shared decision-making curriculum: the co-design and co-produce with clinical patients, and undergraduate medical students](/colloquium-2023/session/1473379/learning-effects-of-an-evidence-based-shared-decision-making-curriculum-the-co-design-and-co-produce-with-clinical-teachers-patients-and-undergraduate-medical-students) Background: Shared decision-making (SDM), a process in which clinicians and patients work together to select treatments based on clinical evidence and the patient's informed preferences, is the optimal outcome to evaluating evidence-based practice. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) also included SDM as an essential skill of Competencies Interpersonal and Communication Skills for physicians to provide patient-centered care. Objectives: This study aimed to codesign and coproduce an evidence-based SDM simulation curriculum with clinical teachers, standard patients (SP), and undergraduate medical students to fulfill the needs of students and patients. We also evaluated students' learning effects quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods: We first performed SP focus group interviews to explore patient needs for SDM and then held five consensus meetings using the Delphi method with four representative students, three SP, and four teachers to determine core competencies, teaching objectives, course contents, and learning outcomes; finally, we used a paired t-test to evaluate the progress of students' SDM skills improvement in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) quantitatively, as well as content analyzed the learning effects from students' interviews and teachers/SP's focus groups qualitatively. Results: A total of 122 undergraduate medial students (55% male, mean age 24.2 years) with mean clinical experience of 10.1 months completed the course and pre-/post-OSCE multirater feedback assessments. After training, students' SDM skills were significantly improved with change scores of 2.8, 9.5, and 7.8 among students, SP, and teachers, respectively. SDM self-efficacy of students and patients, as well as teachers' ratings of the scores of entrustable professional activities, were also significantly improved. The content analysis of students' interviews and SP and teachers' focus groups indicated that the codesign and coproduction of an SDM curriculum with participants' feedback could facilitate students' empathy and weaken the medical autonomy mindset, as well as deepen their attitude, knowledge and behaviors of patient-centered care. Conclusions: To alleviate medical paternalism and facilitate patient-centered care, clinical teachers, medical students and patients must have a voice in developing highly impactful curricula in the healthcare practice. Our codesigned and coproduced SDM curriculum could help improve students' subjective and objective SDM skills, as well as the SDM self-efficacy quantitatively and qualitatively. [Capturing the primary outcome for Cochrane reviews of medications: an overview of Cochrane reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473898/capturing-the-primary-outcome-for-cochrane-reviews-of-deprescribing-specific-medications-an-overview-of-cochrane-reviews) Background: Deprescribing is the process of discontinuing an inappropriate medication. Research into deprescribing has grown rapidly in recent years, including a number of Cochrane systematic reviews (CR). It is important to study whether discontinuation can be done successfully without an increased risk of a return of symptoms, an event, or need to restart because this is important for clinicians and patients. In this review, we want to review primary outcomes in deprescribing CR. Objectives: To review reported primary outcomes in CR of deprescribing specific medications and to assess which CR included successful discontinuation rate and how this is defined. We also aimed to assess whether CR reported the proportion of patients who successfully stopped, frequency of relapse or event, and of restarting medication as primary outcome. Methods: We screened all published CR in the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews until February 2023. Reviews were included if they aimed to assess discontinuing a specific medication (classes) or interventions to support discontinuing medication. We extracted all primary outcomes. Results: We included 14 CR related to deprescribing (9 CR assessing discontinuation of 1 medication such as cholinesterase-inhibitors, or antipsychotics in dementia, and 5 CR of interventions for discontinuing medication such as approaches to stop antidepressant and interventions for the reduction of prescribed opioid use in chronic pain). All included more than one primary outcome, which resulted in a variety of primary outcomes. Four (29%) reviews used a primary outcome related to 'successful discontinuation rate', e.g., the number of patients who successfully stopped the specific medication; however, studies varied in the definition of successful discontinuation. The nine remaining reviews used frequency of symptomatic relapse or occurrence of a medical event as the primary outcome. Conclusions: A broad range of primary outcomes was reported in CR of deprescribing medication. A few CR have examined successful discontinuation rate, with variation in definition. The results support a broader discussion with involvement of patients and clinicians on primary outcomes and how successfully discontinuation needs to be defined in deprescribing Cochrane reviews. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Need to be involved in the broader discussion. [Novel Population Search Filter Development Methodology - the Black Persons Living in the United States Project](/colloquium-2023/session/1473401/novel-population-search-filter-development-methodology-the-black-persons-living-in-the-united-states-project) Background: Increasingly, systematic review searchers need to limit searches to specific populations. This is a difficult task given the wide array of synonyms, semantic drift over time, and poor population reporting in abstracts. This is especially evident in the terms associated with Black Persons Living in the United States (BPLiUS), i.e., US-born Black Americans and US immigrants of Sub-Saharan African ancestry. Objective: To increase the efficiency, reliability, and inclusivity of population searches, we will develop a novel method to create and validate search filters to retrieve biomedical and health sciences-related information on BPLiUS persons in Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed. Methods: We will use a handsearch method to create our gold standard citation set. To gather the most representative citation sample, we will draw from Black-focused journals along with journals in the following categories: race/ethnicity-focused, cultural anthropology/psychosocial, representative high-impact journals, clinical/health systems, and, lastly, regional/state medical journals. To capture the breadth and depth of Black ethnonym terms over time, we will sample citations in the above categories in 20-year increments\u2014i.e., 1955 (Jim Crow era), 1975 (Civil Rights era), 1995 (African American era), 2015 (People of Color era), and 2021 (BIPOC era)\u2014to capture more recent language. We will include explicit population terms (e.g., Blacks), implicit terms (e.g., minorities), and contextual terms occurring with explicit/implicit terms (e.g., immigrant). To identify filter terms, we will text-mine our test set and Black-focused journal citations using the AntConc software; consult the National Library of Medicine's MeSH database; identify example search filters; review published systematic review search strategies; and analyze potential implicit words/phrases for inclusion. The gold standard set will be divided into test and validation sets. The filters will be internally and externally validated. We will create a highly sensitive (recall)-maximizing filter (prespecified performance minimum 75%), a precision-maximizing filter, and a best balance of sensitivity and precision filter. Relevance and importance to patients: This article contributes to methods resulting in more robust evidence production. [Trusting what you see: the importance of images shared with evidence for health decision-making and how to get it right](/colloquium-2023/session/1473441/trusting-what-you-see-the-importance-of-images-shared-with-evidence-for-health-decision-making-and-how-to-get-it-right) Background: PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool) has been launched in January 2019. Since then, there has been much progress and literature on the methodology for prediction modelling in general and on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in this field in particular. Hence, it is timely to develop PROBAST+AI that applies to studies on developing and evaluating (validating) multivariable diagnostic and prognostic prediction models using any data analytical (statistical) AI or ML technique. Objectives: To develop and test PROBAST+AI, a quality and risk of bias assessment tool that applies to studies on developing and evaluating (validating) multivariable diagnostic and prognostic prediction models using any AI/ML data analytical technique. Methods: Using a Delphi process (at least 3 survey rounds) among a diverse and large (>200) group of key stakeholders and experts on prediction model and AI/ML, we identified the relevant items for PROBAST+AI. Participants gave their opinion on a large series of quality, risk of bias, and applicability domains and signalling questions, using a 5-Point Likert scale. Participants were also asked to add new suggestions using free-text boxes. Results: Currently, two Delphi rounds have been conducted, and a third is planned in the spring of 2023, followed, if deemed necessary, by a final consensus expert meeting. The results and PROBAST+AI will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: PROBAST+AI will provide key stakeholders in diagnostic and prognostic prediction models (including primary study authors, systematic reviewers, guideline developers, healthcare providers, prediction model developers, and patients), guidance on the relevant methodological aspects of diagnostic, and prognostic prediction model studies using any AI/ML data analytical technique. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Part of the PROBAST+AI Delphi and working group. Our project has methodological implications for systematic reviews. The images we use when sharing evidence are important. Images can convey ideas quickly, simply, more universally, and sometimes more powerfully than text. They can engage and inform our target audiences of people who may use the evidence for their health decisions. Well-chosen images can draw people in, arouse emotions, and influence someone's decision whether to read on. They can also enhance or reinforce written information and contribute to the credibility of the content. By contrast, bad image choices can repel, misrepresent, and undermine the trustworthiness of the written information they accompany, as well as of the organisation sharing the image. Here, we will encourage people to reflect on the impact of images by exploring some positive examples of image choice, as well as some problematic ones. We will share some key considerations to guide your image choices, including pitfalls to look out for. We will explore, for example, the importance of depicting a diverse range of people to ensure wide representation and inclusivity, accurately depicting the evidence, choosing realistic and relatable images that depict topics sensitively, and avoiding images that stigmatize or reinforce stereotypes. We will also consider how alternatives to stock images, especially art made by people about their health experiences, can be particularly powerful and relatable. As we look at the impact of image choice, we will draw on Cochrane's Guide to Choosing Images for Sharing Evidence, produced by Cochrane UK with input from a diverse global advisory group which is now a Cochrane learning resource. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: One of the abstract authors is a consumer. The Guide we drew on was developed with the help of a global advisory group which included healthcare consumers. We include, and advocate for, images made by people to reflect their health experiences and talk about involving consumers in image choice. [Impact of active placebo controls on estimated drug effects in randomised trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473424/impact-of-active-placebo-controls-on-estimated-drug-effects-in-randomised-trials) Background: Active placebo controls are designed to mimic the nontherapeutic adverse effects of drugs in randomised trials. Active placebos are rarely used but could reduce the risk of bias due to unblinding. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the difference in drug effects when an experimental drug is compared with an active placebo versus a standard placebo control intervention, and to explore causes for heterogeneity. In the context of a randomised trial, this difference in drug effects can be estimated by directly comparing the effect difference between active placebo and standard placebo intervention. Design: A systematic review. Methods: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, and other sources up to October 2020 and included randomised trials directly comparing active placebo versus standard placebo. Our primary inverse-variance, random-effects meta-analysis used standardised mean differences (SMDs) earliest post-treatment assessment. An SMD <0 favoured the active placebo. We conducted seven sensitivity analyses, four subgroup analyses and a meta-regression. In secondary analyses, we investigated observer-reported outcomes, harms, attrition, and cointervention outcomes. Results: We included 21 trials (1,462 participants). The pooled SMD in our primary analysis was -0.08 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.04; Figure 1). The difference was more pronounced and statistically significant in the sensitivity analyses restricting to trials with overall low risk of bias (pooled SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.23 to -0.07). The pooled SMD of observer-reported outcomes was similar to the primary analysis. The pooled odds ratio for harms was 3.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 6.07), and for attrition, 1.22 (95% CI 0.74 to 2.03). Cointervention data were limited. Meta-regression found no statistically significant association with adequacy of the active placebo or risk of unintended therapeutic effect. Conclusions: We did not find a statistically significant difference between active and standard placebo interventions in our primary analysis, but the result was imprecise and compatible with a difference ranging from important to irrelevant. Furthermore, the result was not robust, for example, when restricting to trials with overall low risk of bias. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Collective impact approach for more effective knowledge translation](/colloquium-2023/session/1473761/collective-impact-approach-for-more-effective-knowledge-translation) Background: Translating evidence into clinical knowledge and improved health is challenging. A collective impact approach, bringing together stakeholders through common goals, deploying mutually reinforcing activities and shared measurement systems, provides a framework for more effective translation. The Targeted Therapies Alliance (TTA) designed, developed and implemented a national program in Australia to improve the quality use of biological medicines using a collective impact approach to achieve better health outcomes for people with inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The TTA included nine member organisations and four affiliate organisations representing consumer and clinical audiences, program development expertise and implementation capability. Objectives: Program objectives were to optimise (5) glucocorticoid and analgesic use. Methods: Steps included (1) consortium development with key stakeholders; (2) research and review of practice/behavioural drivers; (3) using behavioural change theory and implementation science to codesign program objectives, key messages and strategy; (4) development and testing interventions with audiences; and (5) promotion of interventions via consortium channels. Results: Seventy interventions supporting key messages were implemented between September 2020 and September 2022 for consumers, rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, dermatologists, immunologists, pharmacists, nurses and hospital/jurisdictional decision-makers. They were applicable to specialist practices, private and public hospitals, hospital and community pharmacies, consumers in these settings and wherever self-management occurred. All resources were available from a dedicated hub (www.nps.org.au/bdmards) with links to TTA member websites, and vice versa. Endorsed national living guidelines were an engagement point for the rheumatology program addressing priority questions for rheumatologists and providing the basis for developing interventions for health professionals and consumers. Positive impacts on knowledge, confidence and practice/behaviour were seen across all therapeutic areas, despite already high levels of knowledge and practice in some areas. Outcome evaluation should be performed in 2025, ~24 months after program implementation. Conclusions: The consortium-based approach provided a collaborative model for developing a multifaceted program addressing multiple perspectives to optimise DMARD use. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Consumers were partners in all stages: governance, research, program design, intervention design, testing, implementation and evaluation. [Patient organisations and the core outcome set revolution](/colloquium-2023/session/1473710/patient-organisations-and-the-core-outcome-set-revolution) Background: This work links to the international Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. Core Outcome Sets (COS) can reduce research waste by promoting consistency in outcome reporting. They represent the minimum that should be measured and reported for a particular health condition. COS should be relevant to all research stakeholders, including patients and the public. Patient participation in COS development is considered crucial to ensure core outcomes are relevant to patients and other healthcare decision-makers. There has been a dramatic increase in patient participation over recent years. Once developed, COS need to be used to reduce rather than increase research waste. Patient organisations are influential in policy decisions in healthcare, and many provide research funding for clinical studies and collaborate closely with the research community in their disease area. Objectives: Describe how COS developers work with patient organisations in developing COS and promoting COS uptake. Identify how patient organisations' influence could be harnessed to enhance COS uptake, normalise their use, and maximise collaborations between COS developers and patient organisations. Methods: We consulted with COS developers via a survey to explore how they worked with patient organisations in developing COS and promoting their use. Additionally, we held meetings with four key stakeholders from patient organisations to understand what they knew of COS, any previous involvement in COS, and their views on how their organisation might support COS uptake. Results: COS developers often described working with patient organisations in activities, such as identifying public research partners or recruiting patient participants. However, they rarely described patient organisations changing their practice as a result of being involved in a COS project. The patient organisations interviewed expressed keen interest in COS and could see the relevance and importance of COS uptake, although some challenges were noted. Conclusions: Whilst COS developers often turn to patient organisations for help, these partnerships could provide opportunities for promoting COS uptake. Indeed, patient organisations appear eager to hear about COS, recognising the importance of COS uptake. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We worked in partnership with two patient organisations, one partner is also a patient research partner. [Can we reduce the workload of systematic reviews without compromising quality? A new platform to accelerate search and study identification](/colloquium-2023/session/1473805/can-we-reduce-the-workload-of-systematic-reviews-without-compromising-quality-a-new-platform-to-accelerate-search-and-study-identification) Background: The development of systematic reviews (SRs) is resource intensive. The Sustainable Knowledge Platform (SK platform) is a new system that streamlines all the steps of SRs, applying technology to make the process efficient. It includes a comprehensive taxonomy, as well as off-the-shelf Boolean strategies and predeveloped artificial-intelligence algorithms for each term. This platform decreases the workload, but it is not clear whether this is at the expense of compromising quality. Objectives: To compare the performance of the SK platform against the traditional approach, to search and select studies in the context of an SR of trials of aspirin for the prevention of colorectal cancer in average-risk adults. Methods: For the traditional approach, we designed a standard search strategy for MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL up to January 2023. For the alternative approach, we matched the components of the review question to the relevant terms of the taxonomy, ran the predeveloped Boolean strategies and applied the automated classifiers. Title/abstracts will be assessed by a single reviewer for each approach, and the full text of the potentially eligible studies will be assessed in duplicate (independent reviewers for each approach). As a measure of workload, we will estimate the total number of records. We will calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the alternative approach using the traditional approach as the reference standard. We will report the number of studies detected by the alternative approach only and will attempt to explore the potential reasons (e.g., different repositories, different strategies). Results: The traditional approach identified 2,766 potentially eligible records. The alternative approach identified 916 records based on the predeveloped search strategies. After applying the automated classifiers, the number to screen decreased to 189. The complete results will be reported during the Colloquium. Conclusions: New approaches may save time and resources. However, it is important to know whether this efficiency gain comes at a cost in quality. If our results are positive, the SK platform would offer an alternative worth exploring in future research. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Using technology in the SR process may help to produce rigorous, relevant and rapid evidence synthesis. [A critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures](/colloquium-2023/session/1473783/a-critical-appraisal-tool-for-systematic-reviews-of-patient-reported-outcome-measures) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are an important way to select the appropriate PROMs. High-quality SRs can provide a comprehensive overview of the PROMs and provide evidence-based recommendations for pediatricians. However, because the risk of bias evaluation of included studies, data extraction and analysis are different from other types of SRs, and there are currently no tools applicable to evaluate risk of bias of SRs of PROMs. Objectives: We aim to develop an evidence-based methodological quality evaluation tool for SRs of PROMs using an explicit, systematic and transparent method: a critical apPRaisal tOol for systeMatic reviews of patient-repOrted ouTcome mEasures (PROMOTE). Methods: We will develop the PROMOTE in five stages using established methods. First, we establish an international and multidisciplinary advisory committee of experts who will oversee the project and provide methodological support. Second, we will develop an initial checklist item list using a scoping review to describe the entries of existing SRs of risk of bias checklists and the methodological characteristics of published SRs of PROMs. Third, 10 SRs of PROMs will be randomly selected using the random number table, and methodological quality will be evaluated by four researchers using the initial checklist item list. The initial items will be modified, added or deleted through focus group discussion. Fourth, we will use a two-round Delphi designed to achieve a high level of expert consensus on the list of items for PROMOTE. We will recruit 30 multidisciplinary international experts, including journal editors, clinical researchers, patient-reported outcomes researchers, guideline developers, policy makers and patients who will participate in the Delphi process. Fifth, after reaching consensus on the items included, we will produce and disseminate PROMOTE risk of bias checklist. Discussion: A systematically developed critical appraisal tool for SRs of PROMs would facilitate the selection of appropriate PROMs in clinical practice or research. A well-defined and transparent critical appraisal tool would further improve the methodological quality of SRs while reducing study waste and ultimately supporting optimal patient health outcomes. Patient or consumer involvement: Patients and consumers will be directly involved in the Delphi process as expert participants. [Cochrane Rehabilitation Blogshot translation: a partnership model of evidence dissemination](/colloquium-2023/session/1652638/cochrane-rehabilitation-blogshot-translation-a-partnership-model-of-evidence-dissemination) Background: Rehabilitation is a health strategy to enable people with disabilities to reach and maintain their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychological, and social functional levels. Cochrane Rehabilitation aims to ensure that all rehabilitation professionals apply Evidence-Based Clinical Practice, combining the best available evidence from high quality Cochrane systematic reviews, with their own clinical expertise and patients' preferences. Cochrane Rehabilitation's priority is to share high quality health information in multiple languages. The translated content is intended to reach rehabilitation professionals and students, researchers, patients and their families and health policy makers. Blogshots are images with key information from a single Cochrane review. Objectives: The aim of this work is to present the collaborative model of Cochrane Rehabilitation's blogshot translations and their dissemination. Methods: The process of creating new translation partnerships starts with spontaneous requests from potential translation partners or with an initial contact by the Field Co-Director or Translation manager. For each language, we seek to involve the National Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine and the local Cochrane Geographical Group (see table 1). These partnerships ensure the quality of translations and enable effective dissemination throughout local communities. The partnership continues with constant communication between translation managers and translation partners. Production times of each translation partner are respected as they are all volunteers and work as full-time clinicians, professors, and researchers. Results: Until March 2023, Cochrane Rehabilitation has translated a total of 531 blogshots: 92 in Dutch, 87 in French, 80 in Italian, 74 in Spanish, 56 in Hungarian, 52 in Croatian, 23 in German, 20 in Serbian, 20 in Polish, 11 in Simplified Chinese, 9 in Japanese, 5 in Malay and 2 in Portuguese. Blogshot translations are available at the Cochrane Rehabilitation website, social media, newsletters and Cochrane archives on Tumblr. Conclusions: Blogshot translations reach a huge number of scientists, rehabilitation professionals, consumers, and policy makers. Partnerships with national societies and Cochrane geographic groups ensure the quality of translations. The success of partnerships is due to close collaboration and clear communication. We aim to continue expanding this collaborative model to include more countries and to increase the dissemination of blogshots. [Plain language summaries of published health research articles: how well are we doing?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473384/plain-language-summaries-of-published-health-research-articles-how-well-are-we-doing) Background: Plain language summaries (PLSs) are condensed summaries of research articles written in plain, easy-to-understand language aimed at a non-scientific audience. Most health research is not written with the public in mind, as it contains jargon and acronyms and is usually written at a high reading level. PLSs are an increasingly important tool for disseminating reliable health information in a way that a lay audience can understand. Objectives: Our first objective was to provide a better understanding of the PLS instructions currently available to authors. Our second objective was to compare published PLSs with author instructions from health journals. Methods: Initially, we conducted a scoping review of 534 health and biomedical journals to locate journals that contained author instructions for writing a PLS. We searched journals from 11 categories linked to the top 10 noncommunicable diseases. We included journals that published in English and recommended the inclusion of a PLS. We reported characteristics and elements of author instructions such as the label used, whether the PLS was optional or mandatory, word, count, length, and use of jargon. We followed this up with a study to determine the level of compliance between author instructions and PLS for these same journals. Before assessed compliance, we had to determine the extent to which PLSs were included with original articles from the journals. Results: From our scoping review, we located 27 journals (5.1%) that had author instructions for PLSs. Author instructions were highly heterogeneous between journals. Only one journal recommended one consumer involvement in PLS development and one the use of a readability tool. In our follow up study, approximately half (53.8%) achieved medium or high levels of compliance. A medium rating was 51%-79% and high 80% compliance between PLSs and author instructions. PLSs were mandatory for seven journals, four of which had low or very low compliance. Conclusions: This research was an important step in the development of evidence-based, consistent, and uniform instructions for writing PLSs that are easily understood by consumers. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: A consumer was engaged as part of the research team, offering knowledge user insight. [Research waste caused by symptom-based eligibility: a systematic review of Cochrane reviews and their component trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473578/research-waste-caused-by-symptom-based-eligibility-a-systematic-review-of-cochrane-reviews-and-their-component-trials) Background: Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the gold standard of evidence for interventions. Therefore, it is imperative that trials are open to all relevant patients and that reviews include all appropriate trials. In gynaecology, it is common that patients with the same diagnosis experience differing symptoms. Where an intervention may benefit the underlying condition, how do trialists define eligibility and select outcomes in the likely scenario that potential participants have no symptoms in common? Similarly, how often do reviewers exclude trials because outcomes are relevant to other symptoms? Objectives: To identify inefficiencies and sources of research waste in the design of recent gynaecology trials and Cochrane reviews. Methods: We searched for Cochrane reviews in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis as exemplar conditions. Reviews were included if the intervention was intended to treat all condition-specific symptoms. We restricted to trials published since 2012 to consider 'current' approaches. For each trial we recorded the number of potentially eligible participants excluded because of their symptoms. Similarly, for each review we recorded the numbers of trials and participants excluded unnecessarily. Results: There were 89 distinct PCOS trials in 13 reviews and 13 endometriosis trials in 11 reviews. Most trials restricted eligibility to participants with specific symptoms (55% PCOS, 46% endometriosis). Reviews excluded 27% of available trials (n=27 in PCOS, n=1 in endometriosis) based on prespecified outcomes not relevant to the symptoms of randomised participants. These excluded trials could have added 1,914 participants (17%) and 44 participants (3%) to the evidence base for PCOS and endometriosis, respectively. Conclusions: Cochrane reviews excluded a quarter of available trials. Excluding trials because prespecified review outcomes are not relevant to randomised participants greatly reduces the evidence base. The issue of outcome reporting bias is now well recognised. We present a subtly different issue of outcome reporting that may lead to imprecision, rather than bias, in the context where an underlying condition presents diverse symptoms. Further work is ongoing to propose more efficient strategies in this context for both trialists and reviewers. Patient involvement: Involvement since idea inception; patients continue to help guide project progress through regular meetings. [An open competition involving thousands of competitors failed to construct useful search filters for new diagnostic test accuracy systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473389/an-open-competition-involving-thousands-of-competitors-failed-to-construct-useful-search-filters-for-new-diagnostic-test-accuracy-systematic-reviews) Background: No abstract classifier can be used for new diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews to select primary DTA study abstracts from database searches. Objectives: Our goal with the FILtering of diagnostic Test accuracy studies (FILTER) Challenge was to develop machine learning (ML) filters for new diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews through an open competition. Methods: We conducted an open competition. We prepared a dataset including titles, abstracts, and the judgement sought to retrieve full texts from 10 DTA reviews and a mapping review. We randomly split the datasets into a train set (n = 27145, labeled as DTA n= 632), a public test set (n = 20417, labeled as DTA n= 474), and a private test set (n = 20417, labeled as DTA n= 469). Competition participants used the training set to develop models, then they validated their models using the public test set to refine their development process. Finally, we used the private test set to rank the submitted models. We used Fbeta with beta set to seven to honor models. For the external validation, we used a DTA review for the cardiology dataset (n = 7722, labeled as DTA n= 167). We preset Fbeta adopted seven as the value of beta and recall to evaluate models for evaluating better filters that are less likely to miss. Results: From July 28 to October 4, 2021, we held the challenge. We received a total of 13,774 submissions from 1,429 teams or persons. We honored the top three models. Fbeta scores and Recall in the external validation set were 0.4036 and 0.2352 by the first model, 0.3262 and 0.3313 by the second model, and 0.3891 and 0.3976 by the third model, respectively. Conclusions: We were unable to develop a search filter with sufficient recall to apply for new DTA reviews immediately. Further studies are needed to update and validate filters with datasets from other clinical areas. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Does type of funding affect reporting in network meta-analysis?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473502/does-type-of-funding-affect-reporting-in-network-meta-analysis) Background: Industry-sponsored randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are more likely to report intervention-favourable results. However, the impact of different funding types on the reporting of network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs has not been explored before. Objectives: To assess whether the funding type influenced: (a) completeness of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting in NMAs of pharmacological interventions according to their funding type, (b) journal impact factor, and (b) the recommendation to use their own or another company's intervention. Methods: We collected NMAs comparing pharmacological interventions published between 2013 and 2018. We assessed completeness of reporting in NMAs using the 32-item PRISMA-NMA checklist and categorized NMAs according to their funding type and overall conclusion. We explored whether NMAs recommended their own or another company's intervention and classified NMAs according to their primary outcome findings and the direction of the overall reported conclusion. We compared the underlying distributions of the journal impact factors by funding type. We also assessed reporting of conflicts of interest (CoI) for the first and senior author in the NMA using barplots. Results: We included 658 sponsored, and 208 non-sponsored funded NMAs were associated with more comprehensive reporting and published their findings in higher impact factor journals compared to industry-sponsored NMAs (median impact-factor: Most industry-sponsored NMAs suggested a statistically significant positive treatment effect for their underlying intervention in their primary outcome (112/136, 82%) and an overall positive conclusion (125/136, 92%). Of the 115 first and senior authors of publicly funded NMAs affiliated with the study sponsor (55%), none reported CoI and, of the 82 first and senior authors of industry-sponsored NMAs that were affiliated with the study sponsor, 78% reported CoI. Conclusions: This is the largest empirical study used to evaluate reporting in NMAs with different funding sources. Differences in completeness of reporting were apparent between different types of funding in NMAs, and guideline developers using NMAs should be aware of this. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None [A call to support Cochrane's social responsibility of improving health equity - the Equity Group](/colloquium-2023/session/1473478/a-call-to-support-cochrane's-social-responsibility-of-improving-health-equity-the-equity-group) Background: Health equity is a moral and ethical imperative. In the 2022 Cochrane Lecture, Jimmy Volmink challenged the organization to address not only inequities raised from health interventions but also consider how to address the social determinants of health which lead to such disparities. Thirteen years ago, The Cochrane and Campbell Equity Methods Group was established to encourage systematic reviewers to consider the potential for interventions to reduce or increase socioeconomic inequities in health. This Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group has just been successfully granted status to become one of the first Cochrane Thematic Groups, herein referred to as The Equity Group. Objectives: The Equity Group aims to: 1. Promote equity in the health evidence-base 2. Ensure equitable processes for stakeholder engagement 3. Produce high-priority, equity-focused evidence syntheses 4. Build capacity for equity design, analysis, and reporting 5. Promote equity in implementation tools Methods: The Equity Group will run a program of projects aiming to reduce health inequity by meeting our five objectives. We will collaborate widely both internally and externally to Cochrane and support any work which helps achieve our objectives. Program of projects: Examples from our workplan include the following: We will develop methods for promoting equity in observational studies, randomized trials, and systematic reviews. We will produce evidence-based, consensus-informed, robust extensions to widely used research tools for these methodologies. We have funding to develop guidance for equitable multi-stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses. We will develop a series of documents with recommendations for conducting, reporting, and evaluating stakeholder engagement throughout all stages of the evidence synthesis process. We are planning to conduct a robust priority setting process that will aim to identify the highest priority equity-focused systematic reviews that should be produced. The Equity Group aims to train author teams and evidence synthesis units to build capacity for equity analysis. This includes creating formal and informal partnerships globally. We plan on developing an equity extension to the widely used GIN-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist. Conclusions: We hereby call to action to listeners who believe in the need to promote health equity and want to support these objectives. [Comparison of linguistic characteristics of plain language summaries of systematic reviews between medical and non-medical sciences: a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473526/comparison-of-linguistic-characteristics-of-plain-language-summaries-of-systematic-reviews-between-medical-and-non-medical-sciences-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Both medical professionals and patients should be able to comprehend health information presented in scientific research. People with low health literacy should be able to access health information easily, with reading level recommendation of maximum 6th-grade reading level. Cochrane is not the only organization developing plain language summaries of systematic reviews (PLSSRs). Although there has been research conducted on medical PLSSRs, little is known about the differences in characteristics between PLSSRs published by medical organizations and those published by non-medical organizations. Objectives: This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the readability, linguistic, and textual characteristics and conclusiveness of PLSSRs between medical and non-medical sciences. Methods: We analysed all PLSSRs of the last updated versions of systematic reviews published in English until November 10th, 2022, by Cochrane Collaboration, Campbell Collaboration, and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie). PLSs were acquired from organizations' web pages manually or using the web scraping procedure. Results: A total of 8,474 medical (by Cochrane) and 163 non-medical (152 by Campbell Collaboration and 11 by 3ie) PLSSRs were included in the analysis. The median years of education needed to understand medical PLSSRs was 15.51 with more confidence (median difference [MDiff] 2.43 on a scale of 0-100 [95% CI: more [95% CI: 5.94-13.82]) than medical PLSSRs. The next step is to assess the conclusiveness of the PLSSRs using the machine learning approach. Conclusions: There is a great discrepancy in the number of PLSSRs between medical and non-medical areas. However, even on a small sample, we found that writers of non-medical PLSSRs are more confident, write in a more positive tone, and use more words than writers of medical PLSSRs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: As this was a methodological study, no patients were directly involved. However, improved readability of plain language summaries of systematic reviews would lead to better decision making, both for patients and other stakeholders. [Discharged patients' PRO-AEs provide credible evidence of in-hospital adverse events](/colloquium-2023/session/1473910/discharged-patients'-pro-aes-provide-credible-evidence-of-in-hospital-adverse-events) Background: Clinician-based reporting of adverse events leads to underreporting and underestimation of the impact of adverse events. To overcome the gap between what clinicians report and what patients experience, interest grows in capturing adverse events directly from patients using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which may enhance its precision and comprehensiveness. Patient Reported Outcomes Safety Event Reporting (PROSPER) developed a guideline that refers to capturing adverse events in PROs, PRO-AEs-related data that can be valuable for monitoring and managing adverse events. Only the American Institute for Cancer Research has developed a PRO-CTCAE measurement tool for oncology patients. A universal scale for PRO-AEs that is widely used in patients discharged from hospital is lacking. Objective: To develop a set of generalized PRO-AEs for discharged patients and validate the reliability in a tertiary general hospital in China, followed by an empirical study in three hospitals of different grades to investigate the effect of health care team members' traits on the occurrence of adverse events in patients through a two-stage postdischarge follow-up with the inclusion of patient demographics, disease conditions and in-hospital treatment received using a random effects model, and a composite index method for risk adjustment. Methods: We used a mixed-method approach based on the 'phase I guideline for developing questionnaire modules' by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life group. Our approach included a comprehensive literature study and semistructured interviews with patients (n=30) and healthcare providers (n=26) to identify the items most relevant for patients. Subsequently, we used a modified Delphi procedure to reach consensus on the final selection of items. Results: The Delphi method has high expert positivity coefficients, Kendall's W coefficients showing good expert agreement, and pre-experimental findings showing good reliability of the scale to reflect adverse events. The empirical study is ongoing, and data analysis will be completed by September. Conclusion: There is a significant difference between the incidence and type of patient-reported in-hospital adverse events and the self-reported occurrence of common adverse events by healthcare professionals in the interviews. [Information specialists - barriers and facilitators to career progression and methodology research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473763/information-specialists-barriers-and-facilitators-to-career-progression-and-methodology-research) Background: Information specialists are an integral part of the evidence synthesis research team and at the heart (quite literally) of other research areas. Their skills are key to the rigorous and transparent conduct of systematic reviews and other research. Yet their role rarely provides opportunities for career progression or to undertake methodological research. Consequently, information specialists may change their career path to progress or remain in more junior positions. This raises not only questions of equity but also the problem of losing essential skills. Objectives: We are exploring the relationship between UK-based information specialists undertaking methodological research and career progression to more senior roles as well as looking at the barriers and facilitators to each. Methods: An online survey of UK-based information specialists (using Qualtrics software) will be conducted in March 2023 after piloting the survey across a small number of information specialists based at a range of institutions and settings. This will be followed by a workshop in May 2023 presenting the findings of the survey to attendees and eliciting strategies to improve both career progression and carrying out methodological research. Results: We are exploring ways in which current approaches to recognising research leadership and progression act as barriers for information specialists to progress to more senior roles. Results will be complete in May 2023. We will present the facilitators employed by survey respondents or shared by workshop attendees that have helped them with career progression and developing their research portfolio. These findings will also be shared with key stakeholders. Conclusions: Recommendations for further research will be covered including the hope to broaden out the survey and workshop to non-UK-based information retrieval specialists to have a wider picture of information specialists worldwide. This project is likely to pick up common themes that may be helpful to those in other applied methodology specialisms. These findings could be of interest to other stakeholders such as employers and methods research funders. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement, but improvements in information retrieval methods will help all evidence-based research and, by extension, healthcare consumers. [Identifying Candidate Harms for a Systematic Review](/colloquium-2023/session/1651132/identifying-candidate-harms-for-a-systematic-review) Background: In order for systematic reviews to be useful to decision makers such as patients, clinicians, and policy makers they need to consider both the benefits and potential harms of any intervention. Including all harms in a systematic review can be challenging and is not the preferred method for most systematic reviewers. Selecting the most appropriate harms to search for, however, can also be problematic. One potential source of information for patient important harms is social media. Objectives: To create a list of candidate harms from social media for inclusion in a Cochrane review on HPV vaccine. Methods: We searched on WebMD and Twitter for HPV vaccine drug reviews or Tweets posted between 2007 and 2021. Each drug review from WebMD was manually annotated for mentions of any adverse events experienced by the person posting or someone they cared for. For each Tweet we used automation to extract mentions of adverse events and normalised them to MedDRA codes. Results: Of the 133 reviews identified from WebMD, 124 reviews mentioned at least one adverse event experienced, with 343 mentioned in total. Our search on Twitter yielded 14,049 posts for adverse events experiences of which 10,271 the adverse event could be normalised to MedDRA preferred terms. We could then identify a list of the most common adverse events experienced such as injection site pain, headache, menstruation disturbances, and fatigue. Those adverse events experienced by teenagers (such as injection site pain and syncope) differed to those feared by parents (paralysis and promotion of sexual activity). There was also considerable fear of infertility - which was often thought to follow on from menstruation disturbances. Conclusion: Social media can be valuable in identifying potential harms that are experienced or feared by patients or caregivers. Social media data could be used alongside regulatory data, patient information sheets and input from clinicians and patient and public representatives to identify candidate harms for inclusion in Cochrane reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: An Independent Advisory Group (IAG), including consumers, advised on overall review production and content, and responded to community concerns. [Adherence to PRISMA 2020 statement in non-Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions. A meta-epidemiological study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473452/adherence-to-prisma-2020-statement-in-non-cochrane-systematic-reviews-of-interventions.-a-meta-epidemiological-study) Background: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of patients by integrating individual clinical expertise, the best available clinical evidence, and the individual patient's preferences. Systematic Reviews (SRs) synthesise all available evidence on a specific topic. However, the quality of SRs reporting varies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement is a guideline to ensure that SRs meet specific criteria for correct reporting. First published in 2009, PRISMA's statement has been updated in 2020 and comprises seven sections with 27 items, some of which include sub-items. The adherence to the PRISMA 2020 statement in non-Cochrane reviews of interventions is unknown. Objectives: To assess the adherence to the PRISMA 2020 statement in non-Cochrane SR of interventions. Methods: We conducted a Cross-sectional study. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE and included completed non-Cochrane SRs of any interventions published during 2022. We did not apply restrictions based on language or topic. For included reviews, we extracted information about the date of the protocol publication or register in any protocol repository (PROSPERO or similar), the date, country, and topic of the published SRs, as well as the citation of the PRISMA statement in the method section. Then, for each SRs we assessed the compliance of the 27 items of the PRISMA statement. Data were extracted by one reviewer and validated by the lead author. Results: We will show the complete results at the London Colloquium. Conclusions: We will show the conclusions at the London Colloquium. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [PROBAST+AI: assessing quality, risk of bias and applicability of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models based on AI or ML techniques](/colloquium-2023/session/1473863/probast+ai-assessing-quality-risk-of-bias-and-applicability-of-diagnostic-and-prognostic-prediction-models-based-on-ai-or-ml-techniques) Background: PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool) has been launched in January 2019. Since then, there has been much progress and literature on the methodology for prediction modelling in general and on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in this field in particular. Hence, it is timely to develop PROBAST+AI that applies to studies on developing and evaluating (validating) multivariable diagnostic and prognostic prediction models using any data analytical (statistical) AI or ML technique. Objectives: To develop and test PROBAST+AI, a quality and risk of bias assessment tool that applies to studies on developing and evaluating (validating) multivariable diagnostic and prognostic prediction models using any AI/ML data analytical technique. Methods: Using a Delphi process (at least 3 survey rounds) among a diverse and large (>200) group of key stakeholders and experts on prediction model and AI/ML, we identified the relevant items for PROBAST+AI. Participants gave their opinion on a large series of quality, risk of bias, and applicability domains and signalling questions, using a 5-Point Likert scale. Participants were also asked to add new suggestions using free-text boxes. Results: Currently, two Delphi rounds have been conducted, and a third is planned in the spring of 2023, followed, if deemed necessary, by a final consensus expert meeting. The results and PROBAST+AI will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: PROBAST+AI will provide key stakeholders in diagnostic and prognostic prediction models (including primary study authors, systematic reviewers, guideline developers, healthcare providers, prediction model developers, and patients), guidance on the relevant methodological aspects of diagnostic, and prognostic prediction model studies using any AI/ML data analytical technique. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Part of the PROBAST+AI Delphi and working group. Our project has methodological implications for systematic reviews. [Methods and guidance on conducting, reporting, publishing and appraising living systematic reviews: a scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473774/methods-and-guidance-on-conducting-reporting-publishing-and-appraising-living-systematic-reviews-a-scoping-review) Background: The living systematic review (LSR) approach is based on an ongoing surveillance of the evidence and continual updating. Currently available guidance documents address the conduct, reporting, publishing, and appraisal for systematic reviews (SRs), but are not tailored for LSRs per se, and they usually miss additional LSR-specific aspects. Objectives: In this scoping review, we aim to systematically collate methodological guidance literature on how to conduct, report, publish, and appraise the quality of LSRs and identify current gaps of guidance. Methods: Standard scoping review methodology from the Joanna Briggs Institute was used. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (OVID), until 28 August 2021. Two authors independently screened in Rayyan and extracted data using a pilot tested data extraction form. We extracted information according to our four pre-defined categories on (1) conducting, (2) reporting, (3) publishing and (4) appraising LSRs and mapped the data in visualizing overview tables. This review was part of a PRISMA extension for LSRs project (Kahale, 2022). Results: Of the 21 included papers, methodological guidance was found in 17 papers for conducting, 6 papers for reporting, 15 papers for publishing, and 2 papers for appraising LSRs. For each category, we are presenting all the identified LSR items, how often they have been reported on, and gaps of guidance evidence (Table 1). Some of the identified key items for (1) conducting LSRs, were identifying the rationale, screening tools or re-revaluating inclusion criteria and of (2) the original PRISMA checklist, were reporting the registration and protocol, title, or synthesis methods. For (3) publishing, some key items were on publication type and frequency or update trigger and for (4) appraising, were on appropriate use of bias assessment or reporting funding of included studies. Regarding gaps of evidence, we noted particularly that guidance on the PRISMA items reporting on the results, discussion, support and funding, and availability of data and material of a LSR is lacking. Conclusions: There is a need to make more guidance available on how to adequately report in LSRs and appraise their quality. Our findings were applied to inform and prepare a PRISMA extension for LSR. [Rapid evidence synthesis for COVID-19 international guidance: a World Health Organization commissioned Cochrane rapid scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473835/rapid-evidence-synthesis-for-covid-19-international-guidance-a-world-health-organization-commissioned-cochrane-rapid-scoping-review) Background: COVID-19, for some people, can result in admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To inform international guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a Cochrane scoping review to identify the type of evidence on care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The review was conducted rapidly over a three-week period in 2020. Objectives: To present the conduct and findings of this scoping review and describe how international collaborative activity helped produce quality evidence rapidly during COVID-19. Methods: The JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis (Chapter 11) and Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group were consulted in conducting the review. Studies of all designs that reported on the use of a care bundle in people with COVID-19, or a related condition, in the ICU were eligible for inclusion. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the WHO-ICTRP were searched in October 2020. The review outcomes included mortality, length of ICU stay, days of ventilation, and rates of adherence to the care bundle. As this was a scoping review, the methods did not involve assessing intervention effectiveness, risk of bias, or the certainty of the evidence. The extracted data were mapped and presented in tabular and graphic format. Results: We included 21 studies of variable designs, involving more than 2,000 patients. The care bundles involved diverse practices, including guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies), and prone positioning (7 studies). Fourteen studies reported on mortality, nine on days of ventilation, nine on length of ICU stay, and three reported on bundle adherence. Identified evidence gaps included a lack of care bundles for preparing patients to leave the ICU and for long-term COVID-19 effects. Conclusions: Information on care bundles specific to patients with COVID-19 in the ICU is limited. Good communication and collaboration ensured the timely conduct of this rapid scoping review in advance of WHO guideline development meetings. Taking methodologically sound decisions, and at what stages, were required to balance speed and quality in an era of rapid evidence need. [Publication bias - a cross-sectional study of randomised trials in Sub-saharan Africa: ongoing challenges of research waste](/colloquium-2023/session/1473552/publication-bias-a-cross-sectional-study-of-randomised-trials-in-sub-saharan-africa-ongoing-challenges-of-research-waste) Background: During this time of infodemics in health, we continue to find that registered trial results are unpublished. In other words, their results are unavailable to the public or healthcare consumers, which weakens available evidence and impedes evidence-based care. This is particularly of concern in places where resources are limited, such as in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where evidence about what works can have major implications for cost-effective care. Objectives: To determine the publication status of registered trials in SSA and to describe their characteristics and assess the association between publishing. Methods: Using meta-epidemiological cohort methods, we searched clinical trial registry platforms. We conducted a logistic analysis using the available trial data. Results: We found 14,203 trials registered in SSA since 2010. 20.5% of completed trials did not publish. More than 85% of trials were retrospectively registered. Our logistic regression model showed that trial phase was the only significant predictor of publishing. Odds ratio of publishing: phase-1 less likely to publish. Important to note, trialists had not updated their trial's status, results, or both on the trial registry. Conclusions: It is promising to see that only 79.5% of SSA trials are published, but we need to know how long it takes to publish the trials in journals. Furthermore, we found inconsistencies in reporting trial data on the trial registry platforms. The SSA region, with poor health systems and a substantial disease burden, relies on accurate trial data to address the challenges. Our next step is to conduct a survival analysis to assess the time to publication. Failure to publish trial results soon after completion is a disservice to informing patients, clinicians, and healthcare consumers that rely on up-to-date evidence they can trust. Research needs to be transparent. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement in this research. Given the interest in trial data since the COVID-19 pandemic, we welcome consumer feedback. [The Application of PROBAST and Prevalence of Unfavorable Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews of Prediction Models](/colloquium-2023/session/1473564/the-application-of-probast-and-prevalence-of-unfavorable-risk-of-bias-in-systematic-reviews-of-prediction-models) Background: The Prediction Model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) has been widely used for appraising prediction models in reviews since its publication. Objectives: The study aimed to explore the problems when using PROBAST and investigate the prevalence of unfavorable risk of bias (ROB) in existing reviews. Methods: Reviews in English were searched in PubMed and Web of Science up to April 17, 2022. Studies were eligible if they (1) used PROBAST; (2) included at least one model; and (3) reported ROB results. Two reviewers screened the search results independently, with disagreement resolved by discussion. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by another. The details of PROBAST were collected, including use of the CHARMS Checklist, number of ROB evaluators, method of ROB evaluating, inter-rater agreement, and the reporting levels of PROBAST results. Number and percentage were calculated for different ROB of each domain and signaling question in all prediction models. Results: A total of 201 reviews and 9,652 prediction models were included in the study. When using PROBAST, about 103 (51.2%) reviews did not use CHARMS checklist. About 84 (41.8%) and 81 (40.3%) reviews did not report the number of ROB evaluators and ROB evaluating methods. Of 192 reviews possibly assessing ROB by double check, about 182 (94.8%) did not report results of inter-rater agreement. For reporting levels of PROBAST results, about 16 (8.0%) reviews did not report ROB of individual prediction models. Within the rest 185 reviews, 151 (81.6%) reviews did not report ROB on signaling question level. For the results of PROBAST, the highest percentages of unfavorable ROB were reported in analysis domain (high: 74.6% and unclear: 10.4%) (Figure 1). Furthermore, the signaling questions about missing data handle and model fitting reported the highest percentage of unfavorable ROB (high: 52.6% and unclear: 39.6%) (Figure 2), respectively. Conclusions: Inappropriate usage and inadequate reporting remained in many reviews when using PROBAST, and high prevalence of unfavorable ROB was observed. In the future, researchers should standardize the use and reporting of PROBAST and improve the quality of prediction models when they develop, validate, or update prediction models. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. [Lessons learnt from conducting a living systematic review and network meta-analysis for covid-19: maximizing efficiency and access of results](/colloquium-2023/session/1473724/lessons-learnt-from-conducting-a-living-systematic-review-and-network-meta-analysis-for-covid-19-maximizing-efficiency-and-access-of-results) Background: Traditional systematic reviews summarize the evidence relevant to a topic for a specific time frame. Living systematic reviews overcome this limitation by conducting ongoing searching and screening. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a living systematic review and network meta-analysis (SRNMA) was crucial to address the rapidly changing evidence base to identify effective interventions. However, living SRNMAs are a large undertaking requiring key considerations. Objectives: To describe the process of conducting a living SRNMA including key lessons learnt from challenges encountered. Methods: The living SRNMA is organized in four main subteams, each with their own team leads who, along with the principal investigators, form the core team. Members of the core team reflected on their experiences through ongoing discussions with each other regarding the strengths and weaknesses of our review process. Based on the experiences shared, we identified any common, overarching themes until we reached consensus on what we considered to be key lessons learnt to date. We will share specific examples highlighting how this lesson is applied in practice. Results: To date, four key themes emerged from our discussions: (1) Leverage technology to increase efficiency in stages such as study identification and data analysis. (2) Maintain detailed records to ensure the large number of included studies and data remain organized. (3) Consider alternative dissemination strategies such as a website to streamline access to results and overcome publication delays. (4) Utilize the ongoing nature of such a large project as a chance to provide multiple learning opportunities for team members. Challenges encountered include turnover of team members and linkage of multiple records associated with the same trial. We will present the rationale and examples for each of these lessons. Conclusions: Living systematic reviews ensure that evidence syntheses remain current and reflective of the most recent, relevant evidence. Such evidence syntheses can be crucial to decision-making in fields with rapidly growing and changing evidence bases. Conducting such reviews requires significant time, planning, and resources; we hope that sharing these four lessons may assist reviewers undertaking such a project. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient partners were not involved. [REH-COVER (Rehabilitation - COVID-19 Evidence-based Response) action: a \"rapid\" and \"living\" systematic review methodology](/colloquium-2023/session/1473776/reh-cover-rehabilitation---covid-19-evidence-based-response-action-a-\"rapid\"-and-\"living\"-systematic-review-methodology) Background: Because of the urgent need for rehabilitation by people with COVID-19, Cochrane Rehabilitation merged the concepts of \"rapid\" and \"living\" systematic reviews and designed an innovative and dynamic methodological approach for evidence synthesis during health emergencies. Objectives: This study presents the methodological innovation of \"rapid living\" systematic reviews and our experience to discuss its strengths and weaknesses. Methods: The two concepts, \"rapid\" and \"living\", were introduced to keep pace with the rapid and constant growth of evidence, and they can be particularly useful in rapidly evolving research fields. The pandemic brings the two challenges together, i.e., the need for rapid knowledge synthesis as well as the need for constant updates. We applied these two concepts to conduct rapid living systematic reviews on COVID-19 to keep the rehabilitation stakeholders rapidly and constantly updated from March 2020 to February 2022. Results: Three main editions (March 2020, June 2020, and June 2021) and 13 monthly or bimonthly updates have been published. Each edition represented an upgrade in methodology because of the growing quality and improved design of current evidence; the first included all study designs, the second excluded expert opinions and papers not reporting patients' data, and the third excluded case reports and case series. Starting from 36,327 records overall, a total of 615 papers have finally been included. The most frequent study designs were cross-sectional studies, case reports and case series, and cohort studies. Table 1 reports the distribution of included papers according to the study design. Conclusions: Our methodology, combining the concepts of \"rapid\" and \"living\", can be defined as \"a dynamic method of knowledge synthesis that allows for the constant updating of new emerging evidence and refinement of its methodological\". This method accelerates the conduct of systematic reviews and allows for an adaptation of methodology based on the quality of the evidence. Similarly, it may be helpful when a rapid answer is needed to make informed decisions. The current pandemic has shown that modern medical science has the ability to produce new knowledge at an unexpected rate. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Time to publication for results of clinical trials: The definitive systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473463/time-to-publication-for-results-of-clinical-trials-the-definitive-systematic-review) Background: We have updated and combined two Cochrane methodology reviews, \"Time to publication for results of clinical trials\" (searches done in 2005) and \"Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results\" (2007). Since their publication, the much greater use of trial registries has allowed researchers to study publication bias in greater depth. We now summarise and present the up-to-date picture with regard to publication bias. This topic is relevant and important to clinicians and patients as nonpublished evidence is wasted evidence. Objectives: To determine publication rate and time to publication of clinical trials. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Epistemonikos and the Cochrane Methodology Register from 2005 to 29 April 2021 for reports analysing any aspect of the publication rate or time to publication for clinical trials. We excluded reports that solely examined cohorts of published papers or solely used results made available on registry portals as evidence of publication. Two authors independently screened all studies, read full texts and completed risk of bias assessments and data extraction. The following outcomes were collected: Primary: (1) proportion of studies that are published and (2) time to publication of published studies; Secondary: relationships between positive results, sample size, multicentre and type of funding and publication and time to publication. Results and Conclusions: The original Cochrane Methodology Reviews included a total of five studies (published between 1992 and 1998). We have added a further 156 studies with this update. We will present results from the 161 studies now included in this review and discuss the implications for those using clinical trials to make decisions about health and social care. [Risk of bias and applicability assessments for overall prognosis studies (RoB-OPS): Current development status](/colloquium-2023/session/1473563/risk-of-bias-and-applicability-assessments-for-overall-prognosis-studies-rob-ops-current-development-status) Background: Overall prognosis (OP) refers to the average course or future outcomes of individuals with a particular exposure or a health-related condition. OP estimates are important tools for individualizing the estimation of benefits and harms of interventions, developing clinical practice recommendations, and guiding future research. To estimate OP, systematic reviews summarize prognosis outcome estimates extracted from various primary studies or data sources. Although the assessment of risk of bias (RoB) is an integral part of any systematic review, there is no specific tool for assessing RoB in OP estimates reported by primary studies. Objectives: We aim to develop a tool to assess the RoB in OP estimates obtained from primary studies. Methods: A steering group (StG) of eight experts on prognosis, RoB assessment, and systematic reviews developed a first draft based on available tools and refined it through iterative discussions. We obtained external feedback by surveying members of stakeholder groups. The StG is currently considering the survey feedback through iterative discussions. Results: We decided to separate the tool into assessments for applicability and RoB. We address the domains \"participants,\" \"outcome,\" \"analysis,\" and \"selective reporting\" for RoB and the domains \"participants' setting\" and \"outcome\" for applicability. We introduce each block of related questions with an elaboration box, followed by factually phrased signaling questions that can be answered with \"no,\" \"probably no,\" and \"not sufficient information.\" For the RoB assessment, the participants domain aims at detecting whether the participant sample of an OP study was selective by covering recruitment strategy and inappropriate exclusions of participants. The second domain assesses whether the outcome was defined and measured appropriately and whether the frequency of outcome assessment was appropriate. The analysis domain aims to detect flaws regarding attrition and analytical methods, and the last domain covers selective reporting. Conclusions: Manifold discussions between StG members reflect the complexity of distinguishing between RoB and applicability. Currently, we are finalizing the remaining domains, the creation of flow charts to facilitate domain-based decision-making, piloting of the tool, and external consolidation via subsequent surveys. [Living Reviews: Practical Considerations for Adapting Scope and Communicating Evolving Evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1473693/living-reviews-practical-considerations-for-adapting-scope-and-communicating-evolving-evidence) Background: To maintain reliability and trustworthiness, evidence-based policies and healthcare recommendations need to keep up with emerging scientific evidence. Such up-to-date information can greatly benefit healthcare decision-makers and the patients they serve. Despite their proliferation, standards to conduct living reviews are still evolving. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has conducted a number of \"living\" reviews to evaluate and update the evidence base on interventions for chronic pain. Objectives: To describe the methods used, challenges encountered, and strategies developed to maintain living reviews and present the evolving evidence. These include 1) adapting or expanding review scope; 2) utilizing input from stakeholders; 3) optimizing frequency and format of living updates; and 4) using data visualization and innovative methods to complement the living review reports. Methods: The composition of the original multidisciplinary technical expert panel (TEP) was assessed during the living review update; new members were added and convened to inform methodologic issues and reevaluate scope. In addition, we iteratively piloted various formats to present new evidence identified in the living review and the overall state of the science that evolved in recurring surveillance reports. We also collaborated with our agency's web team to develop optimal displays for the reports, with the goal of upholding transparency while enhancing user experience. Results: The literature search results signaled that new interventions might be important to include, resulting in the recruitment of new TEP members with appropriate expertise. Literature scans and TEP discussions indicated that an expansion of scope with respect to patient population and outcomes should be considered. Each quarterly surveillance report was crafted to be \"stand-alone,\" providing sufficient detail for first-time readers. We also created a summary table to describe new findings in the context of previous conclusions, with italics and bolding of text to distinguish them from prior surveillance results. Conclusions: Our experience illustrates the value of periodically reassessing the scope of living systematic reviews to ensure that they remain useful. Presentation of frequent updates is challenging, but data visualization techniques can enhance communication of results with patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers. [Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre: a bespoke evidence review process engaging stakeholders for supporting time-sensitive policy and clinical decision-making](/colloquium-2023/session/1473583/wales-covid-19-evidence-centre-a-bespoke-evidence-review-process-engaging-stakeholders-for-supporting-time-sensitive-policy-and-clinical-decision-making) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic presented policymakers with time-sensitive decision problems within an ever-changing environment and rapidly increasing volume of research. The Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre (WCEC), a collaboration of systematic review and economic evaluation expert groups, was established to shape the Welsh government's response. WCEC developed a flexible evidence review process to respond to decision-makers' needs within days, weeks, or months. The approach used, as well as the methodological shortcuts applied, was tailored depending on decision-maker needs, timeframe, and volume and type of evidence. The phased approach generated three products: Rapid Evidence Summary (RES), Rapid Evidence Map (REM), and Rapid Review (RR). Decision-maker, stakeholder, and public/patient engagement was integral from the onset. A core management team worked closely with partner groups, undertaking evidence reviews. Three key rapid review guidance publications informed a Best Practice Framework to support reviewers in their work. Objectives: To reflect on our experience of implementing the WCEC review process and identify key learning points. To ascertain whether our reviews, mainly completed within 2 months, comply with best-practice guidance, and methods were aligned across review groups. Methods: We compared methods used in our RRs and REMs with the Best Practice Framework recommendations. Findings, and key learning points, were discussed at a meeting of the core management team and collaborating review group members. Results: In 2021-2022, 26 RRs and 5 REMs were completed. Our methods aligned with or exceeded most recommendations, particularly developing review questions, preliminary scoping work, conducting searches, critical appraisal, narrative synthesis, and report production. However, our review protocols were not registered; study selection, data extraction, and quality appraisal were generally conducted by a single reviewer; and the assessment of confidence in the evidence was generally subjective. Key learning points were identified, which will be presented. Notably, study selection, quality appraisal, and data extraction should include a verification sample of >20%. The strong stakeholder involvement was considered a particular strength, as was sharing knowledge between reviewers. Conclusions: Our review process enabled us to successfully address a high volume of review questions swiftly, using a transparent and tailored approach. The findings will inform future development. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Are there missing randomized trials in Cochrane systematic reviews and what is their impact on the results?: A methodological study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473862/are-there-missing-randomized-trials-in-cochrane-systematic-reviews-and-what-is-their-impact-on-the-results-a-methodological-study) Background: Owing to reproducibility, reliability and exhaustiveness, systematic reviews (SRs) are considered the best type of evidence synthesis to inform decision-making, which is why the development of SRs increases every year. Because of this, it is possible to find several SRs answering the same question. Unfortunately, the primary studies identified and the results presented by reviews answering the same question may differ between them and mislead the decision-making process. Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) are considered high quality because of their methodological rigor. In this study, we want to evaluate if CSRs miss any relevant primary studies. Moreover, we want to know if including any missed studies could have modified the results. Objectives: To evaluate if CSRs incorporate all randomized trials and the impact of missing studies on the results, specifically on key messages, certainty of the evidence and magnitude of effects on their results. Methods: We will include a random sample of 150 CSRs published last year (2022) that addressed an intervention question. To create a reference standard composed of all the randomized trials addressing the question of each CSR, we will also search for all other non-CSR that answered the same question and create a list of all eligible trials in all reviews. We will use this reference standard to determine if CSRs missed any studies. Then, among CSRs that missed studies, we will incorporate the missing studies to the meta-analyses and evaluate their impact on the results of the CSRs, specifically key messages (according to GRADE Guideline methodology 26), certainty of evidence and magnitude of effects. Results: This project is in progress. We will describe how many CSRs missed studies, how many studies were missed and how many CSRs modified their conclusions in key messages, certainty of evidence and magnitude of effects. Conclusions: The results of this project could impact the processes of developing evidence synthesis to ensure the completeness of CSRs. In addition, we could validate the reliability in CSR for guideline development and decision-making. Optimizing and improving evidence synthesis processes allows for better informing stakeholders, including patients. [Landscape of methodological quality assessment tools for diagnosis and prognosis research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473819/landscape-of-methodological-quality-assessment-tools-for-diagnosis-and-prognosis-research) Background: Multiple tools for assessing the methodological quality of diagnosis and prognosis research exist, with similar scope and overlap in quality items. Which tool should be used for a particular diagnostic or prognostic study type or design is not always clear. This may generate confusion among systematic reviewers and those using such tools for informing the design of a primary study. Objectives: To provide an overview of existing quality assessment tools for diagnosis and prognosis research, along with guidance on which characteristics of a tool to consider when choosing one. Methods: We will search for eligible tools in MEDLINE, repositories of recommended tools by health institutions, and by contacting methods experts and reference list searching. Eligible tools should be intended for diagnosis or prognosis research, i.e., studies aiming to predict the presence of a certain diagnosis or a future event, and help to assess risk of bias, applicability, or other aspects related to study quality. Tools focusing exclusively on reporting quality will be excluded. Eligible tools may be intended for several study designs, including test accuracy studies, prognostic factor studies, and model validation studies. We will narratively describe the tools' scope and intended use and examine differences in their structure, items, and rating system. These results will be used to develop guidance that will highlight differences between the various diagnosis and prognosis study types and which characteristics one could consider when choosing a quality tool for a particular purpose. Results: The results of this study will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: This overview and guidance may help in the selection of a tool that fits the intended purpose, possibly improving the design of primary studies and, in the case of systematic reviews, leading to more informative quality ratings. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [The Australian National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce - the impact of living guidelines in a critical area of clinical need](/colloquium-2023/session/1473629/the-australian-national-covid-19-clinical-evidence-taskforce---the-impact-of-living-guidelines-in-a-critical-area-of-clinical-need) Background: The emergence of COVID-19 presented a significant challenge for guideline developers. Owing to the unprecedented push by investigators to rapidly plan, conduct and publish results of clinical studies, traditional methods of guideline production were incapable of dealing with such high rates of evidence generation. On 23 March 2020, the Australian National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce was established to rapidly identify and synthesise evidence specific to the treatment and care of people with COVID-19. Objectives: With representation from 35 peak national healthcare organisations, the impetus behind establishing the Taskforce was to avoid the development of multiple potentially conflicting guidelines by providing a single source of guidance for Australian clinicians treating individuals with COVID-19. The objective is to ensure clinicians have easy access to up-to-date evidence-based recommendations, promoting the best possible care for patients with COVID-19. Methods: By leveraging methods developed by the Australian Living Evidence Consortium, the Taskforce adopted a dynamic and reactive process of rapidly identifying and translating relevant evidence into actionable recommendations. The cycle involves daily searching and screening, data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment of relevant clinical trials, facilitated by key technology enablers (Covidence, RevMan, and MAGICapp). Recommendations are developed by an expert panel, discussed and ratified by the guideline leadership group and steering committee, and published online. Results: Since March 2020 and with the help of more than 200 contributors across eight topic-specific panels, the Taskforce have developed 180 recommendations and 23 flow charts across 128 guideline updates, which have attracted more than 600,000 unique website users globally. Within the first 12 months, as few as 13 days transpired from publication of a clinical study to its inclusion in an updated version of the guideline (median 20 days for high-priority topics). Conclusions: In the 3 years since its inception, the Taskforce has become an exemplar of how high-throughput living guidelines can become a critical part of the healthcare landscape, having established trust among Australian clinicians, garnered significant media attention, impacted Government policy, and catalysed collaborations with several national and international guideline development bodies, such as the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [Evolving rapid review methods to meet the needs of evidence-informed decision-making: National treatment guidelines for COVID-19 in South Africa](/colloquium-2023/session/1473485/evolving-rapid-review-methods-to-meet-the-needs-of-evidence-informed-decision-making-national-treatment-guidelines-for-covid-19-in-south-africa) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for access to high-quality evidence to inform management and medicine procurement decisions in South Africa (SA). Through collaboration between the National Department of Health (NDoH), members of the National Essential Medicines List Ministerial Advisory Committee (NEML-MAC) on COVID-19 Therapeutics, and the SA GRADE Network, co-led by Cochrane SA and the Centre for Evidence-Based Health, rapid evidence reviews were produced to inform the SA National Essential Medicines List and Guidelines for COVID-19 management. Objectives: To describe the efficient and timely evidence-informed decision-making processes for COVID-19 therapeutics in SA. Methods: The NDoH, NEML-MAC on COVID-19 Therapeutics, and SA GRADE Network developed a methodology for conducting rapid reviews to meet the needs of policy makers. The approach was based on Cochrane's rapid review methodology and adapted to meet the evidence requirements in SA (Prospero registration: CRD42021286710). The goal was to balance urgency with rigorous methods. The committee prioritised review questions and review teams (including committee and SA GRADE members), and conducted reviews. Reviewers searched for available evidence, appraised evidence quality, and summarised the key findings. Members of the NEML-MAC on COVID-19 Therapeutics then made recommendations using the GRADE Evidence to Decision (EtD) Framework. Results: Recommendations for 33 molecules reviewed for potential treatment or prevention of COVID-19 have been issued. Sixty-nine rapid review reports (including updates reflecting emerging evidence) have been completed. Methods have been developed for credible, transparent reporting and continue to evolve. Duplication is minimised by partnering with global evidence producers (like Cochrane France and the COVID-nma Living review), adding contextual evidence for local decisions. All reviews and recommendations are made public on the NDoH COVID-19 Online Resource and News Portal (health.gov.za/COVID-19-rapid-reviews). Conclusions: Rapid evidence-informed decisions are possible by undertaking and using rapid review methods, with iterative real-time collaboration, and accessing available local and global resources, such as living reviews. It is important to keep a consultative process alive despite the rapidness of the review to make sure that the reviews meet the needs of the people using them for national decision-making.

[Diagnostic test accuracy network meta-analysis methods: A scoping review and empirical assessment](/colloquium-2023/session/1473645/diagnostic-test-accuracy-network-meta-analysis-methods-a-scoping-review-and-empirical-assessment) Background: The first and crucial step in the intervention selection process is the diagnosis of the patient's condition. In healthcare settings, diagnostic tests are commonly used to confirm or exclude a target condition (disease). Most diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analyses evaluate the accuracy of a single index test at a time; however, there may be several index tests available for a target condition. Comparative accuracy of index tests for a certain target condition is important for decision-making. To compare the accuracy of multiple index tests, several comparative meta-analysis models have been developed over the past few years. Objectives: To present and discuss methods that have been recognized in our recent scoping review for comparing at least three index tests coming from a variety of studies within a single framework. Methods: We conducted a scoping review up until March 3, 2021, to identify methodological and application papers reporting a model developed specifically for diagnostic test accuracy network meta-analysis (DTA-NMA) or a hierarchical meta-regression method for comparing at least three index tests. We reviewed and summarized the characteristics of the collected methods and the application papers and compared DTA-NMA and hierarchical meta-regression methods empirically, using the collected application papers. Results: Publications of comparative meta-analyses with three or more index tests have increased steeply over the past few years. Our research resulted in 49 articles plus 1 companion report: 9 methodological (describing 11 different DTA-NMA models) and 40 application papers of DTA-NMAs or meta-regression. Most of the application papers employed a meta-regression model. In the empirical assessment, meta-regression produced on average higher estimates of specificity than DTA-NMA models while sensitivity estimates were comparable. Conclusions: DTA-NMA models may yield different results. The inclusion of different thresholds for test positivity, design differences, and software familiarity will determine which DTA-NMA model is appropriate. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: With a good and accurate diagnosis, patients have the best chance of achieving a positive health outcome based on clinical decisions made after understanding their health issue correctly. [How often should \"living\" systematic reviews be updated? A cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473817/how-often-should-\"living\"-systematic-reviews-be-updated-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Living systematic reviews play an important role in the synthesis of evidence, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need for timely updates of clinical evidence is more urgent. However, the frequency of living systematic reviews' updates is not well known. Objectives: To investigate the reporting rate and time of living systematic reviews' updated frequency. Methods: Our study searched PubMed and Google for living systematic reviews from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2023, using the keywords \"living systematic reviews\" and \"living reviews.\" We extracted and analyzed publication country, year, disease, and update frequency reports of the included reviews. Results: We included 164 living systematic reviews; 26.22% of the reviews were published in 2020, 46.95% were published in 2021, and 26.83% were published in 2022. The country with the highest number of included reviews was the United Kingdom, with 21.34%. The most common disease was COVID-19, with 81.10%. The number of reviews that reported updates was 120, accounting for 73.17%, but only 49 reviews reported the specific update frequency, accounting for 29.88%, of which the shortest time of update frequency was 1 week, the longest was 18-24 months, and the median was 3 months. Conclusions: Living systematic reviews have a low reporting rate for their update time and a large variation in update frequency. It suggests that researchers need to further focus on living systematic review methods in the future. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Supporting COVID-19 Decision Making through Rapid Evidence Syntheses and Products](/colloquium-2023/session/1473492/supporting-covid-19-decision-making-through-rapid-evidence-syntheses-and-products) Background: The explosion of COVID-19 research literature resulted in public health decision-makers' need for high-quality synthesized evidence to inform policy and practice decisions. The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) responded quickly to the volume and variable quality of COVID-19 literature by creating the Rapid Evidence Service (RES) and the Repository of Public Health Evidence Syntheses (the Repository). Objectives: The RES and the Repository support decision makers to engage in evidence-informed decision making and increase awareness of synthesized evidence on COVID-19. Methods: The RES process includes refining the research question, developing a search strategy, appraisal of included studies, and writing a high-level synthesis of all findings, including identification of knowledge gaps. It includes rapid reviews completed by the NCCMT that synthesize evidence on priority COVID-19 public health topics for public health decision-makers. The Repository was created to reduce duplication in syntheses being conducted to inform the COVID-19 public health response. Dissemination of the RES and the Repository is done through the NCCMT website, social media, and monthly newsletters. Results: Since May 2020, 88 rapid reviews on 46 unique topics addressing priority public health questions have been completed. The Repository has received over 542 review submissions from public health organizations and research groups across Canada and internationally. Our process has evolved to ensure feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency as the pandemic and the evidence has evolved. More recently, the RES has been expanded to address topics beyond COVID-19 to support public health recovery. Conclusions: The rapid review process is a real-world example of how evidence can be mobilized quickly in response to decision-makers' needs, and users have indicated the RES and the Repository are invaluable resources. By expanding the RES and the Repository to address public health priority areas beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, these resources can continue to be used by public health decision-makers at all levels of governance. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The RES has answered questions from and worked collaboratively with regional, national, and international organizations. The Repository allows public health organizations across jurisdictions to share resources for synthesizing evidence on COVID-19 to support response efforts. [Reasons for missing evidence in rehabilitation meta-analyses: a cross-sectional meta-research study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473769/reasons-for-missing-evidence-in-rehabilitation-meta-analyses-a-cross-sectional-meta-research-study) Background: The current best evidence is usually informed by systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The pooled treatment effect estimates of meta-analyses can be biased when RCTs are omitted from the meta-analyses because of outcome-related reasons (i.e., missing evidence). Objectives: We aimed to assess the prevalence of RCTs omitted from meta-analysis of SRs in the rehabilitation field and the reasons for missing evidence. Methods: This is a cross-sectional meta-research study, prospectively registered (https://osf.io/p25zy/). We started from a sample of 827 SRs identified by Gianola et al. We defined the index meta-analysis (IMA) as the meta-analysis of the primary outcome of the main comparison or, if not clearly identified, the first one reported in the results section. Starting from all studies eligible for the chosen comparison, we identified all RCTs omitted (i.e., not included) from the IMA. The reasons for RCT omission were assessed using and adapting the classification of Yordanov et al (Table 1). Results: Starting from a cohort of 827 SRs, 131 IMAs comprising a total of 1,761 eligible RCTs were selected. Out of all eligible studies, 717 RCTs (40,7%) were omitted from 100 IMAs: for 38.8% the reason was not clear due to lack of a registered protocol (i.e., \"Unable to distinguish between selective reporting and inadequate planning\"), 17% due to \"inadequate or alternative or missing planning\", 15,1% were justified not to be included, 8,4% due to \"incomplete reporting\", 5,2% due to other situations, 3,3% due to \"selective reporting\", and 11,7% were not assessed being non-English trials or trials with full text not available (Table 2). Conclusions: Outcome non-reporting bias (i.e., \"selective reporting\" and \"incomplete reporting\") and lack of guidance on the outcomes to be measured as a minimum (i.e., \"inadequate or alternative or missing planning\") represent important reasons for missing evidence. Similarly, lack of trial registration prevents the identification of the reason for missing evidence. Consequently, better reporting, prospective protocol registration, and the definition of core outcome sets for every clinical condition are needed to avoid research waste and improve conducting of RCTs in the rehabilitation field. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Pooling biological specimens in primary studies compromises evidence generation in test accuracy reviews: a case study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473457/pooling-biological-specimens-in-primary-studies-compromises-evidence-generation-in-test-accuracy-reviews-a-case-study) Background: Pooling multiple biological specimens collected at different time points to increase the quantity and quality of the sample from an individual for a single test may improve the diagnostic yield of an index test (test being evaluated). However, this may overestimate test accuracy in primary studies, as well as in meta-analysis, and lead to a high concern about applicability if only a single sample will be tested in clinical practice. Objectives: To explore the frequency of pooling biological specimens in primary studies and the effect on estimates of test accuracy using two Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy reviews assessing rapid diagnostic tests for tuberculosis. Methods: We contacted the authors of included studies for additional data when the papers reported results were available for pooled and single (unpooled) samples from individuals. We performed meta-analysis separately for the two groups in each review when possible. We also examined individual studies and compared estimates of sensitivity and specificity if a study included results from both pooled and unpooled samples. Results: Contrary to the diagnostic algorithm of tuberculosis programs or routine clinical practice, four of the eight included studies used pooled sputum samples from one or more patient cohorts. Larger studies tended to pool sputum (Pillay 2022; Inbaraj 2023). One of the four studies assessed the Truenat MTB assay for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis in two cohorts using pooled sputum in one and unpooled sputum in the other cohort (Figure 1) (Gomathi 2020). From this within-study comparison of unpooled versus pooled, the differences in sensitivity (-11 percentage points, 95% CI -15 to -6.2) and specificity (15 percentage points, 95% CI 10 to 20) were large. Analyses are ongoing and further results will be available at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Test accuracy studies should ensure that samples used for evaluating tests reflect how the tests will be performed in clinical practice to ensure robust estimates of real-world performance and applicability. This will also reduce research waste. [Living Evidence to Inform Health Decisions Framework (LE-IHD): A practical interactive framework based tool to guide the incorporation of Living Evidence in the development of knowledge transfer products](/colloquium-2023/session/1648514/living-evidence-to-inform-health-decisions-framework-le-ihd-a-practical-interactive-framework-based-tool-to-guide-the-incorporation-of-living-evidence-in-the-development-of-knowledge-transfer-products) Background: Knowledge transfer [KT] products used to inform health decisions should be based on the most current evidence. A framework based practical tool for incorporating the Living Evidence [LE] model can address this need. Objectives: To define a framework to guide the incorporation of the LE model in the development of KT products. To develop a framework-based practical tool to support the LE synthesis planning, conduction, evidence monitoring, and reporting. Methods:The definition of the framework followed an iterative process. Complementary steps were: 1. Systematic review of methodological articles; 2. Two brainstorming Expert consultation; 5.User testing; 6.Refining the framework and development of final version; 7. Framework validation in a pilot study. Results: Twelve methodological articles were identified and used to generate a checklist of key aspects to be included in the guidance framework . The list was distributed among the core team prior to brainstorming meetings. The core team developed the preliminary framework draft that underwent testing among 10 potential users from Cochrane centers and HTA agencies; concurrently, it was presented to experts advisors working on LE. The comments and suggestions collected from users and experts were used to redefine the framework. Its final version was structured into four sections according to the time they are applied during the evidence synthesis process, with a set of guidance questions in each section. This version was tested and evaluated by working groups of HTA agencies and guideline-developers for the planning and conduction of LE synthesis of relevant questions for real-life decision-making. The framework assessment included a survey and in-depth interviews with study participants. Results were taken into account for developing the web-based interactive tool (LE-IHD framework) and its handbook which underwent final experts review prior to launching the tool for its use. Available at: https://livingevidenceframework.com/en/platform/ Conclusions: The process followed for the framework development, the participation of LE experts and its validation among key potential users experts, allow us to conclude that this tool has the desired quality to support the synthesis of LE and guide its way to inform health decisions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [Finding best available evidence in a time of crisis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473408/finding-best-available-evidence-in-a-time-of-crisis) Background: Systematic reviews represent a robust methodology to synthesize research evidence. However, they can be time- and resource-intensive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid reviews have been important to produce evidence to inform policy and clinical practice in a timely manner. However, rapid reviews may be susceptible to bias through using methodological shortcuts or not adhering to a specified methodology. Objectives: To report on a rapid review conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic on how to best support large numbers of bereaved people, to demonstrate how evidence can be gathered at pace and impact quickly on palliative care practice and policy. Methods: We followed Palliative Care Evidence Review Service (PaCERS) methodology [1], developed to conduct rapid reviews requested by clinical services, with a narrative synthesis. A systematic search was conducted on four databases and supplementary search methods were employed to identify additional papers. Two reviewers carried out study selection independently. Data extraction and quality assessment was completed independently by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Results: Six studies were included, reporting on system responses to man-made disasters and natural disasters. A narrative synthesis approach was used to synthesize the data from the available evidence. The review was completed in 10 weeks and rapidly published in a peer-reviewed journal adding to the emergent COVID-19 literature. The review informed the successful funding application and project design for a UK-wide study and was used in developing a national bereavement framework for Wales. Conclusions: Rapid, trustworthy evidence syntheses to inform policy and clinical practice are achievable. Our review highlighted common features of effective bereavement service delivery during and beyond a pandemic, which will have a long-lasting impact. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Even though consumers were not involved in this study, they were part of the review advisory group in our rapid review Programme. 1. Mann, M., Woodward, A., Nelson, A., Byrne, A. (2019). Palliative Care Evidence Review Service (PaCERS): a knowledge transfer partnership. Health Research Policy and Systems, 17(1), 100. doi:10.1186/s12961-019-0504-4 [Stakeholder engagement in a rapid review to determine the effectiveness of interventions to attract, recruit and retain social care workers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473711/stakeholder-engagement-in-a-rapid-review-to-determine-the-effectiveness-of-interventions-to-attract-recruit-and-retain-social-care-workers) Background: The UK social care sector is under increased pressure to combat workforce shortages. With recruitment of professionals impacted by Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis, social care needs innovations to attract, recruit and retain staff. Objectives: To work in partnership with stakeholders to determine the effectiveness of interventions to help attract, recruit and retain social workers and social care workers within the UK context. Methods: This rapid review (RR) was conducted by the Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre (WCEC). The question was submitted by Social Care Wales, and at an initial stakeholder meeting, they provided a strategic overview of the social care situation in Wales outlining the need for the review. A search of available UK literature (including grey literature) from 2017 to 2022 was conducted within 1 week. At the second stakeholder meeting, the research team presented findings from this, to determine the focus of the RR. Results: This RR and subsequent publication was coproduced with the stakeholders over 2 months. Effective interventions to help with the attraction, recruitment and retention of social workers included practice learning, fast-track graduate programmes and apprenticeships. For the wider social care workforce, effective interventions included pre-employment training, national recruitment campaigns, care work ambassadors and values-based recruitment. Weaknesses in the primary studies included lack of follow-up and objective evaluations of the interventions. Conclusions: The Social Care Wales team used the RR to inform its programme of work for developing the social care workforce across Wales. On stakeholders' recommendation, findings were presented to the Directors of Social Services, workforce leads, managers and staff within Wales through the Association of Directors of Social Services. Impact was achieved through the inclusion of the review in the monthly summary of advice to the Technical Advisory Cell of Welsh Government, and it was used to inform the Health and Social Care Committee, House of Commons enquiry 'Workforce: recruitment, training and retention in health and social care'. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The stakeholders included members of the WCEC public partnership group and representatives from Social Care Wales who are the regulator for the social care workforce in Wales. [Identifying Candidate Harms for a Systematic Review](/colloquium-2023/session/1652042/identifying-candidate-harms-for-a-systematic-review) Background: In order for systematic reviews to be useful to decision makers such as patients, clinicians, and policy makers they need to consider both the benefits and potential harms of any intervention. Including all harms in a systematic review can be challenging and is not the preferred method for most systematic reviewers. Selecting the most appropriate harms to search for, however, can also be problematic. One potential source of information for patient important harms is social media. Objectives: To create a list of candidate harms from social media for inclusion in a Cochrane review on HPV vaccine. Methods: We searched on WebMD and Twitter for HPV vaccine drug reviews or Tweets posted between 2007 and 2021. Each drug review from WebMD was manually annotated for mentions of any adverse events experienced by the person posting or someone they cared for. For each Tweet we used automation to extract mentions of adverse events and normalised them to MedDRA codes. Results: Of the 133 reviews identified from WebMD, 124 reviews mentioned at least one adverse event experienced, with 343 mentioned in total. Our search on Twitter yielded 14,049 posts for adverse events experiences of which 10,271 the adverse event could be normalised to MedDRA preferred terms. We could then identify a list of the most common adverse events experienced such as injection site pain, headache, menstruation disturbances, and fatigue. Those adverse events experienced by teenagers (such as injection site pain and syncope) differed to those feared by parents (paralysis and promotion of sexual activity). There was also considerable fear of infertility - which was often thought to follow on from menstruation disturbances. Conclusion: Social media can be valuable in identifying potential harms that are experienced or feared by patients or caregivers. Social media data could be used alongside regulatory data, patient information sheets and input from clinicians and patient and public representatives to identify candidate harms for inclusion in Cochrane reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: An Independent Advisory Group (IAG), including consumers, advised on overall review production and content, and responded to community concerns. [How can a framework for prospective, adaptive meta-analysis (FAME) improve the quality of Cochrane reviews?](/colloquium-2023/session/1574270/how-can-a-framework-for-prospective-adaptive-meta-analysis-fame-improve-the-quality-of-cochrane-reviews) Background: Most systematic reviews are planned after all or most eligible trials have completed and are based on aggregate data extracted from publications. Prior knowledge of trial results may introduce bias, and reliance on published data can limit the range of possible analyses and lead to reporting biases. Our framework for collaborative, prospective, adaptive meta-analysis of aggregate data, \"FAME\" (Tierney 2021), aims to tackle these issues. Planning prospectively reduces the potential for bias in review and meta-analysis methods. Collaborating with trialists provides information on when trials are due to complete so that the earliest timing for reliable meta-analysis can be assessed. Collecting more complete and detailed trial results allows for more thorough analyses and may further reduce possible sources of bias. Objectives: We aim to demonstrate how the use of all or even some FAME principles (\"FAME-lite\") may improve the quality of Cochrane reviews. Methods: The FAME principles that might be adopted in Cochrane reviews are: Start the review early while most trials are ongoing or yet to report Collaborate with trialists to clarify trial status, eligibility and plans and to obtain information to inform risk of bias assessments Assess the earliest possible timing for reliable meta-analysis based on the accumulating data Develop protocol (before trial results are known) and collect harmonised and detailed trial results from trialists to allow more thorough and less biased analyses Interpret results, taking account of both available and unavailable data, and assess the value of updating Results: We will demonstrate the advantages of applying FAME in prostate cancer (Vale 2016; Rydzewska 2017; Burdett 2019; Vale 2020) in COVID-19 (Sterne, 2020; Shankar-Hari, 2021). Recognising that it might not be possible or desirable to apply all elements of FAME, we will highlight those principles that might be used most readily in Cochrane (or other) aggregate data systematic reviews. We will also consider some of the potential challenges for Cochrane and suggest potential solutions. Conclusions: Adopting all or some FAME principles could help to reduce bias and improve the timeliness, trustworthiness and utility of Cochrane reviews. [Engaging Citizen Partners within a Rapid Review Process](/colloquium-2023/session/1473495/engaging-citizen-partners-within-a-rapid-review-process) Background: Rapid reviews seek to answer pressing policy and practice questions by providing time-sensitive evidence syntheses as a basis for decision-making. However, they often lack insights from people who are most affected. To improve the relevance of rapid reviews to the public, the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools' (NCCMT) Rapid Evidence Service (RES) invites public partners to participate in the development of rapid evidence reviews on various public health topics. This engagement process is developed for public partners to make meaningful contributions throughout the review process while maintaining accelerated timelines. Objectives: The NCCMT's RES quickly responds to public health decision makers' requests for syntheses of the best available evidence on priority public health topics within a limited timeframe, which supports public health decision making. Reviews are made accessible and relevant to the public by incorporating the perspectives of people who may be most affected by the subsequent decisions. Methods: Public partners were identified through a pool of interested individuals, including healthcare consumers and other members of the public, and were compensated for their time. The process began with an initial call to orient them to the review question and hear their perspectives on the topic. Following the evidence search, quality appraisal, and synthesis conducted by the NCCMT team, a draft was circulated to partners to review and provide feedback. Comments and insights into research gaps and policy and practice implications were then incorporated into the summary. Partners were given a final opportunity for review before publication. Results: Twenty public partners were successfully engaged across 14 rapid evidence reviews, bringing unique perspectives that improved the relevance of reviews. Conclusions: Rapid reviews benefit from involvement of people with lived experience throughout the evidence synthesis process. The NCCMT's RES successfully engages public partners with lived and professional experience in rapid evidence syntheses, thus addressing a significant gap in the evidence synthesis and decision-making process. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Public and healthcare consumers were engaged in the rapid review process. |12:30 PM - 2:00 PM| Background: Continuous outcomes are not straightforward to analyse if there are a large proportion of zeroes, as frequently occurs with outcomes such as volume of blood transfused for conditions for which blood transfusion is not always necessary. Should we analyse volume per person randomised (PPR) or per person transfused (PPT)? If numbers randomised and transfused are both known, we can convert between PPR and PPT using the relationship between sums of squares familiar from analysis of variance, but several statistical and practical issues arise. Statistical Issues: Standard methods of analysis for continuous outcomes rely on the Central Limit Theorem. When the underlying distribution is extreme owing to a large proportion of zeroes in the data, an intention-to-treat analysis (PPR) may require sample sizes of many hundreds or even thousands before the sampling distribution of the mean is closely approximated by the normal distribution. A PPT analysis will converge with smaller sample sizes, but if only a small proportion required transfusion, this still requires a large number randomised. Practical Issues: Some trials report the mean volume transfused without reporting the number receiving a transfusion and so would be excluded from a PPT analysis. It is sometimes unclear whether a trial has reported PPR or PPT. Converting between PPR and PPT may produce impossible values (negative sums of squares), helping to clarify this. This may also highlight cases where a standard error has been mislabelled as a standard deviation. Conclusions: When extracting these sorts of outcomes, it is important to be sure which value (PPR or PPT) was reported and to ensure that pooled results are all based on the same denominator. Extracted data should be carefully assessed for unusual or impossible values. There is no clear answer as to which analysis is best under any given circumstance; it may be useful to present both and note where the sample sizes available may not be sufficient to meet the underlying assumptions. We have produced a spreadsheet (available on request) to convert between PPR and PPT, including error flags and plots to help diagnose issues with the data extracted. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Use of Simulation Scenarios and Vote Cards in Teaching Critical Appraisal of Randomized Controlled Trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1652050/use-of-simulation-scenarios-and-vote-cards-in-teaching-critical-appraisal-of-randomized-controlled-trials) Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. However, understanding biases arising from a trial can be challenging for medical students to grasp. Objectives: We used simulation scenarios in a Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) framework and engaged vote cards to teach the various biases that may affect RCTs and assessed whether including this interactive session in an evidence-based medicine course for third-year medical students can optimize their understanding of critical appraisal concepts. Methods: Prior to this interactive session, third-year medical students were given a two-hour didactic lecture on critical appraisal. During the interactive session, students were given a scenario for each domain of bias, and options in which they could express their appraisal using color vote cards. At the beginning of each module, the facilitator presented a scenario for each domain of bias. Students expressed answers by holding up a red, yellow, or green card, each representing a particular option. Students were asked to explain their rationale and feedback was given by the facilitator after each module. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous survey about their level of satisfaction and understanding of the RoB 2.0 tool. Results: We included 306 students across two pilot sessions. The students were least able to discern the following problems: baseline imbalances when assessing allocation bias (correct answers: 9.06%), missing outcome data when assessing attrition bias (correct answers: 11.65%), and balanced nonprotocol interventions when assessing performance bias (correct answers: 14.88%). The postcourse survey revealed several aspects of the interactive session that the students appreciated or found challenging. Conclusions: These simulation scenarios based on a structured RoB framework were feasible for teaching critical appraisal. Through the use of vote cards, we further consolidated critical appraisal concepts, discovered areas that were challenging for medical students to understand, and encouraged their active participation. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Learning theoretical concepts through didactic lectures can be challenging for medical students. Simulated scenarios and vote cards increase relevancy and can be used to clarify and reinforce abstract concepts. Furthermore, it was engaging, stimulating, and fun. [A method for quantifying the generalizability of meta-analysis results in clinical practice: meta-epidemiologic study approach with three eye-opening examples](/colloquium-2023/session/1473768/a-method-for-quantifying-the-generalizability-of-meta-analysis-results-in-clinical-practice-meta-epidemiologic-cohort-study-approach-with-three-eye-opening-examples) Background: The generalizability and applicability of meta-analyses from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is often discussed and is part of the GRADE assessment. Objective: Our aim was to quantify generalizability using three prominent evidence syntheses from the field of critical care and perioperative medicine as examples. Methods: Using three Cochrane reviews of interventions, we extracted the eligibility criteria of the included studies for each review. We used the PRECIS-2 score to assess the degree of pragmatism of each study. The topics were perioperative beta-blockers, vasopressors for shock, and hypothermia after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We then defined cohorts of consecutive patients from central European hospitals according to the topic of each of the three Cochrane reviews, which included 2,241, 1,189, and 6,734 cases, respectively. We matched these patient cohorts with the respective eligibility criteria of the studies from the Cochrane reviews and calculated the proportion of patients in the cohort who met the eligibility criteria of the studies in each review. We also examined the association between the proportions of eligible patients and the PRECIS-2 score. Results: The Cochrane reviews on perioperative beta-blockers included RCTs, vasopressors for shock included 25 RCTs, and hypothermia after cardiopulmonary resuscitation included 12 RCTs. The proportion of patients who met the eligibility criteria for each trial varied widely, averaging less than 10%. A higher PRECIS-2 score was associated with a higher proportion of eligibility. Conclusions: The standardized assessment showed surprisingly low generalizability, which may be explained in part by the degree of pragmatism of the individual studies within the evidence syntheses. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [How to avoid retraction of systematic reviews? a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473512/how-to-avoid-retraction-of-systematic-reviews-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Systematic reviews, which are the highest level of evidence, are an important source of evidence for decision-makers to make scientific decisions. Fraudulent publication is a scourge of scientific research. Retracting is an important way to avoid circulation of low-quality research. Objectives: To assess the reasons for retraction and characteristics of systematic reviews retracted from 2012 to 2022. Methods: A review of the Retraction Watch database for retracted systematic review published between 2012 and 2022 was performed. Retractions with the term \"health science\" in the subject code were selected. We extracted the reasons for retraction, the journals and publishers of the retraction, and the correlation between the journals and their impact factors for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 235 retracted systematic reviews were included. Retracted papers were published in 228 different journals with IF ranging from 0.27 to 202.73. Most journals were from Q2 (38.7%). The three journals with the highest number of retractions were Tumor Biology (Tumour Biology), Medicine, and PLoS One. From the perspective of publishers, the retracted paper was also mainly concentrated in a few publishers, and more than 50% of the publishers had only one retracted paper. Seven out of 10 papers were withdrawn within three years. The publication years of retracted papers were between 2012 and 2022, with the most retracted systematic reviews in 2014 (n=46, 19.6%). Retracted articles originated from 33 countries. Compared with other countries, China had the highest percentage of retracted papers (n=162, 68.9%), followed by America (n=10, 4.3%), and the United Kingdom (n=9, 3.8%). Most of the articles had multiple reasons for retraction. The most common reported reason for retraction was fake peer review (n=66, 11.8%), followed by Investigation by Journal/Publisher (n=58, 10.4%). Errors (n=157, 28.1%) in paper is the main reason for retraction, including error in data (7.7%), methods (6.6%), image (0.5%), analyses (7.2%), etc. Conclusions: Academic misconduct is the main problem of systematic review retraction. At the same time, reviewers need to strictly control the publication process to reduce drastically the acceptance of fraudulent papers. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Learning by updating a Cochrane Review: teaching systematic review methods to undergraduate medical students](/colloquium-2023/session/1652047/learning-by-updating-a-cochrane-review-teaching-systematic-review-methods-to-undergraduate-medical-students) Background: evidence synthesis skills should be acquired during the medical degree. Since 2017 medical students at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria-Madrid (UFV), which hosts Cochrane Madrid, update Cochrane Reviews for their end-of-degree research projects. Objectives: to describe our experience in teaching Cochrane methods in the medical degree. Methods: we designed a subject for the last two years to guide medical students to update an intervention Cochrane review. The two-year subject (5th and 6th courses) includes theory sessions, seminars and requires student group and individual work. The teaching staff comprises one co-ordinator, five methodologists, and 20 clinical experts. Students are evaluated by attendance, participation, written essay, oral presentation, and peer assessments by other students. Results: The last promotion enrolled 104 medical students (82.7% women) (September 2021- June 2023). Twenty Cochrane Reviews were under update. Their topics (20%). The students have learnt to formulate clinical questions, search CENTRAL and PubMed, critically appraise studies, and use Review Manager 5.4 and Rayyan. Review publication is not the goal, but we anticipate the students have identified new eligible studies for the SRs. Challenges: 1) demanding subject for students and teachers; 2) explicit teaching materials are needed, and their elaboration is time-consuming; 3) reviews may not find new eligible studies; Increasing cost of review software. Opportunities: 1) focusing on intervention SRs with RCTs facilitates the process; 2) group work lightens students' burden while acquiring teamwork skills; 3) students acquire research skills and competencies for evidence-based medicine; 4) standardised teaching materials facilitate the work of teachers and students. Conclusions: learning to update a Cochrane Review during the medical curriculum helps to acquire research skills oriented to evidence-based medicine. While challenging, this course model is successful and implementable in other universities. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Cochrane methods in the undergraduate curriculum helps medical students to formulate patient-oriented clinical questions. This is an essential skill for an evidence-based practice that will benefit patients. [Developing a core outcome set for assessing clinical safety outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in clinical trials of integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine](/colloquium-2023/session/1652045/developing-a-core-outcome-set-for-assessing-clinical-safety-outcomes-of-cardiovascular-diseases-in-clinical-trials-of-integrated-traditional-chinese-medicine-and-western-medicine) Background: Integrative medicine is commonly used in China. Researchers prefer to report efficacy outcomes rather than safety outcomes in clinical trials; thus, evidence regarding safety in integrative medicine is unclear. Developing a core outcome set (COS) for safety outcomes is necessary. Objectives: In this study, a representative example of the methodology for developing COS to assess safety outcomes of cardiovascular diseases in clinical trials investigating integrated medicine was developed. Methods: Safety information will be extracted from package inserts and through systematic reviews of treatments for cardiovascular diseases (including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmia, and hypertension) to develop an extensive list of safety outcomes, which will then be categorized according to whether subjective or objective outcomes. Patients participated in semi-structured interviews. Questionnaires for clinician-reported safety outcomes and patient reported safety outcomes will be developed. Two rounds of the Delphi survey will then be conducted for different stakeholders (traditional Chinese medicine clinicians and researchers in cardiovascular diseases, Western medicine clinicians and researchers in cardiovascular diseases, integrated medicine clinicians and researchers of cardiovascular diseases, pharmacologists, methodologists of evidence-based medicine, and patients). After round 2 of the Delphi analysis, a face-to-face consensus meeting will be held to determine the final COS for assessing safety outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. Results: Anaphylaxis, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, hypotension, mortality, and bleeding are clinician-reported core adverse events for all cardiovascular disease. Cardiopalmus, chest distress, dizziness, and syncope are patient-reported core symptoms for all cardiovascular disease. We also recommend clinician-reported and patient-reported core adverse events for angina pectoris, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmia, and hypertension. Conclusions: The core safety outcomes for cardiovascular disease may improve the consistency of adverse events reporting in future clinical trials. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Clinicians, researchers, methodologists participated in the design, management, and process of the research. Patients participated in semi-structured interviews and online survey. [The value of Cochrane reviews for informing health decisions on optimal use of albumin](/colloquium-2023/session/1473430/the-value-of-cochrane-reviews-for-informing-health-decisions-on-optimal-use-of-albumin) Background: Albumin is a plasma derivative widely used in routine clinical practice. However, its administration in some scenarios is not always justified by evidence of benefit in relevant clinical outcomes. This, together with the increasing consumption and the limited availability, makes it necessary to review its indications for use. Objectives: To analyse the existence of evidence from systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of albumin in different scenarios. To describe the value of Cochrane systematic reviews for decision-making in clinical practice and the impact on the efficient use of health resources. Methods: A search for Cochrane systematic reviews was conducted in December 2019. This evidence was complemented by non-Cochrane reviews. The identified evidence was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee, which established the criteria for the use of albumin in Navarre (Spain) based on these data. Subsequently, we assessed the impact of the measures adopted on albumin consumption and expending. Results: We identified four Cochrane reviews in people with cirrhosis (Simonetti RG 2019, Best LM 2019), one for resuscitation in critically ill people (Lewis SR 2018), and one in nephrotic syndrome (Ho JJ 2019)] and seven non-Cochrane reviews. Thirty-six percent of evidence synthesis products used were Cochrane reviews. Supported by this evidence, measures for its appropriate use were adopted. In critically ill patients, albumin was restricted to shock, traumatic coagulopathy, surgery and burns refractory to crystalloids. In patients with cirrhosis, adequate indication was established after paracentesis >5 liters. In spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, it was restricted to high-risk patients. In hepatorenal syndrome, it should be used in combination with vasoconstrictors. In patients with cirrhosis with severe oedema, a maximum of 10 g/day was established. Albumin concentration in plasmapheresis was reduced from 5% to 4%. Routine use of albumin is not justified in other clinical conditions. Following the establishment of usage criteria, consumption decreased by 12.4% in 2020 and 19.4% in 2021 compared with 2019, with a savings of approximately \u20ac67,000. Conclusions: Cochrane reviews facilitate decision-making in clinical practice, resulting in better utilisation of available resources. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [The ExME initiative: a two-year experience in Knowledge among Spanish-speaking students](/colloquium-2023/session/1473908/the-exme-initiative-a-two-year-experience-in-knowledge-translation-among-spanish-speaking-students) Background: Exchange Made Easy Club (ExME) is the Spanish homologous to the Students 4 Best Evidence (S4BE) Cochrane UK project, supported by Cochrane Iberoamerica. We planned this platform after identifying the need to make this type of resource available in Spanish due to language barriers common in many non-native English-speaking countries. Since 2020, we have arranged this initiative with the aim to encourage students to produce, translate, and disseminate content related to the best evidence in health sciences. ExME allows establishment of a link with Cochrane Collaboration by starting to collect Cochrane Membership points. The platform has been hosted as a blog website to help students share content pursuing better clinical practice through reasonable and informed-health decisions. Objectives: To describe the type of content published. Methods: We formed an organising committee with students and scholars from seven different Spanish-speaking countries, deployed in a translations team; a new content team; a reviewers team; a communications team; and a technical support team. After registration and receiving instructions, undergraduate or postgraduate students are invited to propose a topic of interest to write about, to be addressed by the following: writing de novo blog entries or translating content published by S4BE. Then, the collaborators must submit their drafts to a review process conducted by an experienced scholar linked to the Iberoamerica Cochrane Network and respond following the suggestions and making the amendments before the final publication. After being published, blog entries are disseminated via social media. Results: At the moment, we have published and disseminated 65 blog entries (27 new content and 38 translations) elaborated by collaborators from 10 different countries along Latin America and Spain. In parallel, the organising committee has reached agreements with four institutions (universities and research centres) to include ExME (as a supplementary material repository or a curricular activity by generating blog entries) in their educational programs, whereas we are in conversations with other interested stakeholders to expand the project. Conclusions: We expect that more students and professors of health-related sciences will consider ExME as a platform to share useful and entrusted information. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This project does not involve direct participation of patients or consumers. [Methodological quality assessment should move beyond design specificity](/colloquium-2023/session/1473749/methodological-quality-assessment-should-move-beyond-design-specificity) Background: Tools used to assess the potential for bias in research are usually design specific. The limitation of design specific tools is that they ignore design-related safeguards and are not useful for assessment across study designs. Objectives: This study aims to assess the utility of a unified tool (MASTER) for bias assessment against design specific tools in terms of content and coverage. Methods: Each of the safeguards in the design specific tools were compared and matched to safeguards in the unified MASTER scale. The design specific tools were the JBI, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), and the Newcastle-Ottawa (NOS) tools for analytic study designs. Duplicates, safeguards that could not be mapped to the MASTER scale, and items non-applicable as safeguards against bias were flagged and described. Results: Many safeguards across the JBI, SIGN, and NOS tools were common, with a minimum of 10 to maximum of 23 unique safeguards across various tools. These three design specific toolsets were missing 14 to 26 safeguards from the MASTER scale. The MASTER scale had complete coverage of safeguards within the three toolsets for analytic designs. Conclusions: The MASTER scale provides a unified framework for bias assessment of analytic study designs, has good coverage, avoids duplication, has less redundancy and is more convenient when used for methodological quality assessment in evidence synthesis. It also allows assessment across designs which cannot be done using a design specific tool. Relevance and importance to patients: Identifying research studies at risk of bias is crucial for the reliable translation of evidence into policy and practice. A unified approach is useful when there are several designs within an evidence synthesis as studies can be down-ranked based on design specific safeguards. A systematic review should attempt to identify all of the available evidence and therefore this approach is useful for synthesizing the results of different study designs in a systematic review. [Patient-reported outcome measures in child health: an overview of reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473476/patient-reported-outcome-measures-in-child-health-an-overview-of-reviews) Background: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are standardized and validated self-administered questionnaires for measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that assess patients' physical, emotional, social, functional, overall well-being, disease burden, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). For children, the appropriate PROMs need to be selected based on their cognitive development as well as their reading ability, vocabulary, and language skills to reflect the children's situation more accurately. Systematic reviews (SRs) of PROMs are an important way to select the appropriate PROMs. High-quality systematic reviews can provide a comprehensive overview of the PROMs and provide evidence-based recommendations for pediatricians. Objectives: This study aimed to provide an overview of pediatric PROMs recommended in SRs. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched, using search terms such as \"patient reported outcome measures\", \"instruments\", \"children\", and \"systematic review\". SRs of PROMs published in English focusing on the health of children and adolescents were included. Four researchers performed literature screening and data extraction and evaluated the methodological quality of SRs. Results: A total of 44 SRs of PROMs were eventually included, of which 123 PROMs were recommended. The range of SRs publication years was 2006-2022. A total of 36 conditions were addressed; the most frequent International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 category was \"Mental, behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorders\" (n=9, 20.45%). Of the 123 recommended PROMs, 36 (29.27%) reported the development country, with most from USA (n=17, 13.82%). Forty-two (34.15%) PROMs reported validated language versions, with the EuroQol Five Dimension Youth questionnaire (EQ-5D-Y) reporting the most language versions of more than 50. There were nine categories of contents of each PROM proposed to measure, and the most frequently measured was quality of life (n=37, 30.08%). Most SRs (35, 79.55%) used the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) to evaluate the reliability and validity of PROMs. Two measurement properties were reported greater than 50%: content validity (n=67, 54.47%) and internal consistency (n=65, 52.85%); measurement error (n=10, 8.13%) was reported as the least. Conclusions: The quality of SRs of pediatric PROMs still needs to be improved, especially in terms of irregular and incomplete reporting of measurement properties. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [A conceptual framework of evidence synthesis for using real-world data to improve childhood cancer health outcomes and resource use in Egypt](/colloquium-2023/session/1473462/a-conceptual-framework-of-evidence-synthesis-for-using-real-world-data-to-improve-childhood-cancer-health-outcomes-and-resource-use-in-egypt) Background: Given the large number of children with cancer in Egypt, the limited resources, and the inferior survival outcomes, there is an urgent need to better utilise available resources to improve care and outcomes efficiently based on evidence. However, there is a gap in knowledge about childhood cancer survival outcomes and resource use in Egypt, due to paucity of published literature. Just as different locks need different keys to unlock them, different problems need different solutions to address them. Objectives: To develop a conceptual framework of evidence synthesis that generates high-quality evidence relevant to local context to improve childhood cancer health outcomes and resource use in a resource-limited setting in Egypt. Methods: I reflected on six key concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM), and the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine 2011 levels of evidence, as a reference to generate and assess high-quality evidence. Results: The conceptual framework of evidence synthesis (illustrated in Figure 1) uses hybrid research methods to generate three types of evidence: (1) real-world evidence from a local context to assess the current status of childhood cancer health outcomes, resources used/costs, and cost-effectiveness estimates; identify local priority areas; and provide evidence-based recommendations for improvement; (2) external evidence from the literature to provide the currently best available evidence about a key priority area; and (3) practical knowledge from expert opinion based on local clinical experience to help translate the generated evidence into practice and address the implementation gaps. Conclusions: This conceptual framework could serve as a roadmap to generate high-quality evidence relevant to local contexts in similar resource-limited settings among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with an identified gap in published literature. Implementing this framework of evidence synthesis will help make better informed decisions to promote value in care delivery for children with cancer in these resource-limited contexts. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Ideally, the opinions of other key stakeholders, such as consumers (patients and families) and payers, should be considered during the implementation phase of this framework. However, this should be cautiously addressed as cultural and socioeconomic barriers can exist in these LMICs. [Extreme Findings in Early Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473459/extreme-findings-in-early-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies) Background: Studies published earlier in the chain of evidence often reported a larger treatment effect than subsequent ones, what has been called the Proteus effect. It is unclear whether such a phenomenon exists in diagnostic test accuracy studies. Objectives: To determine the presence of exaggerated test accuracy measures in the first or second published studies compared with subsequent studies. Methods: We retrieved data from all meta-analyses (MAs) of diagnostic test accuracy published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between January 2003 and January 2020. One MA with the largest number of studies was selected from each systematic review. Within each MA, diagnostic test accuracy was compared across studies according to their order of publication. We estimated the prevalence of having the largest sensitivity, specificity, or diagnostic odds ratio in the first two published studies. Results: A total of 2,095 diagnostic test accuracy studies were included in the analysis. Each MA included a median of 14 studies (interquartile range [IQR]: 8-28) and 3,238 patients (IQR: 1,030-8,814). The prevalence of having the highest accuracy in the first two studies was in 27 MAs (29%) for diagnostic odds ratio, 18 MAs (20%) for sensitivity, and 23 (25%) MAs for specificity (Table 1). There was no significant difference between studies with early extreme findings and those without early extreme findings on number of patients and disease prevalence (Table 2). Conclusions: Diagnostic test studies published early in the chain of evidence often reported the highest diagnostic accuracy compared with subsequent studies. It is unclear what causes this phenomenon. Decision-makers should act with caution on early diagnostic evidence. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Risk of bias and reporting quality of randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses in paediatric surgery: a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473455/risk-of-bias-and-reporting-quality-of-randomised-controlled-trials-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-in-paediatric-surgery-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Few interventions in paediatric surgery are supported by well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and most clinical research in paediatric surgery consists of retrospective studies, half of which are case series. It is imperative that the few RCTs in paediatric surgery, and the systematic reviews and meta-analyses which include them, are of high quality. Objectives: To determine the risk of bias and reporting quality of RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses in paediatric surgery. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses in paediatric surgery which were published in full text in 2021. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, JBI EBP Database, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Web of Science, and the 2021 indexes of high-impact paediatric surgery journals. For RCTs, risk of bias was assessed with the RoB (Risk of Bias) 2 tool and reporting quality was assessed with the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) 2010 statement. For systematic reviews and meta-analyses, risk of bias was assessed with the ROBIS (Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews) tool and reporting quality was assessed with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 statement. Risk of bias was assessed as high, unclear or low, and reporting quality was assessed as adequate if 75% of items in the reporting guideline were reported. All studies were screened and assessed in duplicate by two independent investigators. Results: We identified 82 RCTs and 268 systematic reviews or meta-analyses in paediatric surgery which were published in full text in 2021. More than half of the RCTs (n=46, 56%) (see Figure 1) and almost all of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses (n=258, 96%) (see Figure 2) were at high risk of bias. Only one RCT (1%) and only four (1%) systematic reviews and meta-analyses were adequately reported. Less than half of RCTs (n=40, 49%) and only a quarter of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (n=68, 25%) had a registered protocol. Conclusions: Recently published RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses in paediatric surgery are at a high risk of bias and have poor reporting quality. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Strategies for communicating scientific evidence on healthcare to managers and population: scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473444/strategies-for-communicating-scientific-evidence-on-healthcare-to-managers-and-population-scoping-review) Background: As an underlying element of health knowledge translation, communicating the findings of scientific studies, the effects of interventions, and estimates of health risks, in addition to comprehending key concepts of clinical epidemiology and interpreting evidence, represents a set of essential needs for closing the gap between science and clinical practice. The breakthrough of digital and social media has reframed the construct of health communication, introducing innovative powerful communication platforms and access routes between researchers and managers and the general population. Objectives: To map and evaluate strategies for communicating scientific evidence on healthcare to managers and/or the general population, through a scoping review. Methods: Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE and other electronic databases and relevant sources were systematically searched for studies, documents or reports, published from 2000, addressing strategies for communicating scientific evidence on healthcare to managers and/or the general population. Results: 24,598 records were retrieved, of which 80 fulfilled the eligibility criteria covering 78 strategies. Most strategies focused on risk/benefit communication in health (29.5%), were presented by a textual component (88.5%) and had been implemented and somehow evaluated (52.6%). Strategies which seemed to provide some benefit included (i) risk/benefit communication: natural frequencies rather than percentages, absolute risk rather than relative risk and number needed to treat, numerical rather than nominal communication, and mortality rather than survival; negative or loss content seems to be more effective than positive or gain content; (ii) evidence synthesis: plain language summaries of Cochrane reviews were perceived as more reliable, easier to find and comprehend and more suitable to support decisions than the original summaries; and (iii) teaching/learning: the Informed Health Choices initiatives seem to be effective for improving critical thinking capabilities. Conclusions: Our results endorse both the knowledge translation process by mapping communication strategies with potential for prompt implementation and further research by recognizing the need to measure the clinical and social impact of other strategies to support evidence-informed policies. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our findings may constitute a valuable instrument for supporting the choice of specific strategies for communicating evidence on healthcare and for promoting the use of scientific knowledge in clinical practice and the decision-making process. [How can patient involvement promote systematic review development? Results of patient interview nested in a network meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473434/how-can-patient-involvement-promote-systematic-review-development-results-of-patient-interview-nested-in-a-network-meta-analysis) Background: Engaging patients in the systematic review (SR) development may provide valuable input and make it more trustworthy and relevant for practice. Objectives: To point out the importance of considering the perspectives of patients in SR development, which are sometimes different from those imagined by healthcare professionals. Methods: We report the results of a patient interview, which is part of an ongoing network meta-analysis about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) adherence-enhancing interventions. It was performed before searching the literature using a semi-structured guideline. We used qualitative analysis software (MAXQDA\u00ae) following the Kuckartz method of inductive coding and quality criteria. Subsequently, the findings were incorporated into the logical models prepared in the protocol before the interview (system-based and process-oriented logic models). Results: We interviewed 14 heterogeneous patients with COPD (age 67.7 \u00b1 6.8 years, 10 females). Overall, the coders identified 321 content-bearing codings. Following the research question, five thematic categories were formed, each comprising three to four sub-categories (Table 1). Across the categories, patients described controlling symptoms, a well-structured daily routine, understanding of illness, availability of high-quality and correct information, digital health, effective communication with doctors, transparent management strategy, reminding techniques, physical exercise, and social network as promoting adherence. Medical training, like inhalation technique, was considered one of the most important adherence-promoting measures. Quality of life (QoL) was considered an essential outcome, which was even preferred over mortality. Conversely, they believed that negative thoughts and bureaucracy in healthcare systems might reduce medication adherence. The feedback was incorporated into the logic models. Across both models (Figure 1 and 2), they suggested including physical exercise and social-cultural engagement for adherence components, and adding the internet, health insurance companies, and self-help groups as part of the intervention. They also suggested outcomes like rapid symptom control, immediate improvement in QoL, and reaching individual goals. Conclusions: Involving patients in SR development can provide a valuable perspective on the topic that medical professionals may have yet to recognize. Their insights can help to ensure that the review is more relevant for the patients and thus health care decision-making. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We involved patients with COPD. [Estudantes para Melhores Evid\u00eancias - a Healthcare content supported by Cochrane](/colloquium-2023/session/1473903/estudantes-para-melhores-evid\u00eancias-a-student-driven-blog-of-evidence-based-healthcare-content-supported-by-cochrane) Background: Blogs are technologies that are being tested and assessed for their value in educational environments as a way to increase student engagement, assess student knowledge, and improve retention of material. This poster aims to report the experience and the results of the \"Estudantes para Melhores Evid\u00eancias\" (EME) blog after 18 months of its launch as one strategy to engage students in the active learning of Evidence-Based Health Care (EBHC) topics and to help disseminate the content throughout social media channels. Objectives: To describe the experience of a student-driven blog on EBHC written from and intended to students. Methods: Descriptive case analysis. We used an analytics tool (Google Analytics) and its metrics to see where the website captured attention, and where we have opportunities to increase engagement. Results: EME was officially launched in August 2021 with the support from Cochrane and has produced 75 blogs so far. All the blogs were written by Brazilian students; most of them undergraduates. The website has been visited 35.971 times by 27.353 users with 49.928-page visualizations (Figure 1). Eighty-six percent of the access was done by a new user, whereas 14% was done by returning users. Eighty-two percent of users were from Brazil, 7.02% from Portugal, 5,09% from the United States of America (USA), with several other countries with less than 1% (Figure 2). A few countries had no access so far, most of them in Africa and Asia. Seventy-six percent of users have from 18 to 44 years of age, with 54.15% of males. The most accessed blog was \"Intervalo de confian\u00e7a - o que \u00e9 e como interpretar\" (\"Confidence interval - what it is and how to interpret\") with 4,034 pageviews. Conclusions: Blogs are being assessed for their value in educational environments as a way to increase student engagement, assess student knowledge, and improve retention of material. We considered the results from the \"Estudantes para Melhores Evid\u00eancias\" blog very exciting and promising to foster student engagement and learning on EBM content. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: none. [A comparison of two search filters for economic evaluations. The CADTH Narrow vs the NHS EED search filter](/colloquium-2023/session/1473423/a-comparison-of-two-search-filters-for-economic-evaluations.-the-cadth-narrow-vs-the-nhs-eed-search-filter) Objectives: The aim of this project was to evaluate if the CADTH narrow economic search filter (CADTH narrow) could produce a similar sensitivity to the NHS EED search filter (NHS EED) while achieving a lower number needed to read (NNR) when searching for economic evaluations in the Ovid MEDLINE database. Methods: We identified references of economic evaluations from a sample of 13 systematic reviews conducted by the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU). The references that met the inclusion criteria within each review were used to generate the gold standard set for Ovid MEDLINE (n=126). We calculated the sensitivity of the CADTH narrow and NHS EED filters, respectively, against the gold standard set. We also created a subset of the gold standard which only consisted of references that were included in the final analyses of the systematic reviews after appraisals of quality and transferability to the Swedish setting (n=46). NNR was then calculated in 4 out of the 13 systematic reviews using existing search strategies in combination with the evaluated filters. Results: The overall sensitivity for the entire gold standard was 79% for CADTH narrow as opposed to 98% for NHS EED. When the gold standard was limited to the subset of articles included in the systematic reviews after appraisals of quality and transferability, the sensitivity for CADTH narrow increased to 91% while remaining at 98% for NHS EED. CADTH narrow had a lower NNR than NHS EED in all 4 systematic reviews examined with an average of 16 as opposed to 73 for NHS EED. Conclusions: The sensitivity of CADTH narrow differs depending on the choice of reference gold standard. Within this project, CADTH narrow generated a sensitivity that was almost on par with NHS EED when the gold standard set was limited to economic evaluations appraised as having sufficient methodological quality and transferability to the Swedish setting. NNR was substantially lower with CADTH narrow than with NHS EED and the reviewer screening burden was reduced by a factor of 5. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. [Contextualizing evidence-based nurse-led peri-discharge interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions using GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework: A Delphi study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473422/contextualizing-evidence-based-nurse-led-peri-discharge-interventions-for-reducing-30-day-hospital-readmissions-using-grade-evidence-to-decision-framework-a-delphi-study) Background: Effectiveness of nurse-led peri-discharge interventions on 30-day hospital readmissions has been synthesized in previous network meta-analysis. However, generalizability of such results is expected to vary in health system contexts given their complexity. Objectives: To translate evidence-based nurse-led interventions into local-adaptable intervention options for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions with the engagement of local stakeholders, using Hong Kong as an example. Methods: Eighteen local healthcare stakeholders were recruited to carry out a two-step process. In step 1, stakeholders were invited to prioritize nurse-led interventions which are supported by existing evidence and suggest important combinations of different interventions. For all interventions prioritized in step 1, step 2 involved stakeholders to perform a two-round Delphi questionnaire aiming to generate consensus-based interventions appropriate to the local context. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework was applied to guide the decision-making process, taking into account certainty of evidence, benefits and harms, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Results: Four out of eight nurse-led interventions reached a positive consensus with percentage agreement ranging from 70.6% to 82.4%. GRADE EtD criteria ratings showed that over 70% of stakeholders agreed these four interventions were probably acceptable and feasible, although the certainty of evidence was low or moderate. Half of stakeholders believed their desirable effects compared to undesirable effects were large. However, the resources required and how these nurse-led interventions might affect health inequities when implemented were uncertain. Preliminary implementation issues included high complexity of delivering multiple nurse-led intervention components and challenges of coordinating different involved parties in delivering the interventions. Appropriate resource allocation and training should be provided to address these potential problems, as suggested by stakeholders. Conclusions: Using the GRADE EtD framework, four nurse-led interventions were recommended by healthcare stakeholders as possible strategies for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions among general medical patients in Hong Kong. To address preliminary implementation issues, nurses' role as care coordinators should also be strengthened to ensure smooth delivery of nurse-led intervention components and to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration during service delivery. Patient, public, healthcare consumer involvement: NA. [Comparison of several systematic review process software tools among health care professionals: A questionnaire based survey.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473419/comparison-of-several-systematic-review-process-software-tools-among-health-care-professionals-a-questionnaire-based-survey.) Background: Systematic reviews are an important tool for synthesizing and summarizing evidence in healthcare research. There are numerous software tools available for conducting systematic reviews, but it is unclear which tools are most commonly used or most effective among healthcare professionals. Objectives: This study aimed to compare several systematic review process software tools used by healthcare professionals through a questionnaire-based survey. The objectives were to identify which tools were most commonly used, which were considered most effective, and what factors influenced tool selection. Methods: A questionnaire was developed and distributed to healthcare professionals who had experience conducting systematic reviews. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, experience with systematic reviews, and experiences using various software tools. Participants were asked to rate the ease of use, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction with each tool they had used. Results: A total of 150 healthcare professionals completed the questionnaire. The most commonly used software tools were DistillerSR, Covidence, and Rayyan. Participants rated DistillerSR as the most effective tool, followed by Covidence and Rayyan. Factors influencing tool selection included cost, ease of use, and availability of training and support. Conclusions: This study suggests that healthcare professionals prefer software tools that are effective, easy to use, and affordable. Although DistillerSR was rated the most effective tool, Covidence and Rayyan were also highly rated and commonly used. Healthcare professionals should consider these factors when selecting a software tool for conducting systematic reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, or healthcare consumers were not directly involved in the development or implementation of this study. However, the study's results may ultimately benefit patients and healthcare consumers by helping healthcare professionals identify and use more effective tools for conducting systematic reviews, which could lead to better-informed healthcare decisions. [Introducing The Cochrane Nutrition & Public Health Thematic Group](/colloquium-2023/session/1473418/introducing-the-cochrane-nutrition-public-health-thematic-group) Introduction: Improving nutrition and physical activity is a global health priority. Within Cochrane's new production model, a Thematic Group (TG) with specialist content and methods expertise to support the development and dissemination of high-quality evidence on these priority issues in accessible formats was needed. We established a Nutrition and Physical Activity TG, which will serve as a Cochrane hub for expertise in this area. Approach: In establishing the TG, we brought together Cochrane members and groups with considerable experience in systematic reviews, methods and knowledge translation, as well as expertise in public health, nutrition, physical activity and obesity. Our strategic plan ensures TG decisions, and actions are deliberate and consistent with our shared values and guiding principles and contribute to achieving our TG goals and objectives. A governance structure aims to ensure the integration of teams across the partners and to manage resource allocation procedures and processes to maximise the impact of the TG's programs of work. Our goals: The TG goals are to support and enable evidence-informed decision-making for policy and practice by advancing the preparation and impact of high-quality, relevant evidence syntheses; be a collaborative and sustainable component of Cochrane's ecosystem for producing high-quality, trusted evidence; and to add value to Cochrane's vision of better health for all people. It will achieve this via four objectives: 1) Increase the relevance, timeliness and quality of evidence synthesis aligned with our scope; 2) Ensure the sustainability of the TG; 3) Increase the impact and visibility of evidence synthesis aligned with our scope across all target audiences; and 4) Ensure accountability of the TG to the Cochrane Charity and between the partnering groups. Conclusions: The Nutrition and Physical Activity TG is an aggregation of multi-disciplinary Cochrane entities, as well as partnering organisations and people from around the world, representing both a broadening of global collaboration and potential impact. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We will create opportunities for patients, public and/or healthcare consumers to be involved in priority setting, commenting on reviews in-development and other activities of interest, to ensure our evidence products are accessible and relevant to them. [An overview of Cochrane reviews of or prognostic modelling studies are developed to give accurate and discriminating predictions about the likelihood of a future outcome in individuals with a given disease or health condition and are increasingly being used in evidence-based medicine of the XXI century. Predictors or prognostic factors typically include laboratory variables, biomarkers, patient/disease/clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment-related factors, or concomitant medications. Objectives: This overview aims to a.) synthesise evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies and conditions/outcomes evaluated in CSRs against non-CSRs. Methods: Cochrane Central (2023, Issue 2) and Medline (from inception until 03.02.2023) were searched (without language restrictions) for all relevant studies. CSRs and non-CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies in any healthcare area were eligible. Other types of reviews i.e., effectiveness, diagnostic, or safety, were excluded. Results: Fourteen CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies were included. The conditions involved unprovoked seizure (n=1), cognitive impairment or dementia (n=2), autism spectrum disorder (n=1), major depressive disorder (n=1), noncardiac surgery (n=1), cancer (n=6), low back pain (n=1), and venous leg ulcers (n=1). Those conditions were mapped against non-CSRs and included seizures (n=19), cognitive impairment or dementia (n=24), autism spectrum disorder (n=7), major depressive disorder (n=80), noncardiac surgery (n=8), cancer (n=1,190), low back pain and venous leg ulcers The ratio of non-CSRs CSRs prognostic and versus 1.25% in psychiatry. Conclusions: There is paucity of CSRs of predictive, prognostic, or prognostic modelling studies and a plethora of conditions or outcomes evaluated in non-CSRs. The biggest and most worrying gap exists in oncology. Given that non-Cochrane reviews report larger and often less precise effect sizes compared with CSRs, this could lead to over or under-interpretations of predictive or prognostic factors under investigation further contributing to unnecessary suffering, poor life quality, and excessive fear or unrealistic optimism in certain populations, such as oncology. There should be more CSRs evaluating predictive and prognostic factors. [Assessing spin bias in abstracts of systematic reviews from Revista m\u00e9dica de Chile between 2017-2021](/colloquium-2023/session/1473901/assessing-spin-bias-in-abstracts-of-systematic-reviews-from-revista-m\u00e9dica-de-chile-between-2017-2021) Background: Revista M\u00e9dica de Chile (Rev Med Chile) is the oldest monthly journal of Chilean health science, which is responsible for publishing original articles related to internal medicine and its derived subspecialties. It is the Chilean journal of health science with the highest indexes h5 (26) and m5 (40) in the year 2021 according to SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). Systematic reviews (SRs) are a key component in the evidence ecosystem. An absence of coherence between the findings of a SR and its interpretation may lead to inaccurate recommendations due to spin bias, defined as a distortion of the results that mislead readers towards a more favourable (or unfavourable) conclusion. To our knowledge, no assessment of spin bias has been conducted regarding local evidence. Objectives: Assess the frequency of spin bias in SRs published in Rev Med Chile between 2017 and 2021. Methods: We retrieved every article published in Rev Med Chile during 2017 to 2021 and made a full text review to identify the first author, country, theme, methodology, conflict of interest, and funding, all of which were declared in the articles. Only SRs were included for this study. To assess the presence of spin bias, a masked duplicate fashion data extraction was performed by two reviewers. The data extraction consisted of two phases. The first aimed to characterize the methodological quality of each study by applying the 16-item A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)-2 tool. The second phase aimed to identify the presence of the nine most severe types of spin (Table 1) within the abstract of the included articles. After the data extraction, reviewers will be unmasked and discuss their results in order to reach consensus. If a discrepancy is found, a third reviewer will be consulted. Preliminary Results: We found 1056 articles, of which 22 systematic reviews were included. The data extraction is currently ongoing, and it will be presented at the colloquium. Conclusions: Full results will be presented at the colloquium. Spin bias may be an important issue to consider when interpreting conclusions of SR authors. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, and/or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [Simplifying Cochrane Systematic Reviews with AI for Improved Shared Decision Making](/colloquium-2023/session/1473385/simplifying-cochrane-systematic-reviews-with-ai-for-improved-shared-decision-making) Background: Cochrane systematic reviews provide high-quality, evidence-based information for healthcare decision-making. However, the language used in these reviews can be complex, making it difficult for patients and nonexperts to understand. This can hinder shared decision-making, where patients are equipped with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their health and treatment options. To facilitate shared decision-making and better communication with patients, it is important to simplify the information contained in Cochrane systematic reviews. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in simplifying the lay language summaries of Cochrane systematic reviews to an 8th-grade level. The study compared the readability and accuracy of the simplified summaries generated by AI with those created by human experts and with the original Cochrane systematic reviews. Methods: A sample of Cochrane systematic reviews was used in the study. Lay language summaries were created both by human experts and through an AI-powered simplification process to an 8th-grade level. The readability and accuracy of the summaries were assessed using established metrics. Results: The results showed that the 8th-grade-level lay language summaries generated by AI were more accessible and understandable for patients and the general public without sacrificing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information. The simplified summaries had higher readability scores and were more accurately understood by patients and nonexperts compared with the original Cochrane systematic reviews. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of simplifying evidence-based information for shared decision-making and better communication between healthcare providers and patients. Using AI to generate 8th-grade-level lay language summaries of Cochrane systematic reviews is an effective way to achieve this goal. By making the information more accessible, patients can make informed decisions about their health and treatment options, leading to improved health outcomes. The study demonstrates the potential for AI to support shared decision-making by simplifying complex scientific information into understandable language for patients and the general public. [Quality of report of the clinical quantitative research by area of investigation on the Revista M\u00e9dica de Chile between years 2017-2021](/colloquium-2023/session/1473893/quality-of-report-of-the-clinical-quantitative-research-by-area-of-investigation-on-the-revista-m\u00e9dica-de-chile-between-years-2017-2021) Background: Revista M\u00e9dica de Chile (RevMedChile) is the oldest monthly journal of Chilean health science which is responsible for publishing original articles related to internal medicine and its derived subspecialties. It is the Chilean journal of health science with the highest indexes h5 (26) and m5 (40) in the year 2021 according to SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). These indexes have been criticized for being quantitative tools by relying on the number of citations; therefore, they do not ensure the quality of the published articles. Because of this, it is important to evaluate the quality of the report of articles presented in journals in addition to considering the values of their bibliometric indexes. Objectives: To identify the clinical research articles published between 2017 and 2021 by RevMedChile, to classify them by type of design and to assess the quality of the report. Methods: We searched all articles published in RevMedChile between the years 2017 and 2021 and performed a full text revision and classified them by medical specialty and methodology. Only quantitative research articles from clinical and preclinical areas were considered. Once they were grouped, we applied the respective report Guidelines according to the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network guideline decision tree for each methodology, seeking to correlate the quality of the report with the area of specialty and theme of the research. Preliminary Results: We found 1,056 articles, of which 728 were included; 523 (34.7%) corresponded to internal medicine and its subspecialties, 115 (15,8%) to neurology, 99 (13.6%) to psychiatry and mental health, 75 (10.3%) to radiology and oncology and 71 (9.7%) to surgery and its subspecialties. In relation to methodology, 291 (40%) were observational, 266 (36.5%) were descriptive, 152 (20.9%) were secondary investigations and 19 (2.6%) used interventional methods. We then assessed the quality of the report using reporting guidelines (Equator Network). Conclusions: The final results and conclusions will be presented at the colloquium. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public and/or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [Core outcome set development for intervention research on snakebite in South Asia: methodological case study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473886/core-outcome-set-development-for-intervention-research-on-snakebite-in-south-asia-methodological-case-study) Background: Core outcome set (COS) are a consensus-derived set of outcomes that should be minimally measured in future research or practice for a specific condition. A COS for intervention research on snakebites in South Asia was developed, and several new methodological insights were obtained. Objectives: To describe and discuss methodological insights obtained from COS development on snakebites in South Asia. Methods: A case-study approach is being taken, wherein the COS development process is described in brief together with methodological insights for future methods work. Results: The COS development process involves results from a systematic review to develop an initial list of outcomes for a Delphi survey to develop COS for five intervention groups. The two-stage Delphi survey involved healthcare providers, patients and the public, and potential COS users. This was followed by a final consensus meeting and workshops to finalise \"what\" and \"how\" outcomes in COS should be measured in future. Insights around setting scope (global versus regional), modular design of Delphi, and several challenges for patient and public involvement (most people with a snakebite have poor literary, and there are no organised survivor groups). Conclusions: The case study suggests the need for revising the current COS-STAndards for Development (STAD) with more nuanced standards, in relation to scope, and stakeholder involvement thresholds. It also indicates the need for developing guidance on modalities for patients and public engagement for disease conditions for which no organised survivor groups exist and in populations in which literacy is poor. Patient and public involvement: Snakebite patients, their caregivers, and community representatives were involved in the COS development process. [Supporting evidence-based decisions of the Brazilian Regulatory Agency for Supplementary Healthcare: a case study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473574/supporting-evidence-based-decisions-of-the-brazilian-regulatory-agency-for-supplementary-healthcare-a-case-study) Background: The Brazilian health system is composed of a public system (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade [SUS]) and a supplementary health sector regulated by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Sa\u00fade Suplementar (ANS), an autonomous government agency responsible for maintaining a catalogue that informs which medicines, devices, and procedures must be provided by health plans [1,2]. The process of evaluating a technology to be incorporated into the catalogue is continuous and has been qualified by the adoption of health technology assessment (HTA) guides and evidence-based health concepts. To this end, ANS has relied on the impartial support of institutions of excellence in research and HTA. Objectives: To report the implementation and partial results of the project \"Supporting the Brazilian regulatory agency for supplementary healthcare using health technology assessment actions\", an initiative from Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, Brazil, conducted from 2020 to 2023, to support the ANS and is funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health initiative (PROADI-SUS). Methods: This was a case study [3] conducted at Health Technology Center, Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Results: From 2020 to July 2022, the following activities and products were completed: 59 technical methodological reports assessing the efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of technologies received by the ANS to compose its catalogue of drugs products and services; 50 analyses of society contributions from public consultation; 34 methodological or clinical tutorial sessions to support ANS team; 2 templates to standardise the update process of ANS catalogue; and 1 training course on systematic reviews and meta-analysis for ANS team. Conclusions: The project has contributed to increasing ANS autonomy in HTA, collaborating to efficiency in technologies offer to the users. By adopting and fostering evidence-based knowledge construction, the project reinforces its bridging role in supporting the consonance between public system and supplementary sector of healthcare in Brazil. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The actions developed in this project are structuring and contribute to the rational choice of technologies available to the almost 50 million users of the supplementary health sector, improving the efficiency of this system and ensuring robustness and reliability for decision-making. [Do healthcare professionals and consumers prefer reporting statements based on statistically significant differences or do they prefer non-binary options?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473572/do-healthcare-professionals-and-consumers-prefer-reporting-statements-based-on-statistically-significant-differences-or-do-they-prefer-non-binary-options) Background: For decades, the p value-based interpretation and reporting of results dominated the publications. Nowadays, the scientific community agrees that this binary approach is not enough. A systemic reform is necessary for moving from this binary approach to some other non-binary options. Some of them, which were discussed in the last Cochrane Handbook version (2019), are the point estimate, the confidence interval, and the minimal important difference, suggesting some narrative statements. However, it is not clear how healthcare professionals and consumers agree with this approach and, even more important, whether all retrieve the same conclusions when they look at some specific results. Objectives: To evaluate how healthcare professionals and consumers interpret results and which preferred reporting style is for them. Methods: We are conducting an online survey among healthcare professionals and consumers. These stakeholders have to choose the binary or non-binary option that better expresses the results for the following scenario: After exhaustive literature searches, a systematic review identified only two pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of drug X versus placebo (P) in patients with a rare genetic disease. The risk of bias for all domains was low in both RCTs, and there were no important differences in populations and results between both studies. The combined results were: Mortality risk: X 26%(10/39) and P 45%(18/40) Risk 19% Risk = 0.0721 *95% CI: 95% Confidence Interval (represents the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your trial, within a 95% level of confidence). Results: Will be shown at the colloquium. Conclusions: It will be interesting to see which preferred reporting statements are for healthcare professionals and for consumers. Besides, we will know the level of agreement or disagreement among these groups, which is critical for the patient-physician communication process. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Healthcare professionals and consumers responded to the survey. [Orphan drugs - major evidence gaps and persisting unmet medical needs](/colloquium-2023/session/1652044/orphan-drugs---major-evidence-gaps-and-persisting-unmet-medical-needs) Background: In the EU alone, about 30 million people are affected by more than 6000 different rare diseases, thus representing a major public health issue. The development of drugs for rare diseases (orphan drugs) used to be commercially less attractive due to small markets, resulting in huge unmet medical needs in affected patients. This led to legislation to incentivise orphan drug development, such as the EU Orphan Regulation of 2000. Since then, there has been a sharp increase in the number of orphan drugs approved in the EU. Objectives: To assess whether the increase in orphan drug approvals has led to an evidence based improvement in patient relevant outcomes for a relevant number of patients with rare diseases. Methods: Results of health technology assessments (HTAs) of orphan drugs in Germany were analysed to determine the frequency of an added benefit (i.e. an improvement in patient relevant outcomes) compared to the standard of care. The evidence underlying these assessments was examined. Clustering of orphan drugs in certain therapeutic indications was evaluated by comparing approved indications with all known rare diseases. Results: No proof of added benefit was shown for 54% of the research questions on orphan drugs. This was mostly due to the lack of robust evidence compared to the standard of care. If there was a high unmet medical need in an indication, an added benefit was twice as likely. Clustering of orphan drugs was evident in oncology. Conclusions: Major evidence gaps exist for many orphan drugs, hampering informed treatment decisions by patients and doctors, potentially resulting in suboptimal care. While there are clusters of orphan drugs in some therapeutic indications, a large number of patients with rare diseases remain without adequate treatment options. Therefore, orphan drug regulations need to be reformed to improve the generation of robust evidence in comparison with the standard of care and guide research to indications with the highest unmet medical needs outside of existing clusters. Patient involvement: Patient representatives are regularly involved in German HTAs in an advisory capacity. Their opinions are taken into account for decisions on the added benefit of orphan drugs. [Mapping the Evidence Related to Health and Climate Change Mitigation](/colloquium-2023/session/1473409/mapping-the-evidence-related-to-health-and-climate-change-mitigation) Background: To avoid waste in research, we first need to establish what research has already been undertaken. The results of the mapping reviews can be used inform research priorities and research funding; however, presenting the results of an evidence mapping review visually can be challenging. Objectives: To explore how to visually present the research evidence landscape measuring or evaluating the public acceptability of local actions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and HMIC for relevant research, as well as reference checking of relevant articles and related reviews using the snowballing technique with six iterations. Articles met our inclusion criteria if they reported on empirical evidence (such as surveys or interviews) to evaluate the public acceptability of local actions (such as those involving clean air zones, eco-housing, land and waste management, and green energy supply) to mitigate climate change or provide adaptation and resilience strategies. We used the shiny app EviAtlas to present a summary of the research undertaken to date. We used evidence atlases to present the data by geographical location using the longitude and latitude of the stated locations and heat maps to visualize further details of the research categorized by type of local action. Results: A total of 1,074 records were retrieved, of which 116 representing 111 studies met our inclusion criteria. Using the evidence map feature in EviAtlas provided clear visualizations by location (Figure 1), and using the heat map feature in EviAtlas provided a longitudinal summary of the actions most commonly researched (Figure 2). Conclusions: Using the open software EviAtlas, we were able to provide research funders and those setting priority-setting agendas with a visualization of what research has been undertaken to date and where. EviAtlas may be particularly useful where geographical location is important and where there is a large number of included studies to summarize. Patient and public involvement was paramount to our research and helped focus the research on local action relevant to the public, particularly in relation to socioeconomic status. [Landscape of nutrition or diet-related randomised controlled trials: data from protocols published between 2012 and 2022](/colloquium-2023/session/1473838/landscape-of-nutrition-or-diet-related-randomised-controlled-trials-data-from-protocols-published-between-2012-and-2022) Background: As part of a project to consolidate reporting guidance for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), protocols of RCTs and systematic reviews of nutritional interventions, it was important to understand the nutrition interventions research landscape over the past decade. Objectives: To assess the nutrition or diet-related interventions research landscape using data from RCT protocols published as research articles between 2012 and 2022. Methods: We searched six databases for eligible protocols published between January 2012 and March 2022. Data extracted included bibliometrics, study scope (population, intervention, comparator, outcome and study design) and research transparency practices (protocol registration, conflicts of interest and funding statements, and mention of reporting guidelines). We screened the 'Instructions for Authors' webpages of each journal contributing publications to our sample to check whether they endorsed reporting guidelines. Results: We included 1,068 protocols. The frequency of publication of RCT protocols as research articles increased annually, with a mean of 161 (range: 155 to 163) publications per year. Healthy adults (n=342; 32.0%) and older individuals (n=350; 32.7%) made up the most frequent target population. Isolated nutrition or diet-related interventions (n=724; 67.8%) were most frequently studied, with supplementation (n=405; 37.9%) being the most common type of intervention. The most frequent primary outcome reported was clinical status (n=308; 28.8%). Most protocols the 148 journals in which the included protocols were published, general medical journals (n=518; 48.5%) contributed more publications than methods journals (n=479; 44.9%), and nutrition journals (n=71; 6.6%). The SPIRIT statement was endorsed by 33.8% (n=50) of the journals, CONSORT of publications, the authors mentioned SPIRIT, CONSORT and TIDieR, respectively. Most protocols (n=1,006; 94.2%) reported the study registration and included conflicts of interest (n=952; 89.1%) or funding (n=994; 93.2%) statements. Conclusions: The number of nutrition or diet-related RCT protocols being published as research articles is increasing over time, showing the importance of this type of publication. The adoption of research transparency practices by researchers and journals can still improve. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. [Construction of minimum data set for core outcome set in real-world settings: A data-driven approach](/colloquium-2023/session/1473471/construction-of-minimum-data-set-for-core-outcome-set-in-real-world-settings-a-data-driven-approach) Background: Hundreds of core outcome sets (COS) have been developed for standardized outcome reporting in clinical trials, whereas their usage in real-world settings is largely limited because of the data availability and difficulty in data cleansing. Although a few COS have matched core data sets (CDS), the CDS generally consist of description of data elements but lack of details on how to locate these elements in a given real-world databases and how the data elements are matched to each outcome in the COS. This study aimed to propose a data-driven approach to build minimum data set (MDS) for the COS. Study design: We used a set of healthcare quality measures and a set of real-world data elements, both released by the healthcare officials in China, as an illustrating example of building MDS for COS. We first compiled a data element set with the source and description of the data elements extracted. We also include a list of quality measures along with characteristics and calculation requirements. We then map the data elements to each of the quality measures according to their requirements and created a relational database that stores these mapping relationships. We then build a platform based on this relational database to allow an interface for the input of quality measures and the presentation of the outcome, which is the MDS that is calculated as the union set of the data elements mapped to the selected measures. Conclusion and implication: This is an ongoing project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The project innovatively applies the concept of MDS on COS by adopting a data-driven method to construct the MDS from existing real-world data instead of proposing an independent set of date elements based on experts' consensus. This approach should ease the effort on data cleansing for COS, saving the cost of extra data collection and promoting the more efficient use of existing real-world data. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: With the methodology proposed by this study, more core outcome sets can be applicable in real-world clinical practices instead of being largely restricted to clinical trials. [Methodological quality of systematic reviews on physical exercise for breast cancer patients. Meta-epidemiological study.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473890/methodological-quality-of-systematic-reviews-on-physical-exercise-for-breast-cancer-patients.-meta-epidemiological-study.) Background: Several clinical trials have been published in recent years to investigate the probable benefits of physical exercise for women with breast cancer. It is necessary to carry out systematic reviews using a rigorous methodology to ensure that decision-making is based on the best available evidence. However, systematic reviews that were not conducted according to transparent methodology, as recommended by Cochrane, may result in misleading findings about the effects of an intervention. Objectives: To map and critically assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews on physical activity for patients with breast cancer. Methods: A meta-epidemiological study including systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effects of physical exercise in patients with breast cancer. The search strategy was performed in MEDLINE (via PubMed) (July 1, 2022). Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers using the Rayyan platform. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Results: We included 57 systematic reviews published between 2006 and 2021, only randomized clinical trials on the effects of physical activity in patients with breast cancer. The results showed that 58% of the included reviews were classified as low or critically low quality. Only 10% were classified as high methodological quality and 32% as moderate quality. Furthermore, complete search strategies were presented in 54.4% of the reviews, and 59.6% fully described the search date; 61.4% had data and/or language restrictions and 52.6% performed additional manual searches. Conclusions: The findings of this study showed a methodological weakness of most systematic reviews on the effects of physical exercises for patients with breast cancer. Caution is needed on the part of health professionals, managers and policymakers in health, patients and the population when interpreting the applicability of these results, and it is suggested to conduct systematic reviews of high methodological quality to assist in the decision-making process. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The low-quality evidence on physical exercises for women with breast cancer could influence the effects of this intervention and impact the clinical practice recommendation. [CONSENSYS: an instrument to support CONtextual SENsitivity in SYStematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473855/consensys-an-instrument-to-support-contextual-sensitivity-in-systematic-reviews) Background: Systematic reviews are considered important in answering what works, for whom and in which circumstances. They often include a section on implications for policymakers and practitioners, in which they discuss relevant options to engage with. Implementation sections are coloured by the cultural background, theoretical and disciplinary perspective of the reviewers formulating them. They do not necessarily consider local contexts in which the evidence needs to be applied; hence, the recommendations may be too general to be useful. When policymakers and practitioners implement systematic review findings, the evidence presented needs to be translated to their local context. Methods: We applied a multimethod approach in two main phases: in a developmental phase, we conducted a literature review and inventoried theoretical models and frameworks addressing contextual dimensions affecting decision-making and extracted core theoretical categories from these models. We then conducted five transnational focus groups to investigate how to best translate research evidence into implications for practice and policy. Based on these results, we developed a draft of the guiding instrument. In a testing phase, we first conducted a face validity procedure by inviting comments from experts in the field and then piloted the instrument on existing review projects and an ongoing mixed-methods review. Results: CONSENSYS is an instrument in the form of a checklist. It contains 52 contextual factors categorised as either of ecological and sociocultural relevance or pitched as an influencing actor. CONSENSYS facilitates the transfer from review evidence into practice. Conclusions: CONSENSYS is a theoretical framework that serves as a structure thereby assisting (a) reviewers to formulate context-specific implications for policy and practice and (b) end users of systematic reviews to translate the review evidence into local contexts. It is the first rigorously developed instrument that focusses on implications for policy and practice sections in systematic reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We engaged practitioners, academics and policymakers in the focus group study. The face validity procedure of the drafted instrument was organized with reviewers and methodologists. [Values and preferences in asthma patients for health care decision making: a systematic literature review.](/colloquium-2023/session/1574251/values-and-preferences-in-asthma-patients-for-health-care-decision-making-a-systematic-literature-review.) Background: Effective asthma management requires clear communication between the patient and the healthcare provider. Patient values and preferences are the relative importance people place on health outcomes. Decisions for asthma treatments aligned with patient values and preferences may make treatments more readily adhered to. Objectives: To identify patients' and caregivers' values and preferences for asthma treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and to describe the instruments and/or techniques to determine them. Methods: Paired reviewers independently screened six databases from inception to February 2023. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of patients with asthma or their caregivers, eliciting values and preferences about ICS treatment. Results: Initially, we identified 25,429 studies in our searches. After title and abstract and full-text screening, we identified 10 quantitative and 10 qualitative studies that met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). From the 10 quantitative studies, 4 (40%) implemented a discrete choice approach to elicit utilities, 1 (10%) used EQ-5D-5l and visual analogue scales (VAS), 3 (30%) applied questionnaires or surveys), and 2 (20%) used discrete choice and willingness to pay (WTP). Regarding the qualitative studies, 8 studies (80%) were cross-sectional studies, 1 (10%) was a focus group study, and 1 (10%) was an ethnographic interview. Qualitative findings showed with moderate certainty evidence that fears about adverse events were a significant concern when patients and caregivers selected their preferred treatment and patients valued treatments capable of relieving symptoms (Table 1). Conclusions: From the quantitative studies, we have identified different techniques implemented for eliciting values and preferences in patients with asthma receiving ICS. In qualitative studies, we have found five key themes to address patient values and preferences in asthma treatment with ICS. Although we are still finalizing data extraction for quantitative studies, our findings suggest that multiple instruments and themes have been used to determine patients' values and preferences and how patients value the relative importance of the main health status. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our systematic review summarizes relevant research evidence about patient values and preferences for asthma treatment with ICS to facilitate the integration of values and preferences in healthcare decision processes. [Prevention and control of surgical site infection: preliminary results of a best practice implementation project](/colloquium-2023/session/1473877/prevention-and-control-of-surgical-site-infection-preliminary-results-of-a-best-practice-implementation-project) Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) can cause significant harm to the patient, such as increased length of stay, readmissions, suffering or even death. Depending on several factors, SSIs can occur in approximately 2%-5% of inpatient surgeries and, for certain types such as abdominal surgery, can range from 4%-25%. By preventing it, professionals can reduce the risk of adverse events and improve patient safety. Objectives: To implement evidence-based recommendations and promote compliance with the best evidence-based recommendations on prevention and control of SSIs in a central operating room. Methods: This project follows the JBI Evidence Implementation framework, which included three phases: i) Establishing a project team and undertaking the baseline audit; ii) Providing feedback and implementing strategies based on JBI Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) framework; and iii) A follow-up audit to assess the outcomes and plan for sustainability. Results: The project is being developed. A baseline audit was carried out (100-patient sample) and identified inconsistencies in professionals' adherence to the bundle of SSIs prevention and control interventions (9 criteria). Areas of noncompliance were highlighted (Figure 1), including inconsistent handover (9%), operating room doors unreasonably open too long (17%), and unaccomplished with trichotomy criteria (46%). Feedback was given to the staff team, and results were analysed against the nine criteria through discussion groups to identify the noncompliance causes. After, a root cause analysis identified four significant barriers: lack of knowledge regarding interventions bundle; unfamiliarity with a structured and standardized clinical handover; manual and obsolete doors; and reduced number of cutting machines. An intervention plan to mitigate barriers and increase compliance, a follow-up audit and a sustainability plan are under development. Conclusions: The improvement of compliance with those evidence-based recommendations will reduce adverse events associated with SSIs in inpatient surgeries in this central operating room. Consequently, we hope that this project will lead to better health outcomes, with a positive impact on patients' safety, costs and healthcare quality. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. [Investigating Impact of Dietary Patterns: Can Consistent Findings Between Controlled Trials and Observational Evidence Improve Confidence?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473850/investigating-impact-of-dietary-patterns-can-consistent-findings-between-controlled-trials-and-observational-evidence-improve-confidence) Background: Designs of studies examining dietary patterns (DPs) carry different limitations including short durations and conditions not reflective of the real world in controlled trials (CTs) and confounders associated with dietary choices and health outcomes in observational studies (OSs). Examining both study designs may allow for a more accurate understanding of the impact of DPs. Objective: To compare the direction of findings, effect sizes and certainty of evidence (COE) between CTs and OSs examining the relationship between a vegan DP and body mass index (BMI). Methods: An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) was conducted by healthcare consumers by searching five databases for SRs published from 2018 to January 2023 that examined adults in the general population who followed a vegan, compared with a nonvegetarian, DP. SRs could include primary studies with any study design. If COE was not assessed in included SRs, authors assessed COE for CTs and OSs separately using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method. Results: A total of 524 abstracts were screened, 73 full SRs were reviewed, and 5 SRs examined the impact of a vegan diet on BMI. Three SRs included 11 CTs ranging from 12 to 26 weeks in duration and concluded that a vegan diet reduced BMI compared with no intervention or another intervention diet. However, nearly all included CTs demonstrated some risk of bias and sample sizes were relatively small, resulting in low COE. Two SRs focused on OSs, summarized 67 cross-sectional and cohort studies, many reflecting several years of follow-up, and described low risk of bias in individual studies. COE was not marked down for any domain but was low owing to study design. Pooled mean effect size from OSs (-1.72 kg/m2) was similar to the range in mean reduction found in CTs comparing a vegan diet with no intervention (no pooled data; mean reduction from -1.03 to -3.90 kg/m2). Conclusion: Interpreting the full body of evidence when examining the impact of a DP revealed consistent findings across study designs and led to improved confidence in findings. Methodologists may consider upgrading OSs for plausible confounding if results are consistent with CTs. [Dissemination of Evidence-Based Medicine by Taiwan Evidence-Based Medicine Association](/colloquium-2023/session/1473438/dissemination-of-evidence-based-medicine-by-taiwan-evidence-based-medicine-association) Background: Taiwan Evidence-Based Medicine Association (TEBMA) was established in 2007 to promote the implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). It is not clear what impact TEBMA has on the dissemination of EBM. Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate how TEBMA disseminated EBM in Taiwan. Methods: We reviewed the annual reports of TEBMA. In addition, we interviewed the stakeholders of TEBMA to investigate the effectiveness of the activities of TEBMA. Results: Over the 15 years, TEBMA provided abundant EBM-related activities, such as workshops, annual conferences, and EBM competitions. A variety of workshops were conducted every 1 to 2 months with the duration of 8-12 hours for beginners, instructors, advanced experts, and researchers. The lectures comprise basic and advanced implementation, such as how to teach EBM, how to conduct systematic review and meta-analysis, and how to implement EBM. Invited lecturers came from worldwide, such as Taiwan, Singapore, America, and so on. The average number of attendees for workshops was about 350 each year. There were decreased numbers of attendees to 200 each year in the recent three years of COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, there was a steady increase in the publication of EBM-related articles in Taiwan, especially in systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, TEBMA has hosted national conferences since 2008. The average number of attendees from hospitals and universities in Taiwan for the annual conference was about 450 each year. Furthermore, TEBMA set up a peer-reviewed journal called Evidence Counts with two issues each year. Overall, the active members of TEBMA are increasing year by year. Members have a privileged discount for all activities above. Conclusions: TEBMA has important achievements in the dissemination of EBM. With the efforts of TEBMA to promote EBM, EBM has been an accredited important skill for personal career and hospital management. The establishment of TEBMA is successful in the promotion of EBM. Our findings provide evidence to show a model in the dissemination of EBM. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Development of a theoretical framework to support health-system guidance implementation using a critical interpretive synthesis approach](/colloquium-2023/session/1473659/development-of-a-theoretical-framework-to-support-health-system-guidance-implementation-using-a-critical-interpretive-synthesis-approach) Background: As systematically developed statements regarding possible courses of action, health system guidance (HSG) can assist policymakers with developing or adjusting policies, just as physicians modify their practice based on clinical guidelines. However, there are conceptual and methodological challenges in HSG implementation due to the complexity of health-system policymaking and vast differences in contexts. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and well-organized theoretical framework to support HSG implementation. Objectives: To develop a theoretical framework concerning the facilitators of, barriers to and strategies for HSG implementation at the individual, organizational, community and system levels. Methods: We applied a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) approach to synthesize the findings from a range of relevant literature. We searched 11 electronic databases and seven organizational websites. Also, purposive sampling of the literature was conducted to fill the identified conceptual gaps. The included papers were assessed by relevance and five quality criteria. We developed a standardized form for extracting information and used an interpretive analytic approach to synthesize the findings. (Registration PROSPERO CRD42020214072) Results: A total of 159,983 documents were retrieved, with 90,597 unique documents after the removal of duplicates. After the independent two-phase screening, a total of 15 documents published between 2009 and 2020 were finally included for analysis. In terms of study type, 11 (73%) were empirical studies (e.g., interviews and before-and-after study), whereas the remaining 4 (27%) were nonempirical studies (e.g., handbooks and theory papers). The theoretical framework included the facilitators, barriers and strategies for HSG implementation at the individual (including provider and patient/public), organizational, community and system (including health and political systems) levels (Figure 1). Detailed tables about specific themes will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: A new theoretical framework about facilitators, barriers and strategies for HSG implementation was developed using a CIS approach. The HSG implementation framework could be widely used for supporting the implementation of HSG covering varied topics and in different contexts. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: As for the individual level in the theoretical framework, we summarized the factors and strategies at the patient/public level because they are the important stakeholder during the HSG implementation process. [Utilizing evidence of Cochrane in decision making by policy makers: Gaps needs to be filled](/colloquium-2023/session/1541958/utilizing-evidence-of-cochrane-in-decision-making-by-policy-makers-gaps-needs-to-be-filled) Background: Cochrane helps in generating evidence across the world by collecting, analyzing and critically appraising the findings of different languages. A total of 90% of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were cited by at least one Cochrane review. Most of the reviews are of low or moderate level of evidence. There is a strong need to improve this certainty of evidence, especially health issues related to developing countries, to utilize resources adequately and efficiently. Objectives: What are the major gaps in decision-making by policy makers, and how can these gaps be filled? Methods: We searched different websites for health priorities in India and related present evidence by Cochrane. For various health issues, evidence is of very low/low/moderate level, and evidence even is lacking for research questions. Results: The lack of evidence was mainly found in intervention due to difference in treatment and difference in nature and severity of disease, concomitantly taking more than one treatment/alternative form the therapy such as Ayurveda, Homeopathic, and unpublished data, etc. Various suggestive gaps need to be filled by facilitating clinical trial in medical institutions, training and encouraging all the steps required in conducting interventional studies, including translational research with faster approval for intellectual property rights and including regulatory approvals. There is need to encourage clinical trial in Ayurveda/homeopathic with standardization of interventions and methodology. Publications need to be encouraged by master and PhD students from these healthcare establishments. Conclusions: Founded major gaps are at various levels such as participants level, institutional level, technical and financial agencies, etc. The role of Cochrane affiliate centers is very crucial in not only helping in training but also informing about steps to be taken by policy makers to generate evidence. This will help them to make informed decisions on various health priorities. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Involving participants in filling these gaps is very important to find out how better can be resources utilized by policy makers and Cochrane affiliate centers. [Nocturnal enuresis in children: Rapid scoping review and semi-structured interviews to inform development of a core outcome set](/colloquium-2023/session/1473672/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-rapid-scoping-review-and-semi-structured-interviews-to-inform-development-of-a-core-outcome-set) Background: Quantitative synthesis of interventional studies is challenging owing to variations in outcome measures (domain, measurement, metric, aggregation and timepoints) and missing outcome data. Additionally, the relevance of outcome measures to people with lived experience is often unknown. Cochrane Incontinence planned to harmonise outcomes across reviews to ensure relevancy and quality. Objectives: To facilitate the development of a core outcome set (COS) for use in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews by generating a list of outcome measures. Methods: Following COMET methodology, this work used a mixed-methods design comprising a scoping review and semistructured interviews. Nine databases were searched for outcome measures reported in RCTs and systematic reviews published from 2017 to 2022 (search date: 11/05/2022). A date restriction was applied, limiting the synthesised articles to those published between 2018 and 2022. Eligibility was children with enuresis (all subtypes), all interventions, comparators and outcomes. Two reviewers screened 20% of the records at both screening stages, with one screening the remaining. Two reviewers piloted the data extraction form with 10 articles, with one extracting the remaining articles. Semistructured interviews took place online (April to June 2022) with a convenience sample of six participants recruited by snowballing utilising existing contacts with patient organisations and professional bodies. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed abductively using the framework method. Findings were integrated into the COMET taxonomy within five core outcome areas (mortality, physiological and clinical, life impact, resource use, and adverse events). Results: One hundred twenty-eight outcomes were extracted verbatim from 38 synthesised articles and charted to the taxonomy alongside 262 codes generated from the interview transcripts. Enuretic episodes were a commonly reported outcome domain identified as important by participants. However, heterogeneity exists in descriptions, timings and measurements. In contrast to patient preferences, outcome domains relating to life impact and resource use were lacking in scoping review findings, possibly due to a focus on trials. Conclusions: Reviews of interventions for treating nocturnal enuresis could be more relevant to people with lived experiences by capturing social, role and emotional functioning. In addition, outcome measures relating to enuretic episodes should be standardised to facilitate meta-analysis. Subsequent multistakeholder stages are required to finalise the development of a COS. [Three living systematic reviews to inform living guideline recommendations in Germany: lessons learned](/colloquium-2023/session/1473699/three-living-systematic-reviews-to-inform-living-guideline-recommendations-in-germany-lessons-learned) Background: Living systematic reviews (LSRs) are increasingly used to inform decision-makers and guideline developers to achieve the best available care for patients. However, conducting and updating LSRs to support decision-making remains a challenge. Objectives: To discuss challenges faced in three LSRs, which were used to inform living guideline recommendations in Germany. Methods: In collaboration between systematic reviewers and guideline developers, recommendations from three guidelines with quickly evolving evidence were prioritized. For the prioritization process, a preliminary set of criteria was developed. Over a period of 9-12 months, LSRs were conducted and updated every 3 months. The LSRs assessed the effectiveness and safety of a) COVID-19 vaccines in children, b) E-cigarettes for smoking cessation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and c) sacubitril/valsartan and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 in heart failure. Results of each LSR were presented to the respective guideline groups that assessed the need for modifying the recommendations. We describe challenges based on the experience of systematic reviewers and guideline developers that were additionally assessed within qualitative interviews. Results: During the conduct of LSRs to inform guideline recommendations, we experienced challenges regarding 1.) the prioritization of the guideline recommendations to be updated, which had to match to the needs of the guideline developers and resources of the systematic reviewers, 2.) the harmonisation of LSR and guideline processes, including the coordination of meetings and timely presentation of new evidence to guideline developers, and 3.) methodological challenges such as the inclusion of various study designs, adaption to epidemiological developments (e.g. COVID-19 variants), and changes of the inclusion criteria for each version of the LSR. Conclusions: LSRs that inform guideline recommendations require a sensitive interplay between guideline developers and systematic reviewers. Systematic reviewers and guideline developers are encouraged to discuss possible challenges in the protocol stage and throughout the whole process of the LSR. [A Scoping Review of Published and Ongoing Prospective Meta-Analyses in Health Research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473782/a-scoping-review-of-published-and-ongoing-prospective-meta-analyses-in-health-research) Background: Prospective meta-analyses (PMA) may reduce many of the issues that can occur in retrospective meta-analyses, such as reducing biases in publication and selective outcome reporting. However, common misunderstandings of the PMA methodology remain, leading to inappropriate and/or suboptimal implementation by researchers. Objectives: To investigate the landscape of the published and ongoing prospective meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically searched the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) for PMAs from inception to January 2023, and two reviewers screened these studies in COVIDENCE. The results of this search were combined with a search of medical databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) up to 2018 to capture PMAs that started prior to the launch and subsequently increasingly wide implementation of PROSPERO in 2011. All PMAs conducted in human health research were eligible for inclusion. All records were double-screened, and data were double extracted, with conflicts resolved through consensus. Results: We identified 1,445 studies in the PROSPERO search. One hundred thirty-two were screened at full text, and 32 were identified as PMAs. These identified PMAs were combined with the 43 articles of the second search of medical databases for extraction and analysis. We found that the number of published PMAs has been increasing over time (Figure 1). PMAs have been conducted across a range of health areas, and across all continents. Identified PMAs varied reporting on details, such as collaboration structure, or methods used to identify studies for inclusion. There were 1,091 records on PROSPERO that claimed to be a PMA but were found not to meet the eligibility criteria because they were including studies retrospectively. Conclusions: Whilst PMAs are increasing in numbers, many researchers still do not understand what a PMA constitutes, with over 1,000 standard meta-analyses on PROSPERO falsely labelling themselves as PMAs. In addition, reporting of PMAs is currently inconsistent and lacks important details. Therefore, a standardised procedure for reporting PMAs and greater education on this method are crucial to facilitate the conduct and interpretation of impactful PMAs. This scoping review will help inform the development of such standardised reporting tools. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Cochrane International Mobility Opportunity. A global exchange programme for the Cochrane Community](/colloquium-2023/session/1473697/cochrane-international-mobility-opportunity.-a-global-exchange-programme-for-the-cochrane-community) Background: The Cochrane International Mobility programme provides networking opportunities for people to learn from Cochrane colleagues in different parts of the world. The structure connects people and locations, facilitating exchange that enhances international collaboration and sharing best practice within Cochrane. The programme is open to anyone interested in contributing to Cochrane's work. Cochrane Centres in Sweden, Austria, Italy, and The Netherlands began this initiative with several successful student exchanges. Online courses replaced in-person internships during Covid. The Neurological Sciences Field, following their past experience with in-person training courses in different European countries, including two residential 'Summer Schools' held in Umbria, Italy (2018-2019), decided to offer a one-year online course in 2020. An opportunity, given Covid restrictions, to continue training Cochrane methodology. Objectives: Training new Cochrane review authors, knowledgeable in Cochrane methodology, with the aim of working together to produce a Cochrane systematic review. Methods: The online course was published through Cochrane TaskExchange; applications from neurologists and trainees living and working in different parts of the world were received. Six professionals were accepted, two in the US, two in Italy, one in Syria, one in Colombia. The course began in November 2020 and ended in December 2021 (Image 1). Five online lessons (Fig. 1) and five workshops with expert lecturers were organized (Fig. 2). Exercises were carried out in small groups between each lesson or workshop. Outcomes: Publication and successive citations of the review will represent outcome measures. Conclusions: Choosing a topic relevant to end-users and working together with course experts and the PaPaS CRG was an enthusiastic experience for new Cochrane authors. The review title proposed is 'Prophylactic treatment with monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway for migraine prevention.' The protocol has been submitted following Cochrane's new editorial board process. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Migraines affect over one billion people worldwide and is one of the most common neurological disorders. The review can be of widespread interest for those affected (children, young people, and adults) who suffer from migraine, also evaluating the effectiveness and safety of high-cost pharmaceutical drugs not always available all over the world. [Risk Ratio vs Odds Ratio: Optimal presentation in GRADE evidence profiles](/colloquium-2023/session/1473757/risk-ratio-vs-odds-ratio-optimal-presentation-in-grade-evidence-profiles) Background: Evidence profiles (EPs), used for evidence-to-decision processes by guideline developers, present relative effects, baseline risk, and risk difference (RD). Because of ease of interpretation, reviewers most often report risk ratios (RR) and calculate RD with 95% CI through application of the RR to baseline risk. Objectives: To highlight limitations of applying RR to baseline risk for RD calculation in EPs. Methods: Through methods support for a World Health Organization guideline, we produced EPs summarizing the effectiveness of specially formulated foods compared with counselling alone in children with moderate wasting on anthropometric recovery (desirable outcome). We wanted to present the RD stratified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Without receiving SFFs, patients with MUAC in the lower end of the moderate wasting range (115 to 119 mm; worse prognosis) had a 50% chance of anthropometric recovery, whereas those in the higher end (120 to < 125mm; better prognosis) had a 72% chance. We initially applied the treatment effect to the baseline probability of each prognostic group, encountered problems, and identified a solution. Results: As absolute effects of treatments are always larger in those with a higher baseline risk of poor outcomes, we anticipated finding greater benefit in patients with worse prognosis compared with patients with better prognosis. However, applying the RR to each baseline chance produced counterintuitive results. Applying the treatment RR of 1.29 produced an RD of 145 more anthropometric recoveries per 1,000 for those with worse prognosis and 207 more per 1,000 for those with better prognosis, suggesting that children with better prognosis will achieve greater benefit compared with those with worse prognosis. We subsequently changed the output from RR to OR, which resulted in 180 more anthropometric recoveries per 1,000 in those with worse prognosis and 125 more per 1,000 in those with better prognosis. This RD agreed with our expectation that patients with worse prognosis can expect greater benefit from the intervention. Conclusions: When the probability of a desirable outcome is high, OR applied to the baseline probability will yield a more accurate estimate of absolute benefit than the RR. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. [Are patient-reported outcomes evaluated in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses regarding reconstruction methods after distal gastrectomy?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473738/are-patient-reported-outcomes-evaluated-in-randomized-controlled-trials-and-meta-analyses-regarding-reconstruction-methods-after-distal-gastrectomy) Background: Reconstruction method following gastrectomy affects the quality of life, which is often measured by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Incorporating PROs within clinical trials provides a patient's perspective for shared decision-making among patients and healthcare providers. However, it remains unclear how much attention is paid to PROs when conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses (MAs) regarding reconstructions after distal gastrectomy. Objectives: To evaluate how many RCTs and MAs incorporate PROs, and how the PRO is reported in RCTs. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis. We comprehensively searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for topics that included gastrectomy and reconstruction. We included patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. We included RCTs and MAs comparing postoperative outcomes among reconstruction types. We described the number of RCTs which measured PROs and MAs which incorporated PROs into the outcomes and then assessed the completion of the CONSORT-PRO checklist adaptation for all RCTs reporting PROs. Results: We identified 18 articles on 13 studies, and 10 articles of systematic reviews with MA. Of the 13 RCTs, 7 studies (53.8%) measured PROs, including quality-of-life and study-specific questionnaires. However, no article completes the CONSORT-PRO checklist adaptation. The remaining six studies assessed surgical outcomes (e.g., reconstruction time, postoperative complications) and endoscopic findings of gastritis (e.g. RGB score) without PROs. In terms of systematic reviews with MA, only one study (10%), a Cochrane Review, set PROs as the outcome. Four studies of the remaining 9 included non-randomized studies. Conclusions: Our study found a disparity between the use of PROs in RCTs and these of MAs. No RCTs using PROs adhered to the CONSORT-PRO adaptation. Our findings suggest that RCTs assessing postoperative quality of life among reconstruction types need to improve PRO reporting, and future MAs should incorporate PROs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: As reconstruction methods affect postoperative quality of life, shared decision-making in surgery is necessary among patients and medical personnel. There was no direct patient or healthcare consumer in this project, but the increasing number of accurate reporting PROs in RCTs and MAs will become direct benefits to these groups. [Reproducibility in Systematic Reviews used to Inform Clinical Practice Guidelines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473683/reproducibility-in-systematic-reviews-used-to-inform-clinical-practice-guidelines) Background: Published research is typically considered to be trustworthy. Research organizations use publications as one of the main ways to assess researcher performance for hiring, promotion and tenure. One assumption of trustworthy science is that an independent research team could reproduce similar results when conducting the same study. Several large-scale collaborations, however, have documented poor reproducibility across different disciplines. Poor reproducibility is particularly relevant in medicine but has not been well examined. Systematic reviews (SRs) are often used, and in some jurisdictions mandated, to inform clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide patient management. If SRs used to inform CPGs cannot be reproduced, this might influence the guidance recommended by CPGs for patient care. Objectives: The goal of this project is to investigate the reproducibility of SRs used in CPGs. Methods: We will hand search all CPGs published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; UK), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, and the National Health and Medical Research Council, as well as more than 1000 CPGs from the Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Evidence Alliance asset map. From this sample, we will randomly select two CPGs per entity and identify the index SR (with meta-analysis) used in developing each respective CPG. If CPGs have used more than one source SR, we will randomly select one. We will also examine whether any of the selected SRs have been used in other CPGs. Planned Analysis: All SRs will be assessed for (1) their reporting quality (using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] 2020) and methodological quality (using AMSTAR-2 [A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews]); (2) their sharing of data, analytical code, and other materials (e.g., manual of psychological therapy) used in their meta-analysis; and (3) consistency in results of our re-analyses of all eight SRs (i.e., average effect sizes; statistical significance of results, and p-values) compared to the originally published ones. Expected Outcomes: This is an important study because very few researchers have focused on reproducibility issues within medicine. We will update our EQUATOR Canada Publication School module on reproducibility using the findings from this research. Patient involvement: We will collaborate with patient partners to obtain feedback on our analyses, interpretation, and communication of findings. [Can the Cochrane RCT classifier be used to speed up screening for a qualitative evidence synthesis? A retrospective evaluation](/colloquium-2023/session/1473778/can-the-cochrane-rct-classifier-be-used-to-speed-up-screening-for-a-qualitative-evidence-synthesis-a-retrospective-evaluation) Background: Study selection is time and resource intensive. Using machine learning to identify studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria can decrease time use. The Cochrane randomized controlled trial (RCT) classifier has been trained to recognize and classify RCTs into two categories: likely or unlikely to be an RCT. The quick identification of references\u2014for example, RCTs, which are unlikely to meet the inclusion criteria of a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)\u2014can speed up the study selection process. Objectives: The first objective of this study is to evaluate whether we can use the Cochrane RCT classifier to identify nonqualitative studies that can be excluded or deprioritized during screening for a QES. The second objective is to evaluate whether there is a cutoff point in the likely-to-be-an-RCT category beyond which no qualitative studies are lost. Methods: Using a preidentified number of QES, we will perform the following: - extract the included studies; - run them through the Cochrane RCT Classifier in EPPI Reviewer - map studies that are predicted \"likely to be an RCT\" - create a combined map of the predictions for all included studies across the included QES; and - explore the studies that are classified as having a high likelihood of being an RCT to determine how they are different from the other included studies that were not given this classification. Results: This retrospective evaluation is ongoing (completion June 2023). The results will be the map over qualitative studies that were classified as likely to be an RCT as well as the overview of how these studies are different from the studies that did not receive this classification. Conclusions: Based on the mapping of the studies, we will conclude whether there is a threshold that reviewers can apply to automatically exclude or deprioritize studies based on their high likelihood of being an RCT. This would enable reviewers to screen faster and prioritize certain search hits for screening above others. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Speeding up the review process allows evidence to become available faster to consumers. Qualitative research brings consumer perspectives forward. [Overcoming challenges in network meta-analyses of non-pharmacological trials: Experiences from a Cochrane review on physical exercise in Parkinson\u00b4s disease](/colloquium-2023/session/1473676/overcoming-challenges-in-network-meta-analyses-of-non-pharmacological-trials-experiences-from-a-cochrane-review-on-physical-exercise-in-parkinson\u00b4s-disease) Background: Although network meta-analysis (NMA) allows to compare multiple interventions in a single analysis by combining direct and indirect evidence, this technique introduces several challenges to authors of systematic reviews (SR) especially in the field of non-pharmacological trials, e.g., in clustering interventions, analyzing poorly reported safety outcomes, and presenting key results. Objectives: To present solutions to challenges specific to NMAs of non-pharmacological trials implemented in a Cochrane review on physical exercise in Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We clustered physical exercise in N=156 eligible studies adapting the ProFaNE taxonomy developed to categorize falls prevention trials for the elderly (Lamb 2011) in order to compare the effects of various exercise types in an NMA. Although we rated the confidence in the evidence using CINeMA (Nikolakopoulou 2020) for our primary efficacy outcomes, we summarized poorly reported safety data narratively and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (Sch\u00fcnemann 2022). We additionally created an interactive Summary of Findings (iSoF) table using the MATCH-IT tool (https://magicevidence.org/match-it) to present key results beyond the information included in conventional SoF tables. Results: Our approach to cluster interventions allowed us to compare the effects of a wide range of exercise types representing a realistic picture of current treatment options in PD in an NMA. Combining quantitative and narrative analyses, we systematically synthesized both efficacy and safety data to the most informative degree possible given the available evidence. Integrating an iSoF table enabled us to present key results, including available data, confidence in the evidence, and intervention effects for multiple outcomes and multiple interventions in a clear and consumer-friendly way. Conclusions: We provide solutions for several challenges faced when conducting a Cochrane review with NMA on physical exercise in PD. Our approach may guide authors of SRs with NMAs of non-pharmacological trials in clustering interventions, analyzing poorly reported safety outcomes, and presenting key results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our work supports authors who conduct SRs in dealing with challenges specific to NMAs of non-pharmacological trials, including consumer-friendly presentation of key results. It may, therefore, contribute to producing robust evidence syntheses that are relevant and informative for consumers. [Building Partnerships Across the Systematic Review Community in the United States: Efforts by the AHRQ EPC Program](/colloquium-2023/session/1473870/building-partnerships-across-the-systematic-review-community-in-the-united-states-efforts-by-the-ahrq-epc-program) Background: The Scientific Resource Center (SRC) supports the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program in convening meetings to build partnerships across the evidence-synthesis community. We explore a range of meeting formats to encourage interactive discussion, embrace complexity of commonly faced issues in systematic reviews (SRs), and problem-solve collectively. Objective: To disseminate recent efforts in the EPC Program to build partnerships amongst the US SR community. Methods: In celebration of the EPC Program's 25th anniversary, we hosted three virtual \"Grand Rounds\" style-sessions in 2022. Meeting participants hailed from the EPC Program, US Cochrane Network, Guidelines International Network - North America, Society for Research Synthesis Methods, US Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) Network, Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program, and the Center for Evidence-Based Policy. Sessions most often utilized a roundtable panel format, with ample time reserved for polling and discussion amongst audience members. Results: Our virtual Grand Rounds series provided attendees with diverse perspectives on complex problems faced in evidence-based practice (EBP). Speakers were leaders in EBP who made significant contributions to the EPC Program before assuming other roles in clinical practice leadership, policy, and research funding. Speakers provided the following lessons learned for systematic reviewers: have a clearly defined partner and adequately understanding their expectations; ensure common understanding of end-user needs at all staff levels to improve project success; use 'failures' as opportunities for learning; consider the tradeoffs between cost, time, and quality in scoping a review; and match the rigor of review methods to the requirements of the decision being faced. Conclusion: Systematic reviewers need to leverage existing expertise and rapidly share best practices to create nimble and responsive evidence synthesis systems of the future. The EPC Program has demonstrated commitment to building partnerships and infrastructure to further support collaboration amongst the evidence synthesis community, advance SR methodology, and ultimately improve the quality and trustworthiness of SRs for decision-makers. Relevance to patients: The EPC Program meeting series offers systematic reviewers the opportunity to refine procedures, advance review methodology, and rapidly share best-practices, which, in turn, produces more trustworthy SRs for healthcare decision-makers. [Epidemiology, reporting characteristics and PRISMA-NMA adherence of systematic reviews with network meta-analysis: a meta-research study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473667/epidemiology-reporting-characteristics-and-prisma-nma-adherence-of-systematic-reviews-with-network-meta-analysis-a-meta-research-study) Background: Network meta-analyses (NMA) have become increasingly popular as innovative techniques to compare multiple interventions within a network of studies. Objective: To examine the epidemiology, reporting characteristics and adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-NMA extension of a representative sample of published systematic reviews (SRs) with NMAs. Methods: Cross-sectional study (protocol at https://osf.io/pa6dz/). We searched Pubmed for NMAs indexed during January 2023. We extracted epidemiological (e.g., journal, country, authors, NMA focus) and reporting (e.g., number of studies, participants, nodes of interventions, outcomes, statistics, certainty of the evidence, PRISMA-NMA checklist, protocol registration) characteristics. Overall adherence to PRISMA-NMA was evaluated. Data were analyzed descriptively. Correlation analysis will be conducted to explore the characteristics that might affect quality of reporting by May 2023. Results: A sample of 110 NMAs was included. Overall, 77.3% of NMAs were published on specialty journals with a median IF of 4.8 (IQR 2.9-6.4) and had a median number of 7 authors (IQR 2-11) often based in China (52.7%). The majority of NMAs focused on therapeutics (92.7%), primarily targeting cardiovascular diseases (21.8%) (Table 1). Types of interventions addressed were mainly pharmacological (59.0%). On average, each NMA included 21 studies (median, IQR 12-43) with 3695 participants (median, IQR 1525-12404). The majority (61.82%) prospectively registered a study protocol, reported four outcomes (median, IQR 2-7) including 7 nodes (median, IQR 4 - 12). Two-thirds (65.5%) reported having followed PRISMA-NMA, whereas one-third (35.5%) used GRADE to rate certainty of the evidence (Table 2). Preliminary results based on 10% of the sample (n=12) showed a median adherence to PRISMA-NMA items was 71.4% (35 out of 49 items, IQR 32.5-37.2). The less reported items were as follows: protocol registration, limitation and funding in abstracts, synthesis of results and geometry of network in methods, and results sections (Figure 1). Conclusions: Most NMAs, focused on pharmacological interventions, are published in specialty journals with high impact factors but their quality of reporting can be easily improved. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: A more widely adherence to reporting guideline of NMA should be endorsed by authors and journals for letting stakeholders understand, assess, and trust this evidence. [Collaboration across languages through the Cochrane network increases the amount of evidence](/colloquium-2023/session/1473661/collaboration-across-languages-through-the-cochrane-network-increases-the-amount-of-evidence) Background: Bibliographic databases and trial registers must be searched in Cochrane reviews. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase are mandatory to search, while ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal are considered the most important to search. According to Technical Supplement 4, searching appropriate national and regional databases is desirable. However, it may be challenging to acquire and assess non-English records. We encountered this while conducting a Cochrane review and reached out to Cochrane China for assistance. Objectives: To report the effects and the experience of collaboration across languages and continents in a Cochrane review. Methods: The search methods were published in the protocol. This included forward citation searches, which led to the identification of Chinese literature on the subject. The first author spoke and could read Chinese but was not a native speaker. When Chinese evidence started to gather, we reached out to Cochrane China. They immediately provided us with a capable native Chinese coauthor with good skills in written English, who assisted in review conduct and fulfilled all authorship criteria. Results: The search in the standard databases and trial registers resulted in five of the included trials (355 participants). The search through other sources (mainly forward citation search) almost tripled the amount of evidence identified, resulting in 10 additional trials (658 participants) and 2 trials awaiting classification (194 participants). To facilitate the review conduct, assistance was needed from a native Chinese author. The selection of studies, data extraction and bias assessment were done independently. Several online meetings were held to confirm decisions. To facilitate these, both sides needed assistance from a native Chinese speaker and a person from Cochrane China more familiar with spoken English, respectively. Further reference search, identification of reports and contact to study authors were also conducted in collaboration with the native Chinese coauthor. Conclusions: Evidence collected outside the search in databases and trial registers can considerably increase the amount of evidence. However, to access and evaluate these data, collaboration across Cochrane centres may be needed. This can result in a fruitful collaboration and the involvement of native-speaking coauthors. [Addressing racial health inequity: systematic review of systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473865/addressing-racial-health-inequity-systematic-review-of-systematic-reviews) Background: Racialized populations are affected by the sociopolitical and historical context in which they live. For example, African American and Black people face persistent discrimination and exclusion in the United States. Reducing racism and its negative consequences is a key global priority . Objectives: Our primary aim is to assess methods to center racial health equity in systematic reviews. Our secondary aim is to describe the evidence base on types of interventions for addressing racial health inequities. Methods: We developed a theory-based overview of systematic reviews to evaluate methods and map the evidence base on systematic reviews of effectiveness on reducing racial inequities. We use the Dahlgren-Whitehead rainbow model to describe policy entry points to tackle health inequities and employ a framework for reducing racial inequities to classify types of policies. We used a comprehensive search strategy in MEDLINE, Psychinfo, the Cochrane library, and Campbell systematic reviews, designed with a librarian scientist. We included systematic reviews focused on reducing racial health inequity in a high-income country setting published in 2020-2022. Two independent reviewers screened studies at the title and abstract and full-text levels. We will collect data and appraise quality in duplicate using a pre-tested form. Results: We screened more than 7,500 titles and abstracts. We identified 433 articles for full-text review. The analysis will summarize methods used to address racial inequity in health and generate evidence and gap map of systematic reviews focused on effectiveness of interventions to address systemic and structural racial inequities. Conclusions: This systematic review and evidence map is part of a larger project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, on centering racial inequity in systematic reviews and will be used to inform a priority-setting exercise to establish the future phases of research to advance knowledge on reducing racial inequity. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This project has an advisory board which includes people with lived experience of racial inequity. One of the parallel projects is conducting a listening exercise with people with lived experience of inequities which will inform the priority setting phase. [Mentorship, Community, and Evidence Synthesis Across Borders: Experiences of Cochrane US Year 2 Mentees](/colloquium-2023/session/1473856/mentorship-community-and-evidence-synthesis-across-borders-experiences-of-cochrane-us-year-2-mentees) Background: Sustainable improvement of availability, access, and adoption of trusted health evidence for all requires intentional effort to train and engage students and early- and mid-career professionals in evidence synthesis (ES), especially those from low- and middle-income countries, non-English speaking, and historically marginalized populations. The Cochrane US Mentoring Program is a mentorship-based community that enables participants to become proficient in ES and build a professional network beyond geographical borders. Cochrane US Year 2 (Y2) comprises 27 mentees, 18 mentors, and myriad volunteers from 23 countries. Objective: To describe our experiences as Y2 mentees in building skills in ES, knowledge translation, multi-language strategies, organizing events, and making lasting connections at Cochrane and beyond. Engagement Activities: Within the Y2 mentorship program, we have engaged in various activities, including attending monthly seminars, regular meetings with mentors to partner on projects, completing Cochrane training, and participating in Cochrane Crowd and CochranEngage initiatives. We have shared their stories through #MyStory on Cochrane.org. We have also organized webinars, social media campaigns, and panels for World Evidence-Based Health Care Day and International Women's Day. Lessons Learned: Through this program, we have gained skills in ES and also learned how capacity-building initiatives like this can break down silos and remove other constraints, such as financial limitations and access. Our shared passion for evidence-based health care in building networks beyond borders and across institutions is an important and transferable skill. We understand the importance of clear communication, particularly with respect to cultures and languages. In our evidence-based healthcare advocacy work, we recognize the crucial connection between ES and improved health outcomes. Conclusions: Thanks to the efforts and in-kind contributions of program volunteers, we are gaining skills in ES and opening doors for professional opportunities. We hope to become mentors and share new knowledge with colleagues. We also aspire to evaluate this program's impact on mentees' knowledge and skills in ES. Future expansion of capacity-building strategies, such as this mentorship program, will support equity, accessibility, and engagement in Cochrane, ultimately supporting Cochrane's mission of better health outcomes for patients and populations. [Post COVID-19 - lessons from a living systematic literature search on treatment and rehabilitation](/colloquium-2023/session/1473646/post-covid-19---lessons-from-a-living-systematic-literature-search-on-treatment-and-rehabilitation) Background In 2021, the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) was commissioned by the Swedish Government to continuously evaluate the scientific evidence for treatment and rehabilitation of patients with Post COVID-19. A living systematic review was launched with regularly updated literature searches and the results published on the SBU website on a weekly basis. Objectives To describe the ad hoc methodology used for a continuous and systematic search for the Post COVID-19 literature. Methods To find the most recent published research studies, a comprehensive search in Medline was performed every week via alerts. Every month, five additional databases were searched. Also, reference lists and citations for relevant primary studies and reviews were screened. The searches were performed from April 2021 up to June 2022. The project group also continuously tracked COVID-19-specific resources. The Long COVID search filter in PubMed Clinical Queries was validated against our set of included articles. The sensitivity of the Long COVID search filter, mainly focused on the concept for Post COVID-19 and not including specific symptom categories, was quite low. Results A total of 24,729 references were screened; 536 articles were read in full text, and 19 were deemed relevant. In sum, 11 trials with moderate risk of bias were included. The living systematic review resulted in an evidence map with articles presented according to categories of symptoms. Methodological challenges were as follows: creating a flexible and rapid workflow while maintaining a robust and transparent methodology; keeping abreast of a growing plethora of COVID-19-specialized registers and tertiary databases; and new and evolving terminology, e.g., challenges in creating a comprehensive search strategy for the \"Post\" aspect of COVID-19. Conclusions As expected, not many published trials on Post COVID-19 were found up to June 2022; the research on long-term symptoms was probably still in pre-publication or the preprint phase. However, because this was the first living systematic review at SBU, useful lessons were made for future \"living\" projects. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: no. [Alternative distributions for random effects meta-analysis model](/colloquium-2023/session/1473639/alternative-distributions-for-random-effects-meta-analysis-model) Background: Random effects meta-analysis is widely used for synthesizing the studies of a systematic reviews under the assumption that the underlying study-specific treatment effects come from a common normal distribution. However, this assumption is sometimes not justifiable, such as in presence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies or highly skewed data. Few alternative options have been suggested in the literature, but they are not used in practice. Objectives: To identify and compare alternative between-study distributions for random effects meta-analysis. Methods: We conducted a methodological systematic review to identify articles that proposed and explored random-effects meta-analysis models relaxing the between-study normality assumption. Subsequently, we performed a simulation study to compare the identified models. We considered 90 scenarios, varying the amount of heterogeneity between studies, the skewness of the data, and the number of included studies. Results: We identified 1022 articles in PubMed, of which 1015 were excluded after screening the title/abstract and according to our eligibility criteria. We further added relevant articles through hand-searching in Google Scholar and other related journals, and we concluded with 13 eligible articles suggesting 20 alternative random effects models. Our simulation study is still ongoing, but preliminary results reveal that in the presence of skewed or high heterogeneous data, the normal between-study assumption can lead to highly biased summary effects. Conclusions: We conclude that the plausibility of the normality assumption should be assessed more thoroughly when conducting a meta-analysis, and alternative methods should be used when normality is not deemed plausible. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Applying a stepwise appraisal tool to determine the usefulness of systematic reviews in health technology assessments](/colloquium-2023/session/1473630/applying-a-stepwise-appraisal-tool-to-determine-the-usefulness-of-systematic-reviews-in-health-technology-assessments) Background To facilitate quick appraisal of the usefulness of systematic reviews (SRs), the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) has developed SNABBSTAR. This tool, based on A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), implies a stepwise assessment of the methodological/reporting quality. The six steps concern the following: 1. definition of population, intervention, control, and outcomes (PICO), literature search; 2. inclusion/exclusion according to PICO, listing of included studies; 3. risk of bias assessments; 4. evidence synthesis/meta-analyses; and 5. certainty of evidence considerations; 6. documentation of excluded studies, conflicts of interest, and SR protocol. Assessment is stopped if an SR does not meet the quality criteria of a step. SRs not fulfilling the first step are considered not useful, and those reaching the fifth step and beyond can be used in HTAs with limited or no complementary work. Objectives To apply SNABBSTAR to evaluate the usefulness of SRs systematically identified in an HTA for evidence-based decision-making. Methods We included all SRs published in 2018-2020 identified in the literature search in four databases, and fulfilling the PICO, of an HTA (Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, 2021:123) investigating efficacy and safety outcomes for clopidogrel versus ticagrelor in patients subjected to dual antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome. Four assessors independently assessed all SRs using SNABBSTAR, and diverging assessments were resolved in consensus discussions. Results A total of 13 SRs were assessed (China, n=7; Italy, n=2; USA, n=2; Poland, n=1; Kazakstan, n=1), 10 of which were described to be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The SRs included 016 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 08 non-RCTs. In all, 12 SRs were assessed to fail already at step 1 in SNABBSTAR; the literature search could not be reproduced with the information provided. One SR passed step 4 but not step 5 because the certainty of evidence was not reflected in the conclusions. Conclusion This analysis suggests that SRs often fail to meet fundamental quality criteria required to be useful in evidence-based decision-making; the reporting of the literature search process deserves further attention in SR publications. A stepwise appraisal, starting with the definition of the PICO/literature search, may facilitate quick assessments of the usefulness of SRs. [What we do in the shadows: Interviews with methodologists on synthesis methods when meta-analysis is not possible for all studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473626/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-interviews-with-methodologists-on-synthesis-methods-when-meta-analysis-is-not-possible-for-all-studies) Background: Systematic review (SR) authors commonly encounter situations in which meta-analysis is not possible for some or all studies (e.g., when studies report only the direction of the effect). In a survey of published SRs of public health and health systems interventions, 60% used a method other than meta-analysis, but the methods were rarely specified (5%) and were limited to those described in Cochrane guidance. Greater understanding is needed of the range of other synthesis methods considered by authors and factors that influence their decisions. Methods: We interviewed 12 experienced SR authors, editors and methodologists. We presented four scenarios in which it was not possible to combine results from all studies in a meta-analysis. Scenarios varied in the number and size of included studies; completeness of the reported results (i.e., fully reported [effect estimate and measure of precision] and partially reported [e.g., only a statement of statistical significance]); and other factors (e.g., risk of bias). Participants described the methods they considered to summarise, synthesise and present the results; whether they would combine all available studies in a single synthesis; and how they would draw an overall conclusion. Transcripts were coded to develop a framework of synthesis methods and factors that influenced decisions. Results: Factors that influenced participants' decisions included their views on the purpose of synthesis, existing beliefs about study results and synthesis methods, trust in the available data and the decision-making needs of end users. Participants differed in whether they would or would not meta-analyse some of the available results. Commonly, participants considered explicit or implicit vote counting, alongside or instead of meta-analysis, when it was not possible to meta-analyse all studies. Their description and interpretation of the results varied. Conclusions: A diverse range of methodological approaches and influencing factors were identified. Although synthesis methods other than meta-analysis and their rationale are often not described in SRs, they could be described explicitly in protocols and SRs to enhance transparency. Patient, public and/or consumer involvement: Patients were not involved in this research. These findings are relevant in promoting transparency of methods, which will inform future guidance to strengthen SRs. [AI for Dummies: Do DistillerSR AI Tools Improve Screening Efficiency for Evidence Syntheses?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473623/ai-for-dummies-do-distillersr-ai-tools-improve-screening-efficiency-for-evidence-syntheses) Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency of time-consuming tasks such as title/abstract screening has been difficult to implement for many groups who conduct systematic reviews. DistillerSR provides review authors a cloud-based tool to screen, assess, and abstract studies and offers three types of AI: Re-Ranking, AI Screening, and Classifiers. Re-Ranking and AI Screening are easy to implement and require no knowledge of coding or the need to train large sets of data. Re-Ranking aims to \"bubble up\" the most relevant results during screening to identify potentially relevant studies faster while AI Screening can act as a second reviewer and reduce the title/abstract screening burden on humans. But are these tools actually saving researchers time? Objectives: To measure how much time was saved, or could have been saved, by using DistillerSR Re-Ranking and AI Screening for title/abstract screening. Methods: We examined all scoping, rapid, and systematic reviews conducted by our organization since the introduction of the DistillerSR AI tools regardless of whether AI tools were used. We calculated the total time humans spent on title/abstract screening and the average time spent per record. We employed DistillerSR's Re-Ranking Simulation to determine the predicted portion of abstracts needed to screen to identify all abstracts that were selected for inclusion (i.e., included study plateau). Finally, we estimated the human time saved with AI Screening by multiplying the number of records screened with AI by the average time spent per record by human screeners. Results: We found that substantial review time can be saved by using these tools together during title/abstract screening, with additional time savings possible when used in conjunction with human judgment of when the included study plateau has likely been reached. Conclusions: Easy-to-implement AI tools like those offered through DistillerSR can substantially reduce the time researchers spend screening, particularly in rapid review environments. Those time savings can be better used in the analysis and write-up stages of a review. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This study has indirect relevance to patients. Improved efficiencies in identifying relevant studies can free up researcher time for more robust analysis and write-up. [Establishing a Glocalization Methodology for Developing and Updating Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines: Taiwan experience.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473619/establishing-a-glocalization-methodology-for-developing-and-updating-evidence-based-clinical-practice-guidelines-taiwan-experience.) Background: High-quality Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) require rigorous and transparent methodology with updating in time for optimal healthcare decisions. Evidence generation and clinical recommendations formation have been updated with the introduction and evolution of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology. Developing a credible method for the glocalization of CPG development is imperative. Objectives: To establish a glocalization methodology for developing and updating evidence-based CPGs in Taiwan. Methods: To systematically review internationally developed methodologies for evidence-based CPGs; analyze qualitative data by Delphi methodology, focus group discussion, and expert interview; and propose a tailor-made glocalization methodology for developing and updating CPGs in Taiwan. Results: A total of eight CPGs development manuals were included in the systematic review. Initially, the research team summarized the four-stage, 27-phase CPG development process. Sixteen external experts were invited to organize the CPG development committee, including government leaders, legislators, society professionals, quality promotion managers, experienced guideline developers, and patient group representatives. The Cronbach of two rounds of the Delphi consensus was 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. Additionally, we conducted two focus group discussions and four expert interviews to reach a consensus and establish a \"Taiwan Clinical Practice Guidelines Development and Update Manual.\" Finally, experts adopted the GRADE as the methodology for evidence evaluation and clinical recommendations formation. It was essential to include the opinions of patients and stakeholders in the guideline development process. Considering the feasibility of CPG development, experts identified a four-step (planning, development, publishing, and updating) and 16-phase approach to guideline development, as shown in Figure 1. Conclusions: This study proposed a tailor-made glocalization methodology for developing and updating CPGs. Following this, the Taiwan Nurses Association established the \"Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management\" based on the method to verify its methodological rigor and feasibility. We recommend that the government take action to disseminate the methodology of CPG development for promoting the quality of healthcare. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient group representatives were invited to be the key experts in this project and worked with all the experts in developing the methodology. [Low quality corneal disease systematic reviews limit the amount of usable evidence for informing practice guidelines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473605/low-quality-corneal-disease-systematic-reviews-limit-the-amount-of-usable-evidence-for-informing-practice-guidelines) Background: High-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) underpin trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Project (CEV@US) maintains a database of SRMAs in eyes and vision to support the development and update of practice guidelines in ophthalmology and optometry in the United States and worldwide. Previous work by CEV@US has shown that a majority of SRMAs in many eye conditions are unreliable. Objectives: To summarize the reliability of SRMAs in ocular surface diseases published between 2017 and 2022. Methods: SRMAs of cornea-related interventions (2017-2022) excluding dry eye were searched through the CEV@US database. The reliability of SRMAs was assessed by one reviewer and verified by another based on a set of minimal criteria (Table 1). A single reviewer assessed adherence to SRMA reporting guidelines and registration. Results: We assessed 221 SRMAs of cornea-related interventions, of which 87 (39%) were judged as reliable. Of the remaining 134 unreliable SRMAs, 27 (20%) failed to describe eligibility criteria, 83 (62%) used only one database or unrefined search strategies, 64 (48%) did not assess risk of bias of included studies, 50 (37%) did not conduct meta-analysis appropriately, and conclusions from 34 (25%) were discordant with their findings. Additionally, 26 (19%) SRMAs had other concerns: predominantly financial conflicts. A total of 96 (43%) of the 221 SRMAs stated that they followed relevant reporting guidelines, but 53/96 (55%) were judged as unreliable. Of 200 non-Cochrane SRMAs, 34 (17%) were prospectively registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) or International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY), whereas all 21 Cochrane reviews were prospectively registered and published (Figure 1). Conclusions: Nearly 60% of the published SRMAs in ocular surface disease over the past 5 years were unreliable, primarily because they failed to conduct comprehensive literature searches or assess the risk of bias of included studies. The methodology of future SRMAs should be well-planned, preregistered and clearly reported to produce trusted evidence and avoid research waste. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients or healthcare consumers were not directly involved in this study. The findings, however, may indirectly contribute to them to produce more trusted evidence in healthcare. [Reporting gap of randomized clinical trials registered in Western Mexico, a cross-sectional study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473601/reporting-gap-of-randomized-clinical-trials-registered-in-western-mexico-a-cross-sectional-study) Background: Investigative drug trials and some medical device trials in Mexico are not mandated by the General Health Law to publish their results, and there is currently no legal requirement for any type of trial, posing a challenge for future compliance and enforcement in the country. Objectives: The objective of this project is to analyze the current proportion of registered projects, their status, whether they belong to the public or private sector, sources of funding, and whether they have published results. Additionally, to analyze the proportion of retrospectively registered clinical trials. Methods: The clinicaltrials.gov database was reviewed by searching for Mexico, specifically in the Western region. The following fields were extracted: NCT Number, Title, Status, Study Results published, Sponsor/Collaborators, Funded By, Study Type, Start Date, Primary Completion Date, Completion Date, Retrospective registration, Results First Posted, and Locations. Frequencies and proportions were reported. Results: A total of 1,059 records were analyzed. The reported status in the platform were as follows: 61.5% completed, 15.0% recruiting, 8.8% terminated, 9.0% active not recruiting, 0.8% withdrawn, and 3.5% with unknown status. Only 47.8% of the records had available results. Most of the studies (61.1%) were Phase 3 clinical trials, and 5.3% of the trials involved pediatric populations. Industry funding was reported for 78.7% of the records. Most of the registries (93.3%) were classified as interventional, and 59.4% of the registries were properly registered as prospective studies. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study highlights the concerning lack of legal requirements for drug and medical device trials to publish their results in Mexico. The analysis of the clinicaltrials.gov database reveals a significant proportion of completed trials with no available results, which poses a potential challenge for future compliance and enforcement in the country. Patient, public, and healthcare consumer involvement: This study highlights the crucial role of policy in promoting ethical and responsible conduct in clinical trials, ultimately benefiting patients and public health. As part of the University of Guadalajara initiative, trial participants in Mexico were encouraged to ask sponsors about results, emphasizing the importance of empowering patients and promoting transparency in clinical trial research. [Knowledge mobilization of covid-19 evidence-based health recommendations for parents: a multi-methods randomised trial](/colloquium-2023/session/1473599/knowledge-mobilization-of-covid-19-evidence-based-health-recommendations-for-parents-a-multi-methods-randomised-trial) Background: Plain language versions of evidence-based health information are likely to be more accessible to end-users, particularly the general public, and may increase uptake of recommendations. Objectives: To conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative study to assess the effectiveness among parents of plain language versions of COVID-19 recommendations on child health topics (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05358990). Methods: In this online, allocation-concealed, blinded, superiority RCT, we recruited parents from around the world. Our primary outcome was understanding. Secondary outcomes were as follows: accessibility and usability, satisfaction, intended behaviour, and preference. Individual interviews were conducted with a subset of participants to provide deeper understanding of their preferences. Participants were randomised to receive one of two recommendations: Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 5-11 years; mothers with COVID-19 rooming with their newborn as part of usual hospital care. Participants were then randomised to receive a plain language (PLR) or standard language version (SLV) of the recommendation. Results: A total of 295 parents were randomized, and 241 (81.7%) completed the trial. Mean understanding was significantly higher in the PLR preferred the PLR version, with a mean rating significantly higher than neutral (p0.001). There were no differences between groups in whether they would follow the recommendations or share them with others. Interviews (n=12) highlighted different aspects of the PLRs to enhance future knowledge mobilisation efforts. Conclusions: Parents preferred the PLRs compared to SLVs, and those randomized to the PLRs showed better understanding of the recommendations' content. Parents rated the PLR easier to access and use and were more satisfied with the PLR. Interviews provided context for findings and insight for how to enhance knowledge mobilisation of health recommendations for parents. Further research among diverse groups and examining what other factors influence use of recommendations and decision-making is important to increase uptake. Patient and/or public involvement: Parents contributed to methods, intervention design, pilot testing, and recruitment. [Comparison of diagnostic test accuracy estimates using the Multiple Thresholds Model based on complete and published cut-off data with a bimodal reporting pattern](/colloquium-2023/session/1473842/comparison-of-diagnostic-test-accuracy-estimates-using-the-multiple-thresholds-model-based-on-complete-and-published-cut-off-data-with-a-bimodal-reporting-pattern) Background: The multiple thresholds (MT) model allows for diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis of multiple cutoffs simultaneously. Previous analyses demonstrated the ability of the MT model to approximate DTA estimates of a complete cutoff dataset, based on reported cutoffs. This has been done for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 dataset (Benedetti 2020), which had a symmetrical cutoff reporting, and the most frequently reported cutoff were mostly the study-specific optimal cutoff. The optimal cutoffs defined by the authors are only a subset of the reported cutoffs, so the most frequently reported cutoff is not necessarily the most frequent optimal cutoff. It has been speculated that the cutoff reporting pattern might influence the extent to which this approximation is possible. Objectives: To evaluate how well MT approximates DTA of a complete cutoff dataset based on cutoffs with bimodal reporting in which the most frequently reported cutoff is not the most frequent optimal cutoff defined by authors using Youden's index. Methods: We used data from an ongoing review on DTA of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire, for which information about published and all cutoffs was available. We present cutoff reporting pattern and DTA estimates obtained through the MT model for both published and all cutoffs. Results: We analyzed 251 cutoffs from 13 studies. Eighty-one cutoffs were published (Figure 1), whereas 170 were provided by authors. Reporting on cutoffs was bimodal, 8 and 11 were the most frequent cutoffs, reported in 10 and 8 studies, respectively. Only one optimal cutoff each was at cutoff 8 and 11. Using reported versus full dataset, absolute difference of MT DTA estimates were as follows (Figure 2): sensitivities were underestimated by use of reported cutoffs up to 1.6% with cutoffs 10 and overestimated by a maximum of 1.4% above cutoff 10. Specificities were overestimated by a maximum of 3% with cutoffs 14 and underestimated by a maximum of 0.03% above cutoff 14. Conclusions: Our preliminary analysis suggests that MT model approximates accurately the complete cut-off dataset despite the use of cutoffs with a bimodal reporting pattern. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: none. Additional resources: Figure 1, Figure 2. [Contribution of the new rehabilitation definition to possibly improve related Cochrane Systematic Reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473592/contribution-of-the-new-rehabilitation-definition-to-possibly-improve-related-cochrane-systematic-reviews) Background: Cochrane Rehabilitation (CR) developed, with all global relevant stakeholders, a new rehabilitation definition (Table 1). The next step in the project was to understand its value in discerning rehabilitation studies from those that were not specifically rehabilitative. Objectives: The aims were as follows: 1) to assess whether Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) previously tagged as \"rehabilitative\" met the criteria outlined in the new definition of rehabilitation; to identify 2) major gaps in rehabilitation-relevant CSRs; and 3) in the definition itself. Methods: We analysed a sample of 124 CSRs tagged in the CR evidence database. The sample size was calculated with estimation of proportion. We planned a coding to identify the presence of each element of the definition using a nominal scale: Absence, Presence, and Unclear. Two independent reviewers (senior and basic expertise) rated the sample of CSRs. Results: The disagreement among raters was 33.8%. Most disagreements the rating (6.5%) CSRs met all criteria, and they were the ones that included all the contents of the \"Intervention-General\" macro-criterion of the definition. Three (2.4%) CSRs did not meet any of the criteria. Overall, \"Intervention-General\" had the highest prevalence of absence (74.2%) and (19.4%). \"Person-centered,\" \"multimodal,\" \"process,\" \"activity/participation,\" and \"contextual factors\" were the least reported and mostly unclear criteria of the sample (Table 2). We did not find information that could require updates of the current rehabilitation definition. Conclusions: This study revealed that the framework of the new rehabilitation definition was a useful tool in identifying rehabilitative CSRs, although there were gaps, mostly in the reporting of \"Intervention General.\" It seemed that CSRs regarding rehabilitation required specific criteria and a framework in order to address all the components of rehabilitation interventions.

Yet, understanding the value that a source brings to a review in terms of unique and relevant records can greatly improve and optimize an overall search strategy and guide decisions about sources to search in the review updating process. Objectives: We aimed to build a new R package that maintains source or other user-defined metadata during the deduplication process, opening up many possibilities for the analysis of source contribution, including contributions at different screening and inclusion stages of the review process. Methods: The R package, called CiteSource, was developed collaboratively by a team of interdisciplinary researchers, developers, and information specialists and emerged from a hackathon at the Evidence Synthesis and Meta-Analysis in R Conference. The package builds on existing evidence synthesis R packages like ASySD. Unlike standard deduplication processes in most tools, which merge records into a single record while losing original metadata and source information, CiteSource was designed to maintain user-defined metadata at the imported file level, such as source, database, search string, or review stage. Various plots and tables were tested to determine the best visualizations to describe overlap between sources and various other use cases were considered for the tool. Results: CiteSource is now available along with an accompanying Shiny app. It includes three customizable plots to visualize overlap, as well as a search summary table with sensitivity and precision values and a record-level table that indicates the databases in which individual records were found. It also includes various export formats that can facilitate further analysis and comparison. Conclusions: CiteSource can be used for source contribution comparisons and to generate search summary tables. However, there may be many other unexplored use cases for this new tool. For example, CiteSource can be used pre-screening to evaluate the usefulness of databases to a search and their contribution to a set of benchmark studies, or to examine differences in search methods. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [The importance of a multidisciplinary team in developing an evidence-based guideline on first aid for road safety in Africa](/colloquium-2023/session/1473586/the-importance-of-a-multidisciplinary-team-in-developing-an-evidence-based-guideline-on-first-aid-for-road-safety-in-africa) Background: According to the World Health Organization, road traffic crashes account for approximately 1.3 million deaths annually, with 93% of fatalities occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Training first responders in providing simple lifesaving interventions at the scene of road traffic crashes is considered essential in decreasing the risk of road traffic-related injury or death, especially in resource-limited settings. Objectives: To develop an evidence-based first aid guideline and training manual for road safety, aimed at laypeople in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We convened a panel of 10 experts from nine different African countries, including academic researchers and first aid practitioners and trainers of several Red Cross National Societies, to provide input on topics and guideline questions. For each question, we conducted a mini systematic review searching MEDLINE, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. A first draft of the guideline and accompanying training materials, based on the best available evidence, was discussed with the experts during a 2-day panel meeting. Results: The panel formulated 10 PICO questions not yet covered by existing first aid guidelines, regarding prevention, diagnosis, and management of road traffic injuries. We identified one experimental and 14 observational studies, and one systematic review providing evidence on only four questions, with certainty of evidence ranging from moderate to very low, which led to three recommendations. The panel contributed in two ways: 1) as evidence was scarce, they formulated several additional recommendations based on good practice; 2) as the panel included first aid trainers (i.e., training materials users), they were also able to identify potential barriers and facilitators related to feasibility, acceptability, and equity when implementing the guideline in the local context in sub-Saharan Africa. After another round of expert feedback, the guideline and training materials will be finalised and piloted in Burundi. Conclusions: Involving a multidisciplinary team including local users of the materials from the start of the project enabled us to develop a guideline and accompanying training materials that are relevant, appropriate, contextualised and supported, which should facilitate implementation. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The majority of the panel and priorities was driven by the target audience and trainers. [Methodological and reporting quality of pharmacoepidemiology studies using the target trial emulation framework: a systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473841/methodological-and-reporting-quality-of-pharmacoepidemiology-studies-using-the-target-trial-emulation-framework-a-systematic-review) Background: Many pharmacoepidemiology studies adopted the target trial emulation approach in recent years, which was considered as a useful framework for avoiding potential sources of bias. However, there is evidence that key methodological details are missing from some reports of such studies. Objectives: Our aim was to systematically evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of pharmacoepidemiology studies using the target trial emulation framework, and to examine opportunities for improvement. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science database to identify all full-text available pharmacoepidemiology studies using the target trial emulation framework. Information regarding methodological elements was extracted and evaluated. Results: Fifty-five studies were identified. The most common methodological limitations related to 1) inappropriate eligibility criteria: 10 (18.2%) studies used post-baseline events to define baseline eligibility (e.g., use of treatment, no follow-up data), which may introduce selection bias; 2) lack of 'time zero' synchronization: In 15 (27.3%) studies, follow-up started at eligibility, but treatment strategy is assigned after follow-up, which may introduce immortal time bias and misclassification bias. Among these, only 7 (46.7%) studies described a solution to mitigate these biases; and 3) Inappropriate assignment procedures: Only 7 (12.7%) studies reported a critical approach (e.g., use of directed acyclic graphs) for confounder selection, and only 15 (27.3%) studies conducted sensitivity analysis (e.g., use of negative control or E-value method) to investigate the potential impact of residual confounder. In addition, only 13 (23.6%) studies clearly mentioned the standard reporting checklist they adhered to (10 used STRBOE checklist, 1 used ISPOR guideline, 1 used RECORD checklist, and only 1 used RECORD-PE checklist), thus there were substantial variations in methodological and reporting details. Conclusions: Most studies did not explicitly define their target trial and failed to comply with the basic principles of the target trial emulation framework. The methodological and reporting quality of pharmacoepidemiology studies using the target trial emulation framework needs improvement. Our findings emphasize the pressing need to develop evidence-based guidelines for conducting and reporting such studies. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patient, public, or healthcare consumer were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. [Classifying questions and matching them against forms of evidence: a new tool to better connect evidence demand and supply.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473832/classifying-questions-and-matching-them-against-forms-of-evidence-a-new-tool-to-better-connect-evidence-demand-and-supply.) Background: Decision-makers need to address a broad array of questions about several societal challenges. Evidence is an important input that decision-makers can use and often expect to make decisions. However, it is often the case that researchers focus their attention on questions answering what interventions might work to address a problem, often leaving decision makers with several questions unanswered. In the other side, researchers and evidence producers often create different products that are not always answering decision-makers' needs. Objectives: This oral presentation aims to present a novel tool to help facilitate the process of identifying a decision-maker's need and matching it with the right form of evidence that could help provide insights. Methods: This study had two steps. First, a global cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect all the questions that evidence-support centres around the globe have addressed. With these inputs, a taxonomy of demand-driven type of questions was created. Secondly, a Delphi study with methodological experts was conducted to select the best matches of study design for each type of question that was found in the first stage. Results: Twenty-nine different centres provided a list of questions that they provided some type of evidence support. More than 200 questions were analyzed and structured to create a taxonomy of 40 different types of questions. The types of questions were structured across the four stages of the decision-making cycle, namely clarifying a problem, finding and selecting options, implementing an option and monitoring implementation, and evaluating impacts. A group of methodological experts were contacted to provide insights on the type of study design that better matches each type of question. Conclusions: This presentation will show a novel tool that creates a clear connection between decision-making needs to the form of evidence needed to be created. This will help researchers to better coordinate and avoid duplication and decision-makers to understand for what type of questions evidence can provide some type of support. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Citizens will benefit from a more structured global evidence infrastructure approach. [How well did the consensus methods apply in the guideline development of traditional Chinese medicineA Web-Based Survey in China](/colloquium-2023/session/1473571/how-well-did-the-consensus-methods-apply-in-the-guideline-development-of-traditional-chinese-medicinea-web-based-survey-in-china) Objectives: To explore the opinions and attitudes of relevant application groups on the critical elements of the consensus methods during the guideline development process. Design: Cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was distributed to stakeholders via the mobile phone application WeChat through purposeful and snowball sampling methods. Setting: China. Participants: People who have experience of leading the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPG), participating in the consensus process in a guideline working group or expert panel, or being an external reviewer/examinator of guidelines. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The questionnaire inquired about participants' demographic characteristics and key issues in the consensus process related to consensus method. Results: A total of 2,426 people participated in the survey, whereas only 290 people met the requirements. The survey results come from 31 different provinces, of which Beijing has the most (n=107, 36.9%). Two hundred eleven (72.76%) participants had senior professional titles, and 186 (64.14%) participants had guidelines ongoing. Regarding the most serious adverse aspects affecting the consensus process, the participants generally believed that the top three most serious aspects were insufficient retrieval and evidence (30.7%), insufficient methodological training (19.83%), and overexpression of authority (11.16%). Conclusions: Consensus methods are poorly standardized and are used inconsistently in the guideline development process. The results of this study provide consideration for different roles and better implement the consensus process in the guideline development process. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Quality Evaluation and Reporting Specification for Real-World Evidence of Traditional Chinese Medicine](/colloquium-2023/session/1473826/quality-evaluation-and-reporting-specification-for-real-world-evidence-of-traditional-chinese-medicine) ABSTRACT: In recent years, the real-world studies (RWS) have attracted extensive attention, and the real-world evidence (RWE) has been accepted to support the drug development in China and abroad. However, there is still a lack of standards for the evaluation of the quality of RWE. It is necessary to formulate a quality evaluation and reporting specification for RWE especially in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). To this end, under the guidance of the China Association of Chinese Medicine (CACM), the Quality Evaluation and Reporting Specification for Real-World Evidence of Traditional Chinese Medicine (QUERST) Group, including 24 experts (clinical epidemiologists, clinicians, pharmacologists, ethical reviewer and statisticians), was established to develop the specification. This specification contains the listing of classification of RWS design and RWE, the general principles and methods of RWE quality evaluation (26 tools or scales), 25 types of bias in RWS, the special considerations in evaluating the quality of RWE of TCM and the 19 reporting standards of RWE. This specification aims to propose the quality evaluation principles and key points of RWE and provide guidance for the proper use of RWE in the development of TCM new drugs. [Clinical utility of overviews on adverse events of pharmacological interventions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473560/clinical-utility-of-overviews-on-adverse-events-of-pharmacological-interventions) Background: Overviews are a relatively new type of evidence synthesis. Among others, one reason to conduct an overview is to investigate adverse events (AEs) associated with a healthcare intervention. Overviews aim to provide easily accessible information for healthcare decision-makers, including clinicians. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of overviews investigating AEs. Methods: We used a sample of 27 overviews exclusively investigating drug-related adverse events published until 2021 identified in a prior project. We defined clinical utility as the extent to which overviews are perceived to be useful in clinical practice. Each included overview was assigned to one of seven pharmacological experts with expertise on the topic of the overview. The clinical utility and value of these overviews was determined using a self-developed assessment tool. This included four open-ended questions and a ranking of three clinical utility statements completed by clinicians. We calculated frequencies for the ranked clinical utility statements and coded the answers to the open-ended questions using an inductive approach. Results: The overall agreement with the provided statements was high. According to the assessments, 67% of the included overviews generated new knowledge. In 93% of the assessments, the overviews were found to add value to the existing literature. The overviews were rated as more useful than the individual included systematic reviews (SRs) in 85% of the assessments. The answers to the open-ended questions revealed two key aspects of clinical utility in the included overviews. Firstly, it was considered useful that they provide a summary of available evidence (e.g., along with additional assessments or across different populations or in different settings that have not been evaluated together in the included SRs). Secondly, it was found useful if overviews conducted a new meta-analysis to answer specific research questions that had not been answered previously. Conclusions: Overviews on drug-related AEs are considered valuable for clinical practice by clinicians. They can make available evidence on AEs more accessible and provide a comprehensive view of available evidence. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Because this was a methodological project, there was no involvement. [Assessment of Reporting Guidelines and Trial Registration Requirements in Nursing Journals: A Decade-Long Review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473553/assessment-of-reporting-guidelines-and-trial-registration-requirements-in-nursing-journals-a-decade-long-review) Background: Transparent and accurate reporting of research studies is crucial to promote the reliability of medical research literature. The EQUATOR network lists various reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT and PRISMA, to facilitate this process. Similarly, trial registration has been found to improve research transparency and strengthen the validity and value of the scientific evidence base. Many biomedical journals mandate that authors adhere to the relevant reporting guidelines and support clinical trial registration policies outlined by the World Health Organization. However, the extent to which nursing journals prioritize adherence to reporting guidelines and trial registration requirements remains unclear. As such, a thorough investigation into the attention given to these crucial components of research reporting in nursing journals is necessary. Objectives: To assess changes in basic reporting guidelines and trial registration requirements in nursing journals over the past decade. Methods: The \"Instructions for Authors\" of nursing journals included in ISI Web of Science was reviewed for evidence of an editorial policy on the reporting guidelines and trial registration in March 2012, March 2015, March 2019, and March 2023. Results: In 2012, only 25 (28.1%) of the 89 nursing journals reviewed required adherence to relevant reporting guidelines, and a mere 7 (7.7%) required clinical trial registration. However, by 2023, out of the 125 nursing journals evaluated, 90 (72.0%) mandated compliance with recommended reporting guidelines, and 79 (44.8%) required or recommended prospective trial registration prior to participant recruitment. These findings suggest a substantial improvement in the attention given to reporting guidelines and trial registration requirements in nursing journals over the past decade. Conclusions: In conclusion, nursing journals have made significant progress in adhering to reporting guidelines and trial registration requirements over the past decade. Although more than half of the assessed journals now require compliance with reporting guidelines and nearly half recommend or require trial registration, there is still a need for clear editorial policies to ensure the reliability and transparency of nursing research literature. Such policies will improve the validity and value of the scientific evidence base in nursing. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: public. [Platform trials during the COVID-19 pandemic - Challenges in identification and maintenance in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (CCSR)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473546/platform-trials-during-the-covid-19-pandemic---challenges-in-identification-and-maintenance-in-the-cochrane-covid-19-study-register-ccsr) Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, platform trials (PTs) such as RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP played an essential role in the rapid identification of effective treatments. These trials allowed trial arms to be added for new interventions during the course of the study, as the context of the pandemic changed. Clinical trials registers are an important source of information for the identification of studies on new drugs (Knelangen 2018). However, the initial registry entry of PTs does not list all interventions added during later stages. Objectives: Within the scope of multiple COVID-19 Cochrane reviews, we aimed to identify and track potentially relevant PTs. Here, we focus on the methods and particular challenges. Methods: In November 2020, we began a monthly search with a peer-reviewed search strategy for PTs in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (CCSR). Two authors independently screened the results. In the CCSR, the identified PT records were maintained and tagged with the study type \"Adaptive/Platform.\" They were systematically monitored for information on added or dropped intervention arms, interim results, and trial status via their dedicated websites, twitter, or email alert or in the clinical trials registries. Information on available arms or missed trial study acronyms that were not presented in the initial trials register entries were added to the study record in the CCSR. Results: Owing to the changing design of these trials, the search strategy required several revisions. The lack of study descriptors required us to conduct additional searches with study acronyms in ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify multiple records. Furthermore, some trials have registry entries in more than one trials register. The number of PTs increased from inception to almost 75 (February 2023). Press releases emerged as an important source for updates on the results of the trials. Conclusions: PTs became an important source to conduct, plan, and update multiple COVID-19 Cochrane reviews, including future Long-COVID reviews. Because of their continuous adaptation, PTs come with new challenges related to incomplete trials register records and identification of their results. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: In the CCSR, authors can easily identify PTs and newly linked references because of its study-based nature. [Landscape surveillance as part of a living systematic review: an experience with observational COVID-19 vaccine studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473824/landscape-surveillance-as-part-of-a-living-systematic-review-an-experience-with-observational-covid-19-vaccine-studies) Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was urgent demand from the global public health community for up-to-date information on real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE). Although traditional systematic reviews provide robust evidence, during a rapidly evolving health crisis, limited time and resources necessitated a more pragmatic, yet still systematic, approach. Landscape surveillance, the ongoing systematic mapping of available evidence, can help monitor the growing evidence on an emerging pathogen to quickly identify studies on key research questions. Objectives: To report our experience using continual landscape surveillance to identify observational studies of COVID-19 VE against SARS CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Methods: As part of a living systematic review of COVID-19 randomized controlled trials (covid-nma.org), non-randomized COVID-19 vaccine studies were searched and screened weekly with ongoing data extraction. Observational studies evaluating one or more COVID-19 vaccines that reported VE (e.g., COVID infection, severe disease, hospital admission, COVID-19 related death) were included. Results were updated online weekly. Results: Landscape surveillance provided easy and rapid availability of data for addressing questions requiring real-world COVID-19 VE evidence. Mapping informed the scientific community about the type, quality, and scale of COVID-19 vaccine research being conducted worldwide, including gaps and limitations. The data also informed policymakers in a time critical manner. In addition, the landscape results supported ongoing living systematic reviews on the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccine platforms (e.g., mRNA, non-replicating vector, inactivated virus, booster, etc.) against VOCs by identifying studies with the most relevant data for analysis. Conclusions: Use of regular landscape surveillance and mapping continues to be effective in meeting immediate evidence needs of the global scientific and public health community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The landscape surveillance approach within a living systematic review could be used for future emerging pathogens to quicky identify studies when a new clinical question arises. Lessons learned regarding the need to anticipate possible research questions as knowledge about the pathogen changes are currently being implemented. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This work has the potential to improve patient outcomes by advancing research methods that provide robust, yet timely, evidence to policymakers during a public health emergency. [Using a systematic review to develop a taxonomy of uncertainties in health care to structure the design of future participatory research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473534/using-a-systematic-review-to-develop-a-taxonomy-of-uncertainties-in-health-care-to-structure-the-design-of-future-participatory-research) Background: Uncertainty pervades every aspect of the healthcare system. Identifying the different meanings and conceptual models of uncertainty proposed in healthcare with a systematic review will allow us to explore the patterns emerging from such models so that we can move further to identify how people interpret and respond to such uncertainties. Objective: The objective of this article is to showcase how we developed a holistic model of uncertainties that covers different levels of decision-making in healthcare based on findings from a systematic review and how it helped us shape our primary research. Methodology: A total of 4,143 articles were obtained and screened by two authors. Thirty-one studies were included in the review. Thematic synthesis was done by a clinician, a nonclinicaian and a methodology expert to compare the different approaches to the interpretation of data. Results: Based on themes identified, we developed an overarching model of uncertainty. We illustrated the model at three distinct yet interdependent levels: the macro, meso and microlevel. We involved a few patients informally and sought their views on the developed model. Conclusions: This systematic review was able to deconstruct the separate layers of uncertainty affecting health decisions and allowed us to acknowledge that uncertainty can change and evolve during interactions between different people. We used this framework to design an innovative participatory approach for our project which intends to explore how individuals of different ethnicities and uncertainty tolerance respond to uncertainties in oral health decisions. The approach can be extrapolated and adapted for other similar projects. [The GRADE-CERQual iSoQ tool: a new online software for streamlining confidence assessments of qualitative evidence for decision-making](/colloquium-2023/session/1473531/the-grade-cerqual-isoq-tool-a-new-online-software-for-streamlining-confidence-assessments-of-qualitative-evidence-for-decision-making) Background/Patient Relevance: People's perspectives and experiences are at the heart of qualitative health research. Qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) is being used increasingly to synthesise primary qualitative studies to inform decisions that impact users of health and social services, especially around the acceptability and feasibility of health interventions and factors affecting their implementation. To use these findings from QES optimally, decision-makers need to know how much confidence to place in them. The GRADE-CERQual interactive Summary of Qualitative Findings (iSoQ) tool assists review authors in applying the GRADE-CERQual approach to assessing confidence. Objectives: To develop an online tool (1) to assist review authors with applying the GRADE-CERQual approach to their QES findings and (2) to create an online database of QES findings and confidence assessments in order to facilitate access to this evidence. Methods: Members of the GRADE-CERQual coordinating team worked with the Epistemonikos Foundation to create iSoQ. We used one-on-one user tests; pilot testing with review teams and in GRADE-CERQual training workshops; and, finally, a beta release period, to produce continuous feedback for designing the software. Results: The interactive Summary of Qualitative Findings (iSoQ) tool v.1 was launched in March 2022. Ninety-four new accounts have since been created. The tool guides authors through the process of applying the GRADE-CERQual approach to the findings of their QES. This includes an assessment of the four GRADE-CERQual components (methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy and relevance), followed by a final overall assessment of confidence of high, moderate, low or very low confidence. In the iSoQ software, review authors complete a GRADE-CERQual Assessment Worksheet for each individual review finding to produce an Evidence Profile and a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. These tables are designed to package qualitative evidence and confidence assessments in a user-friendly way for decision-makers and other users. Review authors can publish their iSoQs to the open database, making their findings accessible, and the process for assessing confidence transparent, to decision-makers. Conclusions: The new GRADE-CERQual iSoQ tool supports review authors to apply GRADE-CERQual and, in turn, provide decision-makers with evidence from qualitative research that they can use to inform decisions. [PEMS: Participatory evidence synthesis in multiple sclerosis and complementary therapies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473530/pems-participatory-evidence-synthesis-in-multiple-sclerosis-and-complementary-therapies) Background: People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) frequently use complementary therapies, e.g., food supplements or acupuncture. Some complementary therapies can help, but others may be ineffective or expensive. Moreover, the internet can provide unreliable and unsafe advice. There is a need to identify reliable evidence of the effects of complementary therapies on relevant outcomes for pwMS. PEMS (Participatory evidence synthesis in multiple sclerosis and complementary therapies) is a 2-year research project led by the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine (University Hospital Zurich) in collaboration with the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry. The Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society funded the project. PEMS aims to engage relevant stakeholders to collect the best available research evidence of complementary therapies on relevant outcomes for pwMS. Objectives: O1) Identify priorities of pwMS in Switzerland for complementary therapies. O2) Develop a core outcome set (COS) for studies of complementary therapies in MS. O3) Develop an Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) with relevant evidence of complementary therapies on relevant outcomes for pwMS. Methods: Multi-phase participatory research project involving pwMS, health professionals and researchers. O1) Survey nested within the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry to identify the complementary therapies used by pwMS, reasons and symptoms for using them and expectations on their benefits/harms. O2) COS: International Delphi survey and consensus workshops. A scoping review of complementary therapies for pwMS will inform the initial outcomes list considered in the Delphi. O3) EGM developed with Eppi-Reviewer to collect systematic reviews and randomised trials identified in the scoping review. Results: About 730 pwMS in Switzerland have completed the survey. The preliminary scoping review searches generated 16,949 unique reports, of which 329 are studies potentially eligible for the EGM. A list of potentially eligible complementary therapies and outcomes has been generated. Conclusions: PEMS can help to identify reliable evidence of the effects of complementary therapies on outcomes that are relevant for pwMS and their families, health professionals and researchers. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: PEMS participatory approach to engaging non-academic and academic partners in evidence synthesis will enhance the actual and perceived usefulness of the project results. [AssociALi - Cochrane Associate Center: 18 months of activities dedicated to spreading a culture of EBM in Italy.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473828/associali-cochrane-associate-center-18-months-of-activities-dedicated-to-spreading-a-culture-of-ebm-in-italy.) Background The use of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in Italy has not yet reached its full potential; there are obstacles, gaps and areas that need to be implemented. AssociALi is a nonprofit organization founded in 2012 in memory of Alessandro Liberati, one of the founding members of the Cochrane Collaboration and the first Director of the Italian Cochrane Centre. He intended to create an Italian Cochrane Network. Objectives Since 2021, when AssociALi became an associate centre, and its aims are to promote social solidarity by carrying out the following activities: - promotion of Cochrane initiatives and activities with the Italian Drug Agency and Italian societies of different diseases; - training activities in collaboration with University Institutions, updating methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness and quality of health interventions; - launch of initiatives aimed at stimulating the active involvement of citizens/patients and their associations in the promotion of a critical attitude towards health issues; - experimentation of innovative initiatives for the dissemination of scientific research Methods Scientific articles, conferences, newsletters, lessons and social media Results PRODUCING EVIDENCE: published articles about EBM initiatives. MAKING EVIDENCE ACCESSIBLE: a monthly newsletter to give information about Cochrane activities. Organisation of a yearly conference bringing together healthcare stakeholders to talk about EBM and how it can be applied and implemented every day. Increased involvement of students in the Association and Cochrane initiatives. ADVOCATING FOR EVIDENCE: To make Cochrane the 'home of evidence', we increased our relationships with key stakeholders: Universities to organise lectures for students, training initiatives in research methodology with several Italian Societies. We promoted the Informed Health Choices project in Italy to create learning resources and increase critical appraisal for children. BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE and SUSTAINABLE ORGANISATION: Through the AssociALi website and social media we reached out to Cochrane members, offering news, trainings, events and other Cochrane content. Conclusions Our plan is to increase the number of members and connections at several levels: patients, their associations and scientific societies, Geographic groups and Fields in Cochrane. We have to increase the ability to listen to stakeholder voices and to connect them inclusively. Funding, which is lacking, is crucial in order to support initiatives. [Addressing confusion in evidence synthesis: developing a structured taxonomy for informing the synthesis of evidence to inform policy and practice](/colloquium-2023/session/1473517/addressing-confusion-in-evidence-synthesis-developing-a-structured-taxonomy-for-informing-the-synthesis-of-evidence-to-inform-policy-and-practice) Background: Historically, evidence synthesis strategies focused on answering whether or not something works (i.e., questions relating to effectiveness). However, there now exists a multitude of approaches, methods, and methodologies to conduct evidence synthesis. Enabling researchers to ensure that they are undertaking the \"right\" evidence synthesis approach to respond to a clinical or policy question appropriately has strategic implications from a broader evidence-based healthcare perspective. Objective: This project proposes the idea of developing a taxonomy of evidence synthesis to assist authors to identify an appropriate review type and provide structure to the field of evidence synthesis. Methods This objective will be achieved through a variety of projects and methods, including scoping reviews, consultation, evaluation/testing, and Delphi type studies. A broad, interdisciplinary advisory panel has been formed to assist with the project. The first project is a scoping review of previous typologies and taxonomies of evidence synthesis. Conclusions: Such a taxonomy will assist in improving the ability of potential evidence synthesisers to navigate through the complexities of evidence synthesis, thus reducing redundant evidence synthesis efforts, saving scarce research resources, and ensuring evidence synthesis projects are conducted to a higher standard. This will ensure and facilitate the translation of evidence from these syntheses into policy and practice, and as a comprehensive resource, will be of benefit to many in the international community of knowledge generation and translation. This presentation will provide further details regarding the plans and vision for this collaborative initiative. [A comparison of duplicate detection automation tools: a head-to-head comparison study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473516/a-comparison-of-duplicate-detection-automation-tools-a-head-to-head-comparison-study) Background: A key task when conducting a systematic review is to identify and remove duplicate records retrieved by a literature search across multiple databases, a process referred to as deduplication. Deduplication is time-consuming and error prone, particularly when processing thousands of references from multiple sources. Some approaches use automation combined with manual checking by humans and might be done using reference management software or bespoke deduplication tools that are available, either standalone or within systematic review software. Some are only accessible through expensive, proprietary software or operate in a \"black box\" environment. It is not known how these tools compare against each other and which performs best to minimise errors and reduce the time spent deduplicating. Objectives: We are evaluating how the eight bespoke deduplication tools perform to inform choices about which to use. We are evaluating the following tools: 1) Covidence; 2) EPPI-Reviewer; 3) the Deduplicator; 4) Rayyan; 7) ASySD; and 8) HubMeta Deduplicator. Methods: Our sample set comprises re-run searches from a random selection of 10 Cochrane reviews published between 2020 and 2022. We will independently deduplicate these with two experienced information specialists to create 10 deduplicated gold standard sets. Each of the sets will be deduplicated using each tool under investigation and compared with the gold standard sets. The following outcomes will be measured: 1. Unique references removed 2. Duplicates missed 3. Additional duplicates identified 4. Time required to deduplicate 5. Qualitative analysis of unexpected findings of interest Results: Early testing suggests that the automation tools that comprise a human checking component produce fewer errors than those that are fully automated. The majority of these errors are missed duplicates, with few unique references removed. The tools that comprise a human checking component do require more time to deduplicate records sets. We expect to present the error rates of each tool and processing time. Conclusions: Our conclusions will be presented at the conference. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Although not directly relevant to patients, this study will help patients by contributing to methods that will result in more robust and efficient evidence production. [Web-based training packages to enhance evidence-informed policy-making for health in the Eastern Mediterranean Region](/colloquium-2023/session/1473827/web-based-training-packages-to-enhance-evidence-informed-policy-making-for-health-in-the-eastern-mediterranean-region) Background: To ensure that health policies are appropriate, effective and cost-effective, they need to be based on sound evidence. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims for the institutionalization of the use of evidence in policymaking for health, through supporting the establishment of the required processes, structures and capacities at a national level. Objectives: To streamline capacity building efforts, key resources available internationally have been identified and categorized to provide policymakers, policy developers and researchers with a high-quality selection of training opportunities, in the area of evidence-informed policymaking. Methods: Following an assessment of the priority needs of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, through regular consultations with member states, a series of key words have been identified, to inform an initial search strategy. By using these key words, a range of online databases were searched for relevant training materials. The materials were then shortlisted, based on quality, relevance and ease of access. Results: A repository of more than 150 training materials was created and categorized under 13 thematic areas, which became collections of smaller training packages. A guiding flowchart was created, to provide a recommended training route, through a series of relevant questions that led the users through the available training materials. Conclusions: The EIPM training package is a collection of publicly available international resources that serves as an effective and efficient way to readily provide users with practical resources. By using existing training programs, this web-based resource is an efficient and cost-effective way for capacity building, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, as it is easily accessible and free of charge. WHO advocates the use of this unique resource that brings together a wealth of knowledge, developed by different teams across the globe. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Do textbooks encourage critical thinking about health issues? A discourse analysis of Polish educational materials for primary schools.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473807/do-textbooks-encourage-critical-thinking-about-health-issues-a-discourse-analysis-of-polish-educational-materials-for-primary-schools.) Background: Even though Poles consider health as one of the most important values, Poland is among the top ten European countries in terms of obesity among boys and girls. Likewise, mental health problems are pressing. Despite the legal provisions obliging schools to include health education in their curricula, an unhealthy lifestyle remains one of the most important social problems among children and teenagers. Objectives: To describe to what extent the educational policies, school core curricula, and school textbooks, including teaching methods and tasks/exercises, suggested and narration styles used develop/promote health literacy, foster health competences, and critical thinking in regard to health among primary school pupils. Methods: Deriving from the situational analysis methodology (Clarke 2003), our study initiated with identification of the main actors, values, and content linked to health education and establishing relations between them. We were also interested in coverage of and time allocation devoted to critical thinking in teachers' training. We analyzed curricula and identified references to health and critical thinking within randomly selected textbooks. Additionally, we conducted 10 expert interviews with health policy experts and school curricula developers. Text resources were digitized. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The gathered material was coded deductively and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: In the body of 78 textbooks, the most discussed health-related issues were healthy lifestyle, somatic diseases, and their prophylaxis. Issues such as climate-related well-being and mental health, including substance use prevention, received marginal attention in terms of the frequency of topics covered. Critical thinking tasks are usually located in low-exposure parts of textbooks, which make them easily omittable. The experts recommended a more active role of teachers in the process of developing pupils' health literacy and proclaimed the need for cross-curricular cooperation. Conclusions: Although health education plays an important role in the primary school core curriculum, critical thinking about health was rarely raised. The lack of encouragement to think critically reduces the educational value of the present content. We recommend increasing the significance of the reflective approach even on the cost of reducing the amount of factual content presented. [Partnering with Public and Patients: The Vital Role of Panels in Research and Governance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473801/partnering-with-public-and-patients-the-vital-role-of-panels-in-research-and-governance) Background: Coproduction and collaboration are crucial for building trust in research evidence. In this study, we discuss the important role of public and patient panels in health research, including their construction and use, to ensure that research addresses priority questions important to them. We emphasise the importance of engaging patients and experts in research projects, programmes and governance systems to promote patient-centred research. Methods and Results: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases and identified seven guidelines on public involvement in research published between 2010 and 2022, including the World Health Organization and the James Lind Alliance. From these guidelines, we identified the different types of knowledge, skills and expertise that can be mobilized for panels. We also explored the role of expert panels in health research and how they influence research questions, methods and findings. Discussion: Engaging patients and other experts in research projects ensures that research is conducted from a broader perspective. Although evidence-informed health services seek findings from research that minimises bias and error, this is of limited benefit if the research questions are biased or misunderstood. Panels collect and analyse data from panel participants, and their purpose is to make decisions about research with or by patients and the public. Embedding someone with lived experience as a PPI coordinator/coapplicant within the team has a significant impact on the research's effectiveness. This approach ensures that patients' and the public's perspectives are effectively captured and integrated into the decision-making process. Conclusion: Involving the public in research decision-making processes leads to better and more relevant decisions, garnering support for change and facilitating the uptake of services. Partnering with a broad range of people to make judgments about doing and using research is crucial to ensure that research is conducted with a broader perspective, promoting patient-centred research. We emphasise the need for partnership working and coproduction in research to ensure that research addresses priority questions important to the public. [Combined p-values of baseline variables of randomized controlled trials published in 2022 indicate non-randomness beyond chance](/colloquium-2023/session/1473799/combined-p-values-of-baseline-variables-of-randomized-controlled-trials-published-in-2022-indicate-non-randomness-beyond-chance) Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are crucial for the evaluation of interventions. This, however, requires that the randomization is carried out correctly. The anaesthetist Carlisle has developed a method to test whether the baseline variables of an RCT could reasonably originate from a true randomization, assuming the p-values are uniformly distributed. In a study from 2017, based on 5,087 RCTs from 8 medical journals, 5.6% more RCTs than expected had a combined p-value > 0.95 or p-value < 0.05 [1]. Objectives: Apply Carlisle's method to a sample of recent RCTs and compare the findings to Carlisle's results. Methods: A sample of 1,075 RCTs, published February 2022, indexed with the MeSH term 'Randomized Controlled Trial' in MEDLINE, were checked for eligibility. The inclusion criteria were primary/secondary analyses of RCTs providing number of participants, mean, and standard deviation or standard error, of baseline variables. Carlisle's method adopts Monte Carlo simulation, ANOVA, and t-test to get p-values of baseline variables, and Stouffer's method combines them for comparison to a uniform distribution, using R software. A smaller combined p-value indicate that the groups are similar; larger indicate that they are dissimilar. Results: 566 RCTs were included and 13,085 means of 5,780 (range 1-100) baseline variables were extracted. The proportion of p-values within p-value > 0.95 or p-value < 0.05, p-value < 0.00001 was 22.8%, 4.8% and 0.05% respectively, i.e., 2, 5, and 500 times larger than would be expected by chance (Table 1). Possible non-randomness was more common in this sample compared to Carlisle's with the arbitrary limit of 0.95 < p-value < 0.05 but was less common for the extreme limit p-value < 0.00001. The distribution of the combined p-values is presented in Figure 1. Conclusions: The preliminary findings of this sample of recent RCTs indicate that a larger proportion are associated with non-randomness than expected by chance. The findings are not completely in accordance with Carlisle's results. Further analyses will be conducted, more baseline variables will be added, and subgroups, such as type of intervention, will be compared. Nevertheless, Carlisle's method seems to be a promising statistical tool for systematic reviews, and the evaluation of RCTs. [Prespecification of subgroup analyses and examination of treatment-subgroup interactions in cancer individual participant data meta-analyses are suboptimal](/colloquium-2023/session/1473484/prespecification-of-subgroup-analyses-and-examination-of-treatment-subgroup-interactions-in-cancer-individual-participant-data-meta-analyses-are-suboptimal) Background: The results of subgroup analyses may have a significant impact on clinical and public health decision-making. How often cancer individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMAs) prespecify subgroup analyses, conduct planned subgroup analyses, and use daft (across-trial interaction alone), deluded (within-trial and across-trial interactions combined), or deft (within-trial interaction alone) approach to assess the treatment-subgroup interactions remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to explore the pre-specification and conduct of subgroup analyses in cancer IPDMAs. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase.com, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify IPDMAs of randomized controlled trials evaluating intervention effects for cancer. We evaluated how often cancer IPDMAs prespecify subgroup analyses and statistical approaches for examining treatment-subgroup interactions and handling continuous subgroup variables. Results: We included 89 IPDMAs, of which 41 (46.1%) reported a statistically significant treatment-subgroup interaction (p-value < 0.05) in at least one subgroup analysis. Forty-seven (52.8%) IPDMAs prespecified methods for conducting subgroup analyses and the remaining 42 (47.2%) did not prespecify subgroup analyses. Of the 47 IPDMAs prespecified subgroup analyses, 19 performed the planned subgroup analyses, 21 added subgroup analyses, 7 reduced subgroup analyses. Eighty IPDMAs examined treatment-subgroup interactions, but 72 IPDMAs did not provide enough information to determine whether an appropriate approach that avoided aggregation bias was used. Eighty-five IPDMAs that used continuous variables in subgroup analyses categorized continuous variables and only one IPDMA examined non-linear relationships. Conclusions: Many cancer IPDMAs did not prespecify subgroup analyses, nor did they fully perform planned subgroup analyses. Lack of details for the test of treatment-subgroup interactions and examination of non-linear interactions was suboptimal. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: NA. [Fostering the evidence-based methodology in clinical practice guidelines development in the Czech healthcare system](/colloquium-2023/session/1473848/fostering-the-evidence-based-methodology-in-clinical-practice-guidelines-development-in-the-czech-healthcare-system) Background: In the Czech Republic, access to the public healthcare system is ensured, so healthcare can be provided to anyone in the country. Heterogeneity of provided care in various settings and areas of healthcare were identified. Guidelines following the evidence-based healthcare (EBHC) principles should help optimize the care, by recommending the best healthcare option(s), and make it available to all patients. There had been no unified or standardized process of clinical practice guideline (CPG) development. Objectives: The main aim of the 5-year-long project was to implement evidence-based methodology in CPG development in the Czech healthcare system, considering, e.g., GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) principles and processes and methods of (inter)national bodies coordinating development of CPGs. The specific objectives were to establish the managing bodies of the project, draft a guideline development process, develop at least 40 CPGs and design a system of education and training in CPG development. Methods: A baseline audit was conducted in November 2017. Within the national project Clinical Practice Guidelines, led by the Czech Health Research Council, the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic, and Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, the Czech National methodology for CPG development based on the GRADE approach was drafted, pilot tested and reviewed. Identification of barriers in implementation of evidence-based and GRADE principles and suggestion of steps to overcome the barriers followed. Further audits were conducted in 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023. Results: Nearly 1,909 CPGs were identified in 2017, developed by healthcare organizations, differing in ways of development, quality and accessibility. The main obstacles to implementing the drafted Czech national CPG methodology were a lack of both knowledge of CPG development and motivation in healthcare professionals. Workshops focused on the trustworthy CPG development were organized, and methodologists supported teams developing CPGs. The project yielded 41 CPGs informing health and care decisions. Conclusions: The project has helped to establish a CPG process and enhanced knowledge and skills on EBHC in healthcare professionals. A national center focusing on methodology is being created in the Ministry of Health to sustain and increase the project's achievements. [Multi-Stakeholder Engagement in Evidence Synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1652051/multi-stakeholder-engagement-in-evidence-synthesis) Background: Involving stakeholders in evidence syntheses may increase relevance and uptake, while reducing health and social inequities. Stakeholders include interested groups and people: health care providers, patients and caregivers, payers of health research, payers of health services, publishers, policymakers, researchers, product makers, program managers, and the public. Objectives: Our project objectives are to: A) Identify, map, and synthesize qualitative and quantitative findings related to stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses B) Explore stakeholder perspectives on how stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses promotes health equity C) Develop equity-oriented guidance on methods for stakeholder engagement in evidence synthesis D) Develop guidance on methods for evaluating stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses E) Develop a guideline for reporting stakeholder engagement in evidence syntheses (PRISMA Extension). Methods: We will co-produce 1 scoping review, 3 systematic reviews and 1 evidence map focusing on a) methods, b) barriers and facilitators, c) conflict of interest considerations, d) impacts, and e) equity considerations of stakeholder engagement in evidence synthesis. Next, we will contextualize the findings of step 1 by assessing a sample of evidence syntheses reporting on engaging with stakeholders and through interviews with stakeholders who have been involved in producing evidence syntheses. We will use these findings to develop draft guidance checklists and will assess agreement with each item through an international survey. The guidance checklists will be co-produced and finalized at a consensus meeting with stakeholders. We will co-produce a dissemination plan with our stakeholders and work collaboratively to improve adoption of our guidance by key organizations. Results: We will present our experiences establishing an international advisory group which will include additional representatives of our 11 stakeholder groups. We will present the preliminary results of the series of reviews. Conclusions: We aim to develop guidance for stakeholder engagement in health care evidence syntheses. This guidance will be co-produced with stakeholders, including patients, caregivers and the public. This guidance will be of interest to individuals or organizations that conduct evidence reviews, such as Cochrane, Campbell, JBI and GRADE. [Challenges of systematic reviews in the field of traditional Chinese medicine](/colloquium-2023/session/1473833/challenges-of-systematic-reviews-in-the-field-of-traditional-chinese-medicine) Nowadays, systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs) are widely applied in the field of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with about 14,754 SRs having been published. However, there are some challenges in the construction of clinical questions, topic selection, methodology design, and reporting of SRs in the field of TCM, including the following: 1) The western medicine diagnostic system was mostly used in the inclusion criteria instead of the TCM diagnostic system; 2) Lack of represent of Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment of TCM; 3) The interventions were set broadly, for example, when the TCM was set for the intervention, the studies of Chinese medicine treatment and non-pharmaceutical therapy were generally combined, which led to great heterogeneity and made it difficult to clarify the effect of the single therapy and translate evidence into clinical practice; 4) It may difficult to clarify the effect that comes from the acupuncture treatment or acupoint selection when combined the acupuncture trials; 5) Some did not state whether the intervention was used directly or loaded in addition to usual care when the comparison was usual care; 6) The selection of outcomes was not comprehensive, lacking of safety outcomes, economy outcomes, gold-standard outcomes, and outcomes with TCM characteristic; 7) Lack of registration; 8) There were some irregularities in the formulation of search terms, such as missing aliases and processed products of Chinese medicine or Chinese patent medicine, and missing international codes of acupoints; 9) Some only searched Chinese databases without English databases or specialized databases, inviting incomplete literature retrieval; 10) Grey literature was ignored because some studies did not search protocol registration platforms or include unpublished studies; 11) Some did not strictly follow the inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature screening; 12) Improper meta-analyses, for example, the combination of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs or the combination of high-quality trials and low-quality trials may cause biased results; 13) Lack of publication bias assessment; and 14) Lack of reports on conflicts of interest. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement. [A comprehensive approach to assess the existing evidence and appropriateness of anticancer drugs on advanced cancer: the ASTAC project](/colloquium-2023/session/1652058/a-comprehensive-approach-to-assess-the-existing-evidence-and-appropriateness-of-anticancer-drugs-on-advanced-cancer-the-astac-project) Background: Appropriateness of Systemic Treatments for Advanced Cancers (ASTAC) is a collaborative research project aiming to assess the appropriateness of anticancer drugs in advanced digestive non-intestinal cancers (ADNIC), contributing to reduce potential scenarios of misuse. Objective: To describe the ASTAC approach for broad evidence synthesis. Methods: We synthesised evidence on efficacy and safety through overviews, evidence gap maps (EGMs) and systematic reviews (SRs), according to the following steps: 1) We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Epistemonikos and PROSPERO for SRs, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies regarding our research questions. 2) We classified the identified SRs according to cancer location, and conducted three overviews. These overviews included all relevant SRs. We created matrices of evidence and de novo meta-analyses. 3) For conducting the EGMs, we used all the previously identified SRs (plus the RCT and observational studies already identified), and we ran a new and broader search strategy. We re-started the screening process, complementing the search with clinicaltrials.gov. 4) Once we had all the SRs, RCTs and observational studies identified, we conducted three EGMs. The EGMs informed which new SRs were more appropriate to conduct. 5) We used the RCTs included in the EGMs for the new SRs. At this stage, we also conducted a forward citation search to retrieve newer studies. 6) We conducted data extraction and analysis for the SRs, comparing our assessments with those made by authors of other SRs (identified by previous overviews). In parallel, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to describe ADNIC patients' treatments, for judging the appropriateness of these interventions. Results: The project is in its final stage. At the moment of this submission, we have published three overviews and one EGM, and submitted other two EGMs. We are in the final phase of five SRs. In parallel, we are finishing data analysis for the cohort study. Conclusions: ASTAC has managed to combine optimally different methodological approaches for synthesising evidence, contrasting them with current clinical practice. Evidence to treat ADNICs with anticancer drugs is sparse and, in consequence, treatments could be often considered inappropriate. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None [Dissemination efforts to optimize service delivery to children, adolescents, and their families - How systematic reviews (SRs) can be utilized](/colloquium-2023/session/1652056/dissemination-efforts-to-optimize-service-delivery-to-children-adolescents-and-their-families---how-systematic-reviews-srs-can-be-utilized) Background Access to research is a prerequisite for decision-making in policy and practice. Those who strive to enhance the mental health of children and adolescents often encounter difficulties while attempting to locate and utilize reliable evidence. Objectives Our aim is to support practitioners and decision-makers in child and adolescent mental health and welfare (CAMHW) in optimizing the delivery of services. Further, to contribute to the implementation of evidence-based practice, by providing access to trustworthy information based on systematically reviewed research. Outcomes Four closely cooperating research centres in Norway have developed an ecosystem of digital resources, to disseminate research findings derived from SRs in CAMHW: PsykTestBarn (psyktestbarn.no) publishes SRs on the psychometric properties of tests and diagnostic tools used to assess mental health and other traits in children and young people, in a Norwegian context. Ungsinn (ungsinn.no) publishes SRs on specific psycho-social interventions/programs and their evidence of effectiveness. It grades the quality of evidence on a scale of 0 to 5, based on the number and quality of studies, beneficial effects and implementation quality. IN SUM (insum.no) is a database containing all international SRs on the effects of CAMHW interventions. IN SUM includes the SRs published by Ungsinn and serves as the basis for The Intervention Handbook. The Intervention Handbook (tiltakshandboka.no) presents living (i.e., updated yearly) reviews of SRs on diagnostic areas and interventions. SRs are evaluated using Cochrane methodology for Overviews of Reviews. Ungsinn, PsykTestBarn, and The Intervention Handbook are peer-reviewed and registered open-access scientific journals. Conclusion Each resource - as well as the collaboration between them - has been funded by the Norwegian government. Growing interest and use from the practice field and government indicates that accessible evidence-based information is important. Our next challenge is to further increase the use of our resources, and ensure that local decision-making is based on these resources. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Resource users are active in initiating reviews, and are included in the review processes as reviewers together with researchers. This work may be of relevance to patients in making trustworthy evidence available, on a common platform, in an accessible format. [A rapid, fit-for-purpose QES for a WHO guideline: processes and challenges](/colloquium-2023/session/1473762/a-rapid-fit-for-purpose-qes-for-a-who-guideline-processes-and-challenges) Background: The evidence-to-decision (EtD) criteria for World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development requires the explicit consideration of acceptability, feasibility and equity implications of interventions. We were commissioned by WHO to produce a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) on these phenomena, for a broad range of interventions, within a tight timeline. Objectives: To describe the processes and challenges to produce a rapid QES for a WHO guideline. Methods: Our approach was informed by a rapid Cochrane QES and the need for a 'fit-for-purpose' product. To ensure completion in a rapid but rigorous manner, authors continuously discussed and reflected on their approach and met with the WHO team regularly. Eligible interventions mirrored those in the systematic review of effectiveness, commissioned for the same guideline. We limited perspectives to those of critical stakeholders; searched only MEDLINE (PubMed), supplementing this with targeted searching for 'siblings' of relevant trials; and included a 'pre-screening' step before full-text screening. Data extraction, analysis and synthesis was done iteratively using best-fit framework synthesis. Results: The broad range of interventions resulted in the inclusion of >80 studies. Inclusion of trial siblings enabled us to discern evidence that was 'directly' and 'indirectly' applicable to interventions included in the related effectiveness review. To produce fit-for-purpose evidence, we presented findings per intervention category and for each phenomenon of interest. This approach resulted in the richness of some pertinent cross-cutting perspectives not being captured and some interventions having very sparse data. The best-fit framework approach was suitable for this accelerated synthesis; though construct-level coding enabled systematic analysis, it was time-intensive. Constant communication and extensive time spent on calibration and synchronous discussions by at least three authors was key to successful QES completion. WHO was positive about the aptness of the QES evidence for the multiple EtD frameworks. Conclusions: Pragmatic processes and decisions, continuous communication and a dedicated team ensured the timeous completion of the QES. This was not without challenges and methodological limitations, particularly due to the composite question. Decisions about which elements should be prioritised, and which accelerated, in rapid QES are challenging. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. [A co-produced e-toolkit to support patient and public involvement in developing and promoting core outcome sets](/colloquium-2023/session/1652054/a-co-produced-e-toolkit-to-support-patient-and-public-involvement-in-developing-and-promoting-core-outcome-sets) Background: This work links to the international Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. Core Outcome Sets (COS) can reduce research waste by promoting consistency in outcome reporting. Over 400 COS have been published; another 300 COS are in development. COS should be relevant to all research stakeholders, including patients, carers and the public. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in COS research helps to ensure that COS studies are accessible and acceptable to all stakeholders, yet PPI in COS studies is not undertaken consistently, is often of limited scope, and its impact is rarely documented. This may partly reflect a lack of tools and training for COS teams. We aim to address this gap in resources using a COS specific PPI toolkit that will help COS developers to consider the range of ways that PPI could be integrated in their study and provide practical support on how to achieve this. Objectives: To produce a practical resource supporting PPI throughout COS development and dissemination Methods: The toolkit has been co-created with patient research partners. It is designed to follow the timeline of a COS study. At each stage, COS developers are provided with questions to consider with their public research partners. Specifically, designed PPI resources, including co-produced animations and guidance, are provided at key COS development stages. We also provide links to relevant resources produced by other international organisations. The toolkit includes a template for documenting PPI activity and impacts throughout the study. Results: The PPI toolkit will soon be available on the COMET website. It will be promoted in the COMET Initiative newsletter and through social media. Conclusions: The co-produced COMET PPI toolkit is an evolving resource for COS developers. Further resources for the toolkit will also be co-designed with patients. Feedback from toolkit users will be used to refine the content. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The toolkit was co-designed by a team including two patient research partners with COS experience. Many resources in the toolkit were also co-designed with patient research partners, including an animation about PPI in COS development, which will be showcased along with the toolkit. [Tool to assess recognition and understanding of elements in Summary of Findings table](/colloquium-2023/session/1473775/tool-to-assess-recognition-and-understanding-of-elements-in-summary-of-findings-table) Background: The summary of findings (SoF) table presents the main findings of a systematic review in an understandable and simple format. In this study, we used a novel software developed to observe the process of navigation in a textual educational task to study how medical students, learning about evidence synthesis in their evidence-based medicine course, navigate through the segments of the SoF table when answering questions about the information in the table. Objectives: To assess the ability of students to correctly interpret data presented to them in the SoF table and to critically answer questions about evidence presented in the SoF table. Methods: At the end of a 5-day course on evidence-based medicine, which introduced the concept of the SoF tables, third-year medical students had to answer open-ended question based on an SoF table about use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. The SoF table had all table cells blurred except the headings for rows and columns. To make a specific table cell readable, the students had to click on it. We measured the number of target and non-target cells visited for each question and the time spent on these cells. Results: The question with the highest percentage of correct answers was the question about the study setting (88.9%), whereas the lowest was the question about outcome with the largest improvement after intervention (28.4%). These were also the questions on which students spent most or least time and opened most or fewest table cells, respectively. Students mostly read the target cells. Conclusions: Even though the students have formal education in key terms used in the SoF table, they have a problem of critical thinking and comparative evaluation between the elements represented in the SoF table and, consequently, in the understanding of the outcomes of the studies. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The study will offer an insight into how medical professionals decision make decisions and form their answers regarding questions about therapy they are including. This has a direct effect on the well-being of patients. [A tool to assess risk of bias in studies estimating the prevalence of mental health disorders (RoB-PrevMH)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473695/a-tool-to-assess-risk-of-bias-in-studies-estimating-the-prevalence-of-mental-health-disorders-rob-prevmh) Background: Studies of prevalence provide essential information for estimating the burden of mental health conditions, which can inform research and policymaking. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated a large volume of literature on the prevalence of various conditions, including those related to mental health. Biases affect how certain we are about the available evidence. It is one of the essential steps when conducting a systematic review; however, no standard tool for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in prevalence studies exists. Objectives: For the purposes of a living systematic review on prevalence of mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a RoB tool to evaluate prevalence studies in mental health (RoB-PrevMH) and tested its interrater reliability. Methods: We reviewed existing RoB tools for prevalence studies until September 2020 to develop a tool for prevalence studies in mental health. We tested the reliability of assessments by different users of RoB-PrevMH in 83 studies stemming from two systematic reviews of prevalence studies in mental health. We assessed the interrater agreement by calculating the proportion of agreement and Kappa statistic for each item. Results: RoB-PrevMH consists of three items that address selection bias and information bias. Introductory and signaling questions guide the application of the tool to the review question. The interrater agreement for the three items was 83%, 90%, and 93%. The weighted kappa was 0.63 (95% 0.54 to 0.73), 0.71 (95% CI to -0.63), respectively. Conclusions: RoB-PrevMH can determine if selection or information biases are present when the prevalence of mental health disorders is measured. Our tool aims to approach bias accurately by excluding reporting questions. The tool's validity, reliability, and applicability should be assessed in future projects. [Examining data visualisation formats used within Cochrane's qualitative evidence reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473690/examining-data-visualisation-formats-used-within-cochrane's-qualitative-evidence-reviews) Background: Systematic reviews are intended to inform professional discussion and lay person healthcare decisions. Presenting review findings visually in tables and graphs is useful to clearly and concisely deliver information and identify patterns. Cochrane recommends the use of visual tools such as matrix and logic models for the integration of qualitative review findings with related Cochrane intervention reviews. However, it is unclear how often such visualisation formats are used in practice. Objectives: To examine the formats used by Cochrane to visually present results of systematic reviews of qualitative studies to help inform evidence users. Methods: Qualitative evidence reviews were searched via The Cochrane Library using the 'qualitative review type' tag and a 'qualitative research' MeSH term search. Owing to a limited search burden, two reviewers independently screened full texts of all records. Reviewers then extracted and assessed relevant characteristics including the year, topic, qualitative analysis approach, and the types and frequency of data visualisation methods used to depict review findings. Results: The search yielded 24 Cochrane reviews, spanning from 2013 to 2023. All 24 reviews were eligible for inclusion; 20 were qualitative evidence syntheses, and 4 reviews synthesised both qualitative and quantitative evidence. Summary or study-level tables were the most common method of presentation of qualitative findings (22/24 reviews); of these, six reviews used solely tables. Two additional reviews used tables to present quantitative findings only. Logic model diagrams or matrix models were used in 5/24 reviews (1-12 uses per review) and in 12/24 reviews (1-2 uses per review), respectively. Whereas most matrix models were tables, they were labelled as figures in 3/12 reviews. Five reviews utilised infographics, four of which used them to depict a conceptual framework developed from the review findings. A minority of reviews provided a rationale for not considering certain data visualisation formats. Conclusions: Different visual formats are used to present qualitative review findings, with tables and matrix models being most common. However, logic models and infographics are under-utilised. In line with existing research, greater utilisation of different visualisation formats beyond summary tables to present qualitative data is recommended. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Spin bias in clinical trials of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues: a meta-epidemiologic study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473686/spin-bias-in-clinical-trials-of-cannabis-derivatives-and-their-synthetic-analogues-a-meta-epidemiologic-study) Background: Numerous trials have been conducted to investigate the effects of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues for different conditions, including pain, nausea and vomiting, eating and anxiety disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, among others. Against the setting of a promising novel intervention, investigators may tend to emphasise benefits when interpreting the findings of trials on cannabinoids, which supports the rationale for assessing the frequency of spin bias in these studies. Spin bias occurs, for example, when the results of a study are misreported with overestimation of positive findings and underestimation of negative ones [1]. Objectives: To estimate the frequency and conduct a qualitative analysis of spin bias in publications of clinical trials about the therapeutic use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues for any medical condition. Methods: Meta-epidemiologic study [2] conducted in the Discipline of Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (Unifesp), Brazil, and supported by academic scholarship from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio \u00e0 Results: Sixty-five publications with at least one efficacy primary outcome were included. The results analysis for the primary outcome indicated statistically significant effects in 44.6% (29/65) of the publications, and 70.7% (45/65) of the conclusions were considered favorable to the intervention. Among the 36 publications that found statistically nonsignificant results for the primary outcome, 44.4% (16/36) presented conclusions favorable to or recommended the intervention, which represents spin bias. Qualitative analysis of the 16 studies with spin bias showed selective outcomes reporting (elevating secondary outcomes that had positive results or reporting only subgroup results), deviations from the planned statistical analysis and failure to consider or report uncertainty in the estimates of treatment effects. Conclusions: Spin bias were found in 44.4% of the publications of trials assessing the therapeutic use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues and presenting statistically nonsignificant results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: When not observed by readers, spin bias can lead to misconduct in clinical practice through the use of interventions that are not efficacious or whose efficacy is uncertain. [Intensive education and facilitation: impact on practitioner understanding and use of evidence.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473772/intensive-education-and-facilitation-impact-on-practitioner-understanding-and-use-of-evidence.) Background: Evidence implementation is a field in which use of high-quality reliable research, implementation frameworks, and theory-informed interventions is known to improve uptake of evidence-based practices. However, clinical care is complex, and although practitioners have expert knowledge on their context, they may lack specific skills related to understanding and using evidence. The impact of equipping practitioners with reliable evidence, skills, knowledge, and resources to lead on local practice change through intensive education and facilitation programs targeted to their local context is of widespread interest to the synthesis and implementation communities. Objectives: To increase understanding and use of reliable evidence by evaluating a targeted short-course program on evidence implementation, clinical leadership, knowledge brokering, and methods of impact evaluation supported with early facilitation on practitioner-led implementation. Methods: Descriptive analysis was undertaken to review and present evidence from implementation projects published in Evidence Implementation. Using a piloted tool, data specific to clinician leadership, clinicians' use of evidence, description of the use-cases for types of evidence, knowledge brokering, and facilitation characteristics were extracted. Results: We found that clinical leadership reflected the cultural context. Clinicians who were unlikely to lead implementation previously were leading across a wide variety of use cases supported by brokering and facilitation. Skills and knowledge from intensive education and facilitation appeared to be retained between 6 and 9 months post-training programs, suggesting knowledge retention was linked to usability within the local clinical context. Conclusions: Understanding and use of evidence in clinician-led implementation can be sustained for the duration of an implementation project or program of work when supported by short-course training in domains focused on the knowledge needs and professional practice interests of clinicians. The use of knowledge brokering and early facilitation equips clinicians to better understand how to use evidence in context. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [The impact of blinding on trial results: a systematic review and meta-analysis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473604/the-impact-of-blinding-on-trial-results-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis) Background: Blinding, the concealment of the arm to which participants have been randomized, is an important consideration for assessing risk of bias of randomized trials. A growing body of evidence has, however, yielded inconsistent results on whether trials without blinding produce biased findings. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence addressing whether trials with and without blinding produce different results. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Reviews, JBI EBP, and Web of Science, from inception to May 2022, for studies comparing the results of trials with and without blinding. Pairs of reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen search results for eligible studies, extract data, and assess the certainty (quality) of evidence using the GRADE approach. We pooled the results of studies comparing trials with and without the blinding of patients, healthcare providers/investigators, and outcome assessors/adjudicators using frequentist random-effects meta-analyses. Results: We identified 47 studies. We found low certainty evidence that trials without the blinding of patients and healthcare providers, outcome assessors/adjudicators, and/or patients may slightly overestimate treatment effects. Limitations: Nearly all studies were rated at high risk of bias, primarily because of potential for confounding. Our results are further limited by the potential inconsistency in the direction of the effect of blinding. For example, although we anticipate that trials without blinding overestimate the beneficial effects of treatments, it is possible that the direction of bias caused by lack of blinding may not be consistent. That is, in certain circumstances, open-label trials may overestimate effects and in other circumstances, they may underestimate effects. Conclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that blinding may influence trial results in select situations\u2014albeit the findings are of low certainty, and the magnitude of effect is modest. Our findings have implications for clinical trialists and for evidence users interpreting the results of unblinded trials. In the absence of high certainty evidence suggesting that trials with and without blinding produce similar results, investigators should be cautious about interpreting the results of trials without blinding. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We did not involve consumers in this investigation. [The impact of database choices on systematic review results: a case study using Cochrane cardiac rehabilitation reviews and implications for future rapid reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473771/the-impact-of-database-choices-on-systematic-review-results-a-case-study-using-cochrane-cardiac-rehabilitation-reviews-and-implications-for-future-rapid-reviews) Background: The necessity of delivering evidence synthesis products in a time-effective and resource-limited way, emphasized by the COVID pandemic, has led to an increased interest in Rapid Reviews (RRs). Although they can be built systematically, the impact of following streamlined rapid approaches to develop a systematic review is not yet well understood. Objectives: To assess the impact of selective database searching on the study inclusiveness and outcome findings of systematic reviews. Methods: The study is using a set of six Cochrane cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reviews as a case study. The original libraries of each database from each review will be used to understand where each included study was indexed. When access to the original libraries is not possible, the search strategy will be re-run using reverse engineering. The general characteristics of each study will be recorded, as well as the outcomes and the meta-analysis results each included reference contributed to. The quality of each included study will also be mapped, using the risk of bias assessments already performed on each one of the reviews. Different search approaches will be tested (i.e., the different possible combinations of databases), and the studies that are not found when we limit the number of databases will be identified. Based on the search approach, we will determine how the meta-analysis and overall conclusions of the review would be affected, as well as the quality of the studies that would be potentially lost. Expected results: The study is ongoing, and the results will be available and presented at the time of the conference. Our study seeks to understand the impact of how bibliographic database choices can impact the results and conclusions of systematic reviews. Relevance and importance to patients: It is important to guarantee the validity and robustness of any findings RRs might generate, which can ultimately impact the policy and clinical decisions that they support. Being able to generate accurate evidence syntheses in a timely and cost-efficient manner can lead to faster uptake of new evidence, thus potentially positively impacting patients. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No involvement. |12:30 PM - 2:00 PM| Background: Sustainability in healthcare is a crucial concept in public health, and currently, there are ongoing debates regarding controlling the high cost of drugs in many countries, including the United States and the Republic of Korea. Each country manages access to high-cost drugs differently because of variations in the structure and financing of the health system. However, there is no summary of the various strategies which have been implemented, with a close analysis to elevate it to a global standard and improve sustainability. Objectives: To analyse current trends in high-cost drugs, review literature, and summarize the factors of high-cost drug listing, financing strategies, assessment & monitoring process, and ethical considerations implemented across countries to facilitate access to high-cost drugs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science through February 22, 2023. Articles published in the English language from 2000 that describe strategies implemented in different countries to facilitate access to high-cost drugs were included. Letters, news articles, and proposed strategies were excluded. Data were analysed by thematic analysis. Results: The study included 204 studies from 176 countries. The results of the review showed that many countries have implemented a combination of strategies to increase access to high-cost drugs. High-income countries (HICs) tended to use funding strategies targeting high-cost drugs (71% of HICs vs 0%-20% of the rest), such as managed entry agreements (MEAs) or dedicated funds for high-cost drugs. In contrast, lower-income countries tended to implement financial assistance programs for patients as a tool to increase access (37% of HICs vs 62%-72% of the rest). The national level of funding strategies has advantages and disadvantages. Conclusions: There is a need for a global standard or working groups on high-cost drugs to improve financial sustainability in healthcare. Many drug companies have built global strategies to sell their expensive products, but nations have not yet fully developed ethical considerations and strategies for financial sustainability. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Overlapping of primary studies in a review of systematic reviews on interventions to prevent adverse events](/colloquium-2023/session/1473543/overlapping-of-primary-studies-in-a-review-of-systematic-reviews-on-interventions-to-prevent-adverse-events) Background: Overview identifies and synthesises systematic reviews (SRs) to answer an investigational question. However, it is necessary to identify redundant information. Objectives: Investigate the overlapping in primary studies across the SRs included in an overview. The overview assessed nonpharmacological interventions to prevent adverse events in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We created a matrix of evidence as a grid, placing all the included SRs in the columns and their respective primary studies in the rows. We calculated the corrected covered area (CCA) for the whole matrix and for each pair of SRs. We repeated this process for each outcome, creating custom matrices including only the SRs and primary studies providing data for each specific comparison. We considered overlap to be low if the CCA was below 5%, moderate if the CCA was between 5% and 10%, high if the CCA was between 10% and 15%, and very high if the CCA was above 15%. Results: A total of 37 SRs were included, and 27 nonpharmacological interventions were identified to prevent 11 adverse events. The SRs comprised a total of 246 individual primary studies. The overall CCA was 1.0% (slight overlap; see Figure 1); however, the overlap assessment at the outcome level showed a high and very high overlap for 12 comparisons. The most frequent adverse event assessed among the SRs was ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). One of its preventive interventions was subglottic secretion drainage (SSD) versus no drainage, which included four SRs with a total of seventeen individual primary studies. Seven of the seventeen trials were included in all four SRs, and the CCA was 52.9% (very high overlap; see Figure 2). Conclusions: We found overlapping in some important outcomes assessing preventive nonpharmacological interventions for avoiding adverse events in the ICU; therefore, the findings should be interpreted carefully. Overlapping in an overview should be investigated globally but also at the outcome level. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: there was no involvement. [An analytical apparatus for including art-research evidence in a systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473682/an-analytical-apparatus-for-including-art-research-evidence-in-a-systematic-review) Background: In times of crisis, art provides an outlet for many to express their feelings, emotions and experiences. We collected art-research works to answer the question of how to best sustain life on earth under pandemic lock-down conditions. Objectives: Starting from a multimodal research perspective, this poster outlines how visual, art-research work can be analysed in a systematic review context. Methods: We propose three different analytical techniques preceding an integrative synthesis of art-research work; thematic analysis, iconographic analysis and art- and design-related analysis. Results: We argue that it is in the exercise of combining different analytical strategies that new synergies for integrative syntheses of dynamic art-research work are created. To prevent a loss of information, multimodal types of syntheses should consider the full range of visual, literary, sonic, tactile and multimodal dimensions of expression. Conclusions: Modes of representation should be adapted to the nature of the evidence included. This poster includes a visual of an online gallery in which art-research evidence can be stored and an example of how visual and performative art-research work can be merged with narrative accounts of evidence to produce an original audio-visual synthesis outcome. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The integrative, audio-visual synthesis outcome is accessible on social media as part of our public outreach plan. [Training on critical appraisal and scientific production for health residents and preceptors in Brazil](/colloquium-2023/session/1473681/training-on-critical-appraisal-and-scientific-production-for-health-residents-and-preceptors-in-brazil) Background: Developing critical thinking and learning the principles of scientific research during a residency are essential to support decision-making, encourage evidence-based clinical practice and enhance the quality of scientific production. Objectives: To report the implementation and initial results of a national training initiative on critical thinking and scientific production for health residents and preceptors in Brazil. Methods: Case study conducted at Health Technology Center, Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, as a component of 'Resid\u00eancias', a project developed by Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas and supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (PROADI-SUS). Resid\u00eancias aims to qualify health professionals across the country, offering medical and multiprofessional residency programmes and complementary educational initiatives for residents and preceptors and considering the health needs and problems of the Brazilian population. Results: This free, short-duration, online course focuses on medical and nonmedical residents and preceptors acting in any residency programme accredited in Brazil. The 50-hour training lasts 13 weeks, consisting of (a) 13 asynchronous theoretical-practical classes addressing key concepts on research and evidence-based medicine (20 hours), (b) 5 synchronous tutorials in small groups for guiding students in the elaboration of a scientific product and addressing students' questions (10 hours), and (c) 20 hours distributed at the student's discretion, designated to the reading of support material and completion of tasks related to individual projects. From November 2022 to January 2023, a pilot group of 18 participants completed the course, developed a scientific product and fulfilled the certification criteria. Pre- and post-course tests and a satisfaction form were completed by the participants, and an analysis is underway to endorse potential improvements for the coming groups. Conclusions: This initiative seemed to be a feasible, acceptable and sustainable strategy to qualify early-career health professionals as well as their preceptors in Brazil. Relevance and importance to patients: The initiative is structural and has the potential to bridge the know-to-do gap by contributing to the body of knowledge of health professionals and qualifying healthcare in the Brazilian public health system. [Comparative analysis of clinical trials in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for treatment of depression](/colloquium-2023/session/1473874/comparative-analysis-of-clinical-trials-in-psychotherapy-and-pharmacotherapy-for-treatment-of-depression) Background: Extensive evidence-based literature exists on the comparative merits of talking therapies and using antidepressant medication for the treatment of depression. However, clinical research concerning psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is often divided along disciplinary lines, and key methodological differences exist in the conduct and reporting of clinical trials in clinical psychology and psychiatry. It is still largely unclear what the key differentiating factors as well as the predictors of effect size are in these two subfields of mental health research. Objectives: To comparatively analyse differences in the conduct and reporting of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy trials for the treatment of depression. Methods: All individual trials from key meta-analyses of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for the treatment of depression were included in the analysis. Patient and trial characteristics as well as conflict of interest and risk of bias in relation to primary outcome measures were compared. This review was prospectively registered. Results: Preliminary data suggest a high risk of bias and conflict of interest in both fields. Key methodological differences regarded prevalence of questionnaire and self-assessment data versus psychiatric rating scales as well as different methods of analysis, which was reflected in the primary outcome measures. Spin and issues with trial registration were prevalent in the psychotherapy literature. Conclusions: The results of clinical trials in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of depression are difficult to compare directly because of differences in methodology, patient populations, and outcome measures and should be carefully considered when making treatment recommendations. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Literature on patient-identified priorities in depression research and public mental health literacy was reviewed and informed this analysis. [What is the definition of \"evidence\" in Health Sciences?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473506/what-is-the-definition-of-evidence-in-health-sciences) Background: The term \"evidence\" is widely used in today's society. At the end of the 20th century, evidence-based medicine was born; evidence-based health sciences have since gradually emerged with a similar emphasis on evidence as the foundation for scientific discussions and decision-making. A \"definition\" is an accurate description of a concept or the meaning of a word without changing the object itself. Evidence is defined differently across widely used dictionaries, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive and systematic collection and analysis of the definitions of evidence in the evidence-based health sciences. Objectives: To find related definitions of evidence and analyze the differences and connections between different meanings. Methods: We used the scoping review to conduct this research. First, we established a multidisciplinary working group and systematically searched five electronic databases (PubMed, WOS, EBSCO, CSCD, and CSSCI) from their inception to February 26, 2022. Second, we also searched websites and reviewed the reference lists of the identified studies. Six reviewers working in pairs, independently, selected studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted information. Any differences were discussed in pairs, and if there was disagreement, it was resolved via discussion or with the help of a third reviewer. The analysis was descriptive. Results: Twenty-nine documents were finally included after the screening, and a total of 30 different definitions of evidence were identified. Three definitions came from public health, three from nursing, and others were unknown to the specific health sciences discipline. There were 23 intensional definitions and 7 extensional definitions. The top three definientia were \"information,\" \"research,\" and \"fact.\" The term \"research\" appeared most frequently in the definitions. The definitions could be classified according to three types: dynamic or static, research or observation, and support decision-making or knowledge. Most definitions of evidence seemed too broad or too specific or limited, and there were no widely recognized and accepted definitions of evidence in health sciences. Conclusions: Given that evidence is the foundation of evidence-based health sciences, a standardized, clear, meaningful, and widely applicable definition of evidence is needed. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [COVID-19 literature surveillance\u2014A framework to manage the literature and support evidence-based decision-making on a rapidly evolving public health topic](/colloquium-2023/session/1652048/covid-19-literature-surveillance\u2014a-framework-to-manage-the-literature-and-support-evidence-based-decision-making-on-a-rapidly-evolving-public-health-topic) Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rapid surge of literature on SARS-CoV-2 and the wider impacts of the pandemic. Research on COVID-19 has been produced at an unprecedented rate, and the ability to stay on top of the most relevant evidence is top priority for clinicians, researchers, public health professionals, and policymakers. Objectives: We present a knowledge synthesis methodology developed and used by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) for managing and maintaining a literature surveillance system to identify, characterize, categorize, and disseminate COVID-19 evidence. Methods: The Daily Scan of COVID-19 Literature project comprised a systematic process involving four main steps: literature search; screening for relevance; classification and summarization of studies; and disseminating a daily report. Results: As of the end of January 2023 there were approximately 470,000 COVID-19 and pandemic-related citations in the COVID-19 database, of which 50%-60% were primary research. The results of the Daily Scan continue to be used in a variety of ways to promote the use of up-to-date evidence by researchers and policymakers across the agency and other organizations. Evidence synthesis teams across PHAC capitalize on this database resource to rapidly respond to urgent requests for evidence, conduct rapid evidence syntheses on priority questions, and to streamline evidence into other domain-focused projects (e.g. vaccines, therapeutics, public health measures). Other groups utilize the searchable repository for reporting evidence highlights to senior management, identifying parameter values for predictive models, creating guidelines, web content and answering media requests. The presentation will include a discussion on the resources needed for this project and how technology may be used in future events to improve efficiencies. Conclusions: This central repository of COVID-19 literature continues to be maintained to aid in accelerated evidence synthesis activities and support evidence-based decision-making during the pandemic response in Canada. This systematic process can be applied to future rapidly evolving public health topics that require the continuous evaluation and dissemination of evidence. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This methodology contributes to comprehensive up-to-date evidence to be used in evidence-informed decision making for patients and the public. [Developing a toolkit for Involving a multi-ethnic group in an evidence-based research process](/colloquium-2023/session/1473541/developing-a-toolkit-for-involving-a-multi-ethnic-group-in-an-evidence-based-research-process) Background: The evidence-based research process starts with asking the important research questions that are relevant to stakeholders. Previous evaluations on research priority setting (RPS) processes, including the prioritisation of topics for Cochrane reviews, has shown that most RPS processes often do not involve stakeholders from a range of ethnicity, socioeconomic situations, or educational levels. Objectives: This study intends to conduct priority setting with a diverse range of stakeholders and understand the similarities and differences in their priorities and values. Methods: We selected oral health as a health topic to focus our RPS process as it is a common health problem. We recruited 14 dental surgeons and 40 community participants from one of the four ethnicities in Malaysia and conducted semi-structured interviews in their preferred language. We compared the challenges involving different ethnic groups, similarities and differences in their views, and the influence of their different life experiences on their research priorities. Results: Based on our observations, we listed various factors that demonstrate how ethnicity needs to be considered in their environment, context, and interaction with other groups in that community and the impact of their cultural and religious views and practices on their priority choices and values. Conclusions: Our research observations will shape a toolkit to involve multiple ethnic groups who speak different languages in an RPS process. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We have involved dental surgeons and patients who had dental treatment experiences and belong to one of the four different ethnic groups in Malaysia. [Evaluation of database contributions to a review on predictive analytics for disease progression: A SWAR using the R package CiteSource](/colloquium-2023/session/1473588/evaluation-of-database-contributions-to-a-review-on-predictive-analytics-for-disease-progression-a-swar-using-the-r-package-citesource) Background: Significant advancements in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for the prediction of disease progression has led to a rapidly growing literature in this space. Systematic and scoping reviews in this area could benefit from methods research to improve efficiency of the review process. In the context of a scoping review on AI/ML applications in predicting the progression of chronic kidney disease, we are conducting a study within a review (SWAR) to evaluate database contributions to this topic, which lies at the intersection of biomedical and computer science research. Objectives: We aim to evaluate the usefulness of five databases for reviews in predictive analytics and disease progression: Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. We are interested in overlap across databases, unique contributions of each database, and what each database contributes to a set of benchmark studies and the different screening stages of the review. Methods: We will use a new R package called CiteSource to assess database overlap and contribution to benchmark studies and review stages. The unique records from each database will be further evaluated on characteristics such as publication year, journal titles, topic, and keywords. Results: We conducted a preliminary analysis of database contribution prior to screening and found that Scopus finds twice as many studies compared with Medline. There are early indications that many of these results are from Medline-indexed journals and are found owing to the liberal application of Emtree terms, searched in Scopus as part of the Keywords field. Moreover, the computer science database ACM Digital Library contributes relatively few, but mostly unique, records to the search. We will investigate these findings in more depth as well as other aspects of the multiple databases searched. Conclusions: Understanding the contributions of multidisciplinary and discipline-specific databases to the searches for our scoping review can inform decisions about source selection for future reviews on predictive analytics for disease progression. This SWAR provides a case study using the R package CiteSource, presenting new opportunities for methods research related to source selection and search strategy validation. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Exploring the concept of reproducibility and developing a needs-based tool for educating end-users about research reproducibility: A qualitative study](/colloquium-2023/session/1652046/exploring-the-concept-of-reproducibility-and-developing-a-needs-based-tool-for-educating-end-users-about-research-reproducibility-a-qualitative-study) Background:The concept of research reproducibility has gained significant attention recently. However, studies assessing research reproducibility use the terms \"replicability\", \"repeatability\", or \"reproducibility\" interchangeably. This severely affects the definition, the scoring system, and the results of the studies focused on reproducibility, but also highlights the lack of research on the understanding of what \"research reproducibility\" is. Objectives:We aim to explore the understanding of the concept of research reproducibility and its importance to stakeholders, gather information about tools that could help better understand reproducibility, and gather information for designing a website-based tool for educating stakeholders and end-users about research reproducibility. Methods:In this qualitative study, we will conduct three focus groups with different stakeholders (researchers and teachers; funders, editors, and policymakers; and other stakeholders), each with a minimum of 8 participants. In the first part, we will explore their views of reproducibility and its perceived importance and understand which interventions would improve their understanding of reproducibility as a concept. In the second part of the focus group, we will present the participants with the initial version of the reproducibility network website, using their input to inform its development as a website-based tool for educating end-users about research reproducibility. We will use open-ended questions for the moderated discussion in focus groups. The focus group sessions will be recorded, and responses transcribed. Results:We will analyze the results using an inductive approach by applying thematic analysis with no pre-defined themes. As this is an exploratory qualitative study, we expect that the outcome will be a better understanding of how stakeholders define and think about research reproducibility. The findings will serve as the baseline for a more extensive quantitative survey study and will be presented at the Cochrane Colloquium 2023. Conclusions:Our qualitative study will provide a clear user definition of the concept of research reproducibility and will also serve as a consumer-aided test of our website for tools on research reproducibility. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement:A further understanding of the concept of reproducibility will help with the expectations and evaluations in studies assessing reproducibility, thus positively affecting policy development processes. [IMPACT OF DATA EXTRACTION BY A SINGLE REVIEWER ON EFFECT ESTIMATES FROM META-ANALYSES](/colloquium-2023/session/1473675/impact-of-data-extraction-by-a-single-reviewer-on-effect-estimates-from-meta-analyses) Background: COVID-19 has driven the need for timely evidence to inform decision-making. Rapid reviews allow for the timely production of evidence for stakeholders. Therefore, systematic review teams may consider mechanisms to streamline the methods despite the lack of evidence about the impact of these strategies on the conclusions of the review. To our knowledge, there is no relevant empirical evidence regarding differences in meta-analytic effect estimates when using data abstracted by only one reviewer versus the consensus. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of data extraction by a single reviewer versus two reviewers on effect estimates from meta-analyses. Methods: We conducted a meta-epidemiological study using data abstracted from randomized trials included in the living network meta-analysis (LNMA) that informs the recommendations of the World Health Organization COVID-19 therapeutics living guideline. We included comparisons and outcomes used in the guidelines. As part of the LNMA, for each eligible trial, pairs of reviewers, following training and calibration exercises, extracted data independently using a standardized, pilot-tested data extraction form. Subsequently, a data cleaning team checked all the extracted information for accuracy. For each comparison and outcome, we will conduct three pairwise meta-analyses using a frequentist approach and random effects model: 1) using the reference standard (i.e., the final data after cleaning), 2) using data abstracted by one reviewer, and 3) using the consensus data of the reviewers. To determine whether there are important differences between the results of the three analyses, we will use the threshold above which the guideline panel considered the effect important (see Figure 1). Finally, we will calculate the proportion of outcomes for which the results are importantly different when using the data abstracted by one reviewer versus two reviewers and versus the reference standard. Results: This study is ongoing, and the results will be presented at the Colloquium as available. Conclusions: This study is ongoing, and the results will be presented at the Colloquium as available. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients and or the public were not involved in this study, either in planning or in the study's design. [Risk of bias assessment tools used in non-Cochrane reviews of interventions: a meta-epidemiologic study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473449/risk-of-bias-assessment-tools-used-in-non-cochrane-reviews-of-interventions-a-meta-epidemiologic-study) Background: Biases can lead to under-estimation or over-estimation of the true intervention effect. There are many tools for assessing the risk of bias for intervention studies. Cochrane developed the Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, which was updated to its second version (RoB 2) in 2019. Other available tools for RoB assessment are the Physiotherapy Evidence Database2 (PEDro) scale, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ; Viswanathan) and Appraisal tools for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS; Downes), just to name a few. All of these tools focus on the allocation, random sequences, blinding, incomplete data and selective reporting. The certainty of the evidence is the extent to which we can be confident that what the research tells us about a particular treatment effect is likely to be accurate. Cochrane recommended the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for assessing to the certainty of the evidence, classifying the evidence of high certainty, moderate certainty, low certainty or very-low certainty. Whether Cochrane recommendations for RoB and certainty of the evidence assessment, as well as RoB tools used in non-Cochrane reviews of interventions, remain unknown. Objectives: To identify the RoB tool used in non-Cochrane systematic reviews (NCSRs) of interventions and to assess the usage of GRADE approach for certainty of the evidence Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE for completed NCSRs of any intervention published during 2022. Only systematic reviews for intervention were included. Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols were excluded. We did not apply any language, topic or country restrictions. For the included NCSR we extracted information regarding country, journal, use of any RoB tool, RoB tool used and use of GRADE approach. Data were extracted by one reviewer and validated by the lead author. Results: We will show the complete results at the London Colloquium. Conclusions: We will show conclusions at the London Colloquium. [A Pretrained Language Model for Classification of Cochrane Plain Languages Summaries on Conclusiveness of Recommendations](/colloquium-2023/session/1473443/a-pretrained-language-model-for-classification-of-cochrane-plain-languages-summaries-on-conclusiveness-of-recommendations) Background: Cochrane Plain Language Summary (PLS) is a stand-alone summary of a Cochrane Review used to disseminate the evidence in health to a non-research audience. They can be categorized according to level of conclusiveness, i.e., whether they contain conclusive recommendations on intervention's efficacy and safety. The ever-growing field of natural language processing (NLP) and its encoder-decoder machine learning models such as Transformers show excellent performance in text classification tasks. Objectives: To finetune and train SciBERT, a pretrained deep learning language model, for PLS classification according to three level of conclusiveness: conclusive, inconclusive, and unclear. Methods: Our data source was a dataset containing all Cochrane PLSs of systematic reviews on intervention studies published until 2019, already classified according to nine categories of conclusiveness of effectiveness/safety evidence [1]. We merged these categories into three groups based on the strength of the conclusiveness: conclusive (0), inconclusive (1), and unclear (2). We used SciBERT, a pretrained language model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), trained on 1.14M papers mostly from the biomedical domain, for finetuning the classification. The testbed was written in the Python language with the help of the PyTorch framework, and the pre-trained transformer model was taken from the HuggingFace transformers library. Evaluation metrics was performed using scikit-learn machine learning library, applying metric functions from the sklearn.metrics module. Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUCROC) score was used to measure model's performance between sensitivity and specificity. Results: After only three epochs of training, the model achieved high prediction scores: AUCROC was 0.88, 0.91, and 0.94 for conclusive, inconclusive, and unclear categories, respectively. The model had 87% balanced accuracy on the validation data set, indicating good efficiency. Conclusions: Despite having a relatively small and unbalanced dataset, our model achieved a very good performance and will continue to improve as we classify new PLSs published from 2020 to 2022 and add them to the training, testing, and validation dataset. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: PLSs containing conclusive recommendations on intervention's safety and efficacy (whether positive or negative) will help patients obtain relevant information. [Librarian Instruction on Methods for Evidence Synthesis: An Ethnographic Study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473764/librarian-instruction-on-methods-for-evidence-synthesis-an-ethnographic-study) Background: Academic health librarians play crucial roles in training new and future evidence synthesis (ES) researchers through individual support and group instruction on comprehensive searching and other aspects of ES methods. Although the role and impact of information specialists as collaborators and authors on reviews has been well documented, we know little about how librarians use and leverage technology and methods guidance to build capacity for ES research through methods instruction. Objectives: This research adds to our understanding of how academic librarians build capacity for ES research through online instruction to groups and individual learners. Methods: Using ethnographic methods for online data collection, including focus groups, observations of research consultations, and interviews, this study is framed by a sociomaterialist perspective to unpack the black box of ES methods instruction provided by librarians in virtual environments. The resulting qualitative data were analysed using content analysis and constant comparison approaches informed by the theoretical lens of Actor-Network Theory. Results: Assemblages of custom-made and repurposed instructional resources, such as video tutorials, templates, handouts, and online guides, as well as ES methods guidance documents and review-related technologies, mediate the instructional practices of librarians supporting ES methods. In response to academic and methodological expectations, librarians calibrate their teaching to balance technical and conceptual learning objectives related to the interconnected steps for conducting ES projects from research question formulation and information retrieval to data management, analysis, and reporting. Librarians rely on the affordances of various technologies to mediate online ES methods instruction, both for delivering the training and as applied to the methods for completing reviews. Conclusions: Contributing to capacity building in ES requires academic librarians to maintain high levels of expertise in searching and other components of ES research as well as competence in communicating those methods skills to learners and others who are new to synthesis research. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The learners who access ES methods support from academic health librarians were included as research subjects during data collection through observation of research consultations. The primary investigator is an academic health librarian with extensive experience teaching ES methods. [Identifying evidence gaps in Chilean health research: A first step towards evidence-informed decision making and strategic research agendas.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473909/identifying-evidence-gaps-in-chilean-health-research-a-first-step-towards-evidence-informed-decision-making-and-strategic-research-agendas.) Introduction: Clinical research aims to influence decision-making to provide appropriate healthcare. Funding agencies should prioritise projects addressing needed research topics, methodological considerations, cost-effectiveness, and expected social value. In Chile, there is no local diagnosis regarding recent clinical research that might inform prioritisation for future research funding. Objective: To comprehensively identify and classify Chilean clinical research studies, and to characterise design, institutions, authors, and identify gaps of evidence in the main prioritised local health conditions. Methods: We conducted a broad scoping review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and WoS, and performed hand searches to retrieve all health research studies conducted in Chile or by authors whose affiliations are based in Chile from 2000 onwards. We extracted the following data: bibliometric information, type of evidence, study design , area of study authors' affiliations and gender, type of authorship (first, last, corresponding, or other), diseases or health conditions addressed, funding, and conflicts of interest. Through an evidence gap map approach, the retrieved studies will reveal waste research and evidence gaps for the most burdensome conditions in Chile. Results: After deduplication, we retrieved 48,641 publications. To date, 29,305 studies have been excluded by title/abstract screening. Among 1,715 full texts assessed for eligibility, 275 have been excluded for being conducted in other countries or having authors not based in Chile, whereas 151 have been excluded by other reasons (wrong publication type or no clinical topic). We expect to complete the selection process, data extraction, and report in three months. Conclusion: Providing an accurate and up-to-date picture of the national clinical research profile will support agencies and funders' agenda. This scoping review is part of a broader government-funded project aiming to elaborate evidence gap maps for the most burdensome local conditions (Protocol DOI: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057555). Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [A two-stage rapid umbrella review of interventions relevant to the Welsh context to support recruitment and retention of clinical staff](/colloquium-2023/session/1473773/a-two-stage-rapid-umbrella-review-of-interventions-relevant-to-the-welsh-context-to-support-recruitment-and-retention-of-clinical-staff) Background: The United Kingdom is facing an acute healthcare workforce shortage in every discipline, hindering National Health Service (NHS) recovery from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing ongoing endemic pressures. Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of interventions relevant to the Welsh NHS context to support both recruitment and retention of clinical staff. Methods: The Wales COVID-19 Evidence Centre (WCEC) conducted a two-stage rapid umbrella review (RUR) in two and a half months. Following an introductory stakeholder meeting with The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, who requested the research question, and Welsh Government and patient representatives, a rapid evidence map (REM) was conducted to explore interventions that can help recruit and retain clinical staff including return-to-work schemes. The REM identified 58 reviews, including systematic, scoping and narrative reviews, and the findings were presented at an intermediary stakeholder meeting where the focus for the RUR was decided\u2014assessing the effectiveness of interventions for recruitment and retention in healthcare settings that are similar to Wales, including rural areas. Results: The RUR included eight systematic reviews and one scoping review (with an evaluation component), mainly focusing on interventions within rural, remote or underserved areas from across the world. In the synthesis, interventions were mapped across five World Health Organization (2010) categories: educational, regulatory, financial incentives, personal and professional support and bundled (activities that cover two or more different categories). Final findings were presented at an evidence briefing for stakeholders and other interested parties to maximise impact. Furthermore, stakeholders' feedback was that the RUR enabled them to share accurate data with policymakers in Westminster, other Royal Colleges, and Heads of Medical Schools in the United Kingdom. Conclusions: Although RURs and REMs are less common than other review types, they are viable options for providing timely evidence-based support for decision-makers. RURs and REMs are especially useful when research questions are broad and a large number of systematic reviews are available. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The stakeholders included members of the WCEC public partnership group, including patient representatives, and a policy officer from The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. [The Library of Guidance for Health Scientists (LIGHTS) - introduction and outlook](/colloquium-2023/session/1473868/the-library-of-guidance-for-health-scientists-lights-introduction-and-outlook) Background: Substandard methods (e.g., irrelevant outcomes, ignoring missing data, flawed subgroup analyses) often limit the value of health research. Not seldom, corresponding methods guidance has been available for years or decades, suggesting a serious problem with the dissemination and implementation of methods guidance. Here, we address one particular challenge: the lacking organization of methods guidance articles in biomedical databases that leads to poor findability and hinders dissemination and implementation. Objectives: To improve the findability of methods guidance articles, we developed the Library of Guidance for Health Scientists (LIGHTS, www.lights.science) and the linked Taxonomy and Thesaurus for Health Research Methodology (THEREMY). Methods: LIGHTS is a living, curated inventory of methods guidance. We currently include guidance that (1) is published in a peer-reviewed journal and (2) states the objective to provide methods guidance for health researchers. We accept any type including guidance on understanding, applying, reporting, and assessing research methods. We apply a multi-layered search strategy that includes the screening of journals, websites, and suggestions from researchers. A team of health researchers, information specialists, and methodologists manually indexes eligible guidance documents and collects synonyms for methodological concepts in THEREMY. Automated synonym mapping improves the search process in LIGHTS. Results: On March 1, 2023, the database included a diverse set of 1,417 methods guidance articles and had 5,236 unique visitors in the preceding month. THEREMY included 101 study types and 252 methodological concepts. Table 1 shows top level categories and corresponding frequencies in LIGHTS. Discussion: The new library supports the dissemination of methods guidance and users seem to appreciate the resource. We consider LIGHTS complementary to other initiatives in the field, such as the Cochrane Handbook and the EQUATOR Network. Improved dissemination alone, although a precondition for the implementation of methods guidance, is unlikely to have a substantial impact on more robust evidence production. Further steps are needed. The collection of methods terms provided in the new taxonomy is more specific and flexible than index terms available in MEDLINE or Embase. [A cross-sectional analysis of the use of data visualisation in scoping reviews and evidence maps](/colloquium-2023/session/1652043/a-cross-sectional-analysis-of-the-use-of-data-visualisation-in-scoping-reviews-and-evidence-maps) Background Scoping reviews are well-suited to visually presenting data due to their focus on mapping evidence. A wide range of data visualisation methods and tools are available to researchers, including tools to create interactive data visualisations. Interactive data visualisation allows easy presentation of multiple variables and the exploration of hierarchal data at different levels. It is unknown how many scoping reviews visually map data or which methods they use. Objectives To explore the use of data visualisation methods in a large sample of recent scoping reviews and evidence maps on health topics. Methods A search for scoping reviews and evidence maps was undertaken in Ovid MEDLINE ALL (June 2020-May 2021). Search results were screened against basic selection criteria. Data were extracted on review aim (mapping evidence vs. answering a specific research question) and the use of visualisation in a sample of 300 recent scoping reviews or evidence maps. Descriptive data analysis was undertaken on reviews that aimed to map evidence. Results 238 reviews in the sample aimed to map evidence. Most of these reviews were described as \"scoping reviews\" (97.9%). A minority of reviews included any data visualisation (37.8%). In total 222 individual examples of data visualisation were identified, using 35 different methods across the sample. Only two reviews used interactive data visualisation. Many data visualisations were simple bar charts, pie charts or cross-tabulations (60.8%). Only 9.5% of data visualisations presented more than two different variables. Conclusions Data visualisation is under-used by scoping review authors. The data visualisations in published reviews tend to be simple, static, and illustrate only one or two variables. In particular, scoping review authors could make much greater use of free online software to present their results using interactive online data visualisations (see Figure 1 for an example of what is possible). Relevance to patients Scoping reviews can identify both existing evidence and gaps in evidence that are important to patients, decision-makers and research commissioners. Better use of engaging data visualisation could make scoping reviews more user-friendly for patients and other stakeholders. [Impact of the Restoring Invisible & Abandoned Trials (RIAT) initiative on Cochrane evidence products](/colloquium-2023/session/1473414/impact-of-the-restoring-invisible-abandoned-trials-riat-initiative-on-cochrane-evidence-products) Background: The Restoring Invisible & Abandoned Trials (RIAT) initiative is an international effort to tackle bias in the way research is reported. Cochrane should pay attention to and benefit from this project. Objectives: To identify the Cochrane evidence products directly concerned by two trials, one on evolocumab and the other on plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF), recently restored through RIAT projects, and also explore potential changes to be implemented. Methods: Two searches in the 'All Text' box of the Cochrane Library were performed on 15/02/2023 using 'evolocumab' and 'PRGF' as search terms. All identified results were screened looking for Cochrane products including the original trials [FOURIER (doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1615664); BTI-01-EC/07/ART (doi:10.1016/j.arthro.2012.05.011)] subsequently restored by RIAT researchers (doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060172; highlighting areas in need of updating. Results: One Cochrane review (CD011748), one protocol (CD012917) and one Clinical Answer (CA) (doi:10.1002/cca.3409) were identified as linked to the FOURIER trial. One Cochrane protocol (CD013341) was retrieved as linked to the BTI-01-EC/07/ART trial. Regarding the Cochrane review, the FOURIER trial accounted for more than 95% of the total sample size in the evolocumab versus placebo comparison. After assessing only published data, FOURIER was labeled as low risk of bias in all domains, supporting the global 'high certainty of evidence' according to GRADE. This is contradicted by the subsequent published restored trial based on its Clinical Study Report, which will likely lead to not being categorized as low risk in 'Reporting' and 'Other bias' domains. The CA, specifically designed to widen the Cochrane review audience, reiterated the challenged message of evidence with high certainty. Both ongoing protocols identified are expected to consider the restored trials for inclusion. Conclusions: In the examples above, the certainty of evidence would likely be downgraded when restored versions of trials are considered. Thus, Cochrane reviews including restored trials are in need of a rapid update to reflect the best available evidence, particularly when restored trials had a major weight on their reviews. In parallel, Cochrane Central could link restored and original versions of trials to assist authors with the search and identification of restored trials. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Crowdsourcing trainees in a living systematic review provided valuable experiential learning opportunities: a mixed-methods study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473751/crowdsourcing-trainees-in-a-living-systematic-review-provided-valuable-experiential-learning-opportunities-a-mixed-methods-study) Background: Evidence-based medicine educators are continually looking for new ways to engage trainees in experiential learning. Living systematic reviews (LSRs) could serve as a mechanism for ensuring an ongoing opportunity for this type of learning. Objectives: To understand trainee experiences of participating in an LSR for rheumatoid arthritis and the potential benefits in terms of experiential evidence-based medicine education. Methods: We initiated a Cochrane LSR and network meta-analysis (NMA) on drug therapy for rheumatoid arthritis that is informing living guidelines in Canada and Australia. We conducted a mixed-methods study with a wide range of medical trainees (undergraduates, medical students, residents, fellows, practicing rheumatologists, and researchers) who participated in the LSR and who were recruited broadly from training programs in two countries. Trainees received task-specific training and completed one or more tasks in the review: assessing article eligibility, data extraction, and quality assessment. Trainees completed a survey followed by a one-on-one interview. Data were triangulated to produce broad themes. Results: Twenty-one trainees, most of whom had a little prior experience with systematic reviews, reported a positive overall experience. Key benefits included learning opportunities, task segmentation (ability to focus on a single task, as opposed to an entire review), working in a supportive environment, international collaboration, and incentives such as authorship or acknowledgment. Trainees reported improvement in their competency as a scholar, collaborator, leader, and medical expert. Challenges included communication and technical difficulties and appropriate matching of tasks to trainee skillsets. Conclusions: Participating in an LSR provided benefits to a wide range of trainees and may provide an opportunity for experiential evidence-based medicine training, while helping LSR sustainability. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None; this study involved a wide range of medical trainees. [Promoting research transparency - Interventions to improve the publication and dissemination of trial evidence: A scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473538/promoting-research-transparency-interventions-to-improve-the-publication-and-dissemination-of-trial-evidence-a-scoping-review) Background: No matter the effects of a clinical trial's tested intervention, trial investigators are ethically responsible for disseminating their findings through peer-reviewed journals. However, this only sometimes happens. Lacking trial data because of publication bias damages the evidence ecosystem. Failure to share trial results publicly is a disservice to informing patients, clinicians, and healthcare consumers that rely on up-to-date evidence they can trust. Research needs to be transparent. Noting this, trial investigators may have barriers to publishing because of funding, competing interests, and time. This scoping review aims to identify and describe interventions that target trial investigators to reduce publication bias. Objectives: To identify investigator-targeted interventions to promote the publishing of research findings. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and Scopus using words related to interventions and \"publication bias\", \"trial\", \"publication\", \"publish\", etc., with no date or language limitations. Backward and forward citation searches followed the search structured search. We screened and extracted data in duplicate and independently. Results: We screened 10,000 records and found 23 full texts to review, of which one study was eligible. The backward and forward citations yielded an additional 47 eligible studies. None of the studies focused on trial investigators but on general health-related researchers. All studies focused on writing interventions through workshops, mentoring and peer support ,and capacitated investigators to publish in journals. Approximately 70% of studies report that participants published because of these interventions. Generally, participants had increased confidence in their writing abilities. Conclusions: We found a research gap with this scoping review. Eligible studies did not focus their interventions on trial investigators to avoid publication bias. All studies focused on ways to improve manuscript writing. Future interventions may consider adding checklist tools like the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials to their writing intervention. Future research should involve ethics committees and trial registers to mitigate publication bias among trial investigators and promote research transparency. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: no involvement in this research. Given the interest in trial data since the COVID-19 pandemic, we welcome consumer feedback. [Malaysian experience of training journalists in understanding research evidence: A Cochrane Geographic Groups Consumer Engagement and Involvement Challenge Fund project](/colloquium-2023/session/1473477/malaysian-experience-of-training-journalists-in-understanding-research-evidence-a-cochrane-geographic-groups-consumer-engagement-and-involvement-challenge-fund-project) Background: Apart from a small single workshop conducted by Cochrane Malaysia in 2014, there is little to no training available for journalists on understanding health research evidence. In 2019, Cochrane Malaysia received a grant under the Cochrane Geographic Group Consumer Challenge fund to engage the media. Objectives: To help journalists understand the value of systematic reviews, particularly Cochrane reviews, know where to look for reliable sources of health information and be able to report the findings of Cochrane reviews accurately. Methods: In partnership with two journalist associations, we designed and conducted a series of 1-day workshops. The workshops covered characteristics of and barriers to credible research. We included a hands-on session in understanding and reporting a Cochrane review plain language summary. Trainers included a journalist who had formal training and experience in health journalism and two Cochrane systematic review trainers. Evaluation of the workshops was by immediate feedback and searching the mainstream media for mentions of Cochrane after completion of the workshops. Results: Between 2020 and 2022, we conducted three workshops across the country, attended by 29 participants. The participants included journalists, social media writers, science communicators, journalism lecturers and students. The overall immediate feedback was good\u2014the most common comment was that it was an eye-opener. Compared with 2019 and earlier, there was an increase in mentions of Cochrane in the Malaysian press, mainly COVID-19 related. Another possible reason for this might be due to the active dissemination of COVID-19-related reviews during this time. There was also an opportunity to develop collaborative learning with a local university as a result of the workshops. Conclusions: Training may be an effective strategy for increasing Cochrane's presence in the Malaysian media. However, this needs to be complemented by relationship building and mentoring, including advocating for health and medical journalism to be included in the local journalism curriculum. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Training journalists would contribute to providing the public with reliable information about health. [Education and training for medical trainees and allied healthcare professionals: the use of online platforms](/colloquium-2023/session/1473662/education-and-training-for-medical-trainees-and-allied-healthcare-professionals-the-use-of-online-platforms) Background: Cochrane UK and Ireland Trainee Advisory Group (CUKI-TAG) delivers engagement activities for medical trainees and healthcare professionals across the UK and Ireland to improve the understanding and practice of evidence-based health care. The increasing use of online platforms for education allows greater flexibility in the timings and range of attendees. Objectives: To review the feedback and numbers of interaction on social media from training and engagement events. Methods: Three types of events were held. CUKI-TAG ran six online journal club discussions presenting findings of a research paper on social media through the Cochrane UK accounts. CUKI-TAG contributed to the delivery of two afternoons of webinars for medical, surgical, and dental trainees alongside Cochrane UK staff, and 2 two-hour webinars for nurses and allied healthcare professionals alongside Cochrane UK and Cochrane Ireland staff. The number of interactions on social media, attendees, and feedback from the webinars was reviewed. Results: Between 2020 and 2022, six events were held by CUKI TAG on Cochrane UK accounts. Five events were held over one evening on Twitter with the number of engagements (which includes likes, retweets, comments) ranging from 665 to 1,432. The latest event was spread over five weekday evenings on Twitter, as well as Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The number of twitter interactions remained similar (1,094), with 104 likes across the other social media platforms. The medical trainee webinars were attended by 88 participants with a 42% attendance rate from those who signed up. Approximately 90% of those who gave feedback found it very or extremely helpful; 73% found it at least very engaging with 95% interested in attending future events. The nursing and allied healthcare webinars were attended by 109 participants, who were mostly nurses but from 9 different backgrounds, with a 38% attendance rate from those who signed up. Around 88% of people felt webinar was helpful, whilst 66% found it to be at least very engaging. Conclusions: Using a range of online platforms for training and engagement is deliverable, with good feedback on interactive webinars. This allows interested parties to attend from wherever they are, increasing the wider reach of such events. [Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) guidelines are methodologically good but with opportunities for improvement: a critical appraisal using AGREE II and AGREE-REX](/colloquium-2023/session/1473744/spanish-society-of-medical-oncology-seom-guidelines-are-methodologically-good-but-with-opportunities-for-improvement-a-critical-appraisal-using-agree-ii-and-agree-rex) Background Having trustworthy health recommendations accessible in one single location is highly demanded by guideline users. Since 2014, open-access guidelines from the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) are available to facilitate clinical practice providing a practical view of the most relevant considerations concerning several cancer-related scenarios. To date, no independent assessment of its quality has been conducted. Objective To critically assess the methodological quality of SEOM guidelines on cancer treatment. Methods We conducted a critical review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, guidelines repositories, and other sources from 2014 onwards. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) and AGREE-REX tools were used to assess the quality of the guidelines. Results We included and assessed 33 guidelines. Most of them (84.8% of CPGs, n= 28) were rated as \"high quality\" according to pre-defined criteria. The highest median standardized scores (96.3) were observed in the domain \"clarity of presentation\", whereas \"applicability\" was distinctively low (31.4), with only one of the guidelines scoring more than 60%. Regarding \"rigour of development\", the median standardized score was 74.3, and 28 of the guidelines scored more than 60%. SEOM\u00b4s guidelines did not include in their formulation the views and preferences of the target population. Moreover, they did not specify the updating methods either. Conclusions The SEOM guidelines on cancer treatment have been developed with acceptable methodological rigour although they have some drawbacks that could be improved in the future, such as clinical applicability and items regarding patient views and preferences. Relevance and importance to patients Clinical guidelines are also available to cancer patients and contain specific recommendations that aim to optimize healthcare. A valid guideline has the potential to impact on healthcare outcomes but also to facilitate empowerment by patients. [Community perspectives on the accessibility and relevance of research evidence on dietary supplements for cancer](/colloquium-2023/session/1473907/community-perspectives-on-the-accessibility-and-relevance-of-research-evidence-on-dietary-supplements-for-cancer) Background: The use of dietary interventions and supplements for cancer is common. Results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) about supplements are disseminated widely through social media and the press; however, the effectiveness of this dissemination among members of underserved communities is unknown. For Black Americans, historic mistreatment in the medical system, disparities in health information access, and alienation from traditional research communities may contribute to lack of awareness of research evidence on dietary supplements and other dietary interventions for cancer. Black Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival of any racial/ethnic group for most cancers. Exploring the attitudes and barriers to accessing research evidence among Black Americans can help inform targeted interventions to educate, empower, and improve research access and uptake, empowering Black patients to take charge of their own health and improve cancer outcomes. Objective: The main objective is to understand the accessibility and relevance of systematic research evidence about dietary supplements in the prevention and treatment of cancer among Black communities. Methods: We conducted two online guided discussions on research evidence with community members in 2023. We are using qualitative methods to discover themes surrounding barriers, tools, and resources that affect access to and uptake of research evidence. Results: The project will qualitatively assess whether evidence is being chosen, packaged, and conveyed appropriately for this community. The long-term goal of this project is to improve accessibility and relevance to underserved communities. Feedback from this investigation will be used to guide the development and evaluation of community-led dissemination products. Conclusion: This contribution will improve equity in the dissemination of research evidence on integrative interventions across multiple conditions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We engaged community members in qualitative interviews and are using their input to understand community awareness about research evidence, with the goal of enhancing the accessibility, relevance, and impact of SR and RCT evidence. We view this as a key opportunity to engage Black communities in research. [Use and acceptability of third-party network meta-analysis tools in conducting reviews among Cochrane authors](/colloquium-2023/session/1473470/use-and-acceptability-of-third-party-network-meta-analysis-tools-in-conducting-reviews-among-cochrane-authors) Background: Network meta-analysis is a powerful statistical technique used in systematic reviews to compare multiple treatments and interventions. However, the usability and acceptability of third-party network meta-analysis tools and software among authors in Cochrane reviews have not been fully explored. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the usability and acceptability of third-party network meta-analysis tools and software among authors in Cochrane reviews. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 170 Cochrane authors who had conducted network meta-analyses. The questionnaire included questions on the authors' experiences with using network meta-analysis tools and software like STATA, R, SAS, GeMTC, NetMetaXL, JAGS, etc. and recorded their opinions on the importance of using such tools in Cochrane reviews, as well as their suggestions for improving the usability and acceptability of these tools and software. Results: The results showed that most Cochrane authors who conducted network meta-analyses found the tools and software to be easy to use and were generally satisfied with their performance. Some authors identified specific features or functions of these tools that were challenging to use, which may suggest areas for improvement in the particular tools and software, and others identified challenges and limitations of using STATA and R, such as the need for specialized training and technical support. The authors' opinions on the importance of using these network meta-analysis tools and software in Cochrane reviews were generally positive, indicating a perceived value in using these tools and software to conduct meta-analyses. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that network meta-analysis tools and software are important, valuable, and accepted tools for conducting meta-analyses in Cochrane reviews. However, integrated software with future versions of RevMan could be useful. Healthcare consumer involvement: This study provides important insights into the experiences of Cochrane authors with using third-party network meta-analysis tools and software, which can inform the development of more effective and user-friendly tools and software in the future. [Automation of scoping reviews: towards the efficiency of systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473466/automation-of-scoping-reviews-towards-the-efficiency-of-systematic-reviews) Background: There are several tools used for many steps of the systematic review; however, there is significant variability in their psychometric properties Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to identify the reliability and validity of the available tools, their limitations, and any recommendations to further improve the use of these tools. Methods: A scoping review methodology was followed to map the literature published on the challenges and solutions of conducting evidence synthesis using the JBI scoping review methodology. Results: A total of 47 publications were included in the review. The current scoping review identified that LitSuggest, Rayyan, Abstractr, BIBOT, R software, RobotAnalyst, DistillerSR, ExaCT, and NetMetaXL have potential to be used for the automation of systematic reviews. However, they are not without limitations. The review also identified other studies that employed algorithms that have not yet been developed into user friendly tools. Some of these algorithms showed high validity and reliability, but their use is conditional on user knowledge of computer science and algorithms. Conclusions: Abstract screening has reached maturity; data extraction is still an active area. Developing methods to semi-automate different steps of evidence synthesis via machine learning remains an important research direction. Also, it is important to move from the research prototypes currently available to professionally maintained platforms. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None to declare. [Breastfeeding support and avoiding inappropriate breastmilk substitutes marketing in a neonatal ward in the Czech Republic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473779/breastfeeding-support-and-avoiding-inappropriate-breastmilk-substitutes-marketing-in-a-neonatal-ward-in-the-czech-republic) Background: WHO guidelines dealing with the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding of Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) have been shown to improve breastfeeding outcomes and target hospitals. The Code is a minimum standard for regulation of marketing practices related to breastfeeding support. Objectives: The aim of this evidence translation and implementation was to increase compliance with the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) and the requirements of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code). Methods: WHO BFHI guideline was implemented using clinical audits/feedback and GRiP (Getting Research into Practice) framework. Firstly, we identified a group of stakeholders in one hospital in the Czech Republic. We carried out a baseline audit in January 2021. The clinical team and external breastfeeding experts discussed challenges and devised an implementation plan using the Getting Research into Practice framework. A follow-up audit was undertaken in 2021 and in May 2022. Results: The Ten Steps of BFHI have never been implemented and compliance was very limited, as the Code was not being followed. The identified barriers included lack of knowledge and skills, heterogeneity in lactation counselling, low motivation, no infant feeding policy, antenatal services, and post-discharge services available. The follow-up audit showed improvements in Code compliance, in breastfeeding and infant feeding promotion and support, antenatal classes, and post-discharge services and follow-up. All neonatal staff were trained in breastfeeding. A Code compliant brochure was prepared and distributed. There was improvement across all audited criteria. Conclusions: Breastfeeding support requires a sustained long-term effort before it becomes fully established. The involvement of national-level policy makers is needed. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: healthcare facility management, neonatal department leaders, and highly skilled external breastfeeding experts. [Cochrane Reviews and multimorbidity: past and future](/colloquium-2023/session/1473740/cochrane-reviews-and-multimorbidity-past-and-future) Background: As the population with multiple chronic conditions increases, it is essential that systematic reviews consider this group. The Cochrane Collaboration is an international organisation that develops and publishes high-quality systematic reviews on medical and diagnostic procedures. Over the past decade, several thousand health professionals, researchers, and consumers from around 100 countries contribute to the work of the Cochrane Collaboration, promoting up-to-date evidence-based health decision-making and improving global health. Previous studies have shown that randomized controlled trials testing behavioral interventions rarely include individuals with multimorbidity, which raises questions regarding the generalizability of their findings. However, this is still unclear in the area of systematic reviews. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the frequency with which participants with multimorbidity are represented in Cochrane Reviews of intervention. Methods: Published Cochrane Reviews of intervention will be eligible for inclusion in the cross-sectional study by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2023. We will also identify Cochrane Reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. A random sampling selection process will be performed to identify 100 eligible Reviews representative of the literature. Two authors will independently extract information on consideration of multimorbidity in eligibility criteria and evaluated the reporting and consideration of multimorbidity in data analyses. Results: The results will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Cochrane exists so that healthcare decisions get better. We anticipate that this work will provide an invaluable basis for Cochrane's future work in this critical area. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: NA. [Identification of authorship issues by using an authorship declaration form](/colloquium-2023/session/1473660/identification-of-authorship-issues-by-using-an-authorship-declaration-form) Background: Cochrane publications may be susceptible to unethical authorships such as gift authors. Surveys of first authors of Cochrane reviews confirmed this in 2000 and 2019, where the rate of gift authors was 39% and 41%, respectively. To overcome this issue, Cochrane Colorectal Group initiated an authorship declaration form that must be signed by each author during the editorial process. Objectives: We aimed to assess the impact of applying an authorship declaration form in a Cochrane Review Group. Methods: The authorship declaration form was initiated in 2020. It consists of three parts (Fig. 1): 1) submission information; 2) documentation for roles according to the four authorship criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE); and 3) identification information and signed approval by individual authors including the date. The form was sent to the contact author, who collected the forms filled out by each co-author. The forms were assessed prior to evaluation of the submission. We evaluated all protocols and reviews received after the initiation and present the results of applying an authorship declaration form early in the submission process. Results: We received 250 authorship declaration forms from 40 submissions (53% protocols and 48% reviews). For most submissions (70%), there were no issues after assessing authorship declaration forms. However, there were authorship issues for 30% of the submission. These included not all authors fulfilling all ICMJE authorship criteria, authors wishing to be removed because they had not contributed, and authors wanting to be added after submission. The latter was handled according to guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). All issues were raised to the authors and resolved by the author group when informing them of the ICMJE criteria for authorship and COPE guidelines. Conclusions: Most Cochrane authors provided signed evidence that they fulfilled all four ICMJE authorship criteria. However, issues were raised in 30% of submissions, and all issues were subsequently resolved. The awareness of authorship criteria is sharpened by using an authorship declaration form. This could help decrease the rate of unethical authorships in Cochrane publications and thus contribute to ethical and robust evidence production. [metan: a comprehensive update to the popular user-written meta-analysis package for Stata](/colloquium-2023/session/1473739/metan-a-comprehensive-update-to-the-popular-user-written-meta-analysis-package-for-stata) Background: Whilst the 'metan' has provided high-quality user-contributed support for aggregate-data meta-analysis since 1998, until recently, the package had not been maintained for nearly a decade and lacked various standard features available in other applications. Objectives: In collaboration with previous co-authors and members of the meta-analysis community, we aimed to comprehensively update the 'metan' package and thereafter to track and quantify changes in usage, opinion and impact. Methods: We introduced new options and syntax variations, whilst ensuring backward compatibility. We tested robustly for numerical errors and bugs. All changes were documented and agreed by the authorship group. User documentation was updated and clarified. Using the 'ssccount' package, we tracked number of downloads per month and assessed time trends. User engagement was quantified via the 'Statalist' online forums and direct email contact. Results: 'metan' version 4 was released in December 2020. New random-effects options were added, such as restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) adjustment. Support for cumulative and influence meta-analysis and for proportions was added. Forest plots are drawn with a separate program, enabling options (e.g., colours) to be specified for individual elements and text to be flexibly manipulated. 'metan' is available via the Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive and via GitHub, where testing scripts and error logs are also stored. The textbook 'Systematic Reviews in Healthcare: Meta-analysis in Context, 3rd edition' (2021) includes a detailed chapter on its use. There was a clear upward trend in usage, from ~250 monthly downloads in 2010 to a stable ~3,500 since 2019. User engagement, via forums and email, occurs around once per month. There was no evidence of a drop in engagement in response to new official meta-analysis capabilities within Stata v16+. Conclusions: The 'metan' package is familiar to users and remains well-used. We will continue to maintain, test and support it going forward and provide additional documentation and examples. This will ensure it remains a key tool for those conducting and presenting meta-analyses of aggregate data. Relevance and importance to patients: Robust, flexible and easy-to-use meta-analysis packages, supported and maintained by their authors, are of paramount importance to evidence synthesis and production. [The comparability of clinical characteristics between single-arm trials and objective performance criteria in clinical research](/colloquium-2023/session/1473820/the-comparability-of-clinical-characteristics-between-single-arm-trials-and-objective-performance-criteria-in-clinical-research) Background: Single-arm trials (SATs) with objective performance criteria (OPC) or performance goals (PG) have turned out to be a rational design for clinical effectiveness evaluation and facilitation of medical device approval. Objectives: To compare the baseline characteristics and outcomes between single-arm trials (SATs) and objective performance criteria (OPC) in clinical research. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and four databases in China from inception to April 2022. SATs with the OPC as an external comparator were included without any restriction on interventions. Furthermore, the eligibility criteria, demographic characteristics data, as well as the outcomes of the SATs, and their matched OPC sources were compared. Results: We identified 869 citations from seven databases and 76 SATs with OPC were included. Most interventions were medical devices (80.3%, 61/76), of which 80% of studies focused on vascular (81.6%) SATs one OPC, and OPC for different outcomes. Fifty-eight SATs (76.3%) provided the obtained sources of OPC through references. All SATs and their matched OPC belonged to the same disease categories, with some of them being kind of different in the types or stages. Age differences existed with a range from 3 to 20 years in 44.8% (22/49) of included studies between the SATs and their matched OPC. Moreover, whether there was an age difference was statistically associated with the effect size (2=4.191, p-value=0.004). Fifteen SATs (25.9%) selected OPC with a more serious condition. For the outcome selection, 76.5% were completely consistent between SATs and their matched OPC in measures; however, 35.9% of them were inconsistent in observation time points. Conclusions: The inconsistency in some demographic characteristics data and outcome indicators selection has been identified between the SATs and their matched OPC. Comparability of the most important prognostic factors between SATs and their matched OPC should be critically evaluated not only before the determination of OPC, but also when designing statistical analysis plans and drawing conclusions to enhance the reliability of OPCSATs. [Challenges and promises of cultural adaption of the Claim Evaluation Tools - an on-going process of validation in Poland](/colloquium-2023/session/1473803/challenges-and-promises-of-cultural-adaption-of-the-claim-evaluation-tools---an-on-going-process-of-validation-in-poland) Background: Within the framework of the research project aiming at exploring the national level of health literacy among primary school pupils in Poland, we are adapting and validating The Claim Evaluation Tools (CET), which was developed as part of the Informed Health Choices project. We used the opportunity not only to develop a Polish-language version of the instrument, but also to discuss the adequacy of some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to the post-pandemic reality of pupils immersed in new media society. Objectives: To validate the CET to the Polish cultural context. Methods: We translated CET database into Polish using forward- and back-translations. We selected 36 MCQs testing 12 treatment claims recommended for primary schools. Next, three experts reviewed the MCQs regarding their relevance to the Polish educational and cultural circumstances. We collected feedback on the questionnaire from 15 pupils. The final version of the questionnaire, covering additionally sociodemographic questions, self-evaluation of reading skills and the Health Literacy for School-Aged Children scale already validated in Poland, will be piloted on a sample of 300 12-14-year-olds from schools in the South region of Poland. Based on results of the pilot study, basic psychometric properties will be assessed. We will assess content validity in relation to relevance and clarity using Content Validity Index (CVI). To assess the convergent validity, we will compare the CET with the HLSC score and estimate the known group differences. The reliability assessment will be based on the retest on a group of 10% of the sampled pupils. Results: During the process of cultural adaptation, we faced dilemmas regarding the relevance of the narratives used in the MCQs to the present-day discourses which shape daily experiences of the post-pandemic cohorts of primary school pupils. The identified discrepancies are connected to the contemporary strategies of collecting information, omnipresence of COVID-19, and emerging interest in mental health issues, which have not been covered in MCQs to the present day. Conclusions: The results of the on-going process of validation will enable national cross-sectional survey in Poland. We hope observation made during the contextualization of the Polish version of CET could inform enhancement of the resources in other countries. [Evidence syntheses of the health risks of weather and climate-related exposures: A scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473864/evidence-syntheses-of-the-health-risks-of-weather-and-climate-related-exposures-a-scoping-review) Background: Climate change is affecting the global burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Synthesizing the growing evidence base on climate-health risks and strategies for adaptation and mitigation is vital for effective decision-making. Although the number of published climate-health evidence syntheses is increasing each year, current methodological guidance for this type of work remains limited and requires further development to incorporate analyses of the causal chain from emission of greenhouse gases to observed human health outcomes. If author teams do not sufficiently differentiate between weather, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change in the design and conduct of a synthesis, the resultant blurring of climate change with other meteorological phenomena lessens the precision of its findings and therefore its usefulness for decision-makers. Our project to collate syntheses in which these terms have been clearly delineated and incorporated into conceptual frameworks or logic models will give us a base for developing guidance for author teams on how to handle this foundational work. Objectives: To review how authors of climate-health evidence syntheses have used logic models and/or other conceptual frameworks to illustrate the relationship between weather, climate and climate change, and specific health outcomes. Methods: A scoping review of climate-health evidence syntheses published from 1946 to 2023. Included syntheses will be in English and will incorporate a) definitions of weather and climate variables and b) logic models and/or conceptual frameworks relating climate change processes to specific health determinants and outcomes. Thematic analysis will be conducted of the findings. Results: The full results will be presented at the Colloquium, along with recommendations for synthesis author teams. Conclusions: Cochrane must take a leadership role in developing evidence synthesis methods that are aligned to the task of strengthening health resilience to climate shocks. In this presentation, we will focus on recommendations to improve the rigour and utility of reviews by focusing on how synthesis teams can adequately include considerations of the causal pathways and linkages between climate change exposures and health outcomes. Relevance and Importance to Patients: Climate change is a global health issue; improved methods for evidence syntheses on climate-health topics will help to contribute to better health outcomes. [Synthesis without meta-analysis when assessing effects of return-to-work interventions - experiences from a systematic review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473733/synthesis-without-meta-analysis-when-assessing-effects-of-return-to-work-interventions---experiences-from-a-systematic-review) Background: The Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) was commissioned by the government to evaluate healthcare interventions to manage individuals on, or at risk of, long-term sickness absence. Inclusion was restricted to studies evaluating intervention effects on return-to-work (RTW). Objectives: The aim of this substudy was to describe how the effects on RTW were synthesized by a synthesis without meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify well-performed randomised controlled trials investigating intervention effects on RTW. Results: Most of the 68 included unique studies based their RTW outcomes on sickness absence register data. Despite this, there was considerable heterogeneity in how RTW was defined, operationalized, estimated and presented in the publications. Furthermore, it was common that authors presented several RTW outcomes, using different models on the same data. Meta-analysis was not considered feasible; thus, a synthesis without meta-analysis was performed including all reported RTW results. For each study, the number of statistically significant results in favour of the intervention or the control was first assessed. Thereafter, experts in the field evaluated each study result's potential clinical significance, based on the magnitude of statistically significant effects. Experts then formulated summarized results, weighing the evidence of favourable effects against the evidence of nonfavourable or nonpresent effects, to determine whether the overall results suggested directional effects. The GRADE domains were considered for summarized results, and uncertainty arose mainly because of risk of bias and imprecision. The certainty of results was assessed as being very low to low, and results were presented according to GRADE's recommendation of informative statements. The advantages of this method of synthesis include the comprehensiveness when summarizing all results in the included studies. The disadvantages involve loss of precision, affecting the possibility to summarize the magnitude of effects with associated uncertainty. Conclusions: The considerable heterogeneity in results reporting effects of interventions aiming at RTW might be handled by performing synthesis without meta-analysis. However, it is desirable that the results of RTW interventions are reported in a manner that allows meta-analysis to be performed. The new core outcome set in the field might facilitate this. [Publishing clinical prActice GuidelinEs (PAGE): recommendations from editors and reviewers](/colloquium-2023/session/1652052/publishing-clinical-practice-guidelines-page-recommendations-from-editors-and-reviewers) BackgroundEditors and reviewers of academic journals often find that authors submit guidelines that lack a lot of key information and critical content, which affects the judgment of the quality of the guidelines. Methods, Transparency Ecosystem for Research and Journals in Medicine (TERM) Working Group summarized the essential recommendations that should be considered to review and publish a high-quality guideline. Results: These recommendations from editors and reviewers included the ten components of essential requirements. 1. Systematic review of existing relevant guidelines: Submit a systematic review of existing relevant guidelines as an attachment, or add the main findings of the systematic review in the guideline. 2. Guideline registration: Submit a registration number and report the number in the guideline. 3. Guideline protocol: Submit a guideline protocol and report where the protocol is available in the guideline. 4. Stakeholders: Submit a document of which stakeholders were involved in guideline development and what their corresponding roles and specific tasks. 5. Conflicts of interest: Submit a declaration form of conflicts of interest (both financial and nonfinancial) for each member, as well as management methods, process, and results. 6. Clinical questions: Submit a document of the methods and processes used to collect and select clinical questions. 7. Systematic reviews: Submit systematic reviews that supported recommendations. 8. Recommendation consensus: Submit a document of decision-making process and minutes of meetings from evidence to decisions. 9. Guideline reporting: Submit a table indicating on which page and in which section the relevant content appears based on AGREE reporting checklist or the RIGHT checklist. 10. External review: Submit a document of the external review process, the review comments, and the guideline changes made to these comments. Conclusions: The above 10 components are the essential requirements that we believe a high-quality guideline should follow when it published. We abbreviate them as PAGE (essential requirements for Publishing clinical prActice GuidelinEs). We recommend that guideline authors use them as an important reference when they submit their guidelines to promote transparency. Editors can also consider adding PAGE criteria in Introduction for Authors. [Enhancing knowledge translation through partnerships: an initiative to improve practice regarding nasogastric tube placement verification](/colloquium-2023/session/1473732/enhancing-knowledge-translation-through-partnerships-an-initiative-to-improve-practice-regarding-nasogastric-tube-placement-verification) Background The extent of evidence utilisation in practice depends on the priority of the chosen topic, the availability of evidence, the way it is adapted to specific local contexts, and implementation strategies. Numerous patient safety alerts have been issued regarding the placement of nasogastric tubes (NGTs) in hospital and community settings. Verifying NGT placement remains the most pressing issue and a priority area for quality improvement in clinical settings. Objectives and methods To support continuous quality improvement, advance priority research, and translate evidence into policy and practice, Cochrane Hong Kong, in collaboration with Nursing Section of Hospital Authority Hong Kong, has undertaken a project aimed at synthesising evidence and transferring knowledge about NGT placement verification. We conducted a systematic review to review the diagnostic accuracy of end-tidal carbon dioxide detection in determining inadvertent airway intubation and verifying correct placement of NGTs. Sixteen studies were analysed, and the review suggests colorimetric capnometry and capnography may be of comparable diagnostic accuracy to radiography in their ability to differentiate between respiratory and gastrointestinal tube placement in critically ill adult patients. A prospective observational diagnostic study is currently underway in 21 acute, subacute, convalescent, and extended care hospitals (18 emergency departments, 13 intensive care units, and 8 general medical and geriatric wards) to assess the sensitivity and specificity of using capnography in detecting the correct placement of NGTs using the reference standards of radiography and measurement of aspirates for pH value. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the capnography test will be calculated with reference to a combination of x-ray and aspirate pH test. Significance and Impact Misplaced NGTs have detrimental effects, and, in most cases, NGTs are placed in the respiratory tract, which causes serious respiratory complications. Using the findings of this study, the Hospital Authority Hong Kong will update clinical practice guidelines regarding NGT placements in acute and rehabilitative settings. The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate how the research sector and health services (including frontline nurses, nurse consultants, nurse managers, and policymakers) can work together to strengthen collaborations in evidence synthesis and knowledge translation. [Determining the inter-reviewer reliability of literature screening for human and machine-assisted systematic reviews: A mixed methods review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473654/determining-the-inter-reviewer-reliability-of-literature-screening-for-human-and-machine-assisted-systematic-reviews-a-mixed-methods-review) Background: Automating aspects of the systematic literature reviews (SLRs) process could lead to better and up-to-date informed medical decision-making, and therefore improved health outcomes for individual patients. Machine learning automation has been proposed to reduce the workload and potentially enhance the quality of SLRs. However, the level of inter-reviewer reliability (IRR) in both human and machine learning automated SLRs is yet unclear. Objectives: Our main objective is to assess the IRR reported in SLRs. Our secondary objective is to determine the expected IRR by authors of SLRs for both human and machine-assisted reviews. Methods: In the first part of this study, we performed a review of SLRs of randomized controlled trials using the Pubmed and Embase databases. Data of all eligible studies were extracted on IRR by means of Cohen's kappa score of abstract/title screening, full text screening, and data extraction in combination with review team size, items screened, and quality of the review as assessed with the AMSTAR 2 rating. As a second part of this review, we performed a survey of authors of SLRs on their expectations of machine learning automation and human performed IRR in SLRs. Results: In total, 44 eligible articles were included. The average Cohen's kappa score reported was 0.8 (SD= 0.13, n=10) for abstract screening, 0.76 (SD= 0.17, n=14) for full text screening, 0.86 (SD=0.08, the whole screening process, and 0.88 (SD= 0.08, n=16) for data extraction. No association was observed between the IRR and team size, items screened, and quality of the SLR. The survey (n=37) showed similar expected Cohen's kappa values ranging between 0.6 and 0.9 for either human or machine learning assisted SLRs. No trend was observed between reviewer experience and expected IRR. In general, authors expect a better-than-average IRR for machine learning assisted SLR compared with human-based SLR in both screening and the data extraction. Conclusions: It is uncommon to report on IRR in human performed SLRs. This mixed-methods review gives first guidance on the human IRR benchmark, which could be used as a minimal threshold for IRR in machine learning assisted SLRs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: NA. [Risk of bias assessment in systematic review with network meta-analysis: a meta-research study with AMSTAR-2, ROBIS and the ROB-NMA tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473652/risk-of-bias-assessment-in-systematic-review-with-network-meta-analysis-a-meta-research-study-with-amstar-2-robis-and-the-rob-nma-tool) Background. A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) are currently the most commonly used tool for systematic reviews of health care interventions. A new tool to assess the risk of bias in network meta-analysis (RoB NMA) is under development: this pilot tool is recommended to be used in conjunction with ROBIS, although network meta-analysis (NMA) authors might use it also with AMSTAR 2. Objectives. To assess methodological quality and risk of bias by using AMSTAR-2, ROBIS and the pilot RoB-NMA tool. Methods. A cross-sectional study. We searched for all NMAs indexed in Pubmed in January 2023. We rated NMAs methodological quality and risk of bias using AMSTAR 2 and ROBIS. Selection, data extraction and quality assessments were performed independently by two researchers. Data were analyzed descriptively. The RoB NMA tool will be available for the piloting phase by April 2023; therefore, analyses will be completed by June 2023. Stratified analysis and correlations will be conducted to explore factors that might affect the quality of conduct. Study protocol is stored at the following link: https://osf.io/pa6dz/. Results. A total of 110 NMAs with a median of 21 studies (IQR 12-43) and 3695 participants (IQR 1525-12404) were 10% NMAs (n=12) showed that 83.3% (n=10) were judged by critically low quality by AMSTAR 2, with only one of moderate quality and one of high quality. Among critical domains, the three least adequately addressed were item 2 (58,3% NMAs), item 4 (66.7% NMAs), and 1). ROBIS judged 83.3% (n=10) of NMAs as high risk of bias, one as unclear risk and one as low risk. Domain 2 was at highest risk in 50% NMAs, whereas domain 3 was judged as low risk of bias in 75% NMAs that resulted in the better conducted. Table 1 reported AMSTAR 2 and ROBIS assessments. Conclusions. Preliminary results showed that the majority of recently published NMAs had an overall low methodological quality. Patient involvement. Poor control of potential source of bias in NMAs might affect results' trustworthiness and translation into clinical practice, which could be beneficial for patients. [Disseminating Cochrane evidence in German via Instagram: Concept, channel performance and audience characteristics of our Insta channel \"cochrane_deutschland\"](/colloquium-2023/session/1473650/disseminating-cochrane-evidence-in-german-via-instagram-concept-channel-performance-and-audience-characteristics-of-our-insta-channel-\"cochrane_deutschland\") Background: In October 2022, we launched our Instagram channel, 'cochrane_deutschland'. Following 'cochraneorg' and 'cochrane_uk' as role models, we developed our own strategy for disseminating Cochrane evidence in German on Instagram. The main challenge lies in navigating the conflicting priorities of scientific accuracy and accessibility on this popular and young social media channel. Objectives: i) To evaluate the performance of our Instagram channel, ii) to analyze audience characteristics, iii) to develop a strategy to increase our audience reach and iv) to share our concept and experiences with others in Cochrane and encourage them to use Instagram for knowledge translation. Methods: We captured data from Instagram 'Insights' on February 23 including follower count development in relation to Cochrane content posts (performance), demographic data of our audience and user's preferred online daytime and activities. Results: On our Instagram channel, we combine easier, short content like 'memes' with posts that present Cochrane evidence ('Review of the week') or knowledge about basic concepts of EbM ('ABC of evidence'). After just a few months of publishing three to four posts per week, we have 1,051 Instagram followers (as of 23 February). The number of followers increased continuously, especially after popular posts. High-impact posts are diverse and difficult to predict, however. Most of our followers are aged between 15 and 24 years (35.3%), are based in large German cities such as Berlin, Freiburg im Breisgau or Hamburg and are gender balanced. Our users primarily interact with likes (98.0 %); only few provide comments (2.0 %). Activity peaks in the evening hours on weekend days. Conclusions: Using Instagram as a dissemination channel has been a challenging but rewarding experience that offers access to a younger audience often missed by classical channels. The performance of our Instagram channel strongly depends on providing content regularly. Due to the still limited number of posts, we could not yet determine preferences for certain topics among our followers. In future, we want to adapt our dissemination work via Instagram even more to a young audience and encourage interaction with our followers. [Exploring trial publication and research waste in COVID-19 randomised trials of hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and vitamin D: a meta-epidemiological cohort study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473804/exploring-trial-publication-and-research-waste-in-covid-19-randomised-trials-of-hydroxychloroquine-corticosteroids-and-vitamin-d-a-meta-epidemiological-cohort-study) Background: The global research response to the COVID-19 pandemic was impressive but also led to an infodemic and considerable research waste. Registered but unpublished trials add to these problems. Objectives: We aimed to determine the publication status of registered randomised trials of common COVID-19 treatments to describe the characteristics of these trials and to examine the association among these characteristics, publication and research waste. Methods: This meta-epidemiological cohort study used a sample of randomised trials that tested corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine or vitamin D as treatments for COVID-19, registered between 1 November 2019 and 31 December 2021 and available via the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal. We searched for each trial's published results up to 20 October 2022. We analysed the trials' characteristics with descriptive statistics and performed univariate logistic regression to examine the association between these characteristics and publication status. We followed this with multiple logistic regression using significant characteristics to assess the association between trial characteristics and publication status. Results: We identified 357 eligible trials on ICTRP. Of these, 107 (30%) had published or made their results available publicly by 20 October 2022. We could not find publications or other publicly available results for 250 (70%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a larger target sample size was a significant positive predictor of publication, with target sample sizes more than 300, almost tripling the odds of publication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.35 to 5.62). Conclusions: Less than one-third of this sample of registered trials made their results public. Our findings identified that many trialists had not updated their trial's status, results or both on the trial registry. Failure to share trial results publicly is a disservice to patients, clinicians and policymakers and adds to research waste. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement in the conduct of our research but, given the significant interest in these medicines, their impact on patient's lives (including the potential for harm) and their costs, we would welcome public partnership in drawing attention to our findings. [Grading of recommendations in intensive care unit guidelines: A scoping review of existing methodological approaches](/colloquium-2023/session/1473851/grading-of-recommendations-in-intensive-care-unit-guidelines-a-scoping-review-of-existing-methodological-approaches) Background: There has been an explosion of ICU guidelines for clinicians to consider in the last decade. Often, several guidelines on one and the same clinical topic, however, appear to come to different conclusions regarding the underlying level of evidence and strength of recommendations. Objectives: This scoping review assessed methodological approaches used to grade the underlying level of evidence and strength of recommendations within ICU guidelines. Methods: A systematic search of guideline platforms and medical society databases was performed to identify guidelines for intensive care medicine. Other potentially eligible guidelines were identified by searching reference lists of matching guidelines. A two-stage screening was performed by two reviewers. Data were extracted and inspected for statistical analysis. Results: We included 91 guidelines with a total of 3.758 recommendations in this scoping review. We grouped relevant guidelines according to their context and contrasted all recommendations and the level of evidence for each recommendation. We found that multiple ICU guidelines exist for the same clinical topic using multiple different grading systems. Most of the included guidelines (n=57) used GRADE to assess the level of evidence and strength of recommendation. Only 10 of 57 guidelines used the GRADE approach correctly. Other grading methods used were the ESC/EACTS grading scale (n=3), SIGN 50 (n=4), a combination of different methods, or used a self-developed grading system. Conclusions: There are too many guidelines for the same clinical topic for a clinician to keep track of them all. This is further complicated by the fact that guideline development is not standardized, and the grading carried out is incorrect, making it difficult to assess which recommendation of which guideline should be followed in daily practice. The use of different grading systems across guidelines limits comparison of recommendations across guidelines. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Standardization of guideline development process with the use of a uniform grading system will allow clinicians to follow the recommendations of guidelines in their daily work. Patients will benefit from more uniform, guideline-based treatment. [Methodological challenges in systematic reviews of mHealth interventions: survey, expert workshop, and recommendations](/colloquium-2023/session/1473525/methodological-challenges-in-systematic-reviews-of-mhealth-interventions-survey-expert-workshop-and-recommendations) Background: Mobile health (mHealth) is the use of mobile technology, such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, to support and improve health. The mHealth field is rapidly growing and will play an essential role in healthcare in the coming years. Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evaluating health interventions and ensuring that resources are used effectively to improve healthcare outcomes. However, systematic reviewers following traditional SR methods may face specific methodological challenges when evaluating mHealth interventions. Objectives: O1) Identify methodological challenges specific to SRs of mHealth interventions. O2) Discuss a group of prioritised challenges. O3) Provide recommendations for overcoming those prioritised challenges. Methods: Three-phase National Institutes of Health-funded project [Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field: Resource for Research (2R24AT001293)]. O1) Online survey to collect methodological challenges specific to SRs of mHealth interventions. O2) Online workshop with experts. O3) Development of recommendations via consensus. Results: O1) Survey (n=51 authors of SRs of mHealth interventions). The methodological aspects most frequently rated by experienced reviewers as more challenging in SRs of mHealth interventions were 1) keeping the SR up to date (88%) and 2) issues of intervention integrity (the degree to which the mHealth intervention was delivered as intended). The main intervention integrity challenges were defining intervention intensity (80%), assessing intervention integrity (78%), dealing with continuously evolving interventions (74%), extracting the mHealth intervention details (68%), incorporating cointerventions into analyses (65%), and defining the intervention in the review protocol (64%). O2) Two-hour online workshop: eleven experts discussed how to address updating and integrity challenges. O3) Preliminary recommendations for updating SRs of mHealth interventions and addressing mHealth intervention integrity are being developed. Examples of recommendations: a) develop taxonomies and standardised data extraction forms to capture critical mHealth intervention integrity information and b) adapt SR processes to deliver timely review updates for the dynamic mHealth apps market. Conclusions: SRs of mHealth interventions present specific methodological challenges, such as those related to the mHealth intervention integrity and keeping the SR up to date. This project developed recommendations to overcome methodological challenges specific to mHealth SRs. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: Not foreseen. [Reporting of Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) in Cochrane protocols and reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473410/reporting-of-risk-of-bias-2-rob2-in-cochrane-protocols-and-reviews) Background: Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) was introduced in 2019 to improve the usability and address some limitations of the original version. It is used to assess bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in systematic reviews. Minozzi et al (2022) looked at any systematic review (n=208 reviews 5.3% Cochrane) published Jan 2019 to Jan 2020 and found that many applied the RoB 2 tool incorrectly. For example, for reviews with more than one outcome, only 28.2 % applied the RoB 2 tool to specific outcomes with 71.8% erroneously applying the tool to the whole study. Guidance for authors to use the tool appropriately was developed by Cochrane during a pilot phase of implementation (Flemyng 2022). Has this guidance helped Cochrane authors to use RoB2 appropriately? Objectives: To determine whether Cochrane protocols and reviews used RoB2 appropriately and followed the available Cochrane guidance. Methods: We searched for Cochrane protocols and reviews of interventions, published between January 2019 and December 2022 which specified use of RoB2. Each review and protocol will be assessed against the Cochrane guidance for appropriate use of RoB 2. Results: Ninety eight Cochrane reviews, updates and 236 protocols for reviews had cited use of RoB 2, which represents 5.5% of reviews and 26% of protocols. We will summarise how many of the protocols and reviews follow both the conduct and reporting aspects of the guidance. This will include: Stating the effect of interest, listing the outcomes assessed, specifying time points and means of measurement of outcomes, stating if variants of the tool will be used for cross-over and cluster RCTs, check if the RoB 2 tool has been inappropriately adapted, state how the data collected for RoB 2 will be stored and presented. Conclusions: We will state if the Cochrane guidance has helped authors to apply and report the use of the RoB 2 tool in the assessment of bias in RCTs appropriately. The findings will be used to inform future implementation of new methods in Cochrane with the aim of reducing misapplication in the early stages of implementation. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Challenges and Achievements of Implementing Evidence-Based Psychology in Brazil](/colloquium-2023/session/1473727/challenges-and-achievements-of-implementing-evidence-based-psychology-in-brazil) Background: The implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in Brazil is an important initiative to promote the use of scientific evidence in psychology research and practice. The American Psychological Association, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and several international associations emphasize the importance of EBP as a major initiative to contribute to reducing the global burden of mental disorders, a leading cause of disability worldwide. Objectives: To provide an overview of the implementation of EBP in Brazil and evaluate the effectiveness of the program through a literature review and analysis of data from the first course on EBP in Brazil. Methods: A literature review and analysis of data from the first course on EBP in Brazil and the implementation program at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Federal University of Sao Paulo were conducted to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Results: Over the past decade, the implementation of EBP in Brazil has made significant progress, including the publication of the first book on the topic\u2014Evidence-Based Psychology: scientific proofs of efficacy of psychotherapy (Melnik and Atallah 2011)\u2014and the development of the first course. The program has trained and supported numerous clinical psychologists and academics, with positive results. Among the outcomes, more than 65% of participants registered a systematic review protocol, approximately 50% completed a full systematic review, and 35% published primary studies. Conclusions: The implementation of EBP in Brazil is a major challenge due to the gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice. The program developed at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Federal University of Sao Paulo has been successful in training and supporting clinicians and researchers in implementing evidence in their clinical practice. The impact of the program has been remarkable and has resulted in benefits for the development of relevant scientific projects and the improvement of clinical outcomes supported by scientific evidence. Further efforts are needed to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice in Brazil. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The impact of the program has been remarkable and has resulted in benefits for the development of relevant scientific projects and the improvement of clinical outcomes supported by scientific evidence. [Why we need a new Cochrane Thematic Group on Person-centred care, Health Systems and Public Health](/colloquium-2023/session/1473636/why-we-need-a-new-cochrane-thematic-group-on-person-centred-care-health-systems-and-public-health) Background: Person-centred health and public health systems are systems in which healthcare providers, managers, and planners involve consumers/service users as partners in planning, delivering, and evaluating services. Such approaches are key to ensuring that health and public health systems interventions meet the needs of consumers and other stakeholders, and promote engagement, empowerment, and equity. Person-centred approaches are also necessary for safe, high-performing, sustainable and resilient health, and public health systems and are key to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. In recognition of this, Cochrane has agreed to establish a Thematic Group in this area. Goal of the Thematic Group: To collaborate in providing leadership and expertise to support Cochrane's production of priority syntheses on person-centred health and public health systems, and working to ensure more effective, equitable, and accessible systems for all. Key contributions of the Thematic Group: The Thematic Group brings together the expertise of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), Cochrane Consumers and Communication (CCC), and Cochrane Public Health (CPH) to: Provide strategic leadership on review priorities within the Thematic Group scope, working with diverse stakeholders. Advance methods to support evidence synthesis in complex areas that meet the needs of stakeholders. This may include the use of logic models to articulate intervention pathways and shape syntheses, syntheses of qualitative evidence, and approaches for coproducing syntheses with stakeholders. Contribute to knowledge translation and evidence-informed decision making for person-centred care, health, and public health systems, drawing on implementation science and other relevant disciplines. Share and strengthen capacity with partners in the Global South. Conclusions: By integrating evidence on person-centred health systems and public health, this new Thematic Group will contribute to understanding the interconnectedness between health systems, public health, and personal, social, and environmental contexts to promote healthy lives and well-being for all people. Relevance and importance to consumers: Patients, carers, and families are central to the concept of person-centred health and public health systems. This Thematic Group will contribute to advancing this perspective, identifying review priorities from the perspectives of consumers and building an evidence base for decision-making. [Setting up National Health Research Priorities in Malaysia through evidence gap maps](/colloquium-2023/session/1473395/setting-up-national-health-research-priorities-in-malaysia-through-evidence-gap-maps) Background: There are many approaches to health research priorities (HRP) settings, however there is no general agreement on what might constitute the best practice. Regardless of the lack of international consensus for the best method for research priority setting, the process must be fair, equitable, and legitimate. Prioritization allows the researchers and policymakers to channel resources, as well as donor investments, in health to the areas of the highest priority. HRP is essential to maximize the impact of investments in research. Objectives: To identify priority areas for health research using strategies adapted from Evidence Gap Maps in Malaysia. Methods: We conducted an evidence mapping process adapted from Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) and Cochrane Method of prioritization to generate an \"evidence map\" and visually depict the distribution of evidence available and identify gaps in evidence and to inform future research priorities for this priority-setting exercise. EGMs present a new addition to the tools available to support evidence-informed policy making. EGMs are thematic evidence collections covering a range of issues. We searched PubMed, Embase, and national Research databases to identify gaps and evidence for any studies conducted in Malaysia. We invited the policymakers, stakeholders, and experts in the field to give feedback on the identified research priority areas. We conducted serial consultations with expert groups, including academics, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and funding bodies. Lastly, we ranked all the identified research priority areas. Results: The research priorities exercise resulted in identification of eight research areas focusing on health system, communicable disease, non-communicable disease, older people, mental health, environmental, nutrition and food safety and quality, and oral as the most important problems with different profiles of priorities. Conclusions: This EGMs provide new perspectives in presentation of evidence and help us know the need for future research to address the current gaps. The exercise adapted from EGMs covers most of the health research areas and strengthen the priority areas to be focused. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: researchers, stake holders. [Developing a diversity and inclusion Cochrane US Mentoring Program](/colloquium-2023/session/1473723/developing-a-diversity-and-inclusion-cochrane-us-mentoring-program) Background: Cochrane has several mentoring programs, but to date they have included an objective of reaching participants in low-resource and historically marginalized settings, as well as individuals who may experience discrimination, health inequity, and lack of access to evidence-based healthcare curricula, experts, and materials. As such, the senior officer of the Cochrane US Network designed, implemented, and is currently running Year 2 of a mentoring program with these objectives. Objectives: Methods: Cochrane has several mentoring programs, but to date they have included an objective of reaching participants in low-resource and historically marginalized settings, as well as individuals who may experience discrimination, health inequity, and lack of access to evidence-based healthcare curricula, experts, and materials. As such, the senior officer of the Cochrane US Network designed, implemented, and is currently running Year 2 of a mentoring program with these objectives. Results: Fifteen participants of Year 1 were surveyed; 66.7% (10) reported high satisfaction, 80% (12) recommended the program to others, and 93.3 % stated that the program reflects Cochrane objectives. Seven of nine mentees received scholarships for trainings, workshops, and conferences. Mentees were involved in 14 systematic reviews, two received paid internships, and eight of nine received job opportunities because of their participation in the program. Four Year 1 mentees are now Year 2 mentors. Conclusions: A clear need has been identified for additional programming and resources for students and health professionals hailing from under-resourced and marginalized settings. Cochrane is well placed to provide these services and indeed has as an organizational goal to impact global health equity and to turn evidence synthesis focus toward health inequities. Dedicated resources and personnel are needed to ensure continued success and reach. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Many mentees are patients, carers, and other consumers, from multiple counties. [Authorship diversity among first authors of original investigation articles published in Revista Medica de Chile between 2017-2021](/colloquium-2023/session/1473894/authorship-diversity-among-first-authors-of-original-investigation-articles-published-in-revista-medica-de-chile-between-2017-2021) Background: Revista M\u00e9dica de Chile (RevMedChile) is the oldest monthly journal of Chilean health science responsible for publishing original articles related to internal medicine and its derived subspecialties. It is the Chilean journal of health science with the highest indexes h5 (26) and m5 (40) in the year 2021, according to SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). Diversity among researchers is an important aspect for science progress, allowing us to develop a broader spectrum of viewpoints and looking forward to achieving an equity perspective related to gender, nationality, and academical level. This may lead to an increase in trustworthiness evidence by including historically relegated variables and patients. Despite this, UNESCO declared that less than 30% of the world's researchers are women, and many articles point out the lack of diversity in specific fields. Objectives: Assess authorship diversity and its distribution by theme and methodology in investigation articles, published in Rev Med Chile between the years 2017-2021. Methods: We retrieved every article published in Rev Med Chile during 2017-2021 and made a full text review to identify the first author, country, theme, methodology, conflict of interest, and founding, all of them declared on the articles. We only consider quantitative research articles from clinical and preclinical areas. A list of the first authors characterized by the variables sex, occupation, and geographical location was created. Finally, we analyze the distribution of those variables in different themes and methodologies presented in the totality of the articles reviewed. Preliminary Results: We found 1,056 articles of which 728 were included because of our inclusion criteria. In 442 (60.7%) of the articles, the first author were men and in 286 (39.3%) were women. Seven hundred and nine (97.3%) of the first authors were geographically localized in Latin America, 13 (1.8%) in Europe, 3 (0.4%) in the United States and Canada, and 2 (0.3%) in Asia. The analysis of the occupation and organization of the authors is ongoing. Conclusions: Further conclusions will be presented in Cochrane's colloquium. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, and/or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [Pooled risk differences - a comparison between estimates from randomised controlled trials and estimates from propensity score-matched non-RCTs](/colloquium-2023/session/1473524/pooled-risk-differences-a-comparison-between-estimates-from-randomised-controlled-trials-and-estimates-from-propensity-score-matched-non-rcts) Background: Estimating number needed to treat (NNT) from pooled risk differences may provide useful information for decision-making. Traditionally, such information is obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). With increasing amounts of observational data available, as well as published comparisons using propensity score (PS)-matching to address confounding by indication, it may be appealing to rely on pooled non-RCTs for this purpose, particularly when RCTs are not available. Objectives: To compare estimates of NNT based on pooled absolute risk differences from RCTs versus PS-matched non-RCTs. Methods: The basis for these analyses was RCTs and non-RCTs identified in a health technology assessment (HTA) comparing clopidogrel versus ticagrelor as part of dual antiplatelet treatment after acute coronary syndrome (HTA-centrum/Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden, 2021:123). The present comparison between pooled RCTs and pooled non-RCTs focused on the following three outcomes: all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and major bleeding. For each outcome, pooled absolute risk differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses for RCTs and PS-matched non-RCTs separately, and NNT were calculated for statistically significant results. Results: In all, 21 RCTs (29,314 patients) and 13 non-RCTs (103,363 PS-matched patients; 11%-79% of the studied populations) were included in the meta-analyses. For all-cause mortality, the pooled risk differences from RCTs and non-RCTs were 0.5 (95% CI: -0.3; 1.4) and 1.5 (0.3; 2.6) percentage points, respectively, i.e., passing the line of unity for RCTs whilst favouring ticagrelor for non-RCTs with an NNT of 67 to avoid one death. For MI, the pooled risk differences from RCTs and non-RCTs were 0.8 (0.03; 1.5) and 0.5 (-0.2; 1.2) percentage points, respectively, i.e., passing the line of unity for non-RCTs whilst favouring ticagrelor for RCTs with an NNT of 125 to avoid one MI. For major bleeding, the pooled risk differences from RCTs and non-RCTs were -0.8% (-1.5; favouring clopidogrel with an NNT of 125 versus 167 to avoid one major bleeding. Conclusions: Statistical significance/NNT of pooled risk difference diverged between RCTs and PS-matched non-RCTs, a finding of importance for certainty of evidence assessments when RCTs are not available for conclusions [Certainty of evidence matters: is it reported and interpreted in infertility journals?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473381/certainty-of-evidence-matters-is-it-reported-and-interpreted-in-infertility-journals) Background: Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews (SRs), it is crucial to assess their certainty of evidence (CoE) because the design itself does not guarantee high CoE. Objectives: To evaluate whether CoE was reported in SRs in infertility journals and whether they used appropriate wording to describe that CoE. Methods: We selected five fertility journals with the highest impact factors. We performed a search on PubMed, identifying potential SRs with meta-analysis. We screened the studies by title and abstract and analyzed whether they classified the evidence in the full text and in the abstract. When CoE was not evaluated, we analyzed it with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We described how often the authors used a tool for CoE and the level of the CoE published in the selected SRs. We also analyzed whether using a tool for CoE was associated with the P-value and whether the P-value was associated with the level of the evidence. Finally, we analyzed whether the study authors made any effort to adapt the wording used in the abstract to the CoE and the magnitude of the described estimated effect. Results: CoE was reported in 21.4% of the SRs and in less than 10% of the abstracts. Although we did not find important differences in the reports of CoE of those that showed statistically significant differences and those that did not, P-value was associated with the wording chosen by authors. In general, magnitude of the effect was not expressed with consistent wording in 54.8% (23/42) of the SRs, wheras level of CoE was not expressed with consistent wording in 92.9% (39/42). Whereas magnitude of the effect was more consistently expressed in studies with statistically significant findings, CoE was better expressed when the P-value was greater than 0.05. Conclusions: In major infertility journals, less than 25% of authors reported the overall CoE in SRs. Authors still focus more on the discussion if the found difference was by chance or not and less on limitations in the study design, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias. Authors should make efforts to interpret results in the context of those evaluations. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [ADAPTING CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES TO DIGITAL TOOLS: A METHODOLOGICAL STUDY](/colloquium-2023/session/1473888/adapting-clinical-practice-guidelines-to-digital-tools-a-methodological-study) Background: In Brazil, the process of development and updating of the clinical guidelines for the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, SUS) is already well systematized by the Ministry of Health. However, implementing such guidelines within local contexts and at the point of care is still an important challenge. Digital tools for decision support can promote clinical practice guideline implementation and dissemination. Objectives: To report a methodology process involved in transforming the guidelines into Digital tools (cards) for decision support for routine use in primary health care settings in Northeastern Brazil, an initiative from Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, Brazil, conducted from 2022 to 2023, to support the TeleNordeste Project, funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health initiative (PROADI-SUS). Methods: This is a methodological study for adapting clinical guidelines to digital tools (cards) for decision support for routine use in primary health care settings. This study included the following steps: (1) identification and selection of guidelines published by the Ministry of Health; (2) adaptation of clinical guidelines using the ADAPTE method; (3) adaptation of the guidelines in a user-friendly format according to the Practical Approach to Care Kit; and (4) preliminary adaptation using WHO Smart Guidelines approach. For the development of the first three stages, three working groups were established consisting of specialists and general practitioners, whereas the fourth stage was developed by a technology team specialized in digital health. Results: From 2022 to February 2023, we developed 32 digital tools from the adaptation of clinical guidelines in different areas: Orthopedics (n=7, mechanical arthralgia), cardiology (n=5, hypertension 1 and cardiac cardiac arrhythmias, and chest pain), endocrinology (n=5, thyroid nodule, and metabolic syndrome), neurology (n=5, stroke, headache 1 and epilepsy (n=3, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 1 and 2 and cough), rheumatology (n=2, inflammatory arthralgia and chronic pain) and psychiatry (n=2, depression and anxiety). Conclusions: This project has contributed to facilitating the adaptation of recommendations through digital systems. It is expected that these digital tools will support the implementation of evidence-based practices in the primary care settings in Northeastern Brazil. [Using Real-World Evidence to Augment Systematic Review Findings](/colloquium-2023/session/1473704/using-real-world-evidence-to-augment-systematic-review-findings) Background: The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program produces systematic reviews to inform healthcare decisions such as recommendations in clinical practice guidelines and national coverage determinations. Reviews also frequently address priorities of healthcare systems to inform initiatives to improve the quality of care delivered. Due to limitations in the literature base, systematic reviews may be inconclusive or only represent a narrow patient population, making it difficult to generalize or apply review findings across healthcare systems. Objectives: To determine the feasibility, resources, and infrastructure needed to use real-world data from healthcare systems to supplement findings from systematic reviews. Methods: Three topics recently addressed by AHRQ systematic reviews were chosen for this pilot. A retrospective observational study on each topic was conducted by individual teams using electronic health record (EHR) data from their healthcare system (Mayo Clinic, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and University of Minnesota). One team assessed outcomes of migraine treatment in pregnant persons or those with cardiovascular disease; the second examined clinical characteristics associated with surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of infantile epilepsy; and the third evaluated the use of treatment for osteoporosis after surgery for incident fractures. For each topic, we also examined resource requirements. Results: We report how patient populations of interest were defined and identified from the EHR and describe the degree to which the outcomes (effect size and strength of evidence) from the analyses of real-world data complement or conflict with the findings from the original systematic review. We also report the feasibility of routinely conducting such supplementary analyses of real-world data, considering additional resource requirements and timeliness. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that analyses of real-world data from healthcare systems in the United States can supplement systematic review findings by offering additional insights. This is particularly true when decisions involve patient populations such as infants and pregnant women that are seldom included in clinical trials. In our experience, accessing and validating healthcare system data took the most time but may offer efficiencies when standard procedures are established. [A descriptive analysis of funding in research articles published in Revista m\u00e9dica de Chile between 2017-2021.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473899/a-descriptive-analysis-of-funding-in-research-articles-published-in-revista-m\u00e9dica-de-chile-between-2017-2021.) Background: RevMedChile is the oldest monthly journal of Chilean health science which is responsible for publishing original articles related to internal medicine and its derived subspecialties from different countries. It is the Chilean journal of health science with the highest indexes h5 (26) and m5 (40) in the year 2021 according to SCImago Journal Rank (SJR). Funding is crucial for research; without it, researchers cannot conduct any investigation or publish in journals, making them uncompetitive in the scientific community. The global average of research and development (R&D) spending as a fraction of GDP is around 2.274%; in Chile, only 0.34% of the IBP goes to R&D. Objectives: To describe the conflicts of interest disclosed by the authors of clinical and preclinical research articles published in Rev Med Chile between 2017 and 2021. Methods: We retrieved every article published in Rev Med Chile during 2017-2021 and made a full text review to identify the first author, country, theme, methodology, conflict of interest, and founding, all of them declared on the articles. Then, we classified their funding whether it came from the government, the academia, private companies, private clinics, public hospitals, or none of them and calculated their frequency and correlated it to its country, theme, methodology, and conflict of interest. Preliminary Results: We found 1,056 articles, of which 667 (63.1%) declared they did not receive any funding, 95 (8.9%) received funds from the Chilean government through R&D programs, 61 (5.7%) from the academia, 9 (0.8%) from private hospitals, 8 (0.7%) from private companies, 5 (0.4%) from foreign scholarships, 4 (0.3%) from foreign governments, 2 (0.1%) from public hospitals, 2 (0.1%) from medical societies, and 1 (0.09%) from a civilian organization. Fifty-seven (9.4%) received funding from two sources and 145 (13.7%) did not declare if they received any funding. Conclusions: Final conclusion and results will be presented in Cochrane's colloquium. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, and/or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [Impact of Expectation Bias on Effect Estimates between Non-inferiority and Superiority Randomized Clinical Trials: Retrospective Cohort Study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473523/impact-of-expectation-bias-on-effect-estimates-between-non-inferiority-and-superiority-randomized-clinical-trials-retrospective-cohort-study) Background: Prior expectations of effect estimates may affect randomized clinical trials (RCTs), leading to expectation bias. When assessing the same clinical question, the design choice between superiority RCTs (S-RCTs) and noninferiority RCTs (NI-RCTs) may be based on researchers' expectations. Objectives: To estimate the impact of expectation bias by comparing the effect estimates between S-RCTs and NI-RCTs. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of RCTs. We screened Cochrane reviews for meta-analyses that assessed the efficacy of clinical interventions, produced statistically significant results, and included at least one NI-RCT and one S-RCT. In each meta-analysis, S-RCTs were included in the exposure group, while NI-RCTs were in the control group. S-RCTs should share the same primary outcome with NI-RCTs. The main outcome was the ratio of risk ratio (RRR), hazard ratio (RHR), or odds ratio (ROR, with OR transformed from standardized mean difference) between S-RCTs and NI-RCTs. RRRs, RHRs, and RORs were pooled to form a single estimate by random-effects meta-analyses. Potential confounders and effect modifiers were assessed in a linear mixed-effect regression model. Results: We identified 56 meta-analyses from 9,018 Cochrane reviews. A total of 405 RCTs were included, consisting of 74 NI-RCTs and 331 S-RCTs. Among meta-analyses using OR (transformed from SMD), RR, and HR as the effect measure, S-RCTs produced an effect estimate 1.63 (1.21-2.19, I2=84.5%), 1.16 and 1.08 greater than NI-RCTs, respectively. On average, S-RCTs produced an effect estimate 1.31 (95% CI: 1.17-1.48, I2=73.3%) times greater than NI-RCTs. When adjusting for the covariates, S-RCTs produced an effect estimate 1.25 (1.05, 1.47) times greater than NI-RCTs. Publication bias was assessed as an effect modifier: among meta-analyses where publication bias was detected, undetected, or unclear, S-RCTs produced an effect estimate 2.27 (1.72-2.99), 1.25 (1.05-1.47), and 1.10 (0.95-1.29) times greater than NI-RCTs, respectively. Conclusions: S-RCT generally produced an effect size 31% higher than NI-RCT, implying that expectation bias may significantly distort the effect estimates. Such bias may not be adequately controlled by the current procedures to detect or minimize bias.

[Methodological assessment of cost-effectiveness studies of treatment with biologicals of severe asthma: a systematic review [MeCoBiA].](/colloquium-2023/session/1652061/methodological-assessment-of-cost-effectiveness-studies-of-treatment-with-biologicals-of-severe-asthma-a-systematic-review-[mecobia].) Background: There has been a growth in the number of economic evaluations in the literature, reporting important differences in their designs and results for a particular health technology. Previous research has shown systematic differences among incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) conclusions in industry-sponsored evaluations. Since ICERs are used for reimbursement decisions, exploring these differences may improve healthcare decision-making. Biological treatments for asthma have been extensively evaluated, and vast differences in the cost-effectiveness of the same drug have been reported. Therefore, studying these differences could serve as a base-case scenario to better understand differences in CEA. Objectives: To describe the methodological characteristics of the CEA of treatment with biologics for severe asthma and assess their methodological limitations. Furthermore, we will evaluate the association between methodological characteristics and ICERs in these studies. Methods: We will CEA of omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab, benralizumab, and tezepelumab, compared with the standard of care in adults diagnosed with severe asthma, that report ICERs as the primary outcome. We developed a search strategy for Medline and Embase. We will assess included studies with the consensus on the health economics criteria checklist (CHEC) for trial-based studies and ISPOR/ISMD checklist for studies using models. We will use regression analysis to examine the association between study characteristics (e.g., methodological quality) with the ICER and the cost-effectiveness conclusion (cost-effective or not). Expected results: After removing duplicates, we screened the title and abstract of 1364 records, including 26 studies after full-text evaluation. Our results will inform which study characteristics are associated with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. This information may be particularly useful for decision-makers, including funding agencies and guideline developers, raising awareness of the importance of carefully considering evidence from CEA. [Methods and processes for the production of Cochrane Rapid Reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473914/methods-and-processes-for-the-production-of-cochrane-rapid-reviews) Backgrounds: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, health decision-makers have elevated the need for timeliness of evidence, and there is an urgent need for a rapid literature synthesis method to provide highly time-sensitive evidence to aid decision making in urgent emergencies. Although systematic reviews (SR) have a definite advantage in synthesizing high-quality evidence, their rigorous methodological processes often take 1 year or more to complete, limiting the timeliness of evidence. Rapid systematic reviews (RR) have gained international attention because of their ability to provide more timely evidence. It is considered a comprehensive approach to the literature similar to SR and scoping reviews, and its development methods and processes are critical to the reliability of conclusions. Objectives: To analyze the development methods and processes of rapid systematic reviews published in Cochrane Library. Methods: A search was conducted on the Cochrane Library (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/) website using the terms \"Rapid review\" to obtain published rapid systematic reviews, and details of the formulation methods and processes were extracted according to a predesigned information extraction table. Results: After preliminary results and screening, we found 12 eligible rapid systematic reviews, and their production dates were concentrated in 2018 (2), 2020 (8), and 2021 (2), of which 5 focused on COVID-19, and we are working on the details about the main results and look forward to presenting them in Cochrane London 2023. [Stakeholders' perceptions and experiences of animal assisted interventions for people with dementia: a qualitative evidence synthesis engaging patient and public](/colloquium-2023/session/1473812/stakeholders'-perceptions-and-experiences-of-animal-assisted-interventions-for-people-with-dementia-a-qualitative-evidence-synthesis-engaging-patient-and-public) Background: Animal-assisted intervention (AAI) has developed as a popular psychosocial intervention for people living with dementia, which can have positive effects on mood, social and physical activity, and quality of life (QoL) of people living with dementia. However, the perceptions and experiences of AAI by stakeholders and the factors influencing the implementation of AAI remain underexplored. Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research is widely prompted to enhance the transparency, confidence, and quality of research. However, the experience of involving people living with dementia and their caregivers in qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) is not well reported. Objectives: This presentation will describe the experience of working with PPI contributors on an ongoing QES that explores the perceptions and experiences of AAI for people living with dementia. Methods: Before this review began, a PPI invitation and plan was sent to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (ASI). Two people with dementia agreed to meet with the review team to discuss and agree what their contributions to the review would be. A schedule of PPI meetings was developed in partnership. The stages of the review process and the PPI involvement will be described. Conclusions: The reflections from this presentation will guide reviewers and PPI partnerships on what works well and what could be improved when working together on a QES. Any specific considerations for people living with dementia as coproducers of research will be identified. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Two PPI contributors from ASI will be involved in all stages of the QES, including 1) sharing their experiences and values around AAI; 2) advising on research design; 3) reviewing, and assisting with readability of, research results and findings; and 4) deciding on how best to share the research findings with the public. [Evidence synthesis methodologies used for questions relating to barriers and/or enablers in health care: a methodological scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473620/evidence-synthesis-methodologies-used-for-questions-relating-to-barriers-andor-enablers-in-health-care-a-methodological-scoping-review) Background: Questions related to identifying factors that act as barriers or that enable (i.e., support) best practice in healthcare are a popular form of primary research to understand the evidence-practice gap. Currently there is no consensus regarding which methodological approach to use when undertaking an evidence synthesis relating to barriers and/or enablers in healthcare, nor the methods for synthesizing results. Further investigation is needed to overcome this challenge and assist in informing decisions for patient/service users. Objectives: To determine the methodological processes used in barrier and/or enabler reviews to inform the development of future guidance for the evidence synthesis of barrier and/or enabler studies. Methods: A methodological scoping review based on an apriori protocol and following JBI guidance was conducted. All forms of evidence syntheses (excluding literature reviews and umbrella reviews) that described the methods used and were related to any level of the health system were eligible, including consumers of healthcare. In 2022, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, JBI, and EPPI-Centre databases were searched, and records were screened independently in duplicate. A customised data extraction form was developed, and results mapped and synthesized narratively. Results: From more than 24,000 records screened, 798 reviews were eligible for inclusion. A range of methodologies, including but not limited to systematic reviews, integrative reviews, scoping reviews, mixed methods systematic reviews, and rapid reviews were used in the included studies. Synthesis methods varied and included approaches, such as narrative synthesis, descriptive analysis, qualitative synthesis, meta-analysis, and framework synthesis. In some reviews, there were incongruencies between the study aims, stated methodologies, and the methods used to undertake the review, as well as the conduct and reporting guidance followed. Conclusions: This review identified that a range of methodologies and methods are used to synthesize questions relating to barriers and/or enablers in the context of health care. Issues were identified relating to misalignment between guidance followed and methodologies and methods used. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The results of this review are of importance to patients/service users as syntheses of barriers and/or enablers are often undertaken to inform patient care and service improvement. [Estimating costs of lost productivity - examples of methodological shortcomings from an evaluation related to long-term sickness absence](/colloquium-2023/session/1473595/estimating-costs-of-lost-productivity---examples-of-methodological-shortcomings-from-an-evaluation-related-to-long-term-sickness-absence) Background: The Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) was commissioned by the government to evaluate positive and negative effects of different ways for healthcare to manage individuals on long-term sickness absence, or at risk of becoming so. The commissioning also included an analysis of health economic aspects. Objectives: The purpose of this sub-study was to critically assess the methods for calculating costs of lost production seen in the health economic studies identified within the evaluation. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomised controlled trials and associated health economic studies of health care interventions related to long-term sickness absence. The evaluation was restricted to the most common causes of long-term sick absence in Sweden. Health economic studies that met the study inclusion criteria were critically assessed by two SBU health economists using SBU's checklist for trial-based health economic studies. Independent individual assessments were followed by a consensus assessment in which the studies were rated as having high, medium, or low quality with respect to health economic methodology. Results: A total of 22 health economic studies were identified, the majority conducted in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands. In twelve of the studies, the health economic analyses were assessed as having low methodological quality. The most common reason was flaws in how costs of lost production had been calculated. In some cases, sickness benefits were assumed to be equivalent to costs of lost production, even though they constitute a transfer payment and not a cost. In other cases, the economic value of lost production and sickness benefits were summed, leading to double counting. Conclusions: Costs of lost production are a key health economic aspect in the context of long-term sickness absence. The fact that more than half of the health economic studies identified within the evaluation had methodological flaws in how costs for lost production were calculated indicates that the concepts and established methods are difficult to grasp and that expertise within health economics should be involved in studies that include health economic analyses. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Methodological rigour of systematic reviews used to inform the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans](/colloquium-2023/session/1473685/methodological-rigour-of-systematic-reviews-used-to-inform-the-2020-dietary-guidelines-for-americans) Background: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) are a set of recommendations that inform all federal nutrition programs in the U.S. The scientific rigour of U.S. dietary guidelines has raised questions on whether DGA recommendations are based on appropriate evaluation of scientific evidence and whether the systematic reviews (SRs) conducted by the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team to inform these recommendations were sufficiently systematic. These questions have brought on a need for enhanced transparency, greater scientific rigour, and updates to the scientific methodology to the DGA process. Objectives: The aim is to evaluate the following key questions (KQ): (KQ1) Do the SRs conducted by the NESR team report a transparent, complete, and accurate account of their SR process such that they can be replicated? (KQ2) If NESR's SRs were replicated by a group external to the DGA, would any observed differences in SR reporting and methodology substantially impact any final conclusions made by NESR? Methods: For KQ1, we will assess the overall methodological quality of the conduct of a random sample of SRs conducted by the NESR team using the AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) critical appraisal tool. For KQ2, we will replicate a randomly selected SR using current Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidance for the report and conduct of SRs. We will discuss any differences between our replicated review and the NESR's review using PRISMA 2020's comprehensive checklist. Weaknesses identified from our AMSTAR 2 quality assessment will be used to discuss any observed differences in the conduct of our replicated SR. Following the results of our review, we will plan to evaluate the interpretation of results from the NESR team's systematic reviews by reporting any spin bias. Expected Outcomes: Because DGAs are used to inform decision-making, it is imperative that the associated SRs are conducted with methodological rigour. We will use current methodological guidance to help determine the confidence the U.S. government can place in DGA dietary guideline recommendations. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We will collaborate with patient partners and stakeholders to obtain feedback on our analyses, interpretation, and communication of findings. [the methodological and reporting quality of scoping reviews in China: A scoping review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473625/the-methodological-and-reporting-quality-of-scoping-reviews-in-china-a-scoping-review) Background: Scoping review can assemble knowledge synthesis for emerging evidence, gives a comprehensive overview of the context, and has the potential to influence policy and practice developments. It is increasingly being utilized in China. Objectives: The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an overview of scoping reviews conducted by Chinese authors within the last decades. Methods: We searched scoping reviews published by Chinese authors in nine databases and six grey literature databases. We developed predefined forms to select reviews and abstract data. Reporting quality was assessed by the Preferred Reporting Items for PRISMA-ScR checklist. We conducted a quantitative analysis of the scoping review conduct and a qualitative analysis of the research scope. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare methodological issues and reporting quality in English-reported and Chinese-reported reviews. Results: A total of 276 reviews published between 2013 and 2022 were included, 172 English-reported reviews and 104 Chinese-reported reviews, respectively. The purposes mainly focused on mapping and summarizing evidence, and health and nursing were the common topics. Approximately 99.3% of reviews used the term \"scoping review\", and Arksey and O'Malley framework was the most frequently cited framework. Twenty-one English-reported scoping reviews provided a protocol of scoping review. PubMed was the most common source in English-reported reviews and CNKI in Chinese-reported reviews. Reviews published in English were more likely to search the grey literature (p-value = 0.011), consult information specialists (p-value < 0.001), and perform an updated search (p-value = 0.008) than those in Chinese. The reviews published in English had a significantly high score than those in Chinese (16 vs. 14; p-value < 0.001). The reporting ratios in English-reported reviews were higher than that in the Chinese reviews in nine items with statistical significance while were lower than in structured summary (p-value < 0.001) and eligibility criteria (p-value = 0.003). Conclusions: The number of scoping reviews conducted by Chinese authors each year is significantly increasing since 2018. Research topics are diverse; however, the reporting quality is unsatisfactory. Overall, scoping reviews conducted by Chinese authors need more standardization. [ACURATE: a guide for reporting sham controls in trials using acupuncture](/colloquium-2023/session/1473513/acurate-a-guide-for-reporting-sham-controls-in-trials-using-acupuncture) Background: Evidence shows that the quality of reporting of trials using sham controls is not ideal and has yet to improve over time. The lack of proper reporting impedes readers from fully understanding the validity of acupuncture trial findings and their relevant effectiveness. Objectives: To promote better reporting quality regarding sham acupuncture in clinical trials, for a precise appraisal of the adequacy of sham acupuncture procedure. Methods: A three-stage online Delphi survey was used to explore expert consensus and identify items that needed to be reported for trials using sham acupuncture. Items with higher than 80% consensus from the initial checklist were selected as the final candidates. Further discussion among the working group was convened to preclude potential redundancy among the items. Results: A total of 23 experts out of 35 (66%) responded to the Delphi process. A consensus of >80% was achieved on many items. The final checklist consists of 22 items in six categories: types of sham acupuncture, details of sham acupuncture manipulation, location of sham acupuncture, treatment regimen, practitioner, and protocol and settings. This checklist focuses on a clear depiction of sham needling procedures to enhance replicability and enable a precise appraisal. Conclusions: This paper presents the Acupuncture Controls gUideline for Reporting humAn Trials and Experiments (ACURATE) checklist, which is an extension of The Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials (CONSORT). This checklist can be used along with STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) when both real and sham acupuncture needles are used in the study. We encourage researchers to use ACURATE in trials and reviews involving sham acupuncture to assist in reporting sham acupuncture procedures and the related components. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Risk of bias of a set of primary studies across systematic reviews showed highly heterogeneous assessments: A methodological analysis within an overview](/colloquium-2023/session/1473847/risk-of-bias-of-a-set-of-primary-studies-across-systematic-reviews-showed-highly-heterogeneous-assessments-a-methodological-analysis-within-an-overview) Background: Risk of bias (RoB) assessment of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) is a critical step in the conduction of systematic reviews (SRs) because it directly impacts interpretation of findings and certainty of evidence. The Cochrane RoB tool (version 1) has been widely used historically, but some criticism remains in terms of possible disagreements between different assessors. Objectives: To describe the agreement of RoB assessment of a set of RCTs made by authors of different SRs using the RoB1 tool. Methods: Within an overview of SRs regarding the effects of anticancer drugs versus supportive care for hepatobiliary cancers, we extracted all RoB assessments made by SR authors that used the RoB1. We describe the percentage of severe disagreements (simultaneous low and high-risk assessments across different SRs) and non-severe disagreements (simultaneous low-unclear or unclear-high assessments) across all domains. Results: We identified 18 SRs including a total of 22 unique RCTs, of which 16 were evaluated with the RoB1 tool by at least two different reviews. We found severe disagreements in 50% of the assessments of the \"selective reporting\" domain, 37.5% of the \"blinding of outcome assessors\" domain, and 25% of the \"blinding of participants and personnel\" domain. Non-severe disagreements were observed in all domains, especially in the domains related to selection bias. Conclusions: RoB1 tool showed mostly discrepancies in three specific domains. Overview authors should extract and consider the RoB assessments of RCTs made from every SR included within an overview to explore these discrepancies. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Equity in the development of COVID-19 formal recommendations and good practice statements](/colloquium-2023/session/1473431/equity-in-the-development-of-covid-19-formal-recommendations-and-good-practice-statements) Background: We developed an interactive living map that presents the latest evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and care of COVID-19 (eCOVIDRecMap). Given the inequities in the COVID-19 pandemic, guideline developers must consider equity in the issued recommendations. Objectives: To identify COVID-19 formal recommendations and Good Practice Statements (GPS) focused on specific disadvantaged populations in eCOVIDRecMap and describe how health equity was assessed in the development of the formal recommendations. Methods: We employed the PROGRESS-Plus framework (Place, Race, Occupation, Gender, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic Status, Social Capital, Plus for other contextual factors) to identify disadvantaged population-specific recommendations and GPS. Of those, we assessed how likely impact on health equity was assessed in the evidence to decision (EtD) frameworks of these recommendations using criteria based on differences in baseline risk, value of outcomes for disadvantaged populations, differences in the magnitude of effect, and applicability. We also assessed how equity was considered in the certainty of evidence. Results: Of the 1,577 actionable statements published on the eCOVIDRecMap as of July 29th, 2022, we identified 310 (20%) disadvantaged population-specific actionable statements (124, 40% formal recommendations and 186, 60% GPS). Formal recommendations were most frequently focused on children (40%) followed by pregnant women (16%). GPS focused mostly on children (25%) and populations working in high-risk occupations (16%). Seventy-six percent (94/124) of the recommendations were accompanied with EtDs. More than half (55%, 52/94) of those considered indirectness of the evidence for disadvantaged populations. In most of the recommendations (49/52, 94%), the assessment led to reduction in the certainty of the evidence. Considerations in impact on health equity criterion most frequently involved implementation of the recommendation for disadvantaged populations (17%, 16/94). Conclusions: COVID-19 recommendations focused on disadvantaged populations were developed with insufficient considerations for equity. The urgent need for guidance during the pandemic may have made the consideration of equity in the development of disadvantaged population-specific recommendations challenging. Pragmatic guidance, focused on the evidence already available, might help to overcome this limitation. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients and healthcare consumers were involved in the development of the living recommendations map. [Quality Appraisal of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines Developed in Taiwan](/colloquium-2023/session/1473511/quality-appraisal-of-evidence-based-clinical-practice-guidelines-developed-in-taiwan) Background: Developing high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) requires rigorous and transparent methodology with updating in due time for optimum healthcare decisions. The development of CPGs in Taiwan is booming, and the guideline development methodologies are diverse. The quality of CPGs has yet to be systematically evaluated. Objectives: To systematically review the quality of evidence-based CPGs developed in Taiwan. Methods: Using as keywords, Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, international guideline website, Government Research Bulletin, two Chinese databases and Google Scholar were searched. For developed CPGs, The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) was used for evaluation by two researchers with a third expert in case of a 3-point difference in score. Results: A total of 96 CPGs were included after the screening. The guideline developers were professional societies (n=46), individual research or thesis (n=39), hospitals (n=9), and government (n=2). Of these, 36% receive funding from government agencies, 51.3% CPGs mentioned the evidence synthesis methodology and clinical recommendation generation, and only 4 use the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology. The published CPGs do not present any document or statements regarding conflicts of interest of the guideline development group. Moreover, only 14% of published CPGs have been updated. The standardized score of AGREE II in the six domains was Scope and purpose (81%), Stakeholder involvement (55%), Rigour of development (47%), Clarity of presentation (63%), Applicability (31%) and Editorial independence (22%). The overall quality was 4.5 points (Figure 1). Conclusions: Due to the lack of a CPG coordinating center, there is still room for improvement in Taiwan's CPG development. For CPG projects funded by government agencies, it is challenging to promote the application and updating of CPGs owing to a lack of funding and staffing at the end of the project. Establishing a national-level guideline development center, promoting evidence-based CPG development methodologies and developing a sustainable funding method to support high-quality CPG development on essential health issues are the goals for future efforts. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Academic-clinical partnership for enhancing evidence-based healthcare in a Portuguese Context: a case study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473598/academic-clinical-partnership-for-enhancing-evidence-based-healthcare-in-a-portuguese-context-a-case-study) Background: Academic-clinical partnerships offer opportunities to promote evidence-based healthcare in clinical and educational settings. An integrated approach, with the active collaboration of all stakeholders (researchers, healthcare professionals, and final consumers), becomes essential to prioritize the needs of evidence, to develop primary and secondary research regarding specific knowledge needs, and to transfer and implement the best available evidence in clinical practice. Objective: To describe the initiatives developed regarding the partnership between a clinical and a higher education nursing institution in Portugal. Methods: Within the JBI Collaboration, a partnership between a nursing school and a university hospital in Portugal was established in 2021. This academic-clinical partnership was created to promote the use of the best available evidence in healthcare decisions by healthcare professionals (clinicians and managers) and, consequently, to achieve the best outcomes for citizens; maximize resources and synergies; and allow the selection of topics for primary and secondary research. Results: Within this partnership, two webinars and one symposium were organized in 2021. Webinar 1 (\"Evidence-based Healthcare - JBI's Model\" and \"Academic-Clinic Partnership as a Pillar for Evidence Transfer\") had 78 participants. Webinar 2 (\"Evidence-based Healthcare Day: All for one - Evidence, Professional Experience, Patient and Context\") had 50 participants. The face-to-face symposium \"Evidence-Informed Healthcare: Better decisions, better results\" had more than 100 participants. Additionally, three oral communications (\"Evidence Implementation,\" \"Rapid Science,\" and \"Systematic Literature Review\") and one workshop (\"Meta-analysis Interpretation\") were provided at one symposium conducted by the clinical partner in 2022. Moreover, 12 implementation projects were conducted in collaboration with the clinical partner, of which 3 were already published in a scientific journal. Conclusions: This academic-clinical partnership helped increase the awareness of healthcare professionals about evidence-based healthcare, as can be confirmed by the improvement in the number of implementation projects in collaboration. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed to create new opportunities, especially concerning the selection of topics for primary and secondary research as well as for the development of implementation projects through an active collaboration between researchers and final consumers (healthcare professionals and patients). [Revolutionizing Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis with Innovative Software Solutions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473753/revolutionizing-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analysis-with-innovative-software-solutions) Background: The process of conducting a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis involves a meticulous and exhaustive evaluation of the most dependable evidence to address a specific inquiry. This process involves a series of pivotal steps, such as identifying pertinent studies, selecting suitable studies, collecting and evaluating data, assessing bias risk, combining outcomes, summarizing results, and formulating conclusions. Because of the vast number of studies involved, this process can be time consuming. However, researchers can now rely on different software solutions to expedite and simplify the process of conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, making them more efficient and productive. Objectives: This study aims to compare different software options that are accessible on the internet for the creation and management of systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses. Through an analysis of the distinctions and similarities among these tools, our objective is to offer a thorough assessment of their individual capabilities and features. Methods: Our search for software programs to facilitate the preparation and maintenance of systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses led us to explore various online resources, including Google and SR-related blogs. Results: Results The software PICO Portal, Crownd-Care, and DMetaR. Most of these tools are in English, free to use, and allow for the import and export of search results online. Some of them can also conduct quality assessments, extract data, and make final decisions regarding which studies to include or exclude. However, not all these tools provide a comprehensive guide for the meta-analysis process. Conclusions: There are software programs available online that can simplify and speed up the SR and meta-analysis process, but it is imperative for all reviewers to adhere to the necessary steps to perform a high-quality SR and meta-analysis. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Medical students. [Current status of the national clinical research program producing trusted evidence in Korea](/colloquium-2023/session/1473905/current-status-of-the-national-clinical-research-program-producing-trusted-evidence-in-korea) \"Patient-Centered Clinical Research Coordinating Center Program (PACEN)\" is the largest investigator-initiated research program funded by the Korean government for public interest. It supports practical research for comparative assessment or evidence-generation of health technologies used in healthcare systems, and it aims to usefully transfer the research results to practice, policy, or healthcare services. PACEN seeks to solve the matter health systems are facing and to improve the quality of health services with the perspectives of patient and the public through producing high-quality evidence. It carries out the following tasks to successfully achieve the program purpose as above. 1) Strengthen the patient-centerdness in research by identifying unmet needs of patients and the public and by reflecting them in priority settings, outcomes evaluation, and dissemination. 2) Involve and integrate healthcare stakeholders including patients, providers, policymakers, etc. 3) Support to generate real-world evidence and to transfer it to clinical and policy decision-making. 4) Establish a public database system that systematically manages, links, and recycles clinical research data. Through an 8-year (2019~2026) program, we expect to reach the following accomplishments. First, we obtain standardized real-world data of more than 160,000 cases through a clinical research management platform. Also, we facilitate the secondary use of the data, as well as the expansion of the database through supporting the integration of it with other data. Second, we support 380 evidence-generating studies to optimize patient outcomes with health, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life. Additionally, about 1,100 scientific papers and 100 clinical practice guidelines are expected to be published. Third, we process the research results and produce easy-to-understand health information so that the results can be effectively transferred to and used by the public. We support the public to make informed-clinical decisions and resolve their health problems. Lastly, we support clinical appraisals of research results where various stakeholders participated and generated their perspectives on the results, reaching a consensus. Therefore, we raise the availability and the acceptability of research results, effectively transfer research to policy, and, finally, contribute to the evidence-based healthcare system. [Competing events and in-hospital follow-up: issues to be aware of](/colloquium-2023/session/1473608/competing-events-and-in-hospital-follow-up-issues-to-be-aware-of) Background: In our review of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for severe respiratory viral infections, with 30 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), several outcomes were complicated by competing events and in-hospital follow-up. Survival: Only one trial (RECOVERY) of seven reporting a hazard ratio (HR) explicitly stated that individuals discharged before the end of 28-day follow-up were censored at the end of follow-up. A naive survival analysis would censor at discharge (in the absence of postdischarge follow-up), inappropriately removing survivors from the denominator at later timepoints. This outcome was meta-analysable as relative risk, which is adequate for short follow-up with very little loss to follow-up. Time to Mechanical Ventilation: Death is a competing event for mechanical ventilation (MV), usually accounted for by defining the event as 'MV or death.' Only one trial (RECOVERY) of the two which reported an HR described their approach to censoring those discharged before the end of follow-up. Some trials reported duration of MV without describing their methods, making results uninterpretable because patients are removed from MV because of either improvement or death. Some trials included individuals already on MV, further complicating this outcome. REMAP-CAP accounted for this using a Bayesian cumulative logistic model to analyse multiple states. This is a useful way to compare the two groups, but the resulting odds ratios (and medians) are hard to interpret. Length of Hospital Stay: Here, the competing event (death) is diametrically opposed to the event of interest and cannot be accounted for by combining events. RECOVERY was the only trial to state that people who died in hospital were censored at end of follow-up rather than on the date of death. Most trials reported median length of hospital stay without describing any methods, making their results uninterpretable. Conclusions: Reviewers need to be aware of the problem of competing events and in-hospital follow-up and avoid combining results obtained using different (and frequently unspecified) methods of analysis. There will often be insufficient data reported to reanalyse for meta-analysis. Core outcome sets give little or no guidance on analytical methods for trialists; parallel initiatives on core analytical methods would be useful. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Epistemonikos Database of Randomized Trials: methods and preliminary results of a comprehensive, living database of trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473881/epistemonikos-database-of-randomized-trials-methods-and-preliminary-results-of-a-comprehensive-living-database-of-trials) Background: Epistemonikos Database of Systematic Reviews (EDSR) is the largest database of systematic reviews in health. It combines a systematic approach, large-scale human collaboration, and multiple technologies. Considering the relevance of randomized trials for health decision-making, we are applying a similar methodology to develop a comprehensive, open database of trials. Objectives: To describe the methods used and the number of trials identified in the Epistemonikos Database of Randomized Trials (EDRT). Methods: To develop and maintain the database, we screen multiple electronic databases, trial registries, and preprint servers on a regular basis. Applying different technologies, including artificial intelligence and other machine-based approaches, we select potentially relevant trials, which are then validated by a network of collaborators. To complement the electronic searches, randomized trials identified in systematic reviews are indexed in EDRT. All records are deduplicated and studied by automated and manual methods. To test the comprehensiveness of the database, we will generate a sample based on the relative recall method, which uses a set of primary studies from published systematic reviews as a reference standard. The sample will be composed of all the systematic reviews identified in the EDSR with a publication date during May 2023. To assess performance, we will determine if the trials within the sample are in the database when systematic reviews were detected. Trials included in the database before detection will be defined as contained. Trials added after detection will be defined as not contained, because missing studies may have been added after the manual detection of the systematic review's list of studies, which is part of the EDSR search strategy. Results: Up to March 2023, we have captured more than 730,000 trials, which will be freely available in a single place in August 2023 through a simple and an advanced search interface. The updated results, including the estimated comprehensiveness of the database, will be presented during the Colloquium. Conclusions: EDRT intends to provide a comprehensive, reliable, free-access database of randomised trials relevant for health. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: none. [An exploration of knowledge translation in a wider audience by holding Cochrane evidence dissemination competitions via social media in China](/colloquium-2023/session/1473743/an-exploration-of-knowledge-translation-in-a-wider-audience-by-holding-cochrane-evidence-dissemination-competitions-via-social-media-in-china) Background: A lot of efforts have been made to translate Cochrane abstracts and plain language summaries (PLSs) in order to get the high-quality evidence available to a wider audience. However, failure of getting people with less or no expertise to understand the research itself is another barrier apart from language. We started to hold dissemination competitions in 2021. Objective: The aim of this work is to explore possibilities of making evidence more understandable and accessible to wider populations. Methods: We collaborated with translation and dissemination member teams within and outside China Cochrane Network to hold evidence-based medicine dissemination competitions in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 1), calling for submission to the public by any type of works presenting Cochrane review evidence. We invited tutors from each affiliate and member team to judge the submissions from aspects of understanding of methodology, information reliability, proper comment, popularized expression of science, as well as degree of interest and creativity. The submissions were posted via WeChat, the main social media in China, and the numbers of views, likes, and shares were also calculated as part of the final scores. Results: We received 73 and 61 individual or team submissions involving 119 and 237 competitors, respectively, in 2021 and 2022. The submissions were from affiliates, volunteers, university students, clinicians, and researchers. The submissions presented Cochrane review evidence (Table 1) covering a variety of review groups (Table 2) in the form of poster, cartoon, comics, video, mind map, hand-painting, song, lyrics, and poetry (Figure 2). Our WeChat account received 137,251 and 151,210 looks in 2021 and 2022, whereas 139,834 accumulated from 2017-2020, which showed a high possibility that the competition presenting Cochrane evidence in a more innovative way attracted more attention. Conclusions: The idea of holding competitions via social media encourages the efforts of understanding Cochrane evidence and ambition of expressing it with creativity. Considering the effects of attracting public interest, improving evidence accessibility as well as supporting evidence understanding, we will continue this competition in the future. [EBM on-line pilot course: from Brazil to El Salvador](/colloquium-2023/session/1473787/ebm-on-line-pilot-course-from-brazil-to-el-salvador) Background: The medical undergraduate course of the Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (Unifesp) has formally included evidence-based medicine (EBM) in its curriculum since 2000, which has made it recognized as a leading hub for EBM teaching and research in Brazil. However, the concepts and application of EBM do not yet seem to be fully consolidated in many Latin American medical schools, whether public or private. Objectives: To report the design and implementation of an on-line, short pilot course addressing concepts and practical issues on EBM, offered by Unifesp in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, for medical students in El Salvador. Methods: Case study conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Unifesp, Brazil Apoio \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de scholarship (Fapesp, number 2019/20691-4). Results: A free, short-duration, on-line course focused students from Universidad Dr Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado, Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n El Salvador. The 26-hour course lasted 7 weeks, consisting of (a) six asynchronous theoretical-practical classes addressing key concepts on EBM (12 hours, Portuguese audio with Spanish subtitles), (b) six synchronous tutorials in small groups for addressing students' questions (12 hours, conducted in Spanish), and (c) 2-hour final meeting for feedbacks. The tutors were 10 ex-students of the EBM league at Unifesp with Spanish communication skills or who were native Spanish speakers. Pre- and post-course tests and a satisfaction form were completed by the participants, and an analysis is underway to endorse the potential of this pilot course. All educational tools used were free: Google meeting, Jamboard, Google drive, and Google Classroom. Conclusions: This course appeared to be a feasible, acceptable, and sustainable strategy to introduce EBM concepts and practical applicability among medical students. EBM can operate as a link between students from different countries and languages. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: By introducing EBM to students who would not have this opportunity during their education, this initiative could contribute to the development of skills useful for their future career and in the performance of evidence-based clinical practice along the patient care. [Using existing systematic reviews to identify the evidence gaps for resilient health systems: a novel methodology](/colloquium-2023/session/1473829/using-existing-systematic-reviews-to-identify-the-evidence-gaps-for-resilient-health-systems-a-novel-methodology) Background: Identifying evidence gaps that need to be filled is a critical step in conducting research. This helps provide the scientific, ethical, and environmental justification for new research and minimizes research waste. As part of a project funded by the Pan American Health Organization to develop an open-access evidence collection of summaries of systematic reviews (SRs) relevant to the resilience of health systems in the context of health emergency and disaster risk management (Health EDRM), Evidence Aid developed a novel methodology to identify evidence gaps through the use of existing SRs. This presentation outlines this methodology and its application. Methods: SRs relevant to resilient health systems were identified in prioritized domains. Their implications for research were extracted, along with information about the review's search date, geographical restrictions, area of uncertainty (e.g., effects of interventions and size of the problem), and type of research needed. Each gap was classified as to whether it would need to be filled by higher-quality research (generally or for specific populations or settings) or additional SRs. To assess if the gap identified in a review had already been filled by more recent research, we conducted an updated search using the review's search strategy. We used colored visualizations to present the information. Results: Twenty-four SRs of relevance to resilient health systems were prioritized and included. These covered four domains: chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards; migrants; hospital preparedness; and noncommunicable diseases. Most of the reviews had search dates in 2015-2020 and included 10-29 studies. We identified 34 evidence gaps from the SR. We found 11 more recent studies that might contribute to filling the gaps, leaving 23 evidence topics that remain in need of research. Conclusions: Identification of evidence gaps is a critical step in research production, to better orient actions of researchers, funders, and evidence users. Our novel methodology identified evidence gaps in a given topic via the implications for research in SRs and updated searches. We show how the application of this methodology allows the identification of several critical gaps in the evidence for resilient health systems.

[INDEXING OF NIGERIAN BIOMEDICAL JOURNALS AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL](/colloquium-2023/session/1473889/indexing-of-nigerian-biomedical-journals-and-information-retrieval) Background: Journals are indexed to promote accessibility and visibility of research output. It is unclear the extent to which Nigerian Biomedical Journals are indexed online. This could limit the visibility of research that could contribute to the advancement of science locally and globally. In conducting systematic reviews and other forms of evidence synthesis, studies published in such journals may not be easily retrieved and could contribute to missed studies. In order to aid identification and visibility of research published in non-indexed journal, we sought to identify and document Nigerian Biomedical Journals and their indexing status on online Biomedical databases. Objectives: To document Nigerian Biomedical Journals and identify journals indexed online. Methods: We searched the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) Portal (a database of serials published globally), using the search term \"Nigeria\" in April 2022. Two authors independently screened the titles to identify biomedical journals. We extracted data from journals identified, including Publisher, indexing status on PubMed, African Journals Online (AJOL) or other online databases, Access (Free or Fee based), and medium. This research is ongoing, so, in addition to the above, we plan to send out a short survey to Nigerian health professionals to list Nigerian Biomedical Journals they are aware of. The survey will be disseminated via the networks of National Professional Medical Associations. We used simple descriptive statistics to report our findings. Results (preliminary findings): We identified a total of 657 Nigerian Biomedical Journals. Most were not indexed online (58.3%). Only 10% and 6.8% were indexed on PubMed and AJOL, respectively (see Table 1). Almost half of the journals were free to access. Conclusions: Very few Nigerian Journals are indexed on PubMed or AJOL. A greater number are indexed on other databases. In doing systematic reviews of diseases endemic to Nigeria or using regional data (prevalence reviews) it may be useful to search additional databases like Google scholar and consider handsearching. There is need to promote indexing of local journals in PubMed or AJOL to improve visibility. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We will engage the public to identify journals they know through a survey. [Peer reviewers' conflicts of interest in biomedical research: a scoping review of empirical studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473501/peer-reviewers'-conflicts-of-interest-in-biomedical-research-a-scoping-review-of-empirical-studies) Background: Peer review may improve the quality of submitted research manuscripts and assist in editorial decisions. Although researchers' and, to some degree, editors' conflicts of interest have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about peer reviewers' conflicts of interest. Objectives: To systematically map and describe the extent and nature of empirical research on peer reviewers' conflicts of interest in biomedical research. Methods: Scoping review based on preregistered protocol (https://osf.io/sg5wh). We searched MEDLINE, Embase and The Cochrane Methodology Register (up to May 9, 2022), and other sources. We included studies investigating peer reviewers' conflicts of interest in scientific manuscripts for biomedical journals, theses and dissertations, conference abstracts, funding applications, and clinical guidelines. Two authors independently included studies and extracted data on key study characteristics and results, and data were organised into emerging themes. We included studies explicitly aimed at investigating peer reviewers' conflicts of interest in our primary analysis. Studies not aimed at this investigation, but reporting relevant results (e.g., studies of retractions reporting number of retractions due to peer reviewers' conflicts of interest), were included in a sensitivity analysis. Results: We included 69 studies and included 38 of these in our primary analysis. Sixteen (42%) of the 38 studies investigated peer reviewers' conflicts of interest as their primary aim. These 38 studies were published between 2005 and 2021, and 27 (71%) investigated scientific manuscripts, 1 (3%) conference abstracts, 4 (11%) funding applications, and 6 (16%) clinical guidelines. Thirty-three (87%) studies were cross-sectional (14 of these used questionnaires), two (5%) qualitative interviews, and three (8%) mixed methods. Nineteen (50%) studies investigated both financial and non-financial interests, six (16%) solely financial interests, four (11%) solely non-financial interests, and nine (24%) did not report it. The results of the thematic analysis and sensitivity analysis will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: We identified a considerable number of studies on peer reviewers' conflicts of interest in biomedical research, primarily cross-sectional studies of peer review of scientific manuscripts. However, only a fourth of all identified studies investigated peer reviewers' conflicts of interest as their primary aim. Further conclusions await our thematic analysis. [Methodological and reporting quality of search strategies of systematic reviews evaluating the therapeutic use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues. Meta-epidemiological study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473800/methodological-and-reporting-quality-of-search-strategies-of-systematic-reviews-evaluating-the-therapeutic-use-of-cannabis-derivatives-and-their-synthetic-analogues.-meta-epidemiological-study) Background: An increasing number of systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted to map, synthesize, and critically evaluate clinical trials on the effects of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues for different health conditions. The process of searching for studies impacts the reliability of the SRs. It is important to understand how this process has been conducted to guide the planning of SRs and to support further strategies for continuous enhancement of methodological recommendations. Objectives: To assess the methodological and reporting quality of search strategies used by SRs to identify randomized clinical trials about therapeutical use of cannabis derivatives and their synthetic analogues. Methods: Meta-epidemiological study conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Unifesp, Brazil Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento e Tecnol\u00f3gico through an academic scholarship (CNPq, number 134763/2021-1). Two authors independently investigated the use of Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension (PRISMA-S) checklists by the SRs included and, additionally, the adequacy of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)-2 item related to search process (item 4). Results: We identified 86 SRs on the topic, published in MEDLINE from January 1, 2019, to September 21, 2021. None of them referred to the use of PRESS for constructing the searches, nor to the PRISMA-S checklist for reporting them. Regarding the AMSTAR-2 item 4, 89.53% (n=77) SRs searched on at least two relevant databases, 32.56% (n=28) used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms properly, and all respected a limit of 1 year between the search date and the SR publication, but only 1.1% (n=1) of SRs presented a justification for the use of filters and limits. Conclusions: PRESS and PRISMA-S checklists have been poorly adopted by SRs on the cannabis therapy field. Some of the components of AMSTAR-2 item 4 are not fully covered as well. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: By revealing the low adherence to methodological and reporting tools, this study alerts us to the risk of bias in the process of conducting and reporting the clinical effects of cannabinoids, which may limit the applicability of its conclusions or even mislead the body of evidence supporting decision-making. [Adherence to non-financial conflicts of interest policy in Cochrane reviews where authors are also editorial board members](/colloquium-2023/session/1473490/adherence-to-non-financial-conflicts-of-interest-policy-in-cochrane-reviews-where-authors-are-also-editorial-board-members) Background: Conflict of interest (COI) represents a major threat to the validity of research, and its impact is well recognized and has been extensively addressed in the literature [1,2]. The impact of nonfinancial conflict of interest (nfCOI) in conducting systematic reviews is not ignored by Cochrane, which has a strict policy, updated recently, and whose management process is a responsibility of Cochrane Review Group (CRG) editorial boards. An author's involvement in a supporting CRG editorial board represents an additional threat that must not be neglected, although this involvement is allowed by Cochrane policy [3]. Objectives: To assess adherence to Cochrane's editorial nfCOI policy when an author has a role on the editorial board of the hosting CRG. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis [4] conducted at the Evidence-Based Discipline, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Paulo a partnership with Oxford-Brazil EBM Alliance [5]. Results: All 260 published Cochrane reviews (CRs) in issues 1 to 6 from 2019 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were analysed. Overall, 133 (51.2%, 133/260) CRs had at least one author who was also listed as an editor in the CRG. Of these, 5 (3.8%, 5/133) appropriately declared the conflict according to Cochrane policies. In 6.5% (17/133) of CRs, the contact author had a leading editorial position within the CRG, and this was stated according to Cochrane policy in 4 of 17. No CR with the contact author who also had a leading editorial position detailed strategies to prevent any potential issues related to this issue during the editorial process in accordance with Cochrane policy. Conclusions: CRs demonstrate poor adherence to Cochrane's own policy on nfCOI when review authors also have an editorial role in the supporting CRG. Further updates of Cochrane's COI policy should address strategies to improve adherence alongside transparency of editorial processes. We proposed a specific nfCOI form to facilitate disclosure when authors are also editors (available in [4]). Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: It is important that Cochrane ensures the management and reporting of nfCOI to ensure credibility as a global leader in the production and dissemination of systematic reviews. [A scientific initiation underpinned in free Cochrane materials is feasible and effective in delivering high-quality training to undergraduates.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473383/a-scientific-initiation-underpinned-in-free-cochrane-materials-is-feasible-and-effective-in-delivering-high-quality-training-to-undergraduates.) Background: To encourage and support new incomers is one of Cochrane's priorities according to its strategic plan. The Cochrane Training website provides several learning opportunities, with emphasis on reading, preparing, conducting, and publishing systematic reviews. There are tools and online training guidance that might build capacity amongst healthcare professionals, and it is an excellent source of learning for undergraduates. Scientific Initiation (SI) is a program directed to undergraduates to connect them to study groups and lines of research. It intends to stimulate students to learn techniques and scientific methods, as well as to encourage scientific thinking and creativity. The Faculdade de Medicina de Petropolis (FMP/UNIFASE), a private university in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, does not have a curriculum in Evidence-Based Healthcare. However, there are initiatives to approximate students and high-quality research, such as Cochrane Brasil Rio de Janeiro (CBRJ) Affiliate Center, and a partnership with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine from the University of Oxford. Objectives: To describe the experience of a Cochrane-driven scientific initiation to undergraduates at FMP/UNIFASE. Methods: Descriptive case report study. Results: CBRJ conducts a 1-year program, with four positions available. The SI engages the students to become Cochrane members and to get into action in knowledge translation, research, organizational skills, and education. Some activities carried out are (a) training sessions in evidence-based principles using free materials from Cochrane Training website; (b) attendance in training workshops/webinars to build capacity as potential new review authors; (c) translation of Cochrane materials into Portuguese, contributing to the spreading of relevant evidence; (d) participation in CBRJ organizational tasks, promoting a sense of community, and involving them to the Cochrane structure; and (e) promotion of Cochrane evidence within other students and healthcare professionals locally. Some of the Cochrane resources used are Cochrane Evidence Essentials, Cochrane Journal Club, and \"Estudantes para Melhores Evid\u00eancias\" blog. Conclusions: A scientific initiation underpinned in free Cochrane materials is feasible and effective in delivering high-quality training to undergraduates. Patient or healthcare consumer involvement: We believe that offering a proper introduction to health evidence, and how to use it to make informed health choices, would improve patient outcomes in the future. [READ-It project: catalysing influential nutrition evidence synthesis and capacity building in LMICs](/colloquium-2023/session/1473857/read-it-project-catalysing-influential-nutrition-evidence-synthesis-and-capacity-building-in-lmics) Introduction The Research, Evidence and Development Initiative (READ-It), funded by UK aid through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (300342-104) provides core sustained financial support to South African institutions aimed at improving health outcomes in the poor and vulnerable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Nutrition focus and outputs One of READ-It's focus areas is nutrition, where key policy areas include the double burden of malnutrition, infant and young child nutrition and dietary strategies for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Here, we describe the nutrition outputs enabled by READ-It over a 5-year period. Priority-setting: Contributions to prioritisation for global nutrition guidelines, including producing four scoping reviews on priority topics, and partnering in the Cochrane obesity gap analysis. Reviews with impact: The production of 10 Cochrane and 3 non-Cochrane reviews, 5 of which have informed global guidelines on priority policy areas including school food environments, population-level sodium reduction and prevention of child wasting. Two reviews addressing dietary strategies for NCDs have achieved high attention scores (Altmetric 100 in 1 year). Responses to urgent evidence requests from global and national decision-makers have produced a rapid review, two rapid overviews and a rapid review of prognostic factors. Working with guideline developers: Sustained stakeholder engagement with decision-makers and provision of content and methods inputs, with topics covering childhood acute malnutrition, policies to protect children from harmful food marketing, fiscal policies to promote healthy diets, nutrition labelling for promoting healthy diets and nutrition, infant feeding in Zika virus transmission areas and childhood obesity. Building nutrition evidence synthesis leadership: Developed through 13 novice LMIC authors (9 women) 'learning by doing' in partner-country synthesis teams. We have extended methods expertise by learning qualitative and prognostic evidence synthesis production from experienced authors and participating in the Risk of Bias 2 pilot. Conclusions READ-It has boosted nutrition evidence synthesis by LMIC teams for the benefit of LMICs, enabling impact across multiple ecosystem elements including priority-setting; reliable synthesis; and influencing evidence-informed decision-making, both globally and regionally. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. [Teaching secondary school students to think critically about health information and choices: cluster-randomized trials in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473786/teaching-secondary-school-students-to-think-critically-about-health-information-and-choices-cluster-randomized-trials-in-kenya-rwanda-and-uganda.) Background: Many people find it difficult to make decisions about what to believe or do regarding their own and others' health. To avoid being misled by misinformation and to make good choices, people must be able to understand and apply some basic concepts. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) secondary school resources are designed to help students learn and use nine such concepts. Objectives: To estimate the effect of using the IHC secondary school resources on students' ability to think critically about health actions. Methods: We conducted three cluster-randomized trials in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Participants were lower secondary school students (age 14-16) and their teachers. Intervention: 2-3-day teacher training workshop, teachers' guide, and 10 40-minute lessons taught to the students during a single school term. Comparator: the standard curriculum in each country. The primary outcome was a passing score (9 of 18 questions correct) on the Critical Thinking about Health (CTH) Test, which assesses an individual's ability to understand and apply the nine concepts taught in the lessons. We performed random effects meta-analyses of the results of the three trials to estimate overall adjusted odds ratios for passing the test. Results: Altogether, 244 schools with over 11,000 students took part in the three trials. The overall adjusted odds ratio was 5.5 (95% CI: 3.0 to 10.2; p-value < 0.0001) in favour of the intervention. This corresponds to 33% (95% CI: 25 to 40) more intervention students passing the test. The intervention had a larger relative effect on teachers (overall adjusted odds ratio 13.7; 95% CI: 4.6 to 40.4; p-value similar absolute difference (32%; 95% CI: 6 to 57) because control teachers were more likely to understand the concepts. Conclusions: The results show that it is possible to teach secondary school students to think critically about health actions. Relevance to public: Teaching young people to think critically about health actions has the potential to protect them from unnecessary suffering, harm, and resource waste. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Using a human-centred design approach, teachers, students, and curriculum developers were continuously involved in developing the intervention. [Transparency of COVID-19-related research: A meta-research study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473701/transparency-of-covid-19-related-research-a-meta-research-study) Background: The lack of transparency in COVID-19 research has led the public to mistrust the results of research and public health measures. Objectives: To assess the adherence to five transparent practices (data availability, code availability, protocol registration and conflicts of interest [COI], and funding disclosures) from open-access COVID-19-related articles. Methods: We searched and exported all open access COVID-19-related articles from PubMed-indexed journals available in the Europe PubMed Central database published from January 2020 to June 9, 2022. We then detected transparent practices of three article types, namely, research articles, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and reviews, with a validated and automated tool. Basic journal- and article-related information were retrieved from the database. We used R for the analyses. Results: The total number of articles was 258,678, of which we were able to retrieve full texts of 186,157 (72%) articles from the database. More than half of the articles (55.7%) were research articles, 10.9% (n=20,229) were review articles, and less than 1% (n=1,202) were RCTs. Approximately nine-tenths of all three article types had a statement to disclose COI. Funding disclosure (83.9%) and protocol registration (53.5%) were more frequent in RCTs than in reviews or research articles. Reviews shared data (2.5%) and code (0.4%) less frequently than RCTs or research articles. Articles published in 2022 had the highest adherence to all five transparency practices. Most of the reviews (62%) and research articles (58%) adhered to two transparency practices, whereas almost half of the RCTs (47%) adhered to three practices. There were journal- and publisher-related differences in all five practices, and apart from COI disclosure, articles that adhered to transparency practices were published in journals with slightly higher median journal impact factor but received equal citations. Conclusions: Although most of the articles were freely available and had a COI disclosure, the adherence to other transparent practices was far from the acceptable level. A much stronger commitment to open science practices, particularly to protocol registration and data and code sharing, is needed from all stakeholders. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: NA. [Certainty of evidence from Cochrane Reviews on Neonatal Sepsis](/colloquium-2023/session/1473550/certainty-of-evidence-from-cochrane-reviews-on-neonatal-sepsis) Background: Neonatal sepsis is a modifiable risk factor for healthy growth and development during the neonatal period. More than one third of the estimated 4 million neonatal deaths around the world each year are caused by severe infections, and a quarter\u2014approximately 1 million deaths\u2014are due to neonatal sepsis/pneumonia alone. Neonatal infections and prematurity are currently the most challenging areas of research. Cochrane reviews provide the highest level of evidence on neonatal sepsis. Grading the quality of evidence in Cochrane reviews is applied to assess a wide range of interventions and contexts and is important to understand the impact evidence can generate. Objectives: To assess the quality of evidence of Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) on neonatal sepsis. Methods: We searched the Cochrane library for SRs related to neonatal sepsis during a 2-year period (year 2020-2022) using the search term \"neonatal sepsis.\" We reviewed the certainty of evidence in these reviews. Results: We retrieved five SRs in total. These SRs included three to five trials each, and the number of subjects included in the trials ranged from 482 to 1,103 in these reviews. The certainty of evidence was assessed to be of low to moderate quality (one SR), very low quality of evidence (three SRs), very low to moderate, and very low for all main outcomes (one SR). The reasons quoted for the low quality of evidence were small trial size (five SRs), methodological weaknesses (two SRs), high risk of bias (two SRs), imprecise results (one SR), low incidence of outcomes, and data not available for all outcomes (one SR). Evidence was downgraded by two to three levels in the five reviews. Conclusions: Quality of evidence was assessed to be of low to very low quality in the Cochrane reviews on neonatal sepsis in the years 2020-2022. There is a need to initiate better-quality trials with adequate sample size (optimal information size). Certainty of evidence emanating from Cochrane reviews is important for guideline development and can affect clinical practice once included in guidelines. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Good-quality evidence can directly impact clinical practice and improve treatment options for neonates in developing countries. [Methodological quality of systematic reviews on Alzheimer's disease treatments](/colloquium-2023/session/1473420/methodological-quality-of-systematic-reviews-on-alzheimer's-disease-treatments) Background: Carefully conducted systematic reviews can provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the reliability of systematic review results can be limited by methodological flaws. This study aims to appraise methodological quality of systematic reviews on Alzheimer's disease treatments and explore factors associated with the quality. Objectives: Methods: Four international databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched for systematic reviews on Alzheimer's disease treatments. The methodological quality of included studies was appraised using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 instrument. Factors associated with methodological quality were investigated using multivariate regression analyses. Results: A total of 102 systematic reviews are appraised. Four (3.90%) systematic reviews are considered as high quality, and fourteen (13.7%), forty-eight (47.1%), thirty-six (35.3%) are of moderate, low, and critically low quality, respectively. Key methodological limitations are as follows: only 22.5% of systematic reviews registered protocols a priori, 6.9% explained rationales of selected study designs, 21.6% provided a list of excluded studies with justifications, and 23.5% reported funding sources of primary studies. Cochrane reviews (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 31.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.81-266.9) (AOR: CI: 1.27-12.3) are associated overall methodological quality of systematic reviews. Conclusions: Methodological quality of systematic reviews on Alzheimer's disease treatments is unsatisfactory, especially among non-Cochrane reviews and systematic reviews of nonpharmacological interventions. Improvement in the following methodological domains requires particular attention due to poor performance: registering protocols a priori, justifying study design selection, providing a list of excluded studies, and reporting funding sources of primary studies.

[Evidence summaries to champion evidence-based humanitarian action and building resilient health systems](/colloquium-2023/session/1473823/evidence-summaries-to-champion-evidence-based-humanitarian-action-and-building-resilient-health-systems) Background: Disasters and other health emergencies are increasingly common and destructive, and health systems need to be resilient to these shocks. Those involved in health emergency and disaster risk management (Health EDRM), including policymakers, practitioners and civil society, have a critical role to play. They need to access and understand research evidence so that they can use it to bring benefits and reduce harm. Global evidence synthesised in systematic reviews (SRs) can provide this evidence and inform decisions. Evidence Aid (EA) is an international organization that champions evidence-based humanitarian action and is seeking to meet this need by preparing evidence summaries based on SRs. We will describe our work to develop a collection of resilient health systems (RHSs) evidence summaries, along with lessons identified for how these resources can support decision-making. Methods: Since 2021, EA has built on its partnership with the Pan American Health Organization to identify and summarise SRs relevant to RHSs. We extracted key information about the review (citation details, funding, search date, eligibility criteria and countries in which included studies were conducted), with the findings and implications of the review and which aspects of equity it considered. This is presented in plain language summaries, which are freely available online in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, some of them also available in Arabic, Chinese, German, Italian and Japanese. Results: As of March 2023, the RHS collection contains 200+ evidence summaries that contribute to building a stronger and more resilient health system. These sit alongside 600+ summaries produced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 150 summaries relevant to refugees and asylum seekers, 100 summaries of reviews on the physical and mental effects of disasters and 110 summaries on preventing and treating acute malnutrition. Conclusions: EA's 1,000+ evidence summaries help bridge the gap between evidence producers and users involved in health system decision-making and Health EDRM. They provide a unique gateway into the evidence base for policymakers, practitioners and the public, helping to ensure that disaster preparedness, response, recovery and rehabilitation are effective and efficient.

[Bias adjustment in meta-analysis using expert opinions](/colloquium-2023/session/1473748/bias-adjustment-in-meta-analysis-using-expert-opinions) Background: Several methods exist for bias adjustment of meta-analysis results, but there has so far been no comprehensive comparison against various nonadjusted methods. Objectives: In this article, we compare six bias adjustment methods against two nonadjusted methods to examine how these different bias adjustment methods perform. Methods: We reanalysed a meta-analysis that included 10 methods\u2014i) Welton's data-based approach four opinion-informed methods\u2014iii) opinion-based approach (OB), iv) opinion-based distributions combined statistically with data-based distributions (O+DB), v) numerical opinions informed by data-based distributions (OID (num)), and vi) opinions obtained by selecting areas from data-based distributions (OID (select))\u2014were used to incorporate methodological quality information into the meta-analytical estimates. The results of these six methods were compared against two unadjusted models, the DerSimonian-Laird random effects (RE) model and Doi's inverse variance heterogeneity (IVhet) model. Results: When the RE model was viewed as the unadjusted baseline, no bias adjustment occurred for the three opinion-based methods. The DB and QE methods adjusted towards the null. When the IVhet model was used as the unadjusted baseline, there was some bias adjustment away from the null, except for the opinion-based methods, which demonstrated an apparent bias adjustment due to conformity with the random effects model. Data- versus opinion-driven methods agreed differently with different unadjusted models. Data-based methods agreed with the IVhet model with minimal adjustment. Opinion-based methods followed the random effects results. Conclusions: The difference between data- and opinion-based methods can be attributed to the robustness of data-based methods to small study effects. Relevance and importance to patients: This is a contribution to methods that will result in more robust evidence production. This research is important for clinicians and their patients who require trustworthy meta-analyses in their decision-making. There are several methods to 'adjust' the results of meta-analysis based on potential for bias in the results of included studies. Not all methods produce the same results, and this research suggests that methods that rely on expert opinion may not be adequately adjusted. [Comparison of the methodological quality of RCTs using RoB-2 and JBI tools: performing of medical students](/colloquium-2023/session/1473897/comparison-of-the-methodological-quality-of-rcts-using-rob-2-and-jbi-tools-performing-of-medical-students) Background: The risk of bias assessment is an essential step during the development of systematic reviews, which have an important role in the decision-making process and the translation of evidence into practice. Among the instruments to assess the methodological quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the Cochrane's Risk-of-Bias-2 (RoB2) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. However, the performance of undergraduate medical students using those two instruments is unknown, so it is necessary to determine whether there are differences in the overall assessment depending on the instrument used and the students' perception during their use. Objectives: To compare the methodological quality of RCTs on treatments for advanced head and neck cancer using the RoB-2 and JBI tools by medical students. Methods: An electronic search was carried out in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), LILACS, Cochrane registry (Library of Cochrane), and gray literature to identify RCTs assessing the effectiveness of any treatment for advanced head and neck cancer. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated independently by a group of 5th-year medical students using RoB-2 and JBI tools. Data on general characteristics of the studies, participants, and characteristics of interventions were extracted by duplication. Likewise, students' perceptions of the use of both tools were collected. A descriptive analysis was conducted. Results: The literature search yielded 1147 records, of which only 34 RCTs met the eligibility criteria, which were published between 2015 and 2021. Using RoB-2, 13 studies were rated as \"high\", 11 studies were rated as \"some concerns\", and 10 were rated as \"low\" risk of bias, whereas, using JBI, the mean score was 9.4, ranging from 7 to 13. There were differences in terms of the overall methodological quality of RCTs performed by medical students. Conclusions: Both instruments performed quite differently on the overall methodological quality of RCTs on therapeutic interventions for advanced head and neck cancers. Overall, using the RoB-2 tool, a greater number of studies were classified as \"high risk\" of bias. However, most medical students considered the JBI tool as more user-friendly during its application.

This reflects a view of evidence as something that can be achieved in its 'pure state' once all sources of bias have been removed, including the perspective of the researcher. One way of safeguarding research from researchers' personal biases is to require conflict-of-interest statements and to exclude authors who have unacceptable conflicts. Within qualitative research traditions, however, the influence of the researcher is seen as unavoidable. Evidence is seen as a co-production between researchers and their informants. Research findings are therefore inextricably linked with the perspectives of the researcher. Here, there is less focus on conflicts of interest. Instead, qualitative researchers are encouraged to consider how they and their research have interacted with and influenced each other, a concept referred to as 'researcher reflexivity'. Cochrane's conflict of interest declarations have traditionally focused on financial interests. Recently, Cochrane has also required authors to declare non-financial interests, including professional or ideological interests. Unlike financial conflicts, these interests do not prevent participation in reviews. However, Cochrane encourages authors to think critically about how these perspectives and experiences have shaped their development of the review. Although this may be useful, Cochrane offers little guidance about how this exercise should be performed. Here, qualitative research traditions of reflexivity may be helpful. Objectives To explore the concept of reflexivity in the context of Cochrane reviews and offer practical guidance about how review authors can practice reflexivity. Results We will discuss the concept of reflexivity and our experiences with reflexivity in Cochrane reviews. We will offer practical advice regarding how review authors can practice reflexivity, including questions that may help facilitate this process as part of their declarations of interest and throughout the review. Finally, we will discuss how this process can be reported in the review. Relevance to patients Reflexive processes may help review authors better understand their research choices and lead to more robust evidence for patients and other stakeholders. [Checklist for the application of the consensus approach in the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473567/checklist-for-the-application-of-the-consensus-approach-in-the-development-of-evidence-based-clinical-practice-guidelines) Background: Standardized scientific research methods are necessary for reliable results, and consensus methods integrate the opinions of interest groups to make better decisions, though there is no complete consensus on the specifics of its application in guideline development. Objectives: A comprehensive proposed checklist of recommendations for the effective and prudent application of consensus methods in guideline development. Methods: A nominal group of guideline development experts, methodologists, and standards development experts were convened to discuss and evaluate the items of the checklist after two meetings. Two researchers initially selected items to extract and integrate key information from the literature on the application of the consensus method; they then invited a third researcher to evaluate and improve the items. Results: During the first phase of the meeting, 23 suggestions were proposed and discussed. In the second round of voting, consensus was reached on most items, with adjustments made on whether they were required or supplementary. The final checklist summarizes three areas\u2014building a group, design, and implementation\u2014with a total of 11 topics, 64 essential items, and 28 supplementary items. Conclusions: This checklist is intended to help guideline developers plan the consensus process to ensure no important steps are missed. It is hoped that more experts will be organized to demonstrate and improve this list of suggestions in the future to improve its rigor and normativeness. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The checklist emphasizes the significance of involving patients and the public in consensus discussions about guidelines recommendation. [An unusual diagnostic test accuracy review: challenges in study identification, data extraction and quality assessment](/colloquium-2023/session/1473781/an-unusual-diagnostic-test-accuracy-review-challenges-in-study-identification-data-extraction-and-quality-assessment) Background: This was a joint project of Cochrane Response and Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. The aim of the review was to determine the accuracy of simple measures of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence for detecting non-suppressed viral load in people with HIV that could be utilized in resource-limited settings. Included studies measured adherence to ART in different ways and compared the level of adherence to viral non-suppression. Objectives: To describe the methodological challenges of conducting a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic review with studies that were not designed to evaluate DTA. Methods: The index tests were any measures of ART adherence that could be utilized in resourcelimited settings (self-report, tablet counts, pharmacy records or electronic monitoring). The reference standard was a non-suppressed viral load, as detected using nucleic acid testing technologies. We extracted the 2\u00d72 data using pre-piloted extraction forms. We assessed the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool, which was tailored to fit the review question. Results: We included 51 studies. Most studies were not set out to assess the measure of adherence as a diagnostic test but used other study designs also reporting on antiretroviral adherence. By agreeing on a set of \"rules\" on how to apply QUADAS-2, we were able to achieve consistency between reviewers. We encountered high variability for all index tests, and the overall certainty of evidence was very low. No measure offered either a sufficiently high sensitivity or specificity to detect viral nonsuppression. Conclusions: Identifying studies, data extraction and quality assessment were challenging because the studies we included were not designed as diagnostic accuracy studies. However, we successfully managed to include these studies by tailoring the data extraction form and the QUADAS-2 signaling questions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: There was no direct patient involvement in this review. However, the results of this review are very relevant for people with HIV living in resource-limited settings where viral load testing is not universally available or not feasible. The interim results of this review informed the new World Health Organization (WHO) HIV guideline. [Reporting of systematic reviews that synthesize studies of prevalence: Assessment of 1150 reviews using the PRISMA 2009 guideline](/colloquium-2023/session/1473845/reporting-of-systematic-reviews-that-synthesize-studies-of-prevalence-assessment-of-1150-reviews-using-the-prisma-2009-guideline) Background: Systematic reviews that synthesize data about the prevalence of conditions or risk factors form an important part of the evidence base for many research questions. The number of systematic reviews of prevalence has increased substantially. However, several studies have shown diverse methods for conducting these reviews and the way in which they are reported. Objectives: To assess the quality of reporting of systematic reviews of studies of prevalence in adult populations. Methods: We searched for systematic reviews of prevalence from January 2010 to September 2020. We used the PRISMA 2009 checklist and assigned one point for each completed item. The standard 2009 checklist was designed initially for systematic reviews of interventions, and because some items were written explicitly for these reviews, we modified the scoring system. The maximum score was 26 points. We report the highest and lowest compliance items and the median (with interquartile range, IQR) score over time. Results: We included 1,150 systematic reviews. The median PRISMA score was 20 points IQR (17-23); the median score in 2010 was 16 IQR (11-19) and 23 (19-25) in 2020. The items with highest compliance were related to the title, abstract, rationale and objectives, and the discussion. Items with poor compliance were mainly in the methods and results sections. For example, in the methods section, only 24% of reviews reported having published a protocol (item 5), at least one search strategy (item 5) was reported only by 48%, and 64% of authors reported the use of a risk of bias; however, only 54% of authors presented in the results section information on the risk of bias of each study in Figure 1. Conclusions: Overall, the reporting of systematic reviews of prevalence has improved between 2010 and 2020. But the reporting of important methodological items did not improve. Specific guidance for reporting might be needed for systematic reviews of prevalence. In addition, further development of methodological guidance for the conduct of systematic reviews of prevalence could improve the quality of the evidence synthesis about prevalence. [Defining misinformation and related terms: a scoping review of the health-related literature](/colloquium-2023/session/1473883/defining-misinformation-and-related-terms-a-scoping-review-of-the-health-related-literature) Background: Misinformation poses a serious challenge to clinical and policy decision-making in the health field, which relies on accurate and reliable information. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified interest in misinformation and related terms and witnessed a proliferation of definitions. Objectives: We aim to assess definitions of misinformation and related terms used in health-related literature. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews that addressed misinformation in the field of health and reported on at least one definition for misinformation or related terms. We searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos databases for reviews published within the last 5 years. We identified definition concepts and analyzed their use across misinformation-related terms. Results: We included 25 eligible systematic reviews, which contained 48 definitions for misinformation and related terms (13 for misinformation, 12 for disinformation, 15 for infodemic, 7 for fake news, and 1 for malinformation). Out of all the definitions, 34 (71%) were referenced from other sources. We mapped the different terms against the concepts of inaccuracy, intentionality, and being misleading. The definitions were largely consistent, but we did not identify any guidance on operationalizing the concepts addressed in those definitions. Conclusions: This scoping review of the health literature identified several definitions for misinformation and related terms that were largely consistent but not operationalized. Additional research is needed to operationalize the definitions of misinformation and related terms. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients or members of the public were involved in the current scoping review. [Coming soon: A taxonomy has been developing for core outcomes in pediatric clinical trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473795/coming-soon-a-taxonomy-has-been-developing-for-core-outcomes-in-pediatric-clinical-trials) Background: A standard taxonomy can help improve the standardization of databases or registry platforms, which can facilitate knowledge discovery and improve efficiency, reduce study waste, and increase the association of findings. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative has developed a taxonomy for outcomes in medical research, but we found some limitations in it, such as the inability to categorize child growth and development, neonatal, and caregiver-related outcomes. Objectives: We aim to develop a taxonomy of core outcomes applicable to child health. Methods: Using systematic review to collate the core outcomes proposed by published pediatric core outcome set (COS) studies, based on which initial draft of the outcome's taxonomy was applicable to children, will be formed using k-means clustering. Secondly, based on the clustering results, items of the taxonomy will be merged, deleted, or modified using the focus group discussion, and each item will be given a clear definition. Third, we will use a two-round Delphi survey with a consensus discussion to determine the final version of taxonomy. Participants assigned importance ratings for each item using a 1-9 scale. Consensus that an item should be included in the set of minimum standards was defined as at least 70% of the voting participants from each stakeholder group providing a score between 7 and 9. Finally, the newly developed taxonomy will be used to classify the pediatric core outcomes, and inter-rater reliability and content validity were calculated. Results: A total of 906 pediatric core outcomes was collated. Forty-three categories were initially obtained by k-means clustering. A focus group discussion is in progress. Conclusions: Implementation of this standard, pediatric-applicable taxonomy in clinical trials and systematic review databases and registry platforms will further facilitate effective searching, reporting, and classification of pediatric trial results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [How is Evidence Used in Pathology? Using Evidence Gap Maps to shine a light on existing practice and research needs.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473879/how-is-evidence-used-in-pathology-using-evidence-gap-maps-to-shine-a-light-on-existing-practice-and-research-needs.) Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours (WCT), published as the WHO Blue Books and the Blue Books online, is the 'gold standard' used by pathologists, clinicians and researchers for cancer diagnosis, research, treatment and prognosis. It encompasses scientific consensus of global experts to define all tumour types and their characteristics, acknowledging the multidimensional nature of cancer including histopathology but also newer insights from molecular biology, genetics or radiology, among others. Decision-making in pathology has historically been consensus based. The hierarchy of evidence that applies to questions of clinical effectiveness is less relevant in pathology. This project signifies a major shift to moving the practice of pathology from consensus-based to evidence-based practice. Objectives: The WCT EVI MAP project (funded by the European Commission) is using Evidence Gap Map (EGM) methodology to systematically map the evidence landscape relevant to tumour classification and diagnosis, identifying pockets of low-level evidence or research gaps. This information will be publicly available through a living web tool allowing the WCT authors, pathologists, cancer researchers and stakeholders to readily access the existing evidence. Methods: An EGM will be produced for all tumours by organ or place. The EGM framework has been defined in a stepwise process: first, we have undertaken a Delphi study to define a hierarchy of evidence for pathology; second, an advisory board comprising key stakeholders has defined the EGM framework; and third, the resulting framework has been piloted and modified accordingly. The EGMs will become available through a Mega map public tool. Rigorous and transparent methods have been used to locate and include evidence. Conclusions: The WCT EVI MAP project will improve the quality of evidence available by making visible and transparent all the existing evidence used for classifying and defining tumours. A completed map, for lung tumours, will demonstrate the potential value of the EGMs. Once gaps and pockets of low-quality evidence are identified, research agencies play a crucial role in tailoring research to fill those gaps and strengthening the evidence base of cancer decision-making in pathology. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: In protocol design and framework development. [Updating Searches for Evidence Synthesis: The good, the bad and the ugly](/colloquium-2023/session/1473708/updating-searches-for-evidence-synthesis-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly) Background: As the health research landscape changes and evolves, specifically the proliferation of evidence syntheses, the tools and skills needed by this research community also continue to evolve. Librarians and information professionals who support the knowledge synthesis research output require specialized skills and praxis in order to engage in methodologically sound reviews. One specific skill is that of updating complex searches in support of evidence syntheses. Decisions about whether and when to update a review are judgments made for individual reviews at a particular time. These decisions can be made by a variety of entities, including agencies responsible for review collections, journal editors with review update services, and author teams embarking on an update of a review. Objectives: The variety of methods employed to update structured searches for evidence syntheses vary and include using date fields in databases, querying results using unique object identifiers (UIDs), and relying on data extraction tools like Covidence. This inquiry will map the ways librarians and information professionals in the health sciences who support evidence syntheses update searches in order to ensure reproducibility and transparency. An analysis of how to validate such methods and the philosophical implications of doing so will also be discussed. Methods: A survey of health sciences librarians and information professionals was conducted in order to ascertain the most highly utilized and trusted method for updating searches. The survey included a list of known methods as well as space for librarians to state novel methods. Results: The methods commonly utilized are wide-ranging and include restricting records to those entered into a database on or after the date a search was last run. Other methods included using unique identifiers of papers retrieved, merging records in tools like EndNote, and deduplicating records found in the initial search as well as utilizing the Application Programming Interface (API) of certain databases to ensure search update accuracy. Conclusions: A formal guideline for when and how to update searches should be implemented and endorsed by organisations like the Cochrane Collaboration. [Methodological challenges regarding climate change and health in evidence-based medicine- Presentation of discussions from the german congress for EbM 2023](/colloquium-2023/session/1473792/methodological-challenges-regarding-climate-change-and-health-in-evidence-based-medicine-presentation-of-discussions-from-the-german-congress-for-ebm-2023) Background: In an editorial from March 2022, a group of Cochrane authors pointed out the crucial role of Cochrane when it comes to synthesizing evidence regarding climate change and health as a key topic for future work (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.ED000156). In this publication, the authors identify numerous challenges (e.g., a high load of search results, inclusion and appraisal of non-randomised controlled trials such as Public Health interventions and modelling studies) that result in a call for the Cochrane community to broaden its horizon method wise. In 2022, a working group called \"Climate change and health\" formed within the German network of evidence synthesis to prospectively identify those challenges and start developing solutions or ways to address them. Objectives: The objective of this presentation is to underline the importance of possible arising methodological challenges and particularly to communicate and discuss the results of a workshop held by members of the working group in March 2023 at the annual conference of the German Network for Evidence-based Medicine. The aim would be to create an international knowledge transfer in both directions and to initiate further exchange to face methodological challenges together. Methods: The workshop, named 'Fish-bowl discussion on perspectives of the Working Group Climate Change and Health', consists of an introduction into the topic and three statements that will be discussed in an interactive format, where the audience becomes part of the panel. The topics of the statements will cover transdisciplinary collaboration, handling of modelling studies and difficulties in knowledge translation, all relating to the methods of evidence-based medicine and climate health. An anonymised protocol about the discussion will result from the workshop. Expected Results: We hope to gather insightful information and possible directions for future work towards a high-quality evidence synthesis with up-to-date methodological perspectives that result in recommendations to inform health policymakers and to share these insights in an international context. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The working group will work on a public statement presenting the results of discussions after the workshop. [Application of QUADAS-C and GRADE in a Cochrane DTA Review: Comparison of lipoarabinomannan assays for tuberculosis in adults living with HIV](/colloquium-2023/session/1635100/application-of-quadas-c-and-grade-in-a-cochrane-dta-review-comparison-of-lipoarabinomannan-assays-for-tuberculosis-in-adults-living-with-hiv) Background: The WHO recommends the urine lipoarabinomannan assay Determine TB LAM Ag (Determine-LAM) to help diagnose tuberculosis in people living with HIV. A new assay, SILVAMP TB LAM (SILVAMP-LAM)*, may serve as a replacement test for Determine-LAM. Two recently developed methods allow assessing certainty of evidence in comparative accuracy reviews: QUADAS-C and GRADE for comparative accuracy. Objectives: To compare the accuracy of Determine-LAM and SILVAMP-LAM for diagnosing tuberculosis in adults living with HIV. Methods: We searched 10 databases and registries in June 2021. We included studies comparing Determine-LAM and SILVAMP-LAM in adults living with HIV. We used two reference standards: microbiological (culture, nucleic acid amplification test, or both on any specimen type) and composite (microbiological or other tests or clinical assessment). We independently assessed study quality using QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C. We estimated summary sensitivity, summary specificity, and their absolute differences using a Bayesian bivariate model. Using GRADE, we assessed certainty that the true difference in accuracy lies within the range of the 95% credible interval (CrI). Results: We included five comparative accuracy studies. Using QUADAS-C, risk of bias was high in two. We present comparative accuracy estimates based on the microbiological reference standard; those based on the composite reference standard were similar. Based on four fully paired studies in inpatient settings (1021 participants, 619 cases), difference in summary sensitivity between SILVAMP-LAM and Determine-LAM was 26.5% (CrI 5.1% to 44.9%; moderate certainty) and difference in summary specificity was -4.4% (CrI -14.2% to 5.3%; moderate certainty). Based on three fully paired studies in outpatient settings (627 participants, 124 cases), difference in summary sensitivity and difference in summary specificity were 42.9% (CrI 11.4% to 66.5%; low certainty) and -4.8% (CrI -16.1% to 2.6%; low certainty). Conclusions: In adults with HIV in inpatient settings, SILVAMP-LAM likely has higher sensitivity than Determine-LAM and specificity that likely ranges from lower to similar to that of Determine-LAM. In outpatient settings, SILVAMP-LAM may have higher sensitivity than Determine-LAM and specificity that may range from lower to similar to that of Determine-LAM. Results of an updated search will be presented at the meeting. Patient involvement: none. *Not commercially available. |12:30 PM - 2:00 PM| Background: Storyboarding in research can be dynamic way to engage in the research process as well as a form of data collection. Storyboarding can be engaged to express a story for both participants and researchers to engage in and create an opportunity between various stakeholders (co-creators) in the research process to form a 'shared language' (Knowles & Cole, 2008). As a methodology, storytelling is a well-recognised qualitative research method. Storytelling in research design creates an opportunity to bring to the fore various nuances not accessible using other design methods and can assist in expanding design perspectives (Liu et al., 2012). Objectives: Using storyboarding and storytelling, this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) aimed to explore adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) for young people living with perinatal infections of HIV in a deep and nuanced way. Methods: We searched up to November 2021 and followed the Cochrane guidelines for QES. We analysed and interpreted the findings innovatively by following nine steps of synthesis by storyboarding, a technique we experimented with in this QES. These steps included the following: 1. Adopt a perspective to analyse and interpret findings; 2. Familiarisation with the included studies through diffractive reading; 3. Identify and extract codes, quotes, and material markers; 4. Create images of meaning; 5. Place and connect images of meaning onto storyboard; 6. Interpret the storylines emerging from the storyboard; 7. Revise, redefine, and redraw storyboard with new insights; 8. Storytelling, i.e., provide a narrative first-person account of the storyboard; and 9. Researchers reflexivity. Results: We included 47 studies and identified nine storylines. We found that treatment adherence has less to do with humans' preferences, motivations, needs, and dispositions and more to do with how bodies, viruses, things, ideas, institutions, environments, social processes, and social structures assemble. Using storyboarding, we were able to move deeper into the analysis of the integrated story of adherence to ART. Conclusions: Future research into rethinking the linear and casual inferences that we are accustomed to in evidence-based health care is needed if we are to adopt multidisciplinary approaches to address pressing issues such as adherence to ART. [Methodological approaches for developing and reporting Living Evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1738601/methodological-approaches-for-developing-and-reporting-living-evidence-synthesis) Background: Living evidence (LE) approach permits new research findings to be continually incorporated into evidence synthesis. Methods for this type of synthesis are not completely defined. The approaches currently used by the authors are unknown. Objectives: To identify, evaluate and summarize the current methods used by authors for conducting and reporting living evidence synthesis. Methods: We conducted a methodological study based on a systematic literature search to identify any type of evidence synthesis such as systematic reviews, network meta-analyses and overviews that used the \"living evidence\" approach. A highly sensitive search was run in Medline and Epistemonikos databases. Hand searching was done aimed to identify unpublished update reports included in the organization's websites and repositories among others. Two reviewers independently assessed each article against the selection criteria and extracted data on methods and procedures from the baseline report and subsequent updates. Data was analyzed descriptively. Results: Searches up to August 31st, 2021, retrieved 1,692 records. We assessed 246 articles in full text, 195 met the criteria of being a living evidence synthesis (LES), corresponding to a total of 89 studies. Out of them 54 reporting only the baseline synthesis and 35 reporting the baseline and at least one update. Methods used by authors for searching, screening, monitoring, and integrating new evidence during the living mode are summarized descriptively in tables. LES authors used different ways to communicate their updates. We present the sources and publication characteristics of updated reports not identified by electronic searches. Conclusions: There is a significant number of authors who did not report most of the main methodological characteristics for the \"Living Evidence\" approach, which suggest a low compliance with current methodological standards. Therefore, more guidance and standardization are needed to ensure they are conducted using rigorous methods, which will serve to improve the report of living evidence synthesis. [Use of GRADE in Dentistry Systematic Reviews: A Methodological Study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473815/use-of-grade-in-dentistry-systematic-reviews-a-methodological-study) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize evidence from all available studies. Trustworthy SRs should assess the certainty of the evidence through approaches, such as the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). However, uptake of GRADE in dentistry is limited. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency of GRADE use in dentistry SRs and the relationship between GRADE use and SR methodological quality. Among SRs that use GRADE, to evaluate whether GRADE is used appropriately and the frequency of the levels of certainty according to GRADE. Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE for dentistry SRs of randomized controlled trials published between January 1, 2016, and September 23, 2021. Pairs of reviewers independently conducted screening and data extraction. We determined the frequency of GRADE use, determined the frequency of the levels of certainty for the main outcome, and assessed whether GRADE was used appropriately using pre-specified criteria. We assessed whether SRs using GRADE are more likely to have better methodological quality according to two aspects of the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS). Results: We included 200 SRs as per our target sample size. Thirty-six percent of these used GRADE and of those, 51% and 30% used GRADE appropriately at the review and outcome level, respectively. Among SRs using GRADE, most reported low (34%) or moderate (31%) certainty evidence with few high certainty ratings (7%). SRs using GRADE may be more likely to search for grey literature (OR = 3.03; 95% CI [1.66-5.53]) and minimize errors in both screening and data extraction (OR = 2.81; 95% CI [1.36-5.81]) compared with those not using GRADE. Conclusions: Most SRs in our sample did not use GRADE, and many of those using GRADE did not use it appropriately. Using GRADE may be associated with higher methodological quality. SR authors and consumers should be aware of these limitations when interpreting SR conclusions. Improving the quality and trustworthiness of future SRs impacts patients as SRs are considered to be at the top of the hierarchy of evidence-based medical research. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients were not involved. [At the beginning of a public health emergency what's the utility of a conducting a systematic review?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473722/at-the-beginning-of-a-public-health-emergency-what's-the-utility-of-a-conducting-a-systematic-review) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) and other research syntheses have established roles in evidence-based decision making, but a public health emergency presents a unique situation that is not necessarily well suited to SRs. To examine the added value of new SRs in the early stages of an emergency, we will use the recent 2022 mpox (formerly monkey pox) public health emergency of international concern as a case study. The mpox outbreak was identified in May 2022 and affected at least 110 countries globally during 2022. Historically, mpox has been contained in endemic areas of Africa, with sporadic short-lived events occurring in non-endemic countries, and was not an infectious disease with a very large evidence base prior to the outbreak. Objectives: The objective of this work is to evaluate and discuss the utility of conducting SRs at the beginning of a public health emergency when 1) there are SRs available and 2) new data is not available to incorporate. Methods: Based on mpox response work, SRs published before and in the first 6 months of the outbreak were evaluated for quality and coverage of the knowledge base. Results: This presentation will discuss what SRs were available on mpox prior to May 2022, their coverage of the evidence base and quality evaluated using a Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). This will be contrasted with SRs produced after May 2022 in preprint or print up to December 2022 to describe the quantity, coverage, coverage overlap and quality of SRs. The goal of this evaluation is to reflect on the utility of conducting SRs in the first few months of the mpox outbreak and, more generally, reflect on strategies during an emergent or rapidly evolving situation to add to the knowledge base in a constructive and useful manner. Conclusions: The result of this analysis ideally fosters discussion from those conducting synthesis research. Strategies for not duplicating efforts and bringing added value to the literature during a public health emergency include making sure the review is needed, that it can be done in a useful timeline and that it will address existing knowledge needs of decision-makers responding to the emergency. [How is equity addressed in Cochrane reviews of lifestyle interventions for cardiovascular health?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473461/how-is-equity-addressed-in-cochrane-reviews-of-lifestyle-interventions-for-cardiovascular-health) Background: Lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise) are often characterized as individual choices. However, the concept of health equity reflects that not everybody has the same opportunities and resources to be healthy. Lifestyle interventions are influenced by personal and environmental characteristics that affect the ability to make these choices. Systematic reviews (SRs) of interventions rigorously evaluate evidence on the effects of interventions and are used to guide personal, clinical, and policy decisions. If SRs of lifestyle interventions do not explicitly address equity issues, this may lead to evidence being applied inappropriately to disadvantaged populations and used in a way that encourages health inequity. Objectives: To evaluate whether and how PROGRESS-Plus factors (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, age, comorbidity, disability) are addressed in Cochrane reviews of lifestyle interventions for cardiovascular health. Methods: Two authors independently screened all Cochrane reviews published between August 2017 and December 2022 against predefined selection criteria (Box 1). Basic SR characteristics were extracted, and PROGRESS-Plus factors were sought in the Summary of Findings (SoF) table, Methods/Inclusion criteria, Methods/Subgroup analyses, Results/Included studies, Results/Subgroup analyses, and Discussion/Overall completeness and applicability of evidence. Results: We included 36 SRs published by 10 Cochrane groups, covering 11 different health conditions and testing primarily diet or exercise interventions. PROGRESS-Plus factors were not mentioned in 67% of SoF tables but were present in inclusion criteria (64%), included studies (92%), and discussion sections (75%). Although subgroup analyses by PROGRESS-Plus were often planned (69%), few were conducted (44%). The most common PROGRESS-Plus factors were gender/sex, age, and comorbidity. Other factors were infrequently mentioned, and some were never discussed. Conclusions: Equity is not sufficiently addressed in Cochrane reviews of lifestyle interventions for cardiovascular health. We will present detailed data on PROGRESS-Plus factors by review question and review section and discuss the implications of including and omitting specific PROGRESS-Plus factors in each review section. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We did not involve consumers or the public. Improving how equity is addressed in health research will improve the usefulness of research to the wider patient, public, and healthcare consumer community. [Rate and time to the publication of Latin American systematic reviews indexed in PROSPERO: A meta-epidemiological study.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473451/rate-and-time-to-the-publication-of-latin-american-systematic-reviews-indexed-in-prospero-a-meta-epidemiological-study.) Background: The number of published systematic reviews is constantly increasing. However, it is known that there is a substantial disparity in the production of scientific knowledge, a low rate of publications in indexed journals, and research citations from low- and middle-income countries[1]. Some studies report the delay from the registration in the databases to its publication in an indexed journal, especially when the research is Latin American [4,5]. Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the percentage of systematic reviews of interventions registered in PROSPERO from Latin America and to evaluate the publication rate and the time from registration to publication in indexed journals. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We searched in PROSPERO. We included all systematic reviews registered in 2020. We assessed publication status of all included registers within 2 years after its indexation. Data extraction was performed by a reviewer and completely verified by a second reviewer. We extracted the following main characteristics from published systematic reviews: author, year, population, intervention, primary and secondary outcomes, institutional affiliation of the corresponding author, type of review (eg, living systematic review, rapid systematic review), and included study designs. The country of origin was linked in accordance with the organizational affiliation and the country of origin stated in the register. Time until publication was calculated as the difference between the date of registration in PROSPERO and the date of publication in databases and reported as quantitative in months. Results: We will show the complete results at the London Colloquium. Conclusions: We will show conclusions at the London Colloquium. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Attribution of credit in updated Cochrane reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473446/attribution-of-credit-in-updated-cochrane-reviews) Background: Cochrane's guidance indicates that when a review is updated, the authors of the first review version should be listed as former contributors in the updated review's acknowledgements. Objectives: We explore whether Cochrane review authors are properly credited in the acknowledgements of updated reviews. We are particularly interested in potential disparities (if any) in the attribution of credit for female authors and authors from minority groups. Methods: We consider 2,096 Cochrane reviews that have been subject to at least one update between 2003 and 2019. We capture whether authors who contributed to a review by participating in the first version did, or did not, receive credit in the acknowledgements of the updated review. We estimate the antecedents of exclusion from acknowledgements, focusing on the gender and race of the authors. The sample we use for the estimation contains 7,764 observations (review authors). Gender and race were inferred from the authors' first and second names using prediction packages Gender-API and Ethnicolr. Results: Approximately 14% of the authors listed in the original review (and missing from the author list of the updated version) were not mentioned in the acknowledgements of the updated review. We find weak preliminary evidence that the authors' race predicted their exclusion from the acknowledgements. Conclusions: Our initial findings suggest that, despite the guidance set by Cochrane, former contributors are not always credited in updated reviews. [Decision makers find it difficult to compare and select similar systematic reviews based on quality, methods and results: a cross-sectional survey](/colloquium-2023/session/1473436/decision-makers-find-it-difficult-to-compare-and-select-similar-systematic-reviews-based-on-quality-methods-and-results-a-cross-sectional-survey) Background: Systematic reviews (SRs) are being published at an accelerated rate. Decision-makers are often faced with the challenge of comparing and choosing between multiple SRs on the same topic. Objectives: We surveyed individuals in the healthcare field to understand what criteria they use to compare and select one or more SRs from multiple on the same topic. Methods: We developed a survey with 21 open and closed questions. We disseminated it through social media and professional networks. Results: Of the 684 respondents, 25% were health practitioners, 9% were policymakers, 39% were researchers, and 13% were students. Policymakers, practitioners, and researchers frequently sought out SRs (98.1%) as a source of evidence to inform decision-making. They frequently (97.7%) found more than one SR on a given topic of interest to them. Half (50%) struggled to choose the most valid and trustworthy SR amongst multiple. These difficulties related to lack of time (55.2%), insufficient skills/experience in quality appraisal (27.7%), and difficulty comparing different SRs (54.3%). Respondents compared SRs based on the following: relevance to their question of interest, its methodological quality, and recency of SR search date. Conclusions: The exponential growth in the number of SRs leads to duplication of research on similar questions and compounds the problem of identifying which evidence is of the highest quality for decision-makers. Failure to critically appraise and choose the highest quality SRs means that practice and policy decisions may not reflect the best evidence, the implementation of better intervention strategies is delayed, and patients may unduly suffer. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients participated in and responded to the survey. [Adequacy of information on funding and financial conflicts of interest in clinical trial publications and how to obtain missing information: methodological study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473416/adequacy-of-information-on-funding-and-financial-conflicts-of-interest-in-clinical-trial-publications-and-how-to-obtain-missing-information-methodological-study) Background: Knowledge about funding and authors' conflicts of interest is important when critically appraising trials, for example in the context of a systematic review. Although studies have found that funding and conflicts of interest information is often reported in trial publications, little is known about whether the reported information is adequate and if missing information can be retrieved from other information sources. Objective: To assess the adequacy of information on funding and financial conflicts of interest in contemporary randomised trials and to explore how missing information can be retrieved. Methods: Methodological study of 200 randomly selected randomised drug and device trials indexed in MEDLINE in May 2022. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed adequacy of information on funding and authors' financial conflicts of interest (i.e., adequate, partly adequate, inadequate, or no information). The domains that we included in our assessment of adequacy of information were name of funders, types of support, name of organisations resulting in conflicts, relevance of conflicts, and involvement of trial funders and authors. For trials in which information was not adequate, we attempted to retrieve missing information by searching multiple sources (e.g., by searching websites, trial registries, and public disclosure databases). We noted the sources used to successfully retrieve information, the time taken to retrieve information, and the number of trials for which we were unable to retrieve information. Preliminary results (as of February 2023): In the 200 included trials, information on funding was adequate in 54 (27%) trials, partly adequate in 113 (57%) trials, inadequate in 15 (8%) trials, and 18 (9%) trials had no information. Information on authors' financial conflicts of interest was adequate in 129 (65%) trials, partly adequate in 63 (32%) trials, inadequate in 3 (2%), and 5 (3%) trials had no information. Our findings on retrieving missing information will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: Most contemporary trial publications contain information on funding and authors' financial conflicts of interest. However, information on funding is only adequate in around a fourth of trials and for authors' financial conflicts of interest in around two-thirds of trials. [Engaging volunteer translators: the Malaysian experience](/colloquium-2023/session/1473397/engaging-volunteer-translators-the-malaysian-experience) Background: The Cochrane Malaysia Malay translation initiative depends on volunteers, and our success is due to them. Objectives: We describe strategies we have used to keep volunteer translators engaged. Methods and Results: Since its establishment in 2015, we have depended on volunteer translators. Most volunteers join us through cochrane.org. We have attempted to maintain engagement with them in several ways and report these here. We designed strategies to acknowledge their contribution, build relationships, reward them, enhance their capacity, and involve them in decision-making (See Table). Feedback from individual volunteers has been very good, with many stating that they feel they are making an important contribution and others stating that they have learned a lot doing the work. While we thank them for their contribution, many thank us for the opportunity to contribute. Conclusions: There are many ways to keep volunteers engaged. We have shown some examples of what we have attempted to do. Feedback has been very good. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer relevance and involvement: The purpose of the Malay translation initiative is to provide plain language summaries to the public, the majority of whom are Malay-language readers, allowing them to be involved in their own healthcare decision-making. We encourage patients and their caregivers with the appropriate language skills to translate plain language summaries related to their condition. [Risk of Bias 2 tool: the user's point of view](/colloquium-2023/session/1473382/risk-of-bias-2-tool-the-user's-point-of-view) Background: A few years ago, the Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB2) appeared to replace the old RoB tool that has been used for years. As with any new tool, some authors were really adopters whereas others preferred to do it later when it was more 'probed'. Objectives: We aimed to describe the workload of using RoB2 in a group of early adopters. Besides, we described some common questions and doubts that we, as an experimented team in systematic reviews, had during the process of risk bias assessment. Methods: Two reviewers senior used RoB2 during the update of a Cochrane systematic review in the Cochrane GFG. We randomly selected 21 studies that had been included in the previous version of the review. We measured the time workload in each of the following steps during the assessment: before starting with the domains, each of the five RoB2 domains, and the overall analysis. We also performed a qualitative evaluation of the reasons why some domains took longer than others. And, finally, we described some of the questions that we made recurrently during the risk of bias assessment. Results: The mean time of workload was 16.2 +- 4.7 minutes for each of the studies (range 10-26). Domain 2 was the one that took more time (4.7+- 2.1 minutes), whereas domain 5 was the shortest (1.2+-1.1). Conclusions: RoB2 was easily adopted by this group of experienced reviewers. These results show that the evaluation may be more difficult for some domains than for others. A larger and more in-depth evaluation of this tool could be helpful to improve the feeling that both experienced and, especially, non-experienced reviewers could have when using RoB2. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: none. [Participation of stakeholders in the Development of a Clinical Guideline focused on decreasing the COVID-19 transmission risk in dentistry](/colloquium-2023/session/1473906/participation-of-stakeholders-in-the-development-of-a-clinical-guideline-focused-on-decreasing-the-covid-19-transmission-risk-in-dentistry) Background: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are documents systematically developed to help clinicians and patients in the decision-making process. They are a great tool to translate evidence into practice. However, their applicability could decrease if they do not involve stakeholders during their development. Objectives: To develop a CPG focused on decreasing COVID-19 transmission risk in dentistry with the participation of the stakeholders. Methods: We developed a CPG focused on decreasing COVID-19 transmission risk in dentistry following the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodology. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify the evidence of COVID-19 transmission in dental settings. The quality of evidence was determined using different tools. Stakeholders participated in all processes, from the determination of clinical questions to the generation of recommendations. In addition, a questionary was used to assess the experience of stakeholders during their participation in the CPG development. Results: Among the recommendations to reduce the COVID-19 transmission risk during dental care are the use of personal protective equipment and N95 masks, high-speed instruments equipped with an anti-retraction system, and surface disinfection with ethanol. Overall, most recommendations included in the CPG were classified as \"conditional\" by the panel and were based on a \"low\" or \"very low\" level of evidence. Likewise, some clinical questions were addressed under a narrative format, which provides a useful context for clinicians and patients. Around 97% of stakeholders considered that their participation was useful, so it could improve the quality and applicability of the CPG. Conclusions: Most stakeholders self-reported that their participation was considered valued during the development process of a CPG including recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk in dental settings. However, for many participants, it was the first time that they were involved in the development of a CPG; thus, greater efforts are needed to encourage the participation of stakeholders in all processes to synthesize the evidence in this field. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The CPG committee was composed of dentists, methodologists, experts in the field, patients, and government authorities. [Evaluation of the search methods in systematic reviews related to climate change and adverse effects on health published in 2022-2023.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473891/evaluation-of-the-search-methods-in-systematic-reviews-related-to-climate-change-and-adverse-effects-on-health-published-in-2022-2023.) Background: Different international nonprofit organizations promote the development of evidence synthesis in different areas, such as Cochrane, the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence and the Campbell Collaboration, among others that are promoting the synthesis of quality information with the best available evidence for decision-making. For this, they have developed and worked on the elaboration of instances and didactic materials such as manuals and other standards that seek to contribute to the quality of the synthesis of evidence; among these materials are guides and manuals developed by experts in Cochrane and non-Cochrane search methods designed specifically for developing search methods. On the other hand, there are authors who, independently of these organizations, rely on guides such as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension (PRISMA-S) and Peer Review Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) to develop search strategies. In this proposal, we seek to explore and characterize how the authors of the evidence synthesis on climate change and health carry out their searches, what databases they use and the reporting methods. Objectives: - Identify systematic reviews indexed in Medline (PubMed) published between 2022 and 2023 related to climate change and health effects. - Evaluate the reports of the search method of the selected reviews based on the criteria established in PRISMA-S. - Evaluate the search strategies reported with the PRESS guide. Methods: We collected systematic reviews or scoping reviews published from 2022 to 2023 in the Medline (PubMed) databases related to climate change and Health, according to the categories defined by the World Health Organization. To select relevant terms, we use PubReMiner (https://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi) and Analyze Medical Subject Headings (MeSH; mesh.med.yale.edu) We selected a representative sample of 10% from the results retrieved to analyze. The extracted data include those proposed in the PRESS and PRISMA-S. Results: The preliminary results evaluated have detected deficiencies in the review search reports or inappropriate use of the PRESS and PRISMA-S guidelines. Conclusions: The findings of our project will help to detect improvements in the quality of the development of search methods in this area of health that allows it to be an input to detect gaps and new areas of information. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Evaluation patients or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [Inter-rater reliability of AMSTAR-2 in a review of systematic reviews about interventions to prevent adverse events in the intensive care unit](/colloquium-2023/session/1473884/inter-rater-reliability-of-amstar-2-in-a-review-of-systematic-reviews-about-interventions-to-prevent-adverse-events-in-the-intensive-care-unit) Background: The AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) is a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both. With 16 items for evaluation (7 critical and 9 noncritical), the discordances are something to address with a kappa statistic calculation and a third reviewer, demanding researchers time and efforts to complete the overview tasks. Objectives: To evaluate the inter-rater reliability and the weighted kappa statistics of AMSTAR-2. Methods: We assessed the methodological quality with the AMSTAR-2 tool in an overview of systematic reviews about interventions to prevent adverse events in the intensive care unit (1). The study team was divided to evaluated 38 systematic reviews in pairs. We measured inter-rater agreement between reviewers. Kappa weighted score for agreement between pairs of ratters was calculated and compared by each study and AMSTAR-2 item. Results: Agreement between reviewers was significantly high (77.6%) with a good strength of agreement (kw=0.65, p-value < .01), been these results consistent with critical and noncritical items (74.3, .64, p-value < .01; and 80.9, .62, p-value < .01 respectively). Critical items with the least agreement were those referring to the risk of bias and the assessment of heterogeneity in non-randomized studies (9.2 and 11.2), respectively. The non-critical items with the least agreement were the explanation of the study designs selection and description in detail of the included studies (items 3 and 8). Conclusions: Our results are in line with the AMSTAR-2 development and validation study (2). The levels of agreement achieved by the pairs of ratters varied across items, but they were moderate to substantial for most items. Differences between ratters reflect the demanding nature of some item level judgments and should prompt group discussion of their causes and importance, and, if needed, consultation with experts in subject matter and methods. Prior training of the reviewers in the AMSTAR-2 instrument is necessary so that there is maximum consensus when applying it individually. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. References: 1. Suclupe et al. Aust [Collaborating on the COVID-NMA initiative - working on a living mapping and living systematic review in a team effort](/colloquium-2023/session/1473849/collaborating-on-the-covid-nma-initiative---working-on-a-living-mapping-and-living-systematic-review-in-a-team-effort) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 underlined the need for a comprehensive and continuously updated evidence ecosystem approach to synthesize the rapidly evolving body of evidence on interventions to treat and prevent COVID-19. To address this need, the COVID-NMA initiative was established by an international, interdisciplinary group of researchers. Objectives: To describe the living mapping and living systematic review processes and the collaboration across the teams. Methods: The steering committee of the COVID-NMA initiative developed the protocol and search strategies. A network of partners led by Cochrane France are since closely collaborating in the living review process. A live mapping of registered trials is conducted by weekly searching and screening of the COVID-19 database from the WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Epistemonikos' Living OVerview of Evidence (COVID-19 L\u00b7OVE). Data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and grading of the evidence is done in a specifically developed online tool independently by two reviewers. An author contact form is used to gain missing information directly from trialists. Together with forest plots, summary-of-findings tables, the descriptive data, are made available online. A tool to automatically identify publication of preprints was developed. Robust quality control processes were also established to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the synthesized evidence and monitor quality and completeness of reporting. The database is freely available to people who request it for legitimate research. Results: To date, 4,591 studies of treatments have been collected. A total of 874 studies with complete data extraction and results have been included in our evidence synthesis. Of these 576 RCTs are on treatment, 17 RCTs on prevention, 186 RCTs on vaccines, and 95 observational studies on vaccines. Conclusions: The COVID-NMA initiative offers a thorough and up-to-date synthesis of the evidence on interventions to treat and prevent COVID-19. The initiative's approach to evidence synthesis through living mapping, living synthesis, and communication between primary research and evidence synthesis offers a valuable contribution to the evidence ecosystem approach. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The living review is available to the public on the website www.covid-nma.com. [Recommendations to keep a living systematic review alive during a pandemic](/colloquium-2023/session/1473834/recommendations-to-keep-a-living-systematic-review-alive-during-a-pandemic) Background: Living systematic reviews (LSRs) gained special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and have addressed many prioritised research questions. However, the rapid emergence, and persistently high volume, of research evidence on COVID-19 created challenges for keeping LSRs up to date. Objectives: To summarise LSRs about COVID-19 and to offer practical recommendations based on the experience of an LSR group. Methods: We searched the World Health Organization COVID-19 database using the search term 'living systematic review' on 7th November 2022. We extracted and described information about the review topic, population, type of studies included in the review and the number of updates. We used an LSR cycle to give recommendations at each stage, based on our LSR of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Results: We identified 97 living systematic reviews on COVID-19, which focused mainly on the effects of pharmacological interventions (n=46, 47%) or the prevalence of associated conditions or risk factors (n=30, 31%). The topics and aims of many reviews overlapped substantially. One third of the reviews (n=34, 35%) had published any update; most authors only published one update after starting an LSR (n=16). We provide an achievable set of steps for LSRs, starting with a core team with skills to oversee and manage the workload and workflow. Crowdsourcing reviewers can help with workload. Automating steps, such as the search process, and online tools can speed up selection, extraction and risk of bias assessment. We also provide recommendations to update and stop the review (Figure 1). Conclusions: Fulfilling the LSR approach involves considerable human and technical resources. The low proportion of LSRs that were updated by 12-18 months after the search highlights the challenges of keeping reviews alive. Authors should consider this before starting an LSR. We propose steps that make the living process realistic and bring evidence up to date to provide trusted evidence. Even when the LSR method is appropriate, we believe that knowing when to end an LSR is as important as knowing when to start. [How is quality analysis carried out for systematic reviews of nursing interventions?: umbrella review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473814/how-is-quality-analysis-carried-out-for-systematic-reviews-of-nursing-interventions-umbrella-review) Background: Systematic reviews are currently the most consulted secondary source of evidence. New systematic reviews about nursing interventions to improve the health of individuals, families, and communities are produced every day. There are several tools for the critical analysis of the articles that are included in a systematic review. There is no evidence about which ones are used by systematic reviews of nursing interventions. Objectives: The aim of this review of reviews is to identify which are the tools for critical analysis most used in nursing interventions. Methods: Between December 2022 and January 2023, the search was conducted with the following keywords: systematic review, nurse intervention, and effectiveness. The PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, and Web of Science (WOS) databases were consulted. The years 2010-2022 were established as limit, with the following languages: English, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews (quantitative or mixed method) that quantitatively analyzed the effectiveness of nursing interventions. The review was conducted with the support of the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 guideline. Results: The initial search yielded 576 articles. After eliminating duplicates, reading the abstract, and applying inclusion criteria, 90 articles remained. Of the 90 articles, 47 were eliminated due to insufficient description of the population or methodology or inadequate interpretation of the results. A total of 43 articles are analyzed in this review. A total of 55.8% of the systematic reviews correspond to educational interventions, 25.5% to care interventions, and 18.6% to administrative interventions. The tools used to analyze the quality of the articles included in the systematic reviews were as follows: Cochrane 46.5%, Johanna Briggs Institute 32.5%, consort guidelines 6.9%, Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERQI) guidelines 9.4%, and Jadad Guide 4.6%. Conclusions: The most prevalent systematic reviews of nursing interventions are those that include educational and care interventions. The most widely used tool for critical analysis is the Cochrane Collaboration. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This review of reviews was conducted by nurses from two different universities. It is expected that it will serve as an input for the new generations of nurses on the importance of the synthesis of evidence. [Improving alignment between research priorities and needs of people with multiple sclerosis: A worldwide, multi-stakeholder priority setting exercise](/colloquium-2023/session/1473811/improving-alignment-between-research-priorities-and-needs-of-people-with-multiple-sclerosis-a-worldwide-multi-stakeholder-priority-setting-exercise) Background: In 2020, the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Review Group, with the Cochrane Neurological Sciences Field, launched a global priority-setting exercise to elicit the research priorities of people with MS (PwMS), carers, advocates and healthcare professionals. Objectives: To prioritize pressing questions and ensure that future systematic reviews are as useful as possible for the people who need them. Methods: Methods were informed by Cochrane guidance. A working group mapped the evidence base and provided a provisional list of topics, refined iteratively with a multi-stakeholder steering group including clinicians, researchers, one representative of the MS International Federation (MSIF) and one PwMS. A second stage, with help from Cochrane Web Operations, included creating and disseminating an online multi-stakeholder survey, translated into 11 languages by volunteer native speakers recruited via contacts and Cochrane Engage who also assisted with translating responses. A total of 1190 questionnaires were correctly completed (1), mainly by PwMS (74%) and their families, as well as healthcare professionals from 55 countries worldwide. Results: Based on the five top priority-ranked topics for the highest number of respondents (Table 1), systematic reviews on topics that are meaningful and useful for PwMS and carers and include consumer authors are underway. Next, we will further explore the determinants of these choices to better understand the values that inform them by means of a forthcoming thematic analysis of free text answers explaining ranking and through consultation with consumer/stakeholder panels. Conclusions & Relevance statement: Our multi-stakeholder collaboration offers a worldwide perspective on priority areas for evidence synthesis on MS. Notably, only one of the top-ranked topics deals with pharmacological interventions. This ongoing priority-setting process highlights a mismatch between the priorities of PwMS and their carers and research on drugs, on which a disproportionate share of research focus and resources is currently implemented. Taking into account the values of consumers may improve allocation of resources in support of Cochrane's knowledge translation mission. (1) Celani MG et al. Identifying unanswered questions and setting the agenda for future systematic research in Multiple Sclerosis. A worldwide, multi-stakeholder Priority Setting as an evidence map](/colloquium-2023/session/1473798/overview-of-cochrane-systematic-reviews-synthesised-as-an-evidence-map) Background. There exists a lot of evidence synthesis guidance and methodology to characterize and examine the literature relating to a particular topic, including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, umbrella reviews, narrative reviews, integrative reviews, and evidence maps. Because Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) are the reference standard for systematic reviews owing to their methodological rigour and quality, we decided to gather the most robust available evidence from these reviews leading an Overview of CSRs using the evidence map methodology for the synthesis for developing the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation (PIR) proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods. We performed an overview of all the CSRs according to the inclusion criteria defined by the WHO. The CSRs search was led using the tagging process. The search strings were composed of terms defining the \"health condition\" and \"rehabilitation\" and were ran in the Cochrane Library from the inception of the Cochrane Library (1996) to May 30, 2022. The CSRs identified during the screening process were summarised using an evidence map. The novelty was that we mapped outcomes and comparisons of included CSRs indicating the effect and the certainty of evidence to provide a comprehensive view of what is known. Results. Out of 816 CSRs tagged in the Cochrane Rehabilitation database, 3 were related to spinal cord injury, 6 to traumatic brain injury, 17 to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 8 to cerebral palsy, and 10 to rheumatoid arthritis. They provide data within 106 comparisons for a total of 644 primary studies. The evidence map showed a prevalence of low-quality evidence in all conditions, making it difficult to ascertain the effectiveness of several recommended rehabilitation interventions. Conclusion. The evidence map allowed us to give immediate information about the certainty of evidence and, consequently, the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions in patients with different health conditions. The current evidence needs to be confirmed by better-quality research. This methodology could be helpful to summarise evidence for all decision-makers and generate informed and transparent, evidence-based healthcare policy in the rehabilitation field. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: N/A [Scoping and question refinement for systematic reviews commissioned by policy customers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473791/scoping-and-question-refinement-for-systematic-reviews-commissioned-by-policy-customers) Background: Policymakers commission research teams to carry out systematic reviews to support evidence-based decision-making. When presented with a topic brief from a policy customer, the research team must establish whether there is a suitable evidence-base to address the topic and the most appropriate type of systematic review. Often the research team is also involved in refining the research question to make this manageable for producing a review. Objectives: To describe the process used to carry out scoping and question refinement for policy customers and how this informs whether or not to proceed with a review and what type of review is most appropriate. Methods: We will draw on case studies of scoping for policy customers undertaken by the Exeter PRP Evidence Review Facility. This will include analysis of refining the question and inclusion criteria, selecting appropriate sources to search, and presenting the findings in a useful format. We will also discuss how patient and public involvement (PPI) can inform scoping, such as the selection of search terms and relevant sources. Results: The case studies show that topic briefs can be both wide ranging and narrow, requiring a collaborative effort between customer and researchers to refine the question appropriately. The selection of appropriate sources to search depends on the topic, with typical sources including MEDLINE and Google Scholar, extending to specialist sources for some topics, including solicitation of sources and key studies from topic experts and PPI. Meetings with policy customers can help to ensure that our scoping is suitably focused on their research needs. Conclusions: Scoping and question refinement is an important step ahead of the development of a review for a policy customer. Close working between the policy customer and review team, with input from topic experts and members of the public with relevant experience, can help to ensure that the resulting review is best suited to their needs. Patient and public involvement: Scoping and question refinement can use PPI to inform the development of the question and the scope of a review and also more specific technical tasks, such as the development of the search strategy. [Systematic reviews in child and adolescent mental health and welfare: Systematic mapping](/colloquium-2023/session/1473790/systematic-reviews-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health-and-welfare-systematic-mapping) Background: There was a 20-fold increase in the number of systematic reviews (SRs) published between 2000 and 2019 (1). In child and adolescent mental health, an umbrella review identified 104 meta-analyses and network meta-analyses on the effects of an extensive number of interventions (2). But to our knowledge, there is no review mapping the overall production of SRs in child and adolescent mental health (CAMHW). Objectives: We have developed and maintained an open access database (IN SUM: insum.no) indexing all systematic reviews in CAMHW published from 2000 onward. Our objective is to employ this unique literature set to map SR production in CAMHW in the past 2 decades. Methods: We run systematic searches in multiple databases monthly. We include SRs on interventions intended to a) prevent, treat, or alleviate mental health or welfare problems or b) enhance mental health, well-being, and development in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years. Additionally, we include any interventions relevant for child welfare services. Abstracts and full texts are screened, categorized, and included in the database. The identified literature will be described using characteristics such as authors, publication year, interventions studied, diagnosis/problem, age groups, and intervention level. Results: We identified 2,456 included SRs in CAMHW, published from 2000 until February 2023. Our analyses will present descriptive statistics on the characteristics outlined above. Conclusions: We will show publication patterns, describe review overlaps, and identify potential research directions for academics and practitioners and point to a valuable source of systematic reviews in CAMHW. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. Relevance to patients: Pointing to areas in need of research and making evidence on treatment effects available. References 1.

Despite this, high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to JIA are relatively sparse. Systematic searches for RCT evidence are time-consuming and can limit efficient review and guideline development. Objectives: To develop and maintain a living registry of all completed or in-progress RCTs and quasi-RCTs that include patients with a diagnosis of JIA to aid in the development of living systematic reviews and guidelines. Methods: We included all RCTs and quasi-RCTs involving participants with JIA regardless of intervention. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.org and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched from inception on 8 March 2021. Machine learning and crowdsourcing were used to identify probable RCTs from the initial search. Two independent authors further screened the search results to identify potentially relevant studies for full text review. For each included trial, we extracted population, interventions, comparisons and any study identifiers recorded in registries. To maintain the registry in living mode, four further searches have been run to date (10 Nov 2021 and 13 April, 13 July and 12 October 2022). Results: The initial search yielded 5739 records, and 218 trials were included. An additional eight, eight, three, and nine new trials were identified in subsequent searches (total currently of 246 unique trials [540 records]). An additional 38 records are awaiting assessment. Of the included trials, 153 have published results, 27 have conference abstracts only and 66 have a published protocol but no published results to date. The most studied interventions are medications (n=109) followed by physical therapies (n=32), psychological therapies (n=19,) diet/probiotics (n=6), surgery (n=1) and other (n=6). Conclusions: Our living repository of all JIA RCTs will provide an ongoing resource for keeping our living reviews and guideline recommendations for the management of JIA up to date. It will also be useful for identifying evidence gaps. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This repository will be used for the development of living clinical guidelines for the management of JIA. [Equity Considerations in COVID-19 Vaccination Studies of Individuals With Autoimmune Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases](/colloquium-2023/session/1473754/equity-considerations-in-covid-19-vaccination-studies-of-individuals-with-autoimmune-inflammatory-rheumatic-diseases) Background: Immunocompromised patients were excluded from the trials testing the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination. To inform clinical practice guidelines, we searched for studies evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in people with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRDs). Objective: We examined how populations experiencing inequities were considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with AIRDs. Methods: We included 19 studies from an ongoing Cochrane living review on COVID-19 vaccination in people with AIRDs. We used the PROGRESS-Plus framework (place of residence, race/ethnicity, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital, plus: age, multimorbidity, and health literacy) to analyze the included populations. We assessed differences in COVID-19 baseline risk, eligibility, description of participant characteristics, and attrition, controlling for confounding factors, subgroup analyses, and applicability of findings. Results: All 19 studies were cohort studies that followed individuals with AIRDs after vaccination. Three studies (16%) described differences in baseline risk for COVID-19 across age. Two studies (11%) defined eligibility criteria based on occupation and age. All 19 studies described participant age and sex. Twelve studies (67%) controlled for age and/or sex as confounders. Eight studies (47%) conducted subgroup analyses across at least one PROGRESS-Plus factor, most commonly age. Ten studies (53%) interpreted applicability in relation to at least one PROGRESS-Plus factor, most commonly age (47%), followed by ethnicity (16%), sex (16%), and multimorbidity (11%). Conclusions: Sex and age were the most frequently considered PROGRESS-Plus factors in studies of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with AIRDs. The generalizability of evidence to populations experiencing inequities is uncertain. Future COVID-19 vaccine studies should report participant characteristics in more detail to help inform the applicability of findings. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None for this project.

[Multiple methods needed to ensure findings are relevant to stakeholders in a complex health systems review of lay health workers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473742/multiple-methods-needed-to-ensure-findings-are-relevant-to-stakeholders-in-a-complex-health-systems-review-of-lay-health-workers) Background and patient relevance Lay or community health workers (LHWs), i.e., people trained to perform healthcare functions but with no formal professional certification, are one strategy for addressing shortages of health workers to manage chronic conditions in primary and community care. Because LHW interventions are complex and involve a range of tasks, it is challenging to synthesise available trial results for decision-making. We are updating a systematic review on the effects of LHWs for chronic conditions and wanted to maximise the relevance of the findings to stakeholders, including patients and policy users. Objectives To describe two methods innovations to improve the relevance to stakeholders of complex health systems review findings. Methods Innovation 1 - intervention taxonomy: Using the intervention descriptions from 66 randomised trials of LHWs for diabetes treatment, we iteratively developed a draft intervention taxonomy organised by purpose of care. We then tested and refined this taxonomy on a second set of trials of LHWs for hypertension treatment. Innovation 2 - prioritising outcomes: To identify outcomes that patients and other stakeholders view as important, we convened online stakeholder panels, including patients, clinicians, researchers and service managers, to examine the outcomes assessed in included trials; review related clinical core outcome sets; and provide guidance on which outcomes and assessment timepoints should be prioritized. These judgements then guided data extraction and analysis. Results Our intervention taxonomy comprises six categories focused on the purpose of the intervention for patients: health education; social and emotional support; self-management; case management and patient navigation; clinical management; and multi-faceted interventions. We were able to successfully use taxonomy to organise the included studies for synthesis. Included LHWs trials assessed a wide range of outcomes, and we found no core outcome sets for LHWs trials. Stakeholders were key to identifying critical and important outcomes for each condition that we could then use to guide data extraction and analysis. Conclusions Multiple methods innovations are needed within reviews of complex health systems interventions to improve their relevance to stakeholders. Two innovations are presented here as exemplars to be potentially applied to other reviews addressing complex questions. [: Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach to report the conclusions in a non-inferiority randomized clinical trial.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473735/using-the-grading-of-recommendations-assessment-development-and-evaluations-approach-to-report-the-conclusions-in-a-non-inferiority-randomized-clinical-trial.) Background: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) has proposed a system for rating the certainty of a body of evidence (CoE) to determine confidence in the estimate. The GRADE approach has not only refreshed the way in which the evidence is presented, and even though it has become a fact of high-quality systematic reviews, its principles might be applicable to primary designs. Objectives: Describe our experience applying the GRADE approach to the conclusions of a non-inferiority, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of Cardiac Rehabilitation (HYCARET Study). Methods: This report is based on HYCARET study, which evaluated the non-inferiority of a hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program for patients with coronary artery disease. Following the guidelines for non-inferiority trials, we conducted intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses for the main outcome. We established the non-inferiority margin at an absolute risk difference of 5% for the proportions of cardiovascular events. For the PP analysis, we run four analyses for four different percentages of adherence to the intervention, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%. Then we plotted the effect estimates with their confidence intervals (Figure 1) and we judged the inconsistency, imprecision, and risk of bias following the GRADE guidelines. Results: We decrease CoE in two levels because of imprecision. The loss of sample size according to adherence to the intervention in the PP analysis, and the wide confidence intervals crossing the non-inferiority threshold introduced imprecision to our result. However, the effect on recurrent cardiovascular events showed a consistent non-inferiority effect across all analyses. The conclusion of the study is therefore a hybrid CR program may be not inferior to a standard CR program in terms of recurrent cardiovascular events. Conclusions: Domains of GRADE approach, such as inconsistency, imprecision, and risk of bias, might be transferable to draft the conclusions in non-inferiority trials. We hope that sharing our experience may help future authors of noninferiority trials not to focus only on thresholds in writing the conclusions of their papers and may consider including an assessment of the CoE. Patient involvement: Patients participated in the design of part of the intervention under study (counseling). [Cochrane simplified Chinese translation and dissemination: a collaborative model of knowledge translation](/colloquium-2023/session/1473730/cochrane-simplified-chinese-translation-and-dissemination-a-collaborative-model-of-knowledge-translation) Background: Although Cochrane systematic reviews are important for clinical decisions, the structured abstract and plain language summary (PLS) are essential for knowledge translation (KT). However, language is a main barrier for Chinese users. Therefore, Simplified Chinese Translation and Dissemination (SCTD) Working Group has been working on settling the language gap by organizing activities of SCTD. Cochrane China Network (CCN) was established in 2020 in view of deepening the collaboration of research and KT. We started the collaborative SCTD at the same time, aiming to foster a stable capacity in translation and dissemination. Objective: The aim of this work is to present the collaborative model of SCTD. Methods: We collaborated within CCN with affiliates and working groups and also with teams outside CCN but with outstanding interest and capacity of joining this work (Table 1). Together we organized training involving contents of evidence-based medicine, systematic review, clinical trial, Cochrane KT, and medical English translation. Training sessions were set up as a part of course teaching, intern practice, or webinars. There was at least one tutor in each team to supervise the translation and complete the editing work. All teams shared the same pathway and glossary, and all of the final review was done by our working group in order to keep consistency for quality control. Results: We published 710 and 759 translations of abstracts & PLSs in 2021 and 2022 respectively, which shows a significant increase, and a lot more active translators contributed with simplified Chinese translation of higher quality. The training itself built up the capacity of translators and editors. We also continued to disseminate the translation via the main social media in China called WeChat, and we acknowledged the translators and editors to the public, which also encouraged the information dissemination supported by different teams. Conclusions: The idea of network supports SCTD activity by enhancing the efficiency of our work and in turn it provides an innovative way for capacity training as well as education. We will continue the collaboration of SCTD and explore the possibility of improvement by survey and communication in the future. [One in five recent systematic reviews in high-impact sports science journals assessed the certainty of evidence: a systematic meta-epidemiological review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473726/one-in-five-recent-systematic-reviews-in-high-impact-sports-science-journals-assessed-the-certainty-of-evidence-a-systematic-meta-epidemiological-review) Background: Assessing certainty of evidence is a key element of any systematic review. It is unclear whether contemporary systematic reviews in the field of sport and exercise science provide end users with a certainty rating. Objectives: To examine the prevalence and methods of certainty of evidence assessment in contemporary systematic reviews published in high-impact sports and exercise science journals. Methods: A PubMed search and hand-searching of relevant journal web sites was used to identify systematic reviews published between 1 August 2016 and 11 October 2022. Two authors independently screened documents to include any systematic review published in 1 of the top-10 highest-impact journals within the 2020 Journal Citation Report for the Sports Sciences category that assessed certainty of evidence using any method. Certainty of evidence assessment was defined as the combination of two or more conceptual domains to provide an overall rating or statement about the confidence or trustworthiness of the evidence across studies. Results: Of 1,250 otherwise eligible documents, 258 (20.6%) assessed the certainty of evidence. Nine methods were cited for assessing certainty, with the most common being the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (61.6%). The proportion of systematic reviews assessing certainty of evidence appeared to increase over the six-year timeframe analyzed. The overwhelming majority of systematic reviews that assessed certainty of evidence addressed the domains of risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency of the results. Indirectness or applicability and other certainty domains were less commonly assessed. Conclusions: Only one in five recent contemporary systematic reviews in the field of exercise and sport science assessed certainty of evidence. Organizational and institutional education on methods for assessing evidence may help further increase uptake of these methods, improve the quality and clinical impact of systematic reviews in the field, and support evidence-based decision-making among consumers and clinicians. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No patients or healthcare consumers were involved in the development of this project. [Facilitating global collaborations for pregnancy and pediatric biomarker research through a biobank database: the COPPER project](/colloquium-2023/session/1473718/facilitating-global-collaborations-for-pregnancy-and-pediatric-biomarker-research-through-a-biobank-database-the-copper-project) Background: Many studies use biologic specimens to support pregnancy or pediatric research. Globally, research studies often collect biologic specimens from study participants and have leftover specimens stored in \"biobanks.\" There is currently no centralized database of residual pregnancy or pediatric specimens in biobanks available for use by other researchers. Objectives: The objective of the Collaborative Online Perinatal and Pediatric Repository (COPPER) project is to develop a database of studies with pregnancy- and pediatric-related biospecimens linked to clinical outcomes that could be made available for use by other researchers. This could foster global collaboration, increase representation of individuals from under-represented groups, and make research more efficient at testing and validating biomarkers for clinical use. Methods: An online REDCap survey is being utilized for the project. A survey link (attached) is available and has been sent to an initial list of investigators with known biobanks and those who have performed pregnancy studies in which specimens were noted to be collected. The survey asks about the name of the biobank, what and how specimens were collected and stored, available clinical information (de-identified), the limitations that may be in place based on informed consent, and governance of the specimens and data. Results: To date, 24 biobanks have responded to the survey. Of these, 62.5% have blood, 42% umbilical cord blood, 33% urine, 42% placental tissue, 17% breast milk, and 25% DNA or genetic material. Biobanks vary by size, with specimens from 30 to 10,038 individuals. Most biobanks reported participant characteristics, including race and ethnicity, what trimester specimens were collected from, and pregnancy conditions and complications associated with the biologic specimens. Conclusions: There are many pregnancy and pediatric biospecimens available for collaborative research. This initial survey yielded robust responses from a small group of invited investigators in the United States. We plan to invite investigators from around the world to also complete the survey. The ultimate goal is a searchable database of pregnancy and childhood biospecimens available to enable investigators to pool specimens from a multitude of populations to enhance research resources and guide clinical care in pregnant and pediatric patients worldwide. Consumer involvement: In next stage. [Evidence-Informed Policy-making (EIPM): developing for Brazilian context](/colloquium-2023/session/1473717/evidence-informed-policy-making-eipm-developing-an-competency-profile-for-brazilian-context) Background: Evidence-Informed Policy-making (EIPM) requires individual and organizational knowledge, skills and attitudes articulated with contextual factors and needs. An EIPM competency profile was developed to support EIPM institutionalization in Brazilian context. Objectives: To present process and results of the development of an EIPM competency profile for Brazilian context. Methods: An authorship group, composed of Brazilian experts from different sectors, was established to add diversity of views, experiences and opinions. The authorship group discussed and defined, over six workshops held in 2021, from the macroproblems of EIPM in Brazilian context to key elements for the EIPM competency profile in Brazilian context. Development stages included the following: 1) creation of the authorship group, bringing together researchers, professionals with practical experience in EIPM-related fields, decision-makers and educators; 2) development of a rapid review on EIPM competence profiles to support initial discussions; 3) agreement on commitments and responsibilities; 4) discussion and outlining of related macro-problems and 5) outline of general and specific key knowledge, skills and attitudes to be incorporated into the EIPM competency profile. Results: The development of the EIPM competence profile was guided by the following macroproblems: 1) decision-making processes are not systematic and transparent; 2) poorly developed institutional capacity for managing, translating and applying evidence and 3) incipient incorporation of scientific evidence into the process of formulating and implementing health policies. Based on subsidies and discussions carried out by the authoring group, we proposed a competence profile for EIPM in Brazilian context, including 42 specific and general key elements, distributed by professional area (Health policy and systems decision-making, Scientific Research, Civil Society, Knowledge Translation and Transversal field). These elements were systematized and presented in a structured framework. Conclusions: This competency profile constitutes the first initiative to delimit the key competency elements to advance EIPM in Brazilian context and contributes to discussion and elaboration of curricula of courses of different levels, selection of professionals, evaluation of the professional performance, plan career advancement and guide the formation of learning communities in institutional environments, among other purposes. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Different types of decision makers in health policy/systems, health professionals, researchers and citizens. [CHARMS and PROBAST at your fingertips: a template for data extraction and risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews of predictive models](/colloquium-2023/session/1473716/charms-and-probast-at-your-fingertips-a-template-for-data-extraction-and-risk-of-bias-assessment-in-systematic-reviews-of-predictive-models) Background: Clinical prediction model systematic reviews are becoming increasingly abundant in the literature. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment are critical steps in any systematic review. CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies) and PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool) are the standard tools used for these steps in reviews of clinical prediction models. Objective: The aim of our study was to create an Excel template for extracting data and assessing the risk of bias and the applicability of predictive models using these two tools (i.e., CHARMS and PROBAST). Methods: The Excel file (named CHARMS and PROBAST template.xls) consists of eight sheets. The first sheet, \"Home\", provides a description of the Excel file, instructions for its use, and links to relevant papers and forms. The following three sheets (\"Summary\", \"CHARMS\", and \"PROBAST\") correspond to the collection of data from the studies included in the systematic review, and the following three sheets (\"Study Characteristics\", \"Model characteristics \", and \"PROBAST summary\") contain the tables and figures generated automatically from the data collected. The final sheet (\"CHARMS. Drop-down response lists\") allows tailoring of the template to the systematic review. Results: We developed an Excel template for data extraction and risk of bias assessment of clinical prediction models. The template makes it easier for reviewers to extract data, assess the risk of bias and applicability, and automatically produce tables and figures of the results that show a summary of the characteristics of included studies, models, and their critical appraisal. These tables and figures are ready for publication. The template, as well as an example with a filled in file, can be downloaded from https://github.com/Fernandez-Felix/CHARMS-and-PROBAST-template. Conclusions: We hope this template will simplify and standardize the process of conducting a systematic review of prediction models and promote a better and more comprehensive reporting of these systematic reviews. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not foreseen. [Discrepancies between registered protocol and final publication in exercise interventions for chronic low back pain: a meta-research study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473715/discrepancies-between-registered-protocol-and-final-publication-in-exercise-interventions-for-chronic-low-back-pain-a-meta-research-study) Background: Discrepancies between registered protocols and final publications are common in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various medical fields, undermining their integrity and credibility. However, this has not yet been assessed in exercise RCTs for chronic low back pain (cLBP). Objectives: We aimed to assess the prevalence of discrepancies between the registered protocol and final publication in cLBLP exercise RCTs. Methods: This is a meta-research study, prospectively registered (doi: 10.1101/2023.02.27.23286399). We started from the RCTs included in the 2021 Cochrane review \"Exercise therapy for chronic low back pain\" and identified in its update (n=421) to select all RCTs reporting a protocol registration on a primary register of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform or in ClinicalTrials.gov. Standardized data collection forms were developed to record information from both registration and publication. We detected discrepancies for primary and secondary outcomes, outcomes measurement, and timepoints between the registered protocol and final publication adapting a previous published method. We used descriptive statistics to assess the proportion of RCTs with and without a discrepancy. Results: Overall, we included 121 RCTs reporting an available protocol registration. Preliminary results from the first 20 studies showed that most protocols were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (n=11; 55%) with less than half (n=9; 45%) prospectively registered. Overall, we found 31 different discrepancies in reporting outcomes between protocol registrations and publications: 6 for primary outcomes (n=2 in outcome definitions, n=2 in measurements, n=2 in timepoints) in 4 RCTs (20%) and 25 for secondary outcomes (n=17 in outcome definitions, n=5 in measurements, n=3 in timepoints) in 17 RCTs (85%). The most frequent discrepancy was addition of primary (n=2) or secondary outcomes (n=10) (Table 1). Conclusions: From our preliminary findings, we found widespread discrepancies in one fifth of RCTs for primary outcomes and in four fifths of RCTs for secondary outcomes. The presence of such discrepancies can threaten the validity of RCTs as well as systematic reviews or guidelines for clinical practice. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The assessment and reporting of efficacy and safety outcomes should be mandatory to fulfil ethical obligations toward patients for fully informed decision-making in the healthcare system. [Differences in search strategies and output between Cochrane Reviews and matching Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report](/colloquium-2023/session/1473713/differences-in-search-strategies-and-output-between-cochrane-reviews-and-matching-health-technology-assessment-hta-report) Background: Creating and running search strategies are complex tasks relying on information specialists working in collaboration with clinical experts, as well as other available resources. Differences in search strategies for the same research question between review teams are common. Where these differences emerge, and the impact of different search strategies, needs further attention in order to compare and evaluate current search strategy practices. Objectives: Our aim was to investigate if and how search strategies differ between Cochrane Reviews and HTA Reports on the same research question. Methods: We identified and compared the search strategies in HTA reports published by the HTA unit in southern Sweden and matching Cochrane Reviews. When discrepancies in the PICO-S or timing of the search were identified (e.g., HTA reports including additional study designs or conducted at different times), the HTA-search strategy was modified to get more comparable search output. In this pilot project we compared the following variables in the HTA-report and the corresponding Cochrane Review: 1. Search terms 2. Subject terms (e.g., MeSH-terms) 3. Limiters/filters (e.g., animal, children) 4. Language restrictions (e.g., no restrictions, English) 5. Study types (e.g., RCT's, protocols, grey literature, and conference abstracts) 6. Number of databases searched 7. Number of hits Results: Our preliminary results for the initial two review research questions with matching HTA-report and Cochrane review indicates that the Cochrane reviews has more overall hits and included studies, included more databases, used less language restrictions and included more search terms and combinations while the HTA-report included more study types. Different search limits were used. Table 1. Conclusions: There are several differences in search strategies between HTA reports and Cochrane reviews which have an impact on the number of hits and possibly on included studies. Differences can be due to available resources for screening and the time-to-completion of reviews and reports. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None, because of the technical topic of the project. [Co-producing with children and young people on a meta-ethnography on experiences of chronic pain, treatments and services](/colloquium-2023/session/1473712/co-producing-with-children-and-young-people-on-a-meta-ethnography-on-experiences-of-chronic-pain-treatments-and-services) Background: Childhood chronic pain is a worldwide public health issue. We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography, with patient and public involvement (PPI) in all review stages. We investigated the experiences and perceptions of children with chronic pain and their families of chronic pain, pain treatments and services. PPI in every stage of a systematic review or evidence synthesis is rare. We will co-present with young people with chronic pain and parents. Objectives: To involve children with chronic pain and their families and other key stakeholders in the meta-ethnography study design, analysis, interpretation and dissemination to ensure salience of findings. To describe involvement methods and impact. Methods: Thirty-three stakeholders, including children, parents, health professionals and third-sector representatives, took part as co-producers via workshops, meetings, email, and conference calls. They participated in developing the grant proposal, finalising the review protocol, making decisions about sampling and organising studies for synthesis and interpreted and disseminated findings. We created innovative methods to involve children and stakeholders in analysis and interpretation, e.g., we conveyed screening results using infographics and developed cartoons to show preliminary findings to facilitate discussion during workshops to clarify, interpret and/or address gaps in data. Results: Stakeholders suggested additional sources for the literature search strategy, decided we should include non-UK studies in the sample, and agreed that we should group studies by pain condition for synthesis. PPI provided different perspectives on and interpretations of ambiguous data, challenged the review team's interpretations and filled gaps in data based on their experiences. A young person with chronic pain co-presented at a nursing conference, and PPI co-developed an animated cartoon to disseminate findings to children and young people. Conclusions: We believe this is the first meta-ethnography to involve patients, parents and other stakeholders as partners in every stage from inception to dissemination. Their involvement in study design, analysis, interpretation and dissemination ensured the relevance and usefulness of the review outputs, clarified ambiguous (and controversial) findings and was key to producing meaningful findings to enhance policy and practice. [The Fragility of Statistically Significant Findings from Depression Randomized Controlled Trials](/colloquium-2023/session/1473696/the-fragility-of-statistically-significant-findings-from-depression-randomized-controlled-trials) Background: Efficacy of an intervention is commonly evaluated using the P-value; however, recent literature has drawn attention to the potential inadequacy about robustness of threshold P-value as a tool for reporting discontinuous outcomes in clinical trials. The fragility index (FI), which is the minimum number of changes from events to non-events resulting in loss of statistical significance, has been suggested as a means to aid the interpretation of trial results. Objectives: In this systematic survey, we calculated the FI of clinical trials in depression, which report positive eligible outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of randomized controlled trials in depression published from 2012-2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The British Medical Journal (BMJ), and 35 top journals listed in Psychiatry-Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) category in the field of psychiatric medicine focusing primarily on depression. Two-arm studies with 1:1 randomization and significant positive results for discontinuous outcomes were eligible for the fragility index calculation, which involves the iterative reduction of an event to the experimental group (defined as the group with the larger number of events in positive trials) and concomitant subtraction of a non-event from that group, until positive significance (defined as p0\u00b705 by Fisher's exact test) is lost. Results: We identified 1120 trials, and, whereas a total of 130 randomized controlled trials were included, 33 trials were fulfilled with two eligible outcomes (remission rate and response rate). The median FI of total trials included was four (25th-75th percentile, 2-8; range, 1-40), and greater than 33.85% of trials had a FI of equal or less to two. A total of 68.46 % of trials reported the loss to follow-up greater than their FI. Trial sample size, the total number of events, the impact factor of journals which included trials published, and the ratio of the sample size of enrolled to the sample size of screened were associated with FI. In trials with two eligible outcomes, the distributions of FI were different but positively correlated. Conclusions: In depression trials reporting positive discontinuous outcomes, the findings often hinge on small numbers of events. Clinicians should be wary of basing decisions on trials with a low FI. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: 24,345 patients. [Transfusion Evidence Round-ups': an ISBT/SRI collaboration with a goal to share knowledge to improve transfusion practice worldwide.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473684/transfusion-evidence-round-ups'-an-isbtsri-collaboration-with-a-goal-to-share-knowledge-to-improve-transfusion-practice-worldwide.) Background: In 2020, the Systematic Review Initiative [SRI] and the International Society of Blood Transfusion [ISBT] began a partnership to improve the dissemination of the transfusion medicine evidence base. ISBT is a world-renowned, trusted professional network in transfusion medicine. SRI is a producer of high-quality evidence used by clinical, research and guideline developer audiences. The collaboration aims to promote awareness of high-quality papers, facilitate learning and networking opportunities for ISBT members and enhance the SRI/ISBT partnership. Objectives: To present initial experience of the SRI/ISBT Transfusion Evidence Round-Ups. Methods: Annually, a working group of ISBT and SRI staff meet to select four theme days. These days are spread across the year and mostly ally to an internationally recognised theme day selected to be representative of transfusion medicine issues that are relevant worldwide. A 'Transfusion Evidence Round-Up' highlights 10 recently published papers that directly address the chosen theme. Each Round-Up is curated from the content of the SRI's Transfusion Evidence Library, with SRI staff identifying possibly relevant papers and a multidisciplinary panel of volunteers drawn from ISBT panel with an interest in the theme, selecting the top 10 papers. Round-Ups are sent by email to all ISBT members and Transfusion Evidence Library subscribers. The last two Round-Ups have been accompanied by live online journal clubs facilitated jointly by SRI and ISBT staff. Results: The first Round-Up was disseminated in September 2021. To date, six Round-Ups have been created and disseminated, with themes including safer maternal and newborn care for World Patient Safety Day, World Cancer Day, International Thalassaemia Day and World Haemophilia Day. Feedback and access to analytic data has demonstrated that the Round-Ups have been equally well-received by both audiences. ISBT members who have participated in the reviewing panels have also provided positive feedback on their experience. Journal clubs have been well attended. Conclusions: The collaboration has had a successful start, with the Round-Ups raising awareness of the importance of the role of evidence synthesis for transfusion medicine with ISBT members and enabling the SRI to disseminate to a bigger global audience than ever before. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: [Impact of pilot/feasibility study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473680/impact-of-pilotfeasibility-studies-in-meta-analyses-of-acupuncture-a-meta-epidemiological-study) Background: Pilot/feasibility studies are assumed to be associated with inflated effect size (ES) of meta-analyses, and whether acupuncture is used as an adjunctive therapy or not may influence the effect size. Objectives: This study aims to explore the changes of ES in meta-analyses when adopting different criteria regarding inclusion of pilot/feasibility studies and compare the ES following usage pattern of acupuncture (alone or as an adjunctive therapy) across therapeutic areas. Methods: Searches were conducted to identify systematic reviews with meta-analyses of acupuncture from January 2017 to December 2020. The summary ES were extracted from each meta-analysis. Individual studies included in the meta-analyses were classified into one of the following four categories: sample size (N 100, N 100) and usage (acupuncture alone or as an adjunctive therapy). The ES was recalculated following the sample size, except of small-sized studies, and compared with that of original study. Fixed and random effects models and meta-regressions were estimated. The potential independent variables identified by relevant literatures (types of outcome, acupuncture and conditions) were extracted and analysed. Results: Until March 2023, searches are finished, and relevant studies are under review. Preliminary findings will be reported. Conclusions: Results of this study can demonstrate the impact of pilot/feasibility studies and usage pattern of acupuncture for effect sizes of meta-analyses. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Creating accessible patient guidelines based on oncological evidence-based clinical practice guidelines](/colloquium-2023/session/1473674/creating-accessible-patient-guidelines-based-on-oncological-evidence-based-clinical-practice-guidelines) Background: To make informed decisions, patients need reliable information on their disease. In Germany, some evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, for example on haematological malignancies, are being prepared in cooperation with the German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO), funded by the German Cancer Aid. However, these guidelines are not always accessible and understandable for laypersons, as they are aimed at professionals treating the patients. To make health information available to the affected group and provide patients with the best possible information about their disease, patient guidelines are created. Objectives: To create evidence-based and accessible patient information in the form of patient guidelines by translating the complex content of clinical practice guidelines into lay language. Methods: First, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are developed in collaboration with patients and patient representatives. After completion of such a guideline, the patients and patient representatives involved in the development process are invited to review and prioritise the topics and recommendations based on their relevance for patients. The patient guideline is created using a strict methodology and template provided by the GGPO. Recommendations and information are translated into lay language; technical terms are avoided. Several feedback rounds with clinicians and the patient representatives are initiated and, following a public consultation stage, the patient guideline is published online and freely available as a printed version. Results: Recommendations for the clinical practice guidelines were based on systematically researched pre-defined questions and outcomes prioritised on patients' needs. Patient guidelines for multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma were successfully published. A patient guideline for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is currently being prepared; the topics of the clinical practice guideline were evaluated according to their relevance. Topics like general therapy options, treatment of relapses, and post-treatment care were rated as particularly important. Specific details, such as irradiation position in radiotherapy, were considered less relevant for patients. The process of translating the guideline into lay language is ongoing, a first draft is planned for summer 2023. Conclusion: Collaborating with patient representatives allows the creation of accessible, understandable, and evidence-based information for patients in form of patient guidelines providing patients with the best possible guidance. [IMPACT OF A SINGLE REVIEWER ON CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT IN NETWORK META-ANALYSIS](/colloquium-2023/session/1473671/impact-of-a-single-reviewer-on-certainty-of-evidence-assessment-in-network-meta-analysis) Background: COVID-19 has driven the need for timely evidence to inform decision-making. However, summarizing the rapidly growing evidence has been a challenge. Systematic reviews with network meta-analyses (NMA) provide a complete, broad, and updated view of the evidence, making it the best type of evidence synthesis to inform the development of practice recommendations. The rating of certainty of evidence (CoE) is a crucial step that determines the conclusions from the review, but it can be very time-consuming in the context of NMA. To our knowledge, there is no empirical evidence regarding the impact of having a single reviewer conducting CoE assessments in the context of NMA. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of CoE assessments by a single reviewer versus two reviewers on the evidence summaries of NMA. Methods: We carried out a retrospective methodological study using data from all outcomes included in the body of evidence that informs recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 therapeutics living guideline. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessments performed in the context of the COVID-19 LNMA that informs the recommendations. Pairs of reviewers independently, following training and calibration exercises, conducted these assessments following GRADE guidance, and solved disagreements through consensus. We defined an important difference in the ratings as an increase from low or very low to high or moderate or a decrease from high or moderate to low or very low. We will calculate the proportion of outcomes with important differences comparing the CoE rating from a single versus two reviewers. We will use a generalized linear mixed model to account for the outcomes of the same comparison. Results: This study is ongoing, and results will be presented at the Colloquium as available. Conclusions: This study is ongoing, and results will be presented at the Colloquium as available. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable, [Transfers between Cochrane review Groups to sharpen profile and facilitate the work of Cochrane authors](/colloquium-2023/session/1473658/transfers-between-cochrane-review-groups-to-sharpen-profile-and-facilitate-the-work-of-cochrane-authors) Background: The topic and focus of Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs) may change over time. Therefore, their portfolio must adapt to fit their current profile. Three CRGs cover the abdomen, each with distinct foci. However, the portfolio of these CRGs reflects years of research within various topics that possibly differ from the current focus, and there may be overlap between groups. Cochrane authors as well as CRGs may benefit from a streamlining of CRG content between groups. Objectives: We aimed to describe the process and experiences of moving protocols and reviews between CRGs to sharpen their profile and better aid Cochrane authors. Methods: In 2020, the Colorectal Group reached out to the two other CRGs covering the abdomen, the Gut Group and the Hepatobiliary Group, as well as the Cancer network. A discussion on moving protocols and reviews between CRGs and the network was initiated. Several meetings were held online and facilitated by the Abdomen and Endocrine network. Cochrane support piloted the development of an exchange process between CRGs. Results: In total, 36 and 37 relevant Cochrane protocols and reviews were identified in the Colorectal Group and Gut Group, respectively, to be transferred between groups. Most identified protocols and reviews were transferred immediately (89% and 73%, respectively) by Cochrane support. Any Cochrane protocol or review under development was flagged for future transfer when the protocol or review was published to ensure continuity for Cochrane authors. At follow-up 2.5 years later, most of these had been transferred. No protocols or reviews were identified relevant to transfer to the Hepatobiliary Group, and none were transferred to the Cancer network owing to their resources being limited. All authors were contacted and informed by the receiving CRG after the transfer. Conclusions: CRG portfolios can easily be updated and sharpened with the aid of other CRGs and Cochrane support. Protocols or reviews under development should await transfer until published to ensure continuity for Cochrane authors, thereby ensuring that the evidence becomes available to patients. Transfers should only be made if the receiving CRG has the necessary capacity to follow-up and continue these Cochrane reviews. [Trials we cannot trust: investigating their impact on systematic reviews and clinical guidelines in spinal pain](/colloquium-2023/session/1473656/trials-we-cannot-trust-investigating-their-impact-on-systematic-reviews-and-clinical-guidelines-in-spinal-pain) Background: We previously conducted an exploration of the trustworthiness of a group of clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exercise in spinal pain from a single author team. We identified multiple concerns in eight trials, judging their data and conclusions to be untrustworthy. Objectives: To systematically explore the impact of these trials (\"index trials\") on results, conclusions, and recommendations of systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Methods: We conducted forward citation tracking using Google Scholar and the citation chaser tool and searched the Guidelines International Network (GIN) library, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) archive to June 2022 to identify systematic reviews and CPGs. We explored how index trials impacted their findings. Where reviews presented meta-analyses, we extracted or conducted sensitivity analyses for the outcomes pain and disability to explore how the exclusion of the index trials affected effect estimates. We developed and applied an 'Impact Index' to categorise the extent to which index studies impacted the results of identified meta-analyses. Results: We included 32 unique reviews and 10 CPGs. None directly raised concerns regarding the veracity of the data from the index trials. Across all meta-analyses (55 comparisons), removal of the index trials reduced effect sizes by a median 58% (IQR 40-74). Using the Impact Index, 85% of comparisons were classified as highly, 3% as moderately, and 11% as minimally impacted. Nine out 10 reviews conducting narrative synthesis drew positive conclusions regarding the intervention tested. Nine out of 10 CPGs made positive recommendations for the intervention(s) evaluated. Conclusions: This cohort of trials, with substantial concerns regarding trustworthiness, has had substantial impacts on the results of systematic reviews and the recommendations of CPGs, contributing to overly positive conclusions regarding the efficacy of adding CBT to physical rehabilitation for spinal pain. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Systematic review protocol registration: the perspectives of researchers, peer-reviewers, and journal editors through an online survey](/colloquium-2023/session/1473655/systematic-review-protocol-registration-the-perspectives-of-researchers-peer-reviewers-and-journal-editors-through-an-online-survey) Background: As systematic reviews (SRs) inform healthcare decisions, it is key that they address relevant questions and use rigorous methodology. Registration of SR protocols, which is the standard for Cochrane reviews, has been proposed to help researchers identify relevant topics for future reviews and avoid duplication of effort. Currently, most SR protocols are not registered. Gaining understanding in the perspectives of the research community would help guide future recommendations on prospective registration of SRs. Objectives: To examine the experiences with prospective SR protocol registration amongst researchers, peer reviewers and journal editors and identify potential barriers and facilitators. Methods: Survey study among SR authors and journal editors informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Data were analysed with qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: In total, 22 journal editors and 65 researchers (of whom 37 were peer reviewers) took part in the survey. Almost all respondents (95%) were familiar with SR protocol registration and most researchers (81%) registered a protocol for at least one SR. Registration in PROSPERO and publication of a protocol were the most common methods for making SR protocols available. Four journal editors indicated that SR protocol registration was currently mandatory for publication within their journal. Moreover, 8 journal editors believed that SR protocol registration should be mandatory. Overall, researchers and journal editors had a positive attitude towards SR protocol registration. Also, they indicated that avoiding unnecessary SR duplication, as well as reducing publication and reporting bias, is important. A lack of time and finances, and fear of their research ideas being stolen, negatively impacted researchers to register their SR protocol. Journal editors also indicated lack of time and resources as well as multiple existing platforms for SR protocol records as barriers to employing SR protocol records during the editorial process. Both researchers and journal editors suggested a variety of ideas on how flexible SR protocol registration should be positioned. Conclusions: Researchers and journal editors had a positive attitude towards SR protocol registration. This study gives direction to several barriers that prevent SR protocol registration to be addressed in the future. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Integrating the Cochrane Review Methodology for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis into an online learning course for medical students](/colloquium-2023/session/1473641/integrating-the-cochrane-review-methodology-for-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analysis-into-an-online-learning-course-for-medical-students) Background: In terms of capacity building in evidence production, students of medicine are an ideal target group, as they are required to be up to date with current evidence and understand the process of evidence generation in their future line of work. Therefore, students of the medical faculty of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden have access to an online learning course for scientific methods, including the Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews. Objectives: Implementing and evaluating an online module on conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses according to the Cochrane methodology Methods: In accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, a series of short lectures on the purpose and types of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as on the necessary steps to conduct a systematic review was developed, recorded and supplemented by an online quiz on the inclusion of different study types depending on the research question. Additionally, the quiz covers questions relating to critical appraisal tools for different study types. The online learning module will allow for ad-hoc evaluation of the students' answers and provides feedback on why an answer is correct or not in order to foster a learning process. Usage statistics and results from a voluntary evaluation tool included within the course will be analyzed in order to assess students' preferred content and adjust the course accordingly. Results: The module content, student experiences, and usage statistics will be presented. Conclusions: In Germany, most medical students start working scientifically when conducting a dissertation (approximately 70%-80 %). Information and skills gained in curricular courses are not always readily accessible and opportunities for practical training in these methods are scarce within tightly packed curricula. Therefore, on-demand online information and training opportunities may be useful for supporting genuine scientific work by students. Conducting systematic reviews is central for conducting high-quality dissertations, especially in nonlaboratory but rather evidence-based medicine settings where reviews are instrumental in guideline development. The developed online module aims to support this process. [Predatory Publishing in Evidence Synthesis is everyone's problem](/colloquium-2023/session/1473628/predatory-publishing-in-evidence-synthesis-is-everyone's-problem) Background: Predatory publishing is a blemish on research and academia and employs dangerous practices that value profit over scientific reputation. Studies published within predatory journals contain information that may be more prone to error and misinformation. Therefore, their inclusion in evidence syntheses may be problematic and have a ripple effect throughout the translation of evidence in guideline development and clinical practice. Objectives: To explore the thoughts, opinions, and attitudes regarding the inclusion of studies from predatory journals in evidence synthesis. Methods: Focus groups were held with participants who were experienced evidence synthesisers from the JBI (formally Joanna Briggs Institute) Collaboration. Results: Participants within this study discussed the individual, structural, and methodological challenges of predatory publishing practices, and how these impact evidence synthesis. We found the insidious nature of predatory publishing practices affects not just the whole academic community, but also the general public by increasing mistrust through the legitimization of bad science. Evidence synthesisers within this study were challenged with the conduct and reporting in identifying and managing predatory journals, and the decision as to if these articles should be included within evidence synthesis. Furthermore, the 'publish or perish' mentality that is caused by organisational pressures to succeed in academia was seen as a potential driving factor in the perpetuation of predatory journals. Methodologically, for evidence synthesisers, the lack of current consensus on the management of studies from predatory journals regarding their inclusion within evidence synthesis remains problematic. Conclusions: Predatory publishing is everyone's problem. There is a need for further research, education, guidance, and clear processes to assist evidence synthesisers in the management of studies in predatory journals. However, this can only be achieved through consensus and an understanding of the individual and structural challenges endured by researchers when managing predatory publishing in the context of evidence synthesis. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. [Developing and piloting an adaptation of AMSTAR tool for systematic reviews of research priority setting exercises](/colloquium-2023/session/1473600/developing-and-piloting-an-adaptation-of-amstar-tool-for-systematic-reviews-of-research-priority-setting-exercises) Background: There is an increased number of systematic reviews of research priority setting exercises published. These reviews can be critical in informing future priority setting exercises and reduce unnecessary duplication of studies. However, these reviews have a range of qualities, and there is a need for an appropriate tool to appraise these studies. Objectives: To adapt the AMSTAR tool for appraisal of systematic reviews of research priority setting studies and pilot them for a group of systematic reviews identified as part of a previous publication (Tan 2022). Methods: From previous studies on evaluation of priority setting exercises (Nasser 2021), we identified key elements that might affect the AMSTAR tool and developed either adapted questions or adapted guidance to answer the questions. Afterwards, the tool was used to pilot the reviews of Tan 2022 review. Results: Although the original 16 items were maintained, the questions were adapted so that the research priority setting method, as opposed to the intervention, was the focus. Thirty-one studies were identified in Tan 2022 review that were evaluated using the AMSTAR tool. Only two reviews were assessed as low quality, and the remaining 29 reviews were assessed to be of critically low quality overall. Conclusions: Our adapted AMSTAR tool can be used to appraise systematic reviews of research priority setting exercises and differentiate their quality. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: There was no direct involvement; however, the work builds on methodological research focusing on patient involvement in research amongst other research. [Adherence of Cochrane reviews and protocols to the Cochrane's risk of bias 2.0 tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473597/adherence-of-cochrane-reviews-and-protocols-to-the-cochrane's-risk-of-bias-2.0-tool) Background: Assessing the risk of bias in individual studies is an important step when conducting a systematic review and key criteria for assessing the certainty of the body of evidence. Neglecting potential biases can directly impact the estimated effects of the intervention, lead to uncertain conclusions and undermine the basis for decision-making in clinical practice. In this setting, despite the improvement in the interpretation of bias and its influence on the randomized clinical trials results, Cochrane's risk of bias 2.0 tool (RoB 2.0) has a more complex structure than its original version, and there is a growing discussion around its applicability and usability, which seems to limit its wide adoption. Objectives: To identify the frequency of Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols using (or planning to use) the RoB 2.0. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis [2] conducted at Universidade Metropolitana de Santos (Unimes), Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in collaboration with the Evidence-Based Medicine Discipline, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Paulo (Unifesp), Brazil. Results: A total of 440 Cochrane systematic reviews and 53 protocols were analysed. Overall, 4.8% of the reviews and 28.5% of the protocols used or planned to use the RoB 2.0 tool. Although currently low, adherence is increasing over time. In 2019, no Cochrane review used RoB 2.0 tool compared with 24.1% in 2022. For Cochrane protocols, adherence increased from 6.9% in 2019 to 41.5% in 2022. A total of 274 (62.1%) Cochrane reviews had their protocols published before 2018; only one used the RoB 2.0 tool and reported the change of versions in the \"Differences between protocol and revision\" section. Conclusions: The Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool has low adherence among Cochrane protocols and systematic reviews. Additional efforts are needed to enhance the implementation of this tool. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The lack of standardization and competencies to use the RoB 2.0 tool may lead to flawed and/or unreliable conclusions from reviews, reducing its applicability and trustworthiness as a basis for decision-making.

[Evaluation of the performance of five deduplication tools](/colloquium-2023/session/1473585/evaluation-of-the-performance-of-five-deduplication-tools) Background: The removal of duplicate references from extensive systematic searches in different literature sources is a time-consuming and laborious process for authors of evidence syntheses. Different deduplication approaches are practiced by author teams, e.g., manual, semi-automated or fully automated using specialized software. These approaches vary in time-to-be-invested, completeness and accuracy of identified duplicates. Commonly used tools for a multi-step detection of duplicates are reference management programmes (e.g., EndNote, Citavi) and built-in deduplication features of systematic review software (e.g., Covidence, Rayyan). However, deduplication processes are not made transparent in all tools and are sometimes error-prone. Recently, developed deduplication tools such as Deduklick (fully automated) and the Systematic Review Accelerator (SRA) Deduplicator (automated, but needing manual control) use artificial intelligence-based algorithms, including natural language normalisation and sets-of-rules created by information specialists. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate and compare the performance, transparency, time efficiency and manageability of five frequently used manual, semi-automated and fully datasets from different bibliographic databases and trials registers, covering various healthcare topics and varying in size between 100 to 1200 records. We tested the five deduplication tools on each dataset and compared their ability to correctly identify duplicates, their transparency in the process, time efficiency and manageability. Results: The preliminary findings of this ongoing project showed that Deduklick and SRA Deduplicator achieved the best performance in detecting duplicates among all tools tested and compared to manual deduplication in EndNote by an experienced information specialist. The two tools delivered deduplication results in a transparent, downloadable report. Deduklick proved superior in time efficiency and manageability. Comparing Rayyan and Covidence, the latter achieved higher accuracy in identifying duplicates than Rayyan. Both tools provide reports of duplicates, but these were not downloadable in Covidence. In Rayyan a control of duplicate results is strongly recommended. At the conference, we will present further findings, advantages and disadvantages of the five deduplication tools. Conclusions: Our project's findings will help inform a more efficient conduct of evidence syntheses. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Because we present a methodological evaluation, patients or healthcare consumers were not involved. [Exploring incorporation of critical appraisal methods into rapid evidence reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473580/exploring-incorporation-of-critical-appraisal-methods-into-rapid-evidence-reviews) Background: Cedar Healthcare Technology Centre produces rapid evidence reviews across a range of topics and regularly evaluates the methods implemented to improve the usefulness of outputs. Rapid evidence reviews typically omit components of a full systematic review to streamline the process. Where a review has short timelines, Cedar has made pragmatic decisions around critical appraisal (CA), such as only one reviewer appraising evidence, or providing a summary of key issues using checklists as a guide. To increase the level of trust in the findings and align with best practice, full checklist-based CA of studies was incorporated into rapid evidence review processes. Objectives: To explore the feasibility of incorporating checklist-based CA of studies into rapid evidence review processes to inform clinical commissioning decisions. Improving the robustness of rapid evidence review methodology is important to patients as it means commissioning decisions are based on the best available evidence. Methods: Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) CA checklists were used to assess the quality of studies for two rapid evidence reviews produced in November 2022 and February 2023. CA was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. The appraisal checklists were summarised and included as an appendix to the review. A narrative summary of the CA results was included in the main body of the report. Results: The inclusion of CA of all studies included in a rapid evidence review was an achievable task. However, it required additional resourcing and led to an increase in time to complete the review. Specifically, time was required to perform CA in duplicate, consider interpretation of checklist questions, discuss discrepancies, and narratively summarise the results. Conclusions: Including CA for studies included in a rapid evidence review is a valuable exercise to inform the reader of the quality of the evidence. Consequently, this can inform how trustworthy the evidence is and guide interpretation of the evidence to better inform clinical commissioning decisions. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Healthcare consumers positively received inclusion of full checklist-based CA results, particularly where limited evidence existed on a topic, and considered it informative for making clinical commissioning decisions. [Discrepancies in effect estimates of randomized clinical trials between low/middle-income and high-income countries: A meta-research Background: The effect estimates from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may vary across countries owing to genetic or economic differences. However, previous studies suggested that RCTs conducted in low/middle-income countries might be systematically different from those conducted in high-income countries. Objectives: To estimate the discrepancies in effect estimates of RCTs between low/middle-income and high-income countries. We hypothesize that RCTs conducted in low/middle-income countries (LM-RCTs) produced larger effect estimates than those conducted in high-income countries (H-RCTs). Methods: We screened Cochrane reviews for eligible meta-analyses that assessed the efficacy of interventions and produced statistically significant results. The RCTs using superiority design in eligible meta-analyses were classified as LM-RCTs or H-RCTs based on the location of recruiting centers. In each meta-analysis, LM-RCTs were included in the exposed group, while H-RCTs were in the control group. The main outcome was the ratio of risk ratio (RRR), hazard ratio (RHR), or odds ratio (ROR, with OR transformed from standardized mean difference) between LM-RCTs and H-RCTs. RRRs, RHRs, and RORs were pooled to form a single estimate using random-effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian-Laird method). Potential confounders and effect modifiers were assessed in a linear mixed-effect regression model. We planned to include 100 eligible meta-analyses. Results: This was an interim analysis. We identified 48 meta-analyses from 4,763 Cochrane reviews. A total of 516 RCTs were included, consisting of 341 H-RCTs and 175 LM-RCTs. Among meta-analyses using OR (transformed from SMD), RR, and HR as the effect measure, LM-RCTs produced an effect estimate 1.75 (1.29-2.29, I2=87.3%), 1.21 and 1.14 than H-RCTs, respectively. On average, LM-RCTs produced an effect estimate 1.37 CI: 1.25-1.54, I2=80.2%) times greater than H-RCTs. Conclusions: produced an effect size 37% higher than H-RCTs, implying the impact of potential biases. Such discrepancies should be considered when conducting and interpreting the results of systematic reviews. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients, the public, and/or healthcare consumers were not involved in this study. [What determinants of public health research activity contextualise embedded researcher roles? A qualitative investigation in English local government](/colloquium-2023/session/1473568/what-determinants-of-public-health-research-activity-contextualise-embedded-researcher-roles-a-qualitative-investigation-in-english-local-government) Background: Embedded researchers are a novel intervention to improve the translation of research evidence into policy and practice settings, including public health. These roles are being implemented with increasing popularity, but they often lack clear theories of change and evaluative frameworks. Understanding initial levels of research activity within public health settings, including associated barriers and opportunities, is essential to shaping these roles and defining expectations. Objectives: We aimed to i) explore the principal determinants of research activity in public health that contextualise embedded researcher roles and ii) identify the attributes of embedded researchers that are needed to influence this activity. Methods: We undertook 17 semi-structured interviews with embedded researchers in diverse public health settings in the English local government. These roles were part of a Clinical Research Network funded programme to enhance public health research cultures in local authorities. An inductive thematic analysis approach was applied. Results: Research activity varied substantially across local government settings, and rising funding inequities were discussed. Research and interpersonal skills, as well as pre-existing connections and experience within local government, were primary valued attributes for embedded researchers. Resource deficiencies (funding, time and infrastructure) were primary barriers to research activity. A strong local appetite for research presented a primary opportunity. However, perceptions of what constituted \"research\" varied across public health teams, and there was a hesitancy to engage in research activity due to concerns that involvement would be highly resource-intensive. Conclusions: A wide variety of determinants of research activity were identified as relevant to embedded researcher roles in public health settings. Involving embedded researchers in the process of investigating these determinants in a local context could provide an opportunity to build trust with colleagues and enhance local buy-in. Our results provide initial guidance for investigating the research context within local government, an essential step in the evidence-informed design of embedded researcher interventions. If effectively implemented, embedded researchers can enhance research activity and thus improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This research was informed by an advisory group consisting of diverse representatives from academia and public health practice settings. [Cochrane South Africa training - does it work to increase knowledge and skills in evidence-based healthcare?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473540/cochrane-south-africa-training---does-it-work-to-increase-knowledge-and-skills-in-evidence-based-healthcare) Background: A key function of Cochrane South Africa (SA) includes building the capacity of stakeholders to conduct reviews, use review evidence to inform healthcare decisions, and raise awareness about the importance of evidence-based healthcare. In 2021, we launched a project to formally evaluate our training. Objectives: To evaluate training delivered by Cochrane SA across four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and impact. Methods: We followed the Kirkpatrick model for evaluating training effectiveness, using a mixed-methods study design (Table 1). To assess reactions to the training, and changes in knowledge and behavior, participants completed online questionnaires at different timepoints: immediately after every event for reaction to training; immediately before and after selected events for learning; and for behavior change, participants completed an adapted version of the evidence-based practice questionnaire before and 3 months after selected events. To assess impact, or the use of knowledge in practice, we interviewed participants of selected events 6 and 12 months after the event. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data using thematic analysis. Results: We hosted 18 training events including 1,027 participants from November 2021 to December 2022, including webinars, a protocol development course, and a primer in systematic reviews (Tables 2 and 3). Regarding reaction to training, participants' feedback was overall positive (Figures 1 and 2). Only 223/1,027 participants completed evaluation forms; response rates from the monthly webinars were poorer compared with those from the smaller workshops. Changes in knowledge were assessed for two events, changes in behavior for one event, and impact for two events; the results for these will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: The Training Evaluation project is helping us refine and improve the planning, delivery, and impact of the training Cochrane SA delivers. Challenges include the poor response rate and the lack of dedicated resources for implementing the evaluation more efficiently. Knowing the impact of our training will help us understand what the return on investment is, as planning and delivering training is resource intensive. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our training may contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making in Africa. This would be beneficial for patients and other stakeholders. [Difference between scoping reviews and mapping reviews in the evidence ecosystem](/colloquium-2023/session/1473533/difference-between-scoping-reviews-and-mapping-reviews-in-the-evidence-ecosystem) Background: Scoping and mapping reviews are increasingly used by researchers. Objectives: The aim of this presentation is to outline the main difference between these types of evidence synthesis to improve their conduct and reporting. Methods: Analysis of the differences between mapping reviews and scoping reviews was undertaken to provide clear guidance to the evidence synthesis community with examples from the published literature. The methods for scoping reviews will be based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guide to scoping reviews, whereas the methods for mapping reviews will be based on the Campbell Collaboration guidance. Results: Several differences exist between the methodologies, and these are in their protocol development, scope, inclusion criteria, data extraction, reporting, and use. Mapping reviews are mainly driven by questions of effectiveness of a particular intervention and, therefore, they use the Participant Intervention Comparator Outcome Study type format similar to systematic reviews of effectiveness. Scoping reviews mostly use the Participant, context, concept (PCC) format, where they map a concept of interest relevant to a particular population in a specific setting and context. The results of the mapping reviews can be used inform research priorities and research funding, whereas scoping review results may be used to inform policy development by clarifying key concepts and methods and further research. Conclusions: We recommend that authors who are planning to undertake scoping reviews confirm that their research question can be appropriately answered using a scoping review methodology; however, for broader research questions without the need for an in-depth analysis of the information, we recommend that authors consider the appropriate methods guidance and reporting standards. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not relevant. [Establishments of the Cochrane India Network: Sharing initial experiences](/colloquium-2023/session/1473522/establishments-of-the-cochrane-india-network-sharing-initial-experiences) Background: Cochrane is a global, independent network with members and supporters worldwide. There are official geographic Cochrane Groups in 50+ countries. Moving away from the single centre approach in India, a Cochrane India Network (CIN) was set up in 2021 with nine Affiliate Centers across India. Objectives: To promote Cochrane and its work in India, to support and develop the community of Cochrane members and to disseminate Cochrane systematic reviews locally based on stakeholder network, the media and other communication channels. Methods: A Cochrane India Network planning meeting was conducted on February 20 to 21, 2020, in New Delhi. Nine affiliate centres of the CIN were announced in 2021 (https://india.cochrane.org/). An introductory meeting of the Network was held on April 14, 2021, with formal introduction of the teams of the network, introduction to the strategic plans and modalities of functioning. Formal inauguration of the CIN took place on November 26, 2021, with participation of members from the Cochrane, World Health Organization (WHO), Government of India and the director general (DG) of the Indian Council of MedicaI Research (ICMR). Each of the nine affiliates has formalized a memorandum of understanding with Cochrane. Results: Regular meetings with the Cochrane Central Executive members are held to discuss the procedures and activities of the network. On average, four workshops were organized by the nine affiliates, and 50 participants sensitized and trained in each. The ICMR Affiliate has conducted four workshops on protocol development and writing systematic reviews in hybrid mode. An annual meeting of the CIN was organized by Shiksha 'O' Anusandhan (SOA) at Bhubaneswar. Participating affiliate directors presented the activities of their affiliates. The ICMR Cochrane Affiliate was entrusted to coordinate 18 systematic reviews on priority questions of 'NITI Aayog'. A total of 28 systematic reviews to provide answers to existing knowledge gaps in Government's 'Anemia Mukt Bharat' program have been initiated. Collaborative work with Campbell South Asia has been initiated. Conclusions:As a result of above efforts the pool of systematic Reviewers in India is steadily increasing. The robust evidence generated through the SRs would guide the national programs for better health care decision making. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement:CIN is increasing the use of Cochrane's evidence in knowledge translation and policy making activities in India that will reflect in better patient care. [Developing an Evidence-based Questionnaire and Evaluating Health Information Literacy for Chinese Residents](/colloquium-2023/session/1473508/developing-an-evidence-based-questionnaire-and-evaluating-health-information-literacy-for-chinese-residents) Background: Health information literacy is the ability of people to obtain, understand, screen, and apply health information. There is no investigation into how Chinese residents understand and use evidence. Objectives: To develop the Health Information Literacy of Chinese Residents during COVID-19 Questionnaire based on evidence, measure its reliability and validity, and investigate the level of health information literacy for Chinese residents. Methods: The development process of the questionnaire included the determination of questionnaire items, expert consultation, and validation. According to the National Residents Health Literacy Monitoring Questionnaire (2020) and the 2019 Informed Health Choices key concepts, the researchers drafted the questionnaire including all four dimensions of health information literacy. This was followed by several rounds of discussions by the working group. Experts in relevant fields were then invited to evaluate the draft questionnaire, and revisions were made. The reliability and validity of the finalized version were examined in Gansu Province, China. The method of stratified, multi-stage, simple random, and proportional probability sampling was adopted in the formal investigation. If the score was higher than 80% (more than 11 correct answers), we believe it had health information literacy. Results: The research team preliminarily formulated 14 items encompassing the four dimensions of health information literacy. After consulting 28 experts in relevant fields, modifications were made. A convenience sample of 185 Chinese residents was invited to validate the questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency was 0.715, and the test-retest intra-class correlation coefficient after 2 weeks was 0.906, suggesting that the questionnaire content and measurement structure were relatively stable. A total of 2446 questionnaires were collected. After removing 86 invalid and unqualified questionnaires, the effective rate of the questionnaire was 96.48%. Only one-quarter of people have health information literacy and have knowledge of understanding and using evidence. Conclusions: The number and speed of evidence production are increasing currently, but there is a huge gap between the public's understanding and use of evidence and the production of evidence. Therefore, we not only need to produce high-quality evidence but also help the public with evidence-informed choices. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Public involvement. [Information and promotional strategies by pharmaceutical companies for clinicians](/colloquium-2023/session/1473505/information-and-promotional-strategies-by-pharmaceutical-companies-for-clinicians) Background: Medicines have an important role in the treatment of many health conditions. Interventions to improve medicine use aim to maximize potential benefits and minimise the potential for harm. Pharmaceutical product promotion frequently reflects the tension between commercial and health priorities, as promoted medicines do not always represent advances in patient care and may introduce risk of harm. The extent and types of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and prescribers has expanded, with regulatory standards not fully reflecting all current promotional activities. Objectives: To assess the effects of pharmaceutical industry promotional interactions with prescribers on the quality, quantity, cost of prescribed medicines, and on formulary requests. Methods: Multiple study designs were eligible for this Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) review, including the following: randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies. Included studies had to have a measure of pharmaceutical industry interaction with clinicians, either individually or as part of a group, and of clinicians' prescribing (appropriateness, quantity and/or cost). Types of interactions were grouped as either direct receipt of information or gifts and payments, including free samples, from pharmaceutical companies. Results: Of 11,758 identified records, 69 studies met our inclusion criteria, including the following: 3 RCTs, 4 interrupted time series, 12 controlled cohort studies, 7 controlled before-after studies, 1 case-control study, and 42 cross-sectional studies, 30 of which use United States Open Payments data. A total of 19 of these studies examined effects on prescribing appropriateness, 37 on quantity, 25 on costs, and 1 on formulary requests. Types of interactions mainly included gifts/payments, free samples, and information from sales representatives. Several studies showed a dose-response relationship between payment amounts, including numbers of meals provided, and prescribing outcomes. In addition, eight studies examined the effects of conflict-of-interest policies or other restrictions on clinicians' interactions with industry. Conclusions: The evidence base includes a range of study designs with differing risks of bias. This variety of designs creates challenges in interpreting the evidence. However, these challenges are common to reviews of public health interventions in which interventions cannot be easily assessed through randomised trials. Final results will be presented. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Methods for conducting a living evidence profile on mpox: an evidence map of the literature](/colloquium-2023/session/1473500/methods-for-conducting-a-living-evidence-profile-on-mpox-an-evidence-map-of-the-literature) Background: The mpox (formerly monkeypox) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022, by the World Health Organization after outbreaks were identified in several non-endemic countries. Mpox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes mild to severe disease in humans, including a pox rash and lymphadenopathy that can cause severe pain and discomfort. During the outbreak, there was an urgent need to have up-to-date evidence on mpox to inform public health decision-making. Objectives: Develop and maintain a living evidence profile (LEP) on mpox literature during the 2022 outbreak. Methods: A LEP was prioritized to systematically identify, classify, and synthesize new literature to provide updated evidence on epidemiological parameters including transmissibility, clinical outcomes, and protective immunity on mpox. A comprehensive search in Pubmed, Scopus, Europe PubMed Central (PMC), and grey literature sources was conducted twice weekly. Primary evidence on mpox from January 2022 onward was included. Study selection and data extraction were conducted by one reviewer and spot checked by a senior reviewer. Results were synthesized descriptively, and a confidence level was reported for each outcome. Case reports without new information and historical evidence were included in an accessible dataset, but not the LEP. Results: The LEP framework was established based on principles of risk assessment, epidemiological parameters for infectious disease modelling, and consultation with experts. Between June 1 and December 15, 2022, a continuous cycle of literature searches and data extraction were fed into 23 weekly LEPs that were disseminated to global health organizations. As of December 15, 2022, there were 2287 articles on mpox; 687 were primary research studies or surveillance reports on the 2022 outbreak, and 496 were included in the profile. The presentation will highlight key features of the mpox LEP, which mapped evidence to 33 different outcomes and topic areas. Conclusions: This new evidence synthesis framework employed during the 2022 mpox outbreak describes a way to systematically identify and organize emerging evidence to inform what is known and highlight knowledge gaps for decision-making during a public health emergency. Patient involvement: The LEP contributes to methods that result in comprehensive up-to-date evidence for patients. [Exploring the characteristics, reporting, and methods of systematic reviews including time-to-event meta-analyses and outcome analyses: A meta-epidemiological review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473497/exploring-the-characteristics-reporting-and-methods-of-systematic-reviews-including-time-to-event-meta-analyses-and-outcome-analyses-a-meta-epidemiological-review) Background: Time-to-event meta-analyses are complex and often suffer from often inadequate reporting in trial publications. Objectives: We examined the characteristics, reporting and methods of Cochrane, and non-Cochrane systematic reviews, including time-to-event meta-analyses based on aggregate data. Methods: Based on an a-priori published protocol, we included aggregate data systematic reviews with at least one pairwise meta-analysis based on the hazard ratio without further restriction. The 50 most recent Cochrane reviews corresponding to our eligibility criteria up to 08/2020 were identified in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. A systematic search then identified a corresponding random sample (n=50) of systematic reviews from Core Clinical Journals (Medline; 08/02/2021) from the same timeframe (02/2017 - 08/2020). For each review and each meta-analyzed time-to-event outcome, we extracted data on general characteristics, included outcome definitions, general and time-to-event specific methods, and handling of specific randomized trial characteristics with relevance to time-to-event analysis. Review selection and data-extraction took place in duplicate and was based on a priori developed sheets. Results: The 100 included reviews analyzed 217 individual time-to-event outcomes (median: 2; interquartile range: overall mortality (41%; 89/217). Less than half of all time-to-event outcomes were clearly defined (48%; 104/217). Few reviews specified general methods, e.g., the types of included analysis (intention-to-treat, per protocol) (35%; 35/100) or the adjustment of eligible effect estimates (12%; 12/100). Sources of time-to-event summary data differed substantially in number and complexity between reviews. The most prominent data sources were directly reported trial hazard ratios (64%; 64/100) and reference to established guidance without further specification (46%; 46/100). Study characteristics with particular relevance to time-to-event analysis, e.g., variable follow-up, informative censoring, proportional hazards, were seldomly included in additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity analyses) and seldomly discussed throughout the reviews. Reporting among Cochrane reviews appeared more comprehensive in most of our assessed items. Conclusions: The reporting of current systematic reviews, including time to event meta-analyses, appears inconsistent and often inadequate. Reporting standards for such reviews are required. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Clinical trials publication rate in Spain: how far have we come?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473489/clinical-trials-publication-rate-in-spain-how-far-have-we-come) Background: Publication bias is a highly complex and common problem in the area of clinical research. Its adverse consequences range from the waste of resources to the unnecessary duplication of studies and the distortion of the public perception about the benefits and harms of treatments which can ultimately lead to wrong clinical and health care decisions. Data based on previous research suggest the mean rate of publication of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is around 50%, although there has been a trend towards improvement in recent years. Objectives: To assess the publication rate of RCTs in the area of cancer authorized by the AEMPS. Methods: We performed an observational study consisting of a cohort of RCT records with a 9-year follow-up period. We identified all the RCTs authorized by the AEMPS in 2013 corresponding to the therapeutic area of cancer from the Spanish Registry of Clinical Studies (REec). We identified the corresponding publications from the same registry, clinicaltrials.gov registry, through formal searches in Pubmed and, ultimately, through the Google meta-search engine. Results: A total of 215 RCTs were identified. Of these, 129 (60.0%) were published and 86 (40.0%) were not. About 87.9% have also been registered at clinicaltrials.gov. The median size was 181 (IQR 82-450). International multicentre (86.5%), phase II (39.5%), or phase III (38.1%) studies, with a commercial sponsor (84.7%), predominated. The main outcome most studied was progression-free survival (27.0%). The multicentric character (mainly international) was positively associated with the publication of the study (p-value = 0.014), as was the size of the study (p-value < 0.014). Conclusions: Although there has been a slight increase in the publication rate in Spain over the past decade, there is still much room for improvement. It is mandatory that all actors involved in research be more proactive in order to ensure compliance with current legislation and ethical codes that require full publication and dissemination of results. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: A PhD student was involved. [How much confidence to put on health systems reviews?: a comparative assessment using AMSTAR-2 and ROBIS](/colloquium-2023/session/1473487/how-much-confidence-to-put-on-health-systems-reviews-a-comparative-assessment-using-amstar-2-and-robis) Background: Systematic reviews could inform about the impact of different health systems' arrangements on processes of care and patients' health outcomes. As for any type of evidence, users should make judgments about how much confidence to place in their findings. AMSTAR (Assessment Methodological quality of SysTemAtic Reviews) is a tool for assessing the methodological quality of reviews. An updated version\u2014AMSTAR-2\u2014was developed in response to some limitations of the original tool. ROBIS (Risk Of Bias In Systematic reviews) was recently developed to assess risk of bias (RoB) in reviews. They have not been compared in assessing health systems reviews. Objectives: To compare two tools to assess how much confidence to place in the findings of health systems reviews. Methods: In preparing four overviews assessing different health systems arrangements, we previously identified 124 reviews. We assessed a random sample of them using AMSTAR-2 and ROBIS. We converted the AMSTAR-2 overall confidence ratings and the ROBIS overall RoB ratings into numerical values. We calculated a mean score across the raters for each review for each tool and used them to calculate Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs). Additionally, we compared the concordance in the overall categorical ratings on confidence and RoB. Results: Twenty-eight reviews were assessed by at least two raters with each tool. AMSTAR-2's overall confidence ratings were strongly correlated with ROBIS's overall ratings. The rs between both tools was 0.71 (p=0.000023). Regarding the concordance between overall categorical ratings, the 11 reviews assessed with moderate/high confidence by AMSTAR-2 were also assessed with low RoB by ROBIS. However, 8 out of 14 reviews assessed with low/critically low confidence by AMSTAR-2 were assessed with low RoB by ROBIS. Conclusions: The tools showed correlation in the overall numerical scores, but there was not clear concordance between their overall categorical assessments, especially in the group of reviews with more limitations. More work is needed to disentangle the relationship between the tools currently available to assess reviews. Patient and healthcare consumer relevance: Making judgments about how much confidence to place in reviews' findings is key to informing decisions with a potential high impact on patients' health. [Meta-analyses of trials with low and high risk of bias in the randomisation domain may yield substantially different results](/colloquium-2023/session/1473483/meta-analyses-of-trials-with-low-and-high-risk-of-bias-in-the-randomisation-domain-may-yield-substantially-different-results) Background: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) imply random allocation of participants to an intervention or a control group. When assessing risk of bias according to the Cochrane tool, the randomisation domain is crucial and may separate RCTs into low and high risk of bias. Objectives: To compare meta-analyses of RCTs with low and high risk of bias in the randomisation domain. Methods: A systematic review was performed within a health technology assessment (HTA) evaluating the effects of progesterone (Intervention) versus placebo (Comparison) in singleton pregnancies (Participants) regarding the Outcomes preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks) and neonatal mortality (<28 days). Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Library, and 27 RCTs fulfilled this PICO. The RCTs were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and pooled in meta-analyses using random effects models. The meta-analyses were performed separately for RCTs with low and high risk of bias in the randomisation domain, the former defined as low risk of bias regarding both randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment and the latter as (unclear or) high risk of bias in at least one of these. Results: Meta-analyses of 14 RCTs with low risk of bias, compared with 12 RCTs with high risk of bias, showed a smaller reduction in the risk ratio of preterm birth: 0.82 (95% CI 0.71; 0.95) versus risk differences were -6.6 (-11; -2.3) versus -20 (-29; -10) percentage points. Regarding neonatal mortality, the pooled risk ratios in low- and high-risk-of-bias RCTs (n=12 and n=4, respectively) were 0.60 (0.39; 0.92) versus 0.28 (0.07; 1.20). The pooled risk differences were -0.7 (-1.7; 0.4) versus -11 (-25; 3.0) percentage points. Conclusions: Meta-analyses of RCTs with low and high risk of bias in the randomisation domain yielded substantially different results. The two included aspects, randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment, may bias the results considerably. RCTs with high risk of bias in the randomisation domain seem to overestimate efficacy and thus may not be appropriate for drawing conclusions in systematic reviews. Patient involvement: A patient representative was involved in choosing outcomes. [Assessing the quality and completeness of health system guidelines and recommendations for pandemics using the AGREE-HS tool](/colloquium-2023/session/1473481/assessing-the-quality-and-completeness-of-health-system-guidelines-and-recommendations-for-pandemics-using-the-agree-hs-tool) Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared two global disease outbreaks in the 21st century as pandemics: H1N1 in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2019. Although numerous studies assessed the effectiveness of healthcare-system level strategies and interventions for pandemics, there is a lack of studies on the quality and completeness of guidelines and recommendations for implementing such strategies and interventions, as most have focused on clinical treatments rather than health-system strategies. Objectives: We aim to assess the completeness and quality of healthcare system guidelines and recommendations for the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics issued by the WHO, European Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We retrieved guidelines and recommendations from the WHO, ECDC, and CDC repositories, their website sections dedicated to the H1N1 pandemic, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee. Following deduplication, we conducted a title/abstract screening, followed by a full-text screening (Figure 1). The inclusion/exclusion criteria were informed by the AGREE-HS tool (Table 1). The main study outcome will be each document's overall score (range = 20-140) calculated by summing scores from four assessors on the AGREE-HS tool. Secondary outcomes will be the final scores of each item (calculated by summing up each appraiser's scores for each item) and word clusters (topics) extracted using an automated qualitative analysis (topic modeling) from the assessors' comments on the items. Preliminary results: After deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text screening, we included 197 documents in the analysis (Table 2). Fewer health systems guidance documents were issued during the H1N1 pandemic (n = 34) than the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 163). We are currently piloting the AGREE-HS assessment and will present the results at the Colloquium. Conclusions: We expect that our study will improve our understanding of health system guidance development processes in three globally relevant organizations and give insight into possible improvements. Relevance for patients: The study will give patients a better insight into health system guidance development processes, enhancing their understanding of how evidence is implemented in decision-making, which affects them as end users. [Keeping non-English Cochrane evidence dissemination products up to date](/colloquium-2023/session/1473836/keeping-non-english-cochrane-evidence-dissemination-products-up-to-date) Background: Cochrane Belgium disseminates results of Cochrane reviews to Belgian healthcare professionals and patients in their native languages; for example, Cochrane Corners translated summaries of Cochrane reviews. They were originally published in professional journals, but also disseminated via ebpracticenet, which is a website with trustworthy information for healthcare professionals. Moreover, we spearhead the Cochrane Wikipedia-project in Dutch. Our goal is to always provide the right evidence at the right time in the right format. The question remains, however, what needs to be done with evidence dissemination products on websites as reviews get updated. Objectives: To assess how many of the reviews used in Cochrane Corners have been updated since we disseminated them via ebpracticenet.be. To draft a procedure to ensure Belgian evidence dissemination products are kept up to date. Methods: We assessed how many Cochrane reviews were updated since the Cochrane Corner was disseminated. We distinguished 3 types of updates: 1. updated search but no new studies found, 2. updated search and new studies included but with the same conclusion, 3. updates with a change of conclusion. Results: We disseminated 108 Cochrane Corners via ebpracticenet. The source reviews from 25 Corners were updated since they were published. Six updates concerned an updated search only; 12 resulted in the identification of new studies but without changing the conclusions, but 7 updates resulted in a different conclusion. We are currently developing ideas and procedures to update our evidence dissemination products in a timely fashion. This might include taking down some products, adding new evidence in banners to existing products, or developing entirely new products. Additionally, we aim to make even more review evidence available, but this also increases the amount of information that will enter into the update cycle. Conclusions: Ensuring evidence dissemination products are relevant and up to date is of crucial importance to both healthcare professionals as well as patients. Therefore, such products based on Cochrane reviews with a changed conclusion need to be amended as soon as possible. An efficient and easy-to-use system to check for updated reviews should be made available to those disseminating them in languages other than English. [The economics of healthcare access in developing countries: A scoping review on the economic impact of healthcare access for urban populations](/colloquium-2023/session/1652059/the-economics-of-healthcare-access-in-developing-countries-a-scoping-review-on-the-economic-impact-of-healthcare-access-for-urban-populations) Background: The growing urban population imposes additional challenges for health systems in developing countries. The lack of good quality public services and reliance on the private sector can result in catastrophic health expenditures (CHE). Objectives: To document the economic impact of access to care and to identify inequalities in healthcare expenditures and CHE across urban populations. Methods:This scoping review presents a narrative synthesis of cost studies conducted in urban areas. We categorised studies as conducted only in slums, city-wide studies with measures of wealth and slums and non-slums studies. The definitions of slums used in the studies were mapped against the 2018 UN-Habitat definition. We calculated the costs of accessing health care, concentration curves, index and incidence of CHE of acute, chronic and unspecified health conditions. We developed an evidence map to identify research gaps in the domains of the total number of studies, health interests and country. The review had a strong capacity strengthening element and all reviewers completed the Cochrane interactive learning modules on systematic reviews. Results: We identified 64 studies for inclusion, the majority from South-East Asia (59%) and classified as city-wide (58%). None of the definitions of slums used covered all characteristics proposed by UN-Habitat. We found severe economic burden across health conditions, wealth quintiles and study types. Compared with city-wide studies, slum studies reported higher direct costs of accessing health care for acute conditions and lower costs for chronic and unspecified health conditions. Healthcare expenditures for chronic conditions were highest amongst the richest wealth quintiles for slum studies and more equally distributed across all wealth quintiles for city-wide studies. The incidence of CHE was similar across all wealth quintiles in slum studies and concentrated among the poorest residents in city-wide studies. Conclusions: Our findings indicated severe, but different patterns of the economic burden of accessing healthcare for slum dwellers and residents across cities. Financial protection schemes must consider the complexity of healthcare provision in the urban context. Further research is needed to understand inequities in healthcare expenditure in rapidly expanding and evolving cities in developing countries. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: not applicable. [Outcome sets in surgical Cochrane Reviews: suggestions for next steps](/colloquium-2023/session/1686671/outcome-sets-in-surgical-cochrane-reviews-suggestions-for-next-steps) Background: Surgery plays a vital role in clinical treatment and is increasingly needed worldwide. The selection of appropriate outcomes is crucial for Cochrane Reviews to determine surgical intervention effectiveness and safety. One way to achieve this could be through the adoption of core outcome sets (COS). Previous study suggested that approximately 10% of Cochrane Reviews of interventions use COS to help inform their choice of outcomes. However, this is unclear in the area of surgery. Objectives: The overall aim of this study is to evaluation the outcome selection and measurement in Cochrane Reviews testing surgical interventions. The specific objectives are to analyse a sample of surgical Cochrane Reviews in order to: (1) Identify how the outcomes are determined; (2) Identify the number of different types of outcomes and outcome measures reported; (3) Identify variations in outcome between full-texts and pre-protocols; (4) Identify how frequency a COS is used as a basis for defining outcomes in the methods or in the 'Summary of findings' table. Methods: Published surgical Cochrane Reviews addressing any topic and published by any Cochrane Review Group will be eligible for inclusion by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2023. We will also identify Cochrane Reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. A random sampling selection process will be performed to identify 100 eligible Reviews representative of the literature. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess full-texts, and extract data relevant to our Objectives from included Reviews. Results: The results will be presented at the Colloquium. Conclusions: The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions explicitly indicates that reviews should address outcomes that are critical or important to consumers, and established sets of core outcomes should be used (where available). We hope this study will improve the awareness among authors of surgical Cochrane Reviews of a more scientific outcome sets, and facilitate greater involvement of systematic reviewers in the development and implementation of core outcome sets in the area of surgery.

[Facilitating optimized decision-making using a knowledge user driven synthesis approach in a scoping review of social frailty interventions](/colloquium-2023/session/1652055/facilitating-optimized-decision-making-using-a-knowledge-user-driven-synthesis-approach-in-a-scoping-review-of-social-frailty-interventions) Background: Knowledge syntheses are foundational to knowledge translation, but their results are not always represented or intentionally synthesized for optimized knowledge uptake or to support healthcare decision-making. As such, we conducted a scoping review to identify social frailty interventions that have the best potential to help older adults during difficult situations requiring further isolation (e.g., COVID-19, flu), and to determine how the results of this scoping review could best be synthesized and organized to support rapid and optimized decision-making of healthcare professionals. Objectives: To use a knowledge user decision-making driven approach to synthesizing and representing results of a scoping review of social frailty interventions. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, COVID-19 databases and grey literature were comprehensively searched for social frailty terms and its related concepts (e.g., social isolation, social vulnerability, loneliness). Experienced reviewer pairs screened titles and abstracts and full text articles in duplicate. Data abstraction involved an auditing process whereby one reviewer abstracted data and a second reviewer checked for accuracy and consistency. Data was analyzed thematically guided by a social frailty conceptual model. Data synthesis involved organizing the data by social frailty intervention type, considering only those that had the best potential for impact. We created and presented a knowledge product (synthesis table) to our knowledge users in a modified Delphi procedure to help them decide which intervention could be considered to help socially frail older adults during difficult situations. Results: 112 articles containing 170 interventions were included representing three main intervention categories: (1) social behaviours and activities (n=47), (2) social resources (n=64), (3) self-management (n=59). Data synthesis identified self-management interventions as having the most promise for reducing social frailty related outcomes in older adults, which informed the knowledge product for our knowledge users (clinicians, researchers, patients). Conclusions: The resulting knowledge product facilitated swift decision-making, which is a technique that may be ideal for use in rapid reviews where making quick decisions is the priority. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: An integrated knowledge translation team involving researchers, clinicians and patients helped define the scoping review objectives, eligibility criteria, methods, and interpretation of findings. [Competency profiles for Evidence-Informed Policy (EIPM): a rapid review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473714/competency-profiles-for-evidence-informed-policy-eipm-a-rapid-review) Background: Evidence-Informed Policy-making (EIPM) requires a set of individual and organizational capabilities, articulated with background factors and needs. The identification of essential Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes for EIPM can support the formulation of competency profiles and their application in different contexts. Objectives: To identify elements of competency (Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes) for EIPM according to different professional profiles. Methods: Rapid review. A structured search was led and was later updated in two comprehensive repositories (BVSalud and PubMed). Review studies with different designs, published from 2010 onwards, and without language restriction were included. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies was not performed. A meta-aggregative narrative synthesis consolidated the findings. Results: Ten reviews were included. Eight elements were categorized as Knowledge, nineteen as Skills and ten as Attitudes, totaling 37 elements of competency. These elements were aggregated into four competency profiles (Researcher, Health Professional, Decision-maker and Citizen). The competency profiles included different sets of EIPM-related Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes. Conclusions: This study is innovative because it aggregates different profiles of competency and uses a practical perspective, favoring the application of its results in different contexts, to support EIPM. Methodological limitations are related to the shortcuts adopted in this review, especially because it does not include complementary searches of the gray literature and does not carry out, in duplicate, the stages of study selection and data extraction. These findings are valuable for discussion and planning how evidence producers and users could be engaged to promote EIPM and to support the health decision-making using trustworthy information. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This rapid review addresses competency profiles that include different types of decision makers: health policy and systems decision-makers, health professionals, researchers and members of organized civil society. [Practical implications of assessing the risk of bias in a Cochrane review with alternative tools](/colloquium-2023/session/1473709/practical-implications-of-assessing-the-risk-of-bias-in-a-cochrane-review-with-alternative-tools) Background: In 2008, Cochrane released the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool. A revised version for randomized trials (RoB 2) that seeks to address different concerns is being tested since 2019. Objectives: To compare the performance of RoB vs RoB 2 tools when applied to the same Cochrane review, analyzing differences in the assessment results in both individual domains and overall risk of bias. Methods: An ongoing Cochrane review entitled 'Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease', whose protocol was published in 2019 (CD008564), was included for the RoB 2 tool pilot. Once finished with the main assessment, the risk of bias was again rated using the RoB tool. Any discrepancy on randomization, deviations-from-intended-interventions/blinding, missing/incomplete outcome data, reported result and overall bias, was noted and interpreted. The 'Outcome Measurement' domain was only estimated with the RoB 2 tool. Results: Six randomized trials (AASK, ACCORD, HOT, MDRD, SPRINT, SPS3) were included in the review. According to the RoB 2 tool, the bias assessment by domain was judged as follows: 'Randomization' [Low risk, 6 studies]; 'Deviations from intended concerns [Some 5 studies; High risk, 1 study] (Table 1). When RoB was used, a similar judgement was reached on Randomization, missing/incomplete outcome data, and reported result. On the contrary, blinding of participants/clinicians was judged as high risk for all studies, which subsequently led to high risk for all trials in the 'Overall bias' assessment (Table 2). Conclusions: In the Cochrane review under consideration, RoB 2 led to a downplayed overall risk of bias compared to the RoB tool, mainly due to the fact that less emphasis is placed on blinding in the RoB 2 tool. Further research is needed on the practical implications of moving to another risk-of-bias tool, which is closely linked to how the certainty of evidence will be graded in the future. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Supporting evidence-based judicial decisions in Brazil: a case study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473702/supporting-evidence-based-judicial-decisions-in-brazil-a-case-study) Background: Judicial demands related to healthcare increased by 130% in Brazil between 2008 and 2017 [1]. In 2016, the 10 most burdening drugs that were demanded comprised 91% of the resources guaranteed for the acquisition of technologies by the Brazilian Government. From 2018 to 2020, the Health Technology Center of the Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas conducted an innovative project that capacitated over 400 researchers working in the judiciary system, published 80 research syntheses, and hosted other educational initiatives [2]. Despite the advances in introducing core concepts of evidence-based medicine in judiciary decisions, further work is needed to continue the much-needed improvement in this area. Objectives: To report the implementation and expected results of the project \"Supporting Health Related Judicial Decision in Brasil\" an initiative from Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, conducted from 2022 to 2023, funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health initiative (PROADI-SUS) and in partnership with the Brazilian National Justice Council. Methods: A case study conducted at Health Technology Center, Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Results: From 2022 to 2023, the following activities and main products are expected to be completed: two courses in critical appraisal of primary and secondary studies, 11 regional workshops and chat-based tutoring for health professionals who provide technical support to the judiciary, 10 research syntheses of widely demanded technologies, one nationwide event to promote the topic, and a weekly blog with three informative posts per week. Another innovative product of the project is to develop a digital platform that will offer updated evidence-based information and tutoring to judges across Brazil. Conclusions: The project was designed to increase the efficiency of judicial decisions in health-related demands. The activities and products will act in the short- and long-term in the system already structured to help judges while deciding on a judicial demand. By adopting evidence-based medicine and research synthesis core concepts in its objectives, the project supports not only a better decision-making process in the judiciary system but also a better healthcare system in Brazil. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The actions developed in this project are structured to contribute to the efficiency of the Brazilian health system. [Cochrane reviews and evidence certainty for neglected tropical diseases](/colloquium-2023/session/1652053/cochrane-reviews-and-evidence-certainty-for-neglected-tropical-diseases) Background: Cancer and rare diseases are among the hottest topics for health-related research areas. Innovative technologies and treatments for these conditions have put increasing pressure on health systems and their budgets. Conversely, one billion people worldwide are affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTD) [1], but neither the pharmaceutical industry nor academia seem to prioritize investments in health care for such conditions. Objectives: To describe the amount and strength of evidence produced about NTD. Methods: Rapid review conducted at the Post-graduation Program of Evidence-based Health, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo. All Cochrane reviews (CR) on 20 NTD established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] were identified. Cochrane Library, issue 2 202 was searched using MeSH terms with no date restriction. The frequency of systematic reviews according to NTD and the certainty of evidence (GRADE) were analyzed. Results: From 41 CR retrieved, leishmaniases, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma were covered by four; Chagas disease, lymphatic chromoblastomycosis, rabies, snakebite envenoming, and yaws have not been the focus of any CR so far. Four CR were published before the adoption of the GRADE approach; nine did not provide formal GRADE assessment and two were empty CR. Pharmacological treatment was the most frequent intervention assessed (73%), followed by surgical (5%), sanitary (5%) and diagnostic (5%). For the outcomes considered and reported in Summary of Findings tables, 9% were from high, 28% moderate, 28% low and 34% were from very low certainty. Conclusions: Most of the available evidence from CR for supporting decision-making on NTD have very low certainty, and the benefits and harms of current interventions for one billion people worldwide remains unknown. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: The scarcity of CR and the poor evidence from primary studies on NTD are misaligned with the burden that these conditions pose to the world. Strategies and policies must be urgently pursued to stimulate the development of new therapies and evaluate preventive strategies. References: [1] World Health Organization.

[A test to assess claims about treatment effects for Spanish primary school children: the development and validation of the interactive CLAIM Test](/colloquium-2023/session/1473635/a-test-to-assess-claims-about-treatment-effects-for-spanish-primary-school-children-the-development-and-validation-of-the-interactive-claim-test) Background: The main objective of the Informed Health Choices (IHC) project is to teach people to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices. For this purpose, the Claim Evaluation Tools item bank was developed to measure people's ability to apply the IHC key concepts (concepts that people need to use to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices). Objectives: To develop and validate the interactive CLAIM Test (iCLAIM Test), an online interactive test in Spanish, with questions from the Claim Evaluation Tools item bank. To measure the ability of Spanish primary school children to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices. Methods: We followed a multistep process to develop the iCLAIM Test, including 1) selection of the questions from the Claim Evaluation Tools item bank; 2) direct translation, reconciliation, reverse translation, and final revision of the questions; 3) design of the interactive test in an online teaching platform; 4) external review with experts; 5) user testing with children; 6) a validation survey; and 7) adjustment of the test. Results: Two researchers selected 24 multiple-choice questions (MCQ), which addressed the 12 IHC Key concepts included in the IHC primary school resources. Three Spanish researchers, a Spanish translator, and an English translator completed the translation process of the questions into Spanish. One web developer and two researchers designed the online interactive test. Twelve experts (7 researchers and 4 teachers from primary schools and 1 designer) reviewed the test, and 11 children participated in the user testing. During 2023, we will survey a sample of approximately 300 children from Spanish primary schools to validate the test. Finally, we will adjust the test according to the validation findings. Conclusions: We expect to obtain a validated, online, and interactive test in Spanish to measure the ability of primary school children to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices. After that, we can use the iCLAIM Test to evaluate the effect of health education interventions in primary schools, such as using the IHC resources. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Representatives from all the different areas of interest (students, teachers, researchers, and designers) participated in the study. [Concept for teaching medical students evidence-based and Cochrane methods](/colloquium-2023/session/1473549/concept-for-teaching-medical-students-evidence-based-and-cochrane-methods) Background: Scientific methods eke out a niche existence in the education of physicians in Germany. A new model study program in Chemnitz, Germany highlights the importance of scientific methods for medical students. A cornerstone in education is the conduct of systematic reviews in line with the Cochrane methodology in the early phase of education. Objectives: Presenting the concept and evaluation of an interactive course for teaching early medical students how to conduct a systematic review. Methods: The concept was developed by three researchers experienced in conducting systematic reviews. At the beginning of the second study year, study types and basic statistics are introduced. After learning these basics, students take part in a seven-session course based on parts 1 and 2 of the Cochrane Handbook. The course provides input on the essential steps of a systematic review and how to develop an individual review question. To pass the course, students must conduct a \"mini\" review in order to answer this research question. The course was evaluated by the research team that designed the course using an online tool allowing for both questions on perceived quality of didactics and knowledge dissemination. Results: The seven sessions were held between April and June 2022 and were attended, on average, by 32 out of 50 eligible students. The average quality of the student-conducted reviews was graded good to satisfactory by two graders. However, a thorough qualitative analysis of common flaws revealed problems with the narrative synthesis of the results of the included studies and with identifying included study types correctly, the latter leading to falsely selected and applied critical appraisal tools. Students rated didactics of and knowledge translation within the seminar series as positive but missed references to their future work as medical doctors. Conclusions: Including Cochrane standards for systematic reviews into medicine curricula early on is feasible but needs to build on thorough information provision of study types within evidence-based medicine earlier in the medicine curriculum. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Additionally, more effort has to be made in order to stress the relevance for the students' future line of work. [Citations of Cochrane nutrition reviews in guidelines: appraising the \"payback\" on investment in nutrition evidence synthesis](/colloquium-2023/session/1652049/citations-of-cochrane-nutrition-reviews-in-guidelines-appraising-the-\"payback\"-on-investment-in-nutrition-evidence-synthesis) Background: High quality systematic reviews are pivotal to evidence-informed guideline development. The extent to which Cochrane nutrition reviews inform health guidelines is unknown. Objectives: To describe numbers and proportions of Cochrane nutrition reviews cited in published health guidelines and assess the main characteristics and scope of these guidelines. Methods: We extracted information about citations of reviews in published health guidelines reported in the Cochrane Library for all versions of the reviews in the Cochrane Nutrition review repository. We then accessed the guideline documents citing these reviews to extract their characteristics and scope, translating to English, where needed. We developed a categorisation for the guideline scope and topic coverage informed by the Guidelines International Network guideline library. Results: Of the 701 reviews in the Cochrane Nutrition repository (August 2021), 441 (all versions) were cited 2,267 times in guidelines between 2010 and 2021. Review Groups with the greatest number of citations were Pregnancy and Childbirth and Heart (4.5%). We identified 863 unique guidelines citing nutrition reviews. Of these, 141 were from international developers (professional bodies n=66; expert groups n=38; intergovernmental organisations n=33; other n=4). National guidelines (n=668) were mostly from European and North American professional bodies (n=369) (e.g. American College of Physicians), followed by governmental bodies (n=175) (e.g. NICE, SIGN), and expert groups from Europe, North America and Australia (n=65). Fifty-four guidelines were sub-national. Less than 10% of national/sub-national guidelines were from low- and middle-income countries, and none from Africa. The guidelines scope covered management/treatment (84%), diagnosis (10%), and rehabilitation (4%). Topics within these categories included a range of key health conditions and treatments; most addressed chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes, cancer), maternal and child health, enteral and parenteral nutrition and gastroenterological conditions. Conclusions: Cochrane nutrition reviews are supporting international, national and sub-national guidelines across many key areas in the Global Challenges Framework, including chronic conditions, cancer, and maternal and child health. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. Guidelines impact practices and policies that affect health outcomes in these groups. [Do basket clinical trials in oncology increase health benefits for patients?](/colloquium-2023/session/1473442/do-basket-clinical-trials-in-oncology-increase-health-benefits-for-patients) Background: Basket clinical trials (BCTs) are novel trial designs commonly used in precision oncology. A BCT is defined as a study that tests a therapeutic intervention for multiple malignancy types simultaneously under the same study protocol. Patients with different cancers recruited to BCTs share specific molecular characteristics which are predictive of clinical benefit from the experimental treatment. Little is known about the risk/benefit ratio in BCTs. Objectives: Our aim is to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate efficacy and safety profiles in BCTs in oncology. We also aim to compare the risks and benefits for trial participants in BCTs with the risks and benefits in other oncology clinical trials with classical designs. Methods: We systematically searched Embase, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional cancer BCTs published between 1 January 2001 and 20 June 2022. We will measure the risk to trial participants by evaluating treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher. We will assess the benefit by analysing objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Results: Of 3,890 records identified (2,627 Embase and 1,263 PubMed), we included 255 texts for full text screening. We found 260 trials through the systematic search of ClinicalTrials.gov. Two reviewers are independently performing the screening of trials according to the eligibility criteria. The results of the final analyses will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: Our findings on the risks and benefits for trial participants in BCTs will provide a basis for discussion on clinical benefits to patients in precision oncology research. Moreover, an ethical analysis or risk/benefit profile in BCTs can contribute to the proposal of recommendations to increase the benefits for trial participants and reduce risks. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Managing high volumes of evidence in systematic reviews: an umbrella review of approaches in Covid-19 vaccine reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473432/managing-high-volumes-of-evidence-in-systematic-reviews-an-umbrella-review-of-approaches-in-covid-19-vaccine-reviews) Background: The volume of published peer-reviewed literature has been increasing exponentially in every discipline. This has implications for the time required for conducting systematic reviews (SRs) both at the review and data extraction and synthesis stages, especially when answering less focused, general questions or working in widely researched healthcare topics. Objectives: To explore the methods utilised by authors of SRs to manage high volumes of evidence, using the field of COVID-19 vaccine research as an example. Methods: This umbrella review was conducted according to a prespecified protocol. In February 2023, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (via Ovid) for SRs focusing on efficacy or safety of COVID-19 vaccines in unselected populations. Records were reviewed by a single individual at the title and then full-text review stage. Information was extracted on whether any restrictions were placed (either a priori or a posteriori) on the search terms or characteristics of studies included in the SRs: publication date, study design, location, sample size, vaccine type, quality. Results: We initially identified 1,221 records, of which 960 were excluded at title review. A further 158 were excluded at full-text review, leaving 103 for analysis. Overall, none of the SRs explicitly stated having to use an approach to limit the analysed evidence. However, five SRs only completed data extractions for articles that were judged to be of sufficient quality following a risk of bias assessment. Many SRs used restrictive search terms (beyond COVID-19 and vaccine efficacy/safety), which resulted in few records entering the SR in the first place, making the review less resource-intensive but likely to miss relevant data. A large proportion of SRs that had high database hits excluded substantial numbers of records before the title/abstract screening step but did not report further details on the rationale for this. The majority also excluded large numbers of records at the abstract review stage, resulting in small numbers of full texts screened. Conclusions: SR authors do not openly discuss issues of dealing with high volumes of evidence when conducting reviews. An open debate on how to manage the growing body of published data is warranted. [Individual Participant Data (IPD) sharing plan statement: a Clinical Trial Registry perspective.](/colloquium-2023/session/1473429/individual-participant-data-ipd-sharing-plan-statement-a-clinical-trial-registry-perspective.) Background: Data sharing has been increasingly recognized as a vital prerequisite for scientific research. Therefore, it is advocated that prospective clinical trials be registered in a clinical registry such as Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR) and South African Clinical Trial Registry (SANCTR) in an effort to reduce publication and reporting bias. The World Health Assembly resolution has made it a point to enforce sharing the results of trials in the public domain. To promote clinical trial data transparency, PACTR and SANCTR registries collect information on individual participant data (IPD) sharing statements as part of the registration process. Objectives: We examined the reporting of IPD sharing plan statements in PACTR, the only African World Health Organization (WHO) primary registry, as well as the national registry SANCTR. Methods: We searched and downloaded data in excel format in the clinical registry from 6 September 2022 and 21 September 2022, respectively. The total number of records reviewed was n = 2295. We assessed the researchers' responses on the IPD sharing statement field for the studies registered from 2019 to the date of the search. Furthermore, we analyzed the IPD sharing statements collected as part of the reporting field in the registries, and we completed a descriptive analysis of these findings. Results: Of the n=2295 records trial records, 10% were analyzed, 87.4% (201/230) had the intent to share, 3.04% (7/230) had no intention to share, and 9.57% (22/230) did not have any information. Although 87.4% of trial records indicated that they would share data, several descriptions of IPD sharing plans reflects confusion or uncertainty about the IPD description and the meaning of the term IPD sharing. Conclusions: Based on our observation, data sharing still appears to depend on the enthusiasm of the lead researcher, despite it being widely agreed that IPD should be easily available. The gap in evidence base impact of IPD sharing remains a challenge, especially in the African region. Thus, more high-level evidence is needed to assess whether researchers understand the impact of data sharing when conducting research. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No. [Cochrane EPOC's template for Qualitative Evidence Syntheses](/colloquium-2023/session/1473412/cochrane-epoc's-template-for-qualitative-evidence-syntheses) Background/Relevance to Patients: Qualitative research can help us explore how patients and others value and experience many issues, including healthcare options. Decision-makers are increasingly using qualitative evidence syntheses to assess the acceptability and feasibility of these options and identify implementation considerations. Editors and review authors in Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) have collaborated closely in producing qualitative evidence syntheses and have consolidated lessons learnt in a template. Objectives: To describe a template to improve the reporting and conduct of qualitative evidence syntheses. Methods: The template was developed by EPOC qualitative evidence synthesis editors and managing editor, with input from review authors and EPOC's information specialist. The template is based on a series of Cochrane qualitative evidence syntheses in which the core team was involved. We extracted and assessed the content of these reviews by section (e.g., title, abstract, and methods). We then considered feedback from review authors, editors, commissioners and peer reviewers and discussed solutions for each section. During discussions, we strived to follow the theoretical and philosophical principles of qualitative research and to ensure that we followed guidance provided by EPOC and Cochrane. We asked review authors and editors to test the template and give feedback. Results The template includes the following: Suggested subheadings for each review section and an explanation of the content needed; Where appropriate, proposals for standardised text; Links to additional information; and Examples for different review sections. When giving explanations and examples, we focused on topics that have received less attention in other sources of guidance, including the following: Preparing abstracts and plain language summaries for qualitative evidence syntheses; Including and translating studies in multiple languages; Approaches for study sampling; Considering review author reflexivity; Developing 'Implications for practice' and 'Implications for research' sections; and Preparing the declarations of interest statement. The template is freely available at https://zenodo.org/record/5973704#.Y_OkvXbMI2x. Conclusions: Now adopted by Cochrane, the template addresses gaps in current guidance, translates existing guidance into practical advice and provides information about Cochrane-specific expectations. The template is a living document, and we continue to update it in response to feedback. [The ISSG Search Filter Resource: improving the efficiency and quality of searches for studies for systematic reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473902/the-issg-search-filter-resource-improving-the-efficiency-and-quality-of-searches-for-studies-for-systematic-reviews) Context: Well-conducted systematic reviews (SRs) that offer a rigorous summary of the available evidence are crucial to the provision of evidence-based healthcare. Search filters can make a significant impact on the efficiency and quality of searches for SRs. The ISSG Search Filter Resource (SFR) was created by the Information Specialists' Sub-Group of InterTASC, the Technology Appraisal Groups providing health technology assessments to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The SFR is a free-to-access portal for methodological and related search filters. To populate the site, searches to identify eligible filters are conducted monthly in databases, tables of contents and current awareness services. Potential filters are evaluated by the Editorial Team before being added to the site. Content: The SFR currently includes the following: bibliographic references to methodological search filters for a range of topics including SRs; bibliographic references to filters for specific age and ethnic groups, geographic areas and genders; independently created abstracts and structured critical appraisals for some filters; references to research on the design, development and use of filters, including studies reporting comparative data from independent testing of filters; and links to filter collections from other organisations. The SFR is continually being developed to maintain its utility and relevance. Recent innovations adding value include the following: links to launch filters directly into Ovid and PubMed; links to comments, errata and retractions; and highlighting comparative performance data visually. From the Cochrane perspective, the SFR provides access to filters for randomized and nonrandomized trials, safety studies/adverse effects, diagnostic test accuracy studies and studies of prognosis. Conclusions: Using the SFR can provide quick access to search filters which can in turn save time and effort when designing searches for SRs and other evidence syntheses that will directly affect health care. The SFR achieves the following: improves awareness of existing methodological search filters; reduces duplication of effort in methodological search filter design; and provides a forum for critical appraisal of methodological search filters. Feedback on the site is welcome, including information about filters not currently listed.

However, the methodological quality of SRs on treatments for Parkinson's disease has not been evaluated comprehensively. Objectives: The study aims to assess the methodological quality of a representative sample of SRs on treatments for Parkinson's disease. Methods: To obtain potentially eligible SRs, a literature search was conducted in four international databases including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from January 2016 to December 2021. A predesigned questionnaire was used to extract the bibliographical characteristics of the included SRs. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) tool was used to assess the methodological quality of SRs. Factors of methodological quality were explored using multivariable regression analyses. Results: A total of 119 eligible SRs were included and appraised in this study. Only one SR (0.8%) was appraised as being of high overall methodological quality. Four (3.4%) and seven (5.9%) SRs were of moderate and low overall methodological quality, respectively. Among the appraised SRs, only 3 (2.5%) used a comprehensive literature search strategy, 11 (9.2%) provided a list of excluded studies with justifications for exclusion and 4 (3.4%) reported the sources of funding for the studies included in the review. Cochrane SRs and SRs published in journals with higher impact factors had relatively higher overall methodological quality. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that SRs on Parkinson's disease treatments have relatively low methodology quality. To enhance the methodological quality of SRs, future reviews should establish and register a priori protocol, conduct a comprehensive literature search, provide a list of excluded studies with justifications for exclusion and report on the sources of funding for the studies included in the review. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Not applicable. [Adapting evidence-based peri-discharge complex interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions among Heart Failure and COPD patients in Hong Kong](/colloquium-2023/session/1473472/adapting-evidence-based-peri-discharge-complex-interventions-for-reducing-30-day-hospital-readmissions-among-heart-failure-and-copd-patients-in-hong-kong) Background Avoidable 30-day hospital readmission is a key policy problem among health systems globally, including Hong Kong. Among all health conditions, heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two leading causes for such readmissions. Effectiveness of peri-discharge complex interventions for reducing such readmissions among patients with HF or COPD has been synthesized in network meta-analyses (NMAs). However, because benefits of complex interventions may vary across health system contexts, evidence-based complex interventions should be adapted before implementation. Objectives To select and refine peri-discharge complex interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions among HF and COPD patients in the Hong Kong public healthcare system context using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework, based on local stakeholders' consensus. Methods Two 18-participant panels were recruited to carry out a two-step process for both conditions separately. In Step 1, participants were invited to prioritize NMA-supported complex interventions and suggest important combinations of different complex interventions. In Step 2, based on this priority list, participants were invited to conduct a two-round Delphi study for generating a list of consensus-based complex interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions. GRADE EtD framework was used to guide the decision-making process, taking into consideration benefits, harms, values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Results Five and six out of ten complex interventions reached positive consensus for HF and COPD, respectively. Case management, discharge planning, patient education, self-management, and telephone follow-up were common components for both conditions and were considered as core elements for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions. Preliminary implementation barriers are in the areas of governance and leadership, financing, health workforce development, service access, and readiness, as well as empowerment of patients and caregivers. Conclusions This study has successfully applied the GRADE EtD framework for starting the adaptation process of complex interventions and has established a list of local stakeholders-endorsed complex interventions for reducing 30-day hospital readmissions. Before scaling up these complex interventions in the Hong Kong health system, further studies for improving intervention-context fit and assessing real world implementation effectiveness are needed. [Adherence and quality of systematic reviews for automatically registered protocols: a PROSPERO register study](/colloquium-2023/session/1473460/adherence-and-quality-of-systematic-reviews-for-automatically-registered-protocols-a-prospero-register-study) Background: Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the PROSPERO team established an automated checking procedure for non-COVID-19 systematic reviews that are registered on their platform. This process takes place 30 days after registration. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the systematic reviews that are automatically reviewed by this process meet the required quality standards. Objectives: To investigate the effect of automatic registration on the quality of systematic reviews. Methods: Our study involved the random selection of 50 interventional systematic review records that underwent automatic checking and 50 interventional systematic review records that underwent manual checking on the PROSPERO platform. The records were published between 1 Jan 2020 and 1 Jan 2023. We evaluated the quality of all systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 and compared the influence of the two checking methods on the quality of the reviews. Results: Of the 100 systematic reviews and meta-analyses included in our study, 41% were published in 2021 and 31% were published in 2022. China had the highest number of publications, accounting for 25%. Our analysis of the 16 items in the AMSTAR-2 tool showed no difference in the quality of systematic reviews between automatic and manual checking methods (Figure). Specifically, the reporting rate of items 13 and 14 was higher in the manual checking group than in the automatic checking group, but this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Automated registration record checking appears to have no impact on the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, but further research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm this result. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Cochrane Russia for trusted evidence: moving forward through the years in numbers](/colloquium-2023/session/1473456/cochrane-russia-for-trusted-evidence-moving-forward-through-the-years-in-numbers) Background: Cochrane Russia was established in 2015 at the Kazan Federal University. Objectives: To look back assessing outputs for the years (2019-2023) and to look forward planning for further capacity building in communicating evidence and advocating for research integrity. Methods: We analyzed our Cochrane work and expressed the progress in numbers, led brainstorming sessions with the leadership of the host institution. Results: Since 2021, Cochrane Russia works at its new home, the Russian Medical Academy for Continuing Professional Education (RMANPO), communicating Cochrane evidence (CE) through RMANPO news digests reaching out to 300,000+ of Russian healthcare providers. We deliver CE regularly through 5 Russian medical journals and include CE into articles of the Great Russian Encyclopaedia. By 2023, we reached 3,000+ Russian translations of Cochrane Plain Language Summaries (PLS) with 200+ volunteer translators, 160 podcasts and 350+ Blogshots, all Cochrane reports, 9 Cochrane Specials collections on COVID-19 with all updates, which resulted in Russian versions of Cochrane PLSs becoming the most accessed and read in the rise of pandemic in 2020, and De-implementation collection. Four Russian-language modules of Cochrane Evidence Essentials received the most active use among non-English versions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cochrane MECIR standards appeared in Russian (2021) with annual update (2022) and will further follow English original. Russian version of the Evidence Commission report (2022) is available at McMaster Health Forum among seven global translations. We facilitate understanding of Cochrane evidence and advocate for its use at scientific and educational events, webinars, face-to-face workshops, masterclasses, round tables, and conference presentations (32 over the last 2 years). Since 2022, we are part of Cochrane Mentorship program with one mentee from Kazakhstan. The state provided subscription to the Cochrane Library for research/teaching health institutions; a Russian National subscription became a reality in 2022. Looking forward, we developed 8 educational modules on evidence synthesis, evidence-based medicine, clinical trials, and systematic reviews for future implementation. Conclusions: Cochrane presence in Russia is well established. Cochrane values, mission, and spirit are highly respected, Cochrane reviews are regularly accessed and used. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We involve healthcare consumers in Russian translations. [A passing grade? How risk communication strategies aligned with citizen's efforts to access health information during COVID-19: A rapid review](/colloquium-2023/session/1473453/a-passing-grade-how-risk-communication-strategies-aligned-with-citizen's-efforts-to-access-health-information-during-covid-19-a-rapid-review) Background: Risk communication strategies have been employed during public health crises. However, there is a need to determine which strategies were effective during the COVID-19 pandemic and how these aligned with individuals' experiences accessing and interacting with information. Objectives: Two independent rapid reviews were conducted to: (i) identify best practices for risk communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) synthesize the literature on public experiences accessing and interacting with COVID-19 information. Methods: This review used a comprehensive search strategy, critical appraisal, data extraction, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)/GRADE assessment. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Trip Medical Database, Web of Science, and Global Health Database were searched up to November 2022. Both reviews were conducted concurrently, findings were characterized and synthesized descriptively, and key points that were supported across both reviews were collated for stronger recommendations. Independent, paired reviewers completed all steps. Results: Overall, 103 publications were included across the two reviews. Findings highlighted the importance of trusted spokespersons, addressing misinformation, developing government-community partnerships, and delivering clear and positively framed messages. The public used both established and informal channels (e.g., social media) to stay informed about COVID-19, and wanted personalized, community-specific health information. Ethnic minority groups and (im)migrant populations experienced a greater degree of literacy and language barriers. Multipronged interventions to support future public health crises response were recommended. Risk communication can consider the following: (a) adopt a uniform approach to communication between levels of government for consistent and complementary messaging; (b) acknowledge uncertainty to tackle misinformation; (c) deliver clear, honest, and non-sensationalized information; (d) balance positive and fear-based messages to consider the emotional needs of the public; and (e) tailor messages for audiences. Evidence on risk communication and public experiences were lacking in Indigenous communities and other equity-deserving communities. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence exploring risk communication and public experiences accessing information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future risk communication strategies should seek to integrate both to apply best practices while also addressing gaps and serving the public's information needs. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Citizen feedback on both rapid reviews was incorporated. All disseminated materials reflect citizens' suggestions. [Consistency of protocol and safety data reporting in clinical trial registrations and corresponding publications of interventions involving 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)](/colloquium-2023/session/1473440/consistency-of-protocol-and-safety-data-reporting-in-clinical-trial-registrations-and-corresponding-publications-of-interventions-involving-34-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-mdma) Background: The efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been demonstrated in clinical trials, although this remains controversial owing to the classified status of the substance in most countries and the vulnerability of patients during dosing sessions. Pre-registration of clinical trials is one way to increase their credibility and transparency. Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate registration data for clinical trials on MDMA to see whether any significant methodological modifications were made to the protocol registration over time that could imply possible bias within the study. Methods: Using ClinicalTrials.gov advanced search on 21 February 2023, we retrieved all trials that had MDMA under the field \"Intervention\". For all included trials, we analysed the ClinicalTrials.gov \"Archive\" field and searched whether any primary outcome and participants' eligibility criteria were quantitatively (changes in number of parameters or timing of measurement) or qualitatively changed. This was considered a major change. We also recorded any addition of information or formatting as a minor change, which does not significantly impact the content. Our next step is to screen PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases for scientific articles of all studies noted as \"Completed\". We will evaluate protocol amendments that could justify major changes and also the level of congruence between the data on adverse events recorded in the registry and corresponding publications. Results: We identified 78 registered trials, of which 59.0% were classified as \"Completed\". Out of those, only 15 trials (32.6%) had their study results posted in the ClinicalTrials.gov results database. Considering all 78 trials, minor changes to the eligibility criteria were found in 23.1% trials, whereas 20.5% trials had major changes. For primary outcome reporting, 24.4% trials had minor changes, whereas 11.5% changes were classified as major. Conclusions: Our findings raise awareness on the need for consistency of protocol reporting in MDMA trial registrations, especially in terms of modifying eligibility criteria once the registration has already been submitted. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Our findings and recommendations help increase the trustworthiness of the clinical trial findings for PTSD patients and for informing any potential policy changes. [A repository of Cochrane nutrition systematic reviews: providing a nutrition lens on the Cochrane Library](/colloquium-2023/session/1473428/a-repository-of-cochrane-nutrition-systematic-reviews-providing-a-nutrition-lens-on-the-cochrane-library) Background: Cochrane Nutrition aims to support and enable evidence-informed decision-making for nutrition policy and practice by advancing the preparation and use of high quality, relevant nutrition reviews. Supporting the use of Cochrane nutrition reviews includes making them easy to find. Objectives: To develop and maintain a categorised repository of nutrition-relevant Cochrane systematic reviews available to evidence users on our website. Methods: We screened titles, abstracts and, if necessary, full-texts of all reviews and protocols in the Cochrane Library (CL) using prespecified eligibility criteria to identify and extract nutrition-relevant records into a categorised repository. We developed a two-layer categorisation approach: layer-1 with 36 broad health categories informed by the Cochrane topics list; and layer-2 with 14 categories, a taxonomy we created categorising types of nutrition interventions/strategies. These categorisations are applied to all included nutrition records, 'tagging' them in Archie according to the most relevant categories. The repository is available on Cochrane Nutrition's website's \"Evidence\" page, hyperlinking to the CL. Regular screening and tagging ensures this resource stays updated. Results: We have screened 11,402 records, including 725 reviews (including 6 overviews) and 120 protocols in the repository (January 2023). Broad layer-1 categories with the most nutrition reviews and protocols include child health (387), pregnancy and childbirth (188), endocrine and metabolic (184), and neonatal (181). The type of intervention tagged most frequently is micronutrient supplementation (488), followed by diets and dietary patterns (304), delivery and implementation strategies (291), nutrition education, communication, and support (270), and macronutrient supplementation (266). The \"Evidence\" page is the mostly frequently viewed webpage on the website, with most users from the USA, followed by the UK (Google Analytics). Conclusions: The Cochrane Nutrition reviews repository provides a nutrition lens on the CL. Evidence users can easily find and access nutrition-relevant reviews and protocols within their topic and intervention area of interest, also helping them to identify gaps where reviews are unavailable. Users have provided positive feedback about the value this resource in review question development. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: This resource makes it easy for patients, public and healthcare consumers to find and access nutrition relevant Cochrane evidence. [A critical historical review shows mismatch between available evidence and related international guidelines recommendations: the case of advanced oesophageal cancer](/colloquium-2023/session/1473426/a-critical-historical-review-shows-mismatch-between-available-evidence-and-related-international-guidelines-recommendations-the-case-of-advanced-oesophageal-cancer) Background: In the case of advanced oesophageal cancer (AOC) patients, whose prognosis is very poor, most clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend the use of anticancer drugs over best supportive care (BSC) alone, but these recommendations may not have taken into account all the available evidence. Objective: To assess the agreement over the last 30 years between available evidence and related CPGs regarding treatments with anticancer drugs versus BSC alone for AOC. Methods: We conducted a historical review in three phases: 1) After conducting an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and confirming that no SR existed to address our research question, we conducted a new SR to identify all relevant randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated anticancer drugs versus BSC alone for AOC; 2) We identified the most relevant international CPGs from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); and 3) We compared whether the recommendations proposed in the CPGs were supported by the previously identified RCTs. Results: We identified 13 relevant RCTs. The first two were published in the early 1990s, but it was not until 20 years later that new studies were published. We retrieved 12 relevant international CPGs: 8 from ESMO, 3 from ASCO, and 1 from NICE, published between 2005 and 2022. None of the CPGs referenced the identified RCTs, and, instead, they considered other evidence not directly related to the clinical question (Figure 1). Conclusions: There is a mismatch between relevant research and the evidence considered by CPGs for making their recommendations about anticancer drugs versus BSC alone for AOC. This mismatch could have biased the formulation of recommendations towards favouring the use of anticancer drugs over the BSC alone. Relevance and importance to patients: AOC patients should be aware that anticancer drugs proposed to them may not be fully supported by the available evidence, even if they are recommended by relevant international CPGs. This lack of concordance could lead to inappropriate overtreatment, i.e., the prescription of unnecessary treatments with an uncertain ratio of benefits and harms. [Training for awareness on using Cochrane Library in Ministry of Health, Malaysia](/colloquium-2023/session/1473402/training-for-awareness-on-using-cochrane-library-in-ministry-of-health-malaysia) Background: Healthcare providers are the most important frontline healthcare workers. Expansion and support for training and career development to improve evidence-based practice among the healthcare provider are needed to improve knowledge and quality of care . Extensive efforts have been made to train healthcare providers in evidence-based practice in Malaysia. Therefore, since 2021, Ministry of Health Malaysia has subscribed to Cochrane National License for all Malaysian users to increase the knowledge and the practice based on evidence. This effort was made for capacity building and improve the evidence-based practice for different type of healthcare providers and users in Malaysia. Objectives: To improve the use of Cochrane Library and create awareness on the information provided by the Cochrane Library, a nationwide training was conducted among all the health professionals within Ministry of Health Methods: National Institutes of Health was mandated to provide evidence-based trainings, and increase healthcare provided aptitude for working with research through evidence-based practice. We identified all government hospitals which have clinical research network throughout Malaysia. We invited all the healthcare professionals through the clinical research network and informed regarding the training content which also include the introduction on the use of latest version of national medical research registry. Clinical research network is a unit within participating hospitals which is affiliated to National Institutes of Health, Malaysia. Therefore, the unit actively participate in conducting and collaborating research program in Ministry of Health, Malaysia and other private agencies. We conducted training on how to use the Cochrane Library which is divided into several sessions in each hospital. Results: Overall, the training improved healthcare provider awareness, EBP knowledge, and identify accessibility. The training also increases provider knowledge on using Cochrane Library, skill acquisition/adherence, competency, or satisfaction. Across all targeted hospitals, trainees identified actions they could take to apply the information they learned from Cochrane Library. Conclusions: Healthcare provider training in evidence-based practice strengthen the knowledge in the workforce which can be used to improve knowledge and awareness. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Healthcare provider, researcher, patients [The association of sensitivity and specificity with disease prevalence: Analysis of 5,925 diagnostic test accuracy studies](/colloquium-2023/session/1473400/the-association-of-sensitivity-and-specificity-with-disease-prevalence-analysis-of-5925-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies) Background: Sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of a diagnostic test and are not expected to change as the prevalence of the target condition changes. Objectives: To empirically determine if sensitivity and specificity are associated with prevalence. Methods: We retrieved data from diagnostic test accuracy meta-analyses published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between January 2003 and January 2020. The association of sensitivity and specificity with prevalence was evaluated using a mixed-effects random intercept linear regression model to jointly evaluate the association between prevalence and log-transformed sensitivity and specificity. The model evaluated all meta-analyses as nested within each systematic review. Results: We analyzed 5,925 diagnostic test accuracy studies included in 525 meta-analyses. Compared with the lowest quartile of prevalence, the second, third, and fourth quartiles had increasing average sensitivities are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions: In this large sample of diagnostic studies, higher prevalence was associated with higher sensitivity and lower specificity. Clinicians should consider the implications of disease prevalence and disease spectrum when interpreting the results of diagnostic test accuracy studies. Systematic reviewers should explore the effect of prevalence on test accuracy measures or use trivariate models that condition test accuracy measures on prevalence. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients/healthcare consumers were not involved in this research. [Transparent and traceable data science-based real-world evidence (DS-RWE) practice in traditional Chinese medicine](/colloquium-2023/session/1473390/transparent-and-traceable-data-science-based-real-world-evidence-ds-rwe-producing-framework-and-practice-in-traditional-chinese-medicine) Background: Real-world data, including electronic medical records (EMRs), have the potential to provide evidence with high external validity. Clinical prediction models are one type of evidence that can take full advantage of such data. However, producing trustworthy evidence using real-world data can be challenging. To address this challenge, advanced data science methods are necessary, as they may offer opportunities to enhance the trustworthiness of evidence generated from real-world data. Objectives: To propose a framework for constructing a transparent and traceable data science-based real-world evidence (DS-RWE) producing with an example in diagnostic model development for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome pattern differentiation. Methods: We propose a framework consisting of EMR repositories, AI-engaged data cleaner, pre-defined clinical problems, transparent method rules, and a regularly updated evidence interface with version control function (Figure 1). This framework allows for the efficient and accurate extraction of data from EMR repositories while ensuring data accuracy through AI-engaged data cleaning. Pre-defined clinical problems ensure the specificity of the evidence produced, whereas transparent method rules guarantee the trustworthiness of the results. The regularly updated evidence interface with version control function ensures the evidence produced is up to date and traceable. Results: According to the framework, we have constructed a DS-RWE pipeline for TCM syndrome pattern diagnosis using 478,862 EMRs from 298,632 patients in our data repository. The AI-engaged data cleaner consists of Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), regular expressions, and a series of factor regulators. A pre-defined model development workflow for syndrome pattern prediction was established, and Autogluon, an auto-machine learning tool, was applied for model development. It took approximately one day to update all the diagnostic models. Conclusions: The proposed framework provides a transparent and traceable pipeline for producing trustworthy evidence using real-world data through data science methods. It has potential contribution to the development of more robust evidence production methods in real-world research, providing patients with trustworthy, up-to-date, and traceable evidence for their care. [Development and validation of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) model for assessing Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) competency](/colloquium-2023/session/1473387/development-and-validation-of-an-objective-structured-clinical-examination-osce-model-for-assessing-evidence-based-medicine-ebm-competency) Background: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an essential competency for health care professionals. However, it is challenging to assess the learning effectiveness of EBM education. Objectives: To develop and validate an Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) model for assessing EBM competency. Methods: We drafted a five-station OSCE model to assess examinees' EBM competency: (1) question forming (history taking and diagnosis of the health problem of a standardised patient with proposal of a structured PICO question); (2) information searching; (3) literature reading; (4) critical appraisal; and (5) application. The scoring sheet for the 'information searching' station was adapted from the scale for measuring evidence-searching capability that we developed previously. We recruited five experts in EBM and OSCE and employed a modified Delphi method to revise and validate our draft scoring sheets used in the OSCE assessment for EBM competency and calculated the item-content validity index (I-CVI). We considered a consensus was achieved when all scoring items were rated 3 by all experts with an interquartile range of 1. By holding two OSCE examinations on 30 postgraduate year students and registrars, two examiners independently used the scoring sheets to assess examinees' EBM competency at each station for intra-rater analysis. One examiner scores these capacities by videotape at different time points for inter-rater ICC analysis. We analysed the reliability and validity of the scoring sheets and calculated intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter- and intra-rater reliability. Results: After two rounds of modified Delphi process, the consensus on scoring sheets was achieved, with each scoring sheet composed of 10 items. The I-CVI of these items ranged from 0.83 to 1.00. The inter-rater ICC was 0.755 0.860 for the 'application' station. ICC these was 0.816, 0.954, 0.830, 0.929, and 0.871, respectively. Conclusions: We developed an OSCE model assessing different aspects of EBM competency. It can be used to assess students' EBM learning effectiveness and as a reference in developing milestones in EBM competency. [A new taxonomy is proposed for defining the interests of stakeholders' representatives in health research](/colloquium-2023/session/1652062/a-new-taxonomy-is-proposed-for-defining-the-interests-of-stakeholders'-representatives-in-health-research) Background: There are concerns about bias arising from the interests that stakeholder representatives may bring into the process of health research. Objectives: To distinguish between the legitimate interests of stakeholder groups and the conflicts of interests of their representatives. Methods: author group developed the taxonomy based on a literature review and through discussion and iterative changes. Results: Legitimate interests of a stakeholder group relate to the inherent rights of that group (e.g., right of appropriate representation). In the context of guidelines, legitimacy arises from the fact that the stakeholder group either uses the guideline recommendations or is affected by them. There is a need to balance legitimate interests across the different stakeholder groups represented in a health research project, e.g., practice guideline development. Also, individuals representing a stakeholder group should align their judgments, decisions, and actions with the legitimate interests of their group. A conflict of interest exists when a past, current or expected interest creates a significant risk of inappropriately influencing an individual's judgment, decision, or action when carrying out a specific duty Conflicts of interest could relate to the interests of either the representatives themselves (e.g., stock ownership) or the organization they represent (e.g., relationships with industry). Conclusions: We will discuss how different health research groups (e.g., guideline producing organizations) can address these different matters. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: no involved [Environmental scanning to assess climate change readiness across Canadian health systems](/colloquium-2023/session/1473576/environmental-scanning-to-assess-climate-change-readiness-across-canadian-health-systems) Background: Across Canadian health systems, there is considerable variation in the degree to which climate change is understood as a health issue and the breadth of relevant policies and programs. Understanding the current state of these policies and programs requires a method that enables rapid and efficient searching and collation of information, much of which is likely unpublished. The environmental scan method, based on formulating a transparent and reproducible search strategy, conducting screening and inclusion/exclusion according to predefined criteria, carrying out systematized data extraction, and conducting appropriate analysis of findings, is well suited for this need. Objectives: 1) Present the results of an environmental scan across Canadian organizations directly responsible for public health and healthcare. 2) Discuss the strengths of the environmental scan method for rapidly collecting information from a range of sources. Methods: The stages will be as follows: 1) Websites of relevant organizations will be searched, using a web-scraping app, to identify individual webpages presenting information on climate-relevant activity within those organizations. Included webpages will contain a description of climate-related activity within the organization. 2) LinkedIn is a social media channel focused on professional networking and career development. It will be searched for people working at Canadian health ministries, health authorities, and hospitals who describe their current position as being related to climate change. Position information will be extracted. 3) Results will be charted in a standardized form. 4) A narrative report will be produced summarizing the extracted data, including presentation of geographic locations, types of positions, organizational types, and/or sectors with more or less climate change-related activity. Results: The full results will be presented at the Colloquium, along with conclusions about the strengths and limitations of the environmental scanning method. Conclusions: Environmental scanning is a developing type of evidence synthesis. Case studies of where this approach has been used and how it has been applied will be useful for strengthening guidance and building further understanding of the research questions for which it is best suited. Patient, public and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. [Rapid evidence identification in reviews of post-COVID syndrome: inclusion of preprint sources and timeliness of review completion](/colloquium-2023/session/1473866/rapid-evidence-identification-in-reviews-of-post-covid-syndrome-inclusion-of-preprint-sources-and-timeliness-of-review-completion) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. Subsequent to initial infection, the impact of post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) has become an increasing health concern. Prevalence of PASC has been estimated at 48% of COVID-19 survivors, experiencing at least one unresolved symptom.1 The pandemic kickstarted rapid changes in evidence production and communication, with availability of preprints via nonprofit online servers allowing rapid dissemination while the disease and evidence evolved. Up-to-date study results on PASC are vital to inform government and health policy during a fast-moving global health crisis; therefore, availability of preprints and currency of searching play a key role in PASC systematic reviews (SR) production. Our previous PASC SR emphasised the importance of searching preprint sources to identify unique included references in a timely manner.2 Objectives: To assess the inclusion of preprint servers and databases in SRs of PASC and to examine the currency and potential limitations of their search methods. Methods: A sample (n=150) of SRs published between 2020-2023 were selected from Epistemonikos3, the largest database of healthcare SRs. We assessed: Inclusion of preprint servers and range of databases searched; Time between last search and publication of review; Limits applied and implications for potential bias. Review protocols, individual patient meta-analyses, scoping reviews, umbrella reviews, and SRs lacking clear search methods were excluded. Results: We included 150 SRs in the main investigation. Assessment of an initial pilot sample of 50 found 84% searched at least one source containing preprints. Of these, 22% specifically searched a preprint server, and 12% searched only Google or Google Scholar for preprints. A total of 78% of SRs in the pilot sample applied restrictive language limits. Conclusions: Preprint sources should be searched to ensure SRs of PASC are comprehensive and current. Given the global nature of the pandemic and resulting cases of PASC internationally, language limits risk introduction of bias and omission of potentially relevant research. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Identification and evaluation of the latest PASC evidence and implementation of evidence-based decision-making benefits patients and the public during this evolving health crisis. [Prioritizing the needs of first aid evidence users: a priority exercise by Cochrane First Aid](/colloquium-2023/session/1473529/prioritizing-the-needs-of-first-aid-evidence-users-a-priority-exercise-by-cochrane-first-aid) Background: When laypeople provide initial assistance to an ill or injured person, this is called 'first aid'. Cochrane First Aid packages Cochrane evidence relevant to first aid in easy-to-digest formats to laypeople, first aid trainers, and first aid guideline developers. In addition, we aim to translate the evidence needs of the first aid community into research priorities and advocate for the development of Cochrane systematic reviews relevant to first aid. Objectives: To list first aid-related priority topics for new Cochrane systematic reviews. Methods: First, we consulted the results of several existing priority exercises and evaluation surveys of different stakeholders in the field of first aid, i.e. the Global First Aid Reference Centre, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation First Aid Task Force, and Belgian Red Cross. This allowed us to list topics for which it would be appropriate, relevant and necessary to systematically gather and synthesize the evidence in order to substantiate first aid recommendations. Next, we asked our stakeholders to prioritize these topics, based on their needs and sense of urgency. We shared a survey via our social media and other Cochrane communication channels, and sent it to the first aid volunteers of Belgian Red Cross. Calculating the average and median scores allowed us to rank the five most pressing topics. Finally, we surveyed stakeholders from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to determine which of these topics had highest priority to them specifically. Results: We compiled a list of 14 first aid-related topics (see Table 1, column 1). Sixty-two people completed the survey, resulting in a list of five priority topics, with the effectiveness of first aid education being the most urgent one (column 2). The LMIC survey, answered by 9 people from 9 countries in Africa and Asia, revealed that having evidence available on which triage system is most effective was of the highest priority to them (column 3). Conclusions: Performing this exercise and sharing the results with the relevant Cochrane Review Groups enabled us to prioritise the needs of our evidence users. The Cochrane review on first aid training for laypeople is currently underway. [Promoting the findings of Cochrane systematic reviews in dental practice through Live Webinars : Unveiling the Experiences](/colloquium-2023/session/1473469/promoting-the-findings-of-cochrane-systematic-reviews-in-dental-practice-through-live-webinars-unveiling-the-experiences) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the way knowledge was transferred from face-to-face seminars to Live Webinars with the help of digital technology. The Cochrane Goal 3 of Informing Health and Care decisions was achievable with a click of a button, and thus we initiated Live webinars. Objectives: To promote the findings of published Cochrane systematic review (SR) in dental practice to the health care providers. To engage with the healthcare providers to assist and support them in evidence-based health decision-making. To make valuable and trustworthy SR information useable for consumer care. Methods: Live webinars have been conducted once per month since May 2022. The latest published SR was selected for the discussion. Four members of the team executed the webinar. Two were SR experts, and the other two were subject experts (author/clinician/academician). These webinars were publicized via a mailing list, Cochrane event site, and social media for the intended participation of dental postgraduate students, research scholars, academicians, and clinicians. The Webinar was conducted for 45-60 minutes. It included a presentation of the SR, expert comments on the research aspect, clinical implications, future recommendations, and a concluding remark on applying the review findings to the consumers. Feedback was obtained at the end of every session. Results: Eight webinars have been completed with a participation registration range of 112 to 283. The webinar is informative, is well organized, and is a new initiative well executed agreed by 100% participants; only 2.29% have written a Cochrane SR and 15.19% have written non-Cochrane SR, 92% agree that these sessions have sensitized them about it, 100% strongly agree that the evidence helped them in making health care decisions, 73.47% have tried to use the valuable SR findings for their patients, and 100% would continue attending such webinars in the future. Conclusions: Live webinars successfully promote, assist, and support healthcare providers to utilize valuable and trustworthy evidence base for consumer care. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: No direct involvement. However, the clinicians confirmed that the valuable SR information helped them make healthcare decisions, thus benefiting the consumers. The uncertainties in SR's conclusion opened up new areas of consumer research. [Helping the cause of trusted evidence: the work of Cochrane Germany, Austria and Switzerland](/colloquium-2023/session/1473669/helping-the-cause-of-trusted-evidence-the-work-of-cochrane-germany-austria-and-switzerland) Background: Within the past 30 years, Geographic Groups have played an important role as national and regional subsidiaries of the global network Cochrane. In their respective countries, the Geographic Groups pursue the goals of Cochrane, e.g., by disseminating Cochrane evidence, advocating for its use in all kinds of health and care decisions, or offering training and expertise in Cochrane/systematic review methods. Although some Geographic Groups have stable funding and can continue their work throughout Cochrane's imminent transition period, this is not the case for others. The future role of Geographic Groups within the global network as compared to Evidence Synthesis Units and Thematic Groups is less clear and may need to be revisited. Objectives: By presenting the current work of Cochrane Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, we showcase the contribution of Geographic Groups to the overall goals of Cochrane and hope to stimulate discussion about their future role and position within Cochrane's new organizational structure. Methods: The poster gives an overview and presents selected examples of activities from all three German-speaking Geographic Groups. These include joint projects conducted by all three groups, like the translation of Plain Language Summaries (Cochrane Kompakt), the blog \"WissenWasWirkt\", workshops and symposia, or the engagement in Cochrane Public Health Europe. Another example is Cochrane Austria's contribution to the Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Our activities address a wide range of audiences, including patients, healthcare professionals, guideline developers, researchers, students, journalists, and decision-makers. Conclusion: Geographic Groups play a crucial role in Cochrane's work. We suggest that this role should not only be maintained but strengthened within the organization's future strategy. In this future, the original idea of Cochrane as an international and diverse network needs to spring even more into life to ensure that Cochrane's vision of better health for all people becomes reality. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: Patients and the general public are key audiences for our dissemination activities. [Conflicts Of Interest and Risk of Bias In Systematic Reviews On Interventions For 6 Common Diagnoses in Primary Care](/colloquium-2023/session/1473785/conflicts-of-interest-and-risk-of-bias-in-systematic-reviews-on-interventions-for-6-common-diagnoses-in-primary-care) Background Knowledge on the association between disclosed conflicts of interest (COI) and risk of bias (RoB) in systematic reviews (SRs) is limited, especially from a clinical perspective. Objectives We aimed to explore the association between COI and RoB in a recent sample of SRs of clinical relevance. Methods A cross-sectional study of SRs on interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, hypertension, dementia, depression, and osteoarthritis published in 2019 was designed. PubMed was searched by a librarian. Two independent reviewers selected SRs using pre-specified criteria. Disclosures of COI and funding were extracted, and SRs were categorized as \"exposed\" (disclosing either financial COI or funding from industry) and \"non-exposed\" (disclosing no financial COI and no funding from industry). A random sample of 50 SRs was drawn from the exposed and the non-exposed category, respectively. Two independent researchers, blinded to the COI and funding disclosures, applied a ROBIS item for RoB assessment. The ROBIS tool is organized into four domains, and, if one of them is found associated with a high RoB, the others cannot make up for this. A working model based on \"early stop\" at the first domain implied that a high RoB was adopted. Results In total, 590 SRs were included; 189 (32%) evaluated medications, 161 (27%) focused on diabetes, and 22 (4%) were Cochrane reviews. COI were disclosed in 120 (20%) SRs, of which 100 (17%) implicated individual financial COI. Funding from industry was disclosed in 33 (6%) SRs. In all, 109 (18%) SRs were exposed, 362 (61%) were non-exposed to financial relationships, and 119 (20%) could not be categorized. High RoB was found in 43/51 (84%) exposed and 42/52 (81%) non-exposed SRs (p=0.64). The main reason was shortcomings of the second domain, i.e., identification and selection of primary studies in 24 (56%) and 29 (69%) SRs, respectively (p=0.21). Conclusions Most SRs in this clinically relevant sample were assessed as having high RoB, but it did not differ between SRs exposed and non-exposed to financial relationships. Further studies are needed to validate and clarify the implications of this finding. Patient involvement None. [Title: Effective Knowledge Translation: Lessons from a Three-Day Interactive Cochrane Standard Author Training Webinar](/colloquium-2023/session/1473843/title-effective-knowledge-translation-lessons-from-a-three-day-interactive-cochrane-standard-author-training-webinar) Background: For 2 years, Tufts University has conducted biannual Cochrane Training Webinars. Participants are trained to write a protocol, conduct an interventional systematic review, and use relevant software. A team of facilitators underwent training to mentor these participants in small groups to fill out a title registration form in a research area of interest. Professors from three universities delivered lectures, and 106 participants have received the training, some of which are Master of Public Health (MPH) candidates who have since assisted the Tufts Cochrane Affiliate with World Health Organization (WHO)-funded systematic reviews. Objectives: 1. To evaluate the efficacy of four Standard Author Training Webinars. 2. To highlight the strengths and weaknesses associated with online format, multi-day sessions, and small-group activities. Methods: We developed a survey to investigate the program's ability to translate knowledge in review authorship. We also invited participants to submit feedback on the online format and the quality of the lectures and small-group sessions, both in free response and on a five-point scale. Results: Participants were most satisfied with the organization of the program (4.67\u00b10.62), the handout materials (4.25\u00b10.83), the opportunity to ask questions (4.58\u00b10.95), and the content of the program (4.67\u00b10.47). Participants also said they would have preferred for their mentors to be more active in guiding the project. However, they did note that they felt very comfortable asking questions and that this was a valuable aspect of the program. The biggest weakness reported was that participants expressed barriers to continuing with their review. Conclusions: We concluded that the online format increased convenience and allowed for more international participation as well as student participation, increasing the accessibility of empirical research. However, due to the shorter nature of the training, students felt less able to continue the review process towards publication. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: We hope to increase capacity for scientific research in all of our participants with no requirement of expertise. In doing so, we hope to decrease barriers to science for students from underrepresented groups, thereby increasing future medical bodies of evidence that will advance care for all. [Trustworthy stopping criteria for reliable work savings from machine learning prioritised screening](/colloquium-2023/session/1473839/trustworthy-stopping-criteria-for-reliable-work-savings-from-machine-learning-prioritised-screening) Background: Systematic review is a vital tool for producing trustworthy evidence that improves patient outcomes. Screening studies requires repetitive human labour, and machine learning promises to generate labour savings by learning to recognise and prioritise relevant studies. However, many systems report theoretical maximum labour savings that are unreachable in realistic conditions without prior knowledge of the number of relevant studies. Several systems suggest stopping criteria that risk zero work savings or catastrophic failures to meet targeted levels of recall. Previous work by the author team has identified a reliable stopping criterion using the hypergeometric distribution, although it is overly conservative. Objectives: This paper presents an extension of our previous work on stopping criteria that uses biased urn theory to improve the precision of the criterion. Methods: We demonstrate the reliability of the criterion by simulating machine learning-assisted screening processes on evaluation datasets under realistic conditions and contrast the work savings and recall achieved with commonly suggested heuristics. Results: We show that our biased-urn based stopping criterion can achieve savings close to the theoretical maximum with a given dataset and classifier when the bias parameter can be accurately optimised. The stopping criteria enables reliable work savings that are independent of the classifier used or dataset. Conclusions: Our stopping criterion offers a basis for capitalising on the labour-saving potential of machine-learning technologies in systematic review production without compromising on the trustworthiness of the evidence produced. The criterion can be adjusted for the users's preferred recall target and level of confidence, and the results can be easily communicated in terms of rejecting a null hypothesis that a recall target has not been reached, making the use of machine learning technologies transparent and comprehensible to non-specialists. [Building a research team: A Cochrane US Network experience focusing on racial health equity](/colloquium-2023/session/1473736/building-a-research-team-a-cochrane-us-network-experience-focusing-on-racial-health-equity) Background: Cochrane US Network (Network) was established in 2019 and comprises 23 US-based organizations producing and disseminating Cochrane and other high-quality evidence informing healthcare decisions. Network members had little experience working together but solidified common goals and objectives for increased use of evidence to inform healthcare policy, practice, decision-making, and standards of care. The first large-scale partnership project awarded to the Network is for prioritizing racial health equity in evidence synthesis in the United States. This Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) grant facilitated multiple partnerships throughout the Network and brought together multidisciplinary health professionals from diverse backgrounds, with diverging opinions and various levels of experience. Methods: An informational partnership between the Network and RWJF began in 2019 through connections made at the Network launch. Over 3 years, conversations among the Network, RWJF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention progressed through several project ideas and concepts, concluding with a defined project in October 2022. Being the first large-scale collaborative, funded project of the Network, it served as a pilot toward informing protocols and procedures for partnership building, funds management, project team development, and cohesion across agencies. Diplomatic and open conversations, as well as expertise and availability, played key roles in deciding project composition\u2014from both an organizational and individual standpoint. Use of technology accelerated this process and is a key tool in project management and research methods. A milestone payment system enhances accountability across subcontractors and fosters project success. Results: Preliminary results are encouraging. Clear communication and expectations guided us toward a cohesive project team. Given the team expertise, dedication, and lived experience, we look forward to achieving improved prioritization of racial health equity in evidence synthesis in the United States and abroad. Discussion: Although the time from the initial conversations to the award was 3 years, the time from the award to the project start was limited. Despite time constraints, unfamiliar working partnerships, and divergent methodological experience, we assembled a diverse and dedicated project team within a month. Understanding the flexibility, restraints, and institutional requirements of project team organizations is crucial to a successful delegation of responsibilities. [A new online course on Campbell Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Methods](/colloquium-2023/session/1473587/a-new-online-course-on-campbell-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-methods) Background: Many systematic reviews are conducted by research teams with deep domain knowledge but little experience or expertise in evidence synthesis methods. One goal of the Campbell Collaboration is to provide training for the conduct of high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. There is a need to scale up this training and to develop openly available instructional materials for online learning with a global reach. Objectives: We will describe a new online course created by members of the Campbell Training Group for authors of Campbell systematic reviews. The goal of this course is to prepare people to conduct and report rigorous and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform policy, practice, and future research. Course development and structure The course follows guidelines and standards developed by Campbell and is based on empirical evidence about how to produce the most comprehensive and accurate reviews of research. Developed within the Open Learning Initiative (OLI), an open educational platform based on learning science principles, this course is designed for use in both independent (self-directed) and classroom learning environments. The course begins with an overview of the logic and methods of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. It then follows the steps in the production of systematic reviews of quantitative studies, including the following: problem formulation, searching the literature, screening potentially eligible studies, data extraction and coding, critical appraisal, effect sizes, and meta-analysis. The course includes frequent assessments and feedback tied to learning objectives at each step, providing course designers and instructors with data to drive course improvement and targeted in-class curriculum. Conclusions and implications: Beyond the production of Campbell reviews, we encourage wider applications of the knowledge and skills covered in this course, with a focus on systematic reviews and meta-analysis in the social sciences. With the OLI platform, instructors can request implementation of the course for a student cohort integrated with a learning management system such as Canvas, thus serving as a free and open online course textbook. The course has the potential to improve the rigor of systematic reviews and adherence to accepted standards and guidelines. Patient, public, and/or healthcare consumer involvement: None. [Challenges in designing and delivering prognostic factor systematic reviews: experience from three reviews](/colloquium-2023/session/1473653/challenges-in-designing-and-delivering-prognostic-factor-systematic-reviews-experience-from-three-reviews) Introduction: Prognostic factors can potentially be used to target groups at most risk and improve care received by patients. However, producing reliable and informative systematic reviews (SR) synthesizing evidence regarding potential prognostic factors for a particular outcome can be problematic. Objectives: To present the experience of conducting three prognostic factor SRs and discuss challenges encountered. Methods: The three reviews: Predictors of unplanned hospital admissions, mortality, and poor quality of life in older people who are identified as frail in primary care. Prognostic factors and models for predicting work absence in adults with musculoskeletal conditions. Prognostic factors and inequalities in poor outcome in people with dementia. All SRs were conducted using standard, rigorous SR methodology in accordance with guidance from the Cochrane Prognosis group and the Cochrane Handbook. Results: Inconsistent labelling and reporting of prognosis research required sensitive search strategies to ensure all eligible studies were retrieved. Prognostic research search filters did not substantially reduce the number of papers. Extra screening stages were needed owing to the volume of articles identified: initial title screening by one reviewer (sample by a second reviewer), before abstracts and full texts were independently screened by two reviewers. Variation in reporting required a complex spreadsheet and contributed to difficulties extracting consistent data and assessing risk of bias. Piloting eligibility criteria and spreadsheets was essential to improve reliability. Individual prognostic factors identified were grouped. However, often insufficient, inconsistent data and too much heterogeneity was present for meta-analyses to be conducted. Narrative synthesis assessed potential of prognostic factor groups to influence each outcome and level of confidence (informed by GRADE). Patient and Public Involvement & Engagement (PPIE): PPIE groups proposed potential prognostic factors which differed from the factors found in the published research. Conclusions: Reviewers encountered several challenges throughout the review process. This was mainly due to variability in conduct and reporting of studies and the large numbers of studies and individual prognostic factors identified and screened in each of the SRs. The experiences of the reviewers should be considered with reference to new research methods, such as automation, and their potential for solving these challenges. "}
