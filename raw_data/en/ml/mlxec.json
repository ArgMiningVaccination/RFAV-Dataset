Tomorrow's doctors won't just treat the disease; they will care for the super-organism \u2014 the totality of DNA in the patient sitting in front of them. A small desktop machine will spit out a personalized health plan, designed to boost and maintain health by promoting a thriving and perfectly balanced microbiome \u2014 the army of organisms in the gut, mouth and on the skin \u2014 and body. From a few samples, the machine will measure the patient's entire genetic material \u2014 their human DNA plus their microbiome's DNA \u2014 and using bioinformatics and AI, deliver the perfect prescription for a healthy life, from diet to supplements, to medicines and lifestyle advice. You may like It's one school of thought that's gaining pace as scientists today make crucial advances in their understanding of the importance and symbiotic role of the microbiome. But it's some decades off yet. Sequencing on an individual basis is still too expensive, and we don't yet know enough about the key interactions between a human being and their microbiome that drive disease in one circumstance, but not in another, said David Moyes, senior lecturer in host-microbiome interactions at King's College London. \"That's still being worked out,\" he said. But it's one of many areas of work on the microbiome that has seen an explosion in research in recent years. While academics are nerding out on discovering and describing different microbiome compositions and their significance, figuring out the complex relationships between microbiota and disease, industry is already jumping the gun. Getting ahead Consumer groups are developing products designed to boost the microbiome that, advocates say, can help guard against disease. Toothpaste that encourages a healthy mouth microbiome to [improve](https://www.zendium.co.uk/who-we-are.html) gum health; bath and skin products that are \"microbiome-gentle,\" often by being pH neutral; and one [drink](https://www.jnj.com/innovation/dosebiome-the-start-up-hoping-to-improve-oral-care-through-sipping-qii-tea) that claims to remove up to 52 percent of plaque in one serving by balancing the oral microbiome. \"Everything we consume needs to create the right balance so what can we do to promote that? I ultimately decided to start with oral health,\" Dose Biome founder and CEO Ted Jin told [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2018/05/31/this-start-up-just-made-good-oral-hygiene-as-sweet-as-long-island-iced-tea/?sh=7d81a39a769b) after the launch of his first product, the tea-based soft drink, Qii. Unilever is also [investing](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2021/harnessing-the-natural-power-of-microbes-to-create-sustainable-products/) in microbiome research. Its Zendium toothpaste contains natural enzymes and proteins to boost the salivary defenses and balance the oral microbiome. \"The human microbiome is now being recognised as critical to our health,\" Mariano Sampietro, the product lead at Unilever [said](https://www.dentalreview.news/dentistry/19-dental-health-hygiene/3446-zendium-toothpaste-launches-in-uk) at the time of its U.K. launch. \"Our studies reveal the specific gum health benefits of its microbiome-balancing effect.\" The theory behind these products stems from research that shows people with a diverse and flourishing microbiome are less prone to a multitude of diseases. \"The greater the number of different species of bacteria you've got, the higher the diversity of microbes that you have in the guts, the higher the number of different genes that you've got, and therefore the greater the functionality of your microbiome, and therefore, the healthier you will be. That's the way the theory runs,\" explained Moyes. This theory was most recently demonstrated in a [study](https://gut.bmj.com/content/71/3/544) of COVID-19 patients. It found that people who developed long COVID had fewer microbial species and a less abundant microbiome than those who did not. It's the latest sign that harnessing the power of a healthy microbiome could not only treat but also possibly prevent a multitude of illnesses. But there's one big hurdle that scientists still need to overcome: figuring out what a healthy microbiome looks like. \"The jury's out, if I'm really honest, on that,\" said Anthony Finbow, chief executive of Eagle Genomics, a data science firm specializing in genomic platforms and understanding the microbiome. Each person carries tens of thousands of microbial strains, and at the cellular level, they make up at least 50 percent of everyone's cells. Added to that complexity is that everyone is different: Each part of their body \u2014 from their armpits to their small intestines \u2014 has a different microbiome. And it's constantly evolving. On top of this, everyone's immune system responds to these organisms differently. The immune system needs to ensure it doesn't attack microbes that are safe and essential to good health, while recognizing those that are potentially nasty. When this regulatory system fails, people can develop conditions like allergies, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. \"We're just scratching the surface at the moment,\" in our understanding of the microbiome and its role in our health, Finbow said. \"But already we're seeing the extraordinary energy and enthusiasm it's generating.\" Despite the many unknowns in the field, he says of these consumer products: \"I don't think it's a fad. I think it's a long-term transformational and paradigm shift in the scientific realm. And that is coming.\" Risks and rewards In the clinic, microbiome treatment is already saving lives. A handful of centers in the U.K. are now treating people with fecal microbiota transplants, licensed for infection with chronic clostridium difficile that's resistant to standard antibiotics. This involves transferring gut bacteria and other components in feces from a screened healthy donor to an individual. And in C. difficile, a bacterium that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon, results are impressive: studies [demonstrate](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/mds/facilities/advanced-therapies-facility/microbiome-treatment-centre.aspx) a cure rate of over 90 percent. Off the back of this success, it's also being tested in several other areas, from liver disease to inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease. Scientists are also working on developing the therapy in oral capsule form, avoiding the need for more invasive treatment using tubes inserted either into the large bowel or the upper gastrointestinal tract by a tube from the nose. While the results in C. difficile are eyebrow raising, the treatment doesn't come without risks, warns Graham Rook, emeritus professor of medical microbiology at University College London. \"What people are trying to do is develop in the laboratory, sort of ideal microbiota, constituting a community of microorganisms that looks right for your average human being. That would be wonderful,\" he said. \"The problem is that it's not that easy.\" That's because the relationship between a host and their microbiome is far more complex and intertwined than researchers first thought. Studies in sterile mice depleted of a microbiome have shown that transferring the microbiome of an obese person makes them fat, while the microbiome from a depressed person or someone with a sleep disorder also affects the mice in the same way. \"Although it's true that illness and stress and things like that will disturb your gut microorganisms, it's also clear that the microorganisms, once they are abnormal, are going to cause ill health or even perpetuate ill health,\" said Rook, pointing to anecdotal evidence of this happening with fecal microbiota transplants. \"If you think about it, it's actually terribly dangerous,\" he argued, because the microbiota has an effect on the host's ability to regulate what the immune system does and does not attack. The scale and scope of research into the composition and role of the microbiome is vast, but that's not stopping entrepreneurs and scientists who see the huge health care potential in this field. That includes consumer product companies. To Rook, a leading expert in this field who at 76 runs frequently, not just for fitness but to get a healthy dose of microbes from the natural environment, there are so many as-yet unknowns that the best thing anyone can do to boost their health through their microbiome, with certainty, is to focus on their lifestyle. Back to the future Today's modern world has evolved in such a way as to deplete people of an abundant and diverse microbiome, Rook argues \u2014 and this mostly affects those at the bottom end of the socio-economic spectrum. From smoking, to modern housing blocks, cities without green spaces, to processed food, mothers opting for caesarian births preventing a baby from receiving a first vital dose of its mother's microbiome, to pollution, over-exposure to cleaning products, to overuse of antibiotics \u2014 all of these factors serve to limit a person's microbiome, pointed out Rook. It's no coincidence that ill health is more prevalent among the poor, he said, than those who are better off. Delivering solutions to all of these problems requires long-term planning and buy-in across government departments and borders. Cities are taking steps to address issues like pollution and green spaces and there is growing awareness among doctors, for example, not to give in to pressure to dole out antibiotics on demand. But in the future, doctors may have a quicker solution in the form of their desktop friend, swiftly examining the 22,000 human genes and the 15 million or so microbial genes, to deliver a personalized life prescription. \"That is the ultimate goal,\" said Moyes, from King's College London.
