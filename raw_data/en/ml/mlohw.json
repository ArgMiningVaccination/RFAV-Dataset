Regional incidence decreased in all health authorities in the 10 -12 weeks prior to week 25 . In week 25, Interior Health and Fraser Health had the highest incidence rates at 9 and 8 per 100K, respectively. Age-specific incidences decreased from weeks 13-14 to week 25 in all age groups , with decreases ranging from 95% to 98%. Up to week 25, s ingle -dose vaccine cover age for 12+ year -olds reached 77% ; the h ighest coverage was in 70+ year -olds at almost 90%, met by 19 cases in week 25 . Testing of MSP -funded specimens decrease d by 69% from week 14 to week 25 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has also been decreasing since week 14 ( 12.1%), reaching 2.4 % in week 25. Compared to week 24, t here has been an increase in hospital admissions from 50 to 65 hospitalizations, an increase in death counts from 6 to 10 deaths, while intensive care admissions have been decreasing since week 15 (107 admissions), reaching 11 admissions in week 25 . By case of earliest onset date, there were no new outbreaks repor ted in a care setting in week 25. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 25 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for r ecent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overal l) and for year 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197,224 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on July 05, 2021 , laboratory data on July 02, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on July 02, 2021, and PCMS hospitalization data on July 05, 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Provincially, up to week 25 , 2021, there have been 147, 594 cases, for a cumulative incidence of 2,836 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1 , following the peak of Wave 3 in week 14 at 150 per 100 K, incidence has decreased by 96 % to reach 6 per 100K in week 25 . The incidence in week 25 is comparable to early August 2020 during Phase 3a. Rates may increase as data by episode date become more complete. Due to an update to the provincial population estimates used to calculate rates, there is a slight change in rates com pared to reports in week 21 and earlier. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence decreased in all health authorities in the 10 -12 weeks prior to week 25. In week 25 , Interior Health (IH) and Fraser Health (FH) had the highest incidence rates at 9 and 8 per 100K , respectively ; Van couver Coastal Health (VCH) at 6 per 100K; Northern Health (NH) at 2 per 100K; and Island Healt h (VIHA) at 1 per 100K. Incidence has decreased in all health service delivery areas (HSDA), except in East Kootenay HSDA where it increased very slightly in week 25 from 1 to 3 per 100K . Rates may increase as data become more complete. Table 1.

Likely sources of infection As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 , domestic contact with a known case or cluster has been the most commonly reported source of infection across the pandemic to date . There were no cases reporting interprovincial travel for week 25. Table 2.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 69 % from ~67,500 specimens in week 14 to ~21,000 in week 25 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has been decreasing rapidly since week 14 (12.1%) reaching 2.4% in week 25 ; this is comparable to positivity in end of August 2020. As shown in Panel A of Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates for MSP -only specimens have been declining in all HAs since weeks 14-15. As shown in Panel B , percent positivity for MSP -funded tests has also been decreasing since weeks 13 -14. For week 25 , positivity was highest in IH at 3.3% followed by VCH, FH, and NHA at 2.4%, and lowest in VIHA at 0.8 %. Figure 4.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 6 , testing rates in week 25 have decreased in all a ge groups since at least week 20, with the exception of the 80+ year -olds where there was a slight increase from week 24. The 80+ year -olds also had the highest testing rate for week 25 at 738 per 100K . As shown by the black dots in Figure 6 , the percent positivity has decreased in all age groups since week 20 , but has stabilized or increased slightly in ages 0 -14 and 80+ years since week 23. The percent positivity in all age groups between 10 and 59 year s have experienced a similar sharp decline since week 20 of ~5% . In week 25, the percent positivity w as comparable among all age groups less than 60+ ranging from 2.2% to 2.7% . Percent positivity 80+ yea r-olds at 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age gr oup As shown in Figure 7 , recent fluctuations in proportions reflect small case counts which is more pronounced starting week 22. Generally, younger adults between 20 and 49 years of age comprise half of the cases . As shown in Figure 8, age specific incidences decreased from weeks 13 -14 to week 25 in all age groups, with relative decreases ranging from 95% to 98%. The highest incidences in week 25 were in the 30 -39 and 15 -19-year -olds at 9 per 100K and the lowest was in the 70 -79-year -olds at 1 per 100K. Week 25 age -specific incidences are likely to increase as data become more complete. Figure 6.

The vaccination of community - based older adults 70+ years of age started between weeks 10 and 14. As shown in Figure 9 , compared to the very steep increase in vaccination coverage from week 10 (11%) to week 16 (83%), rates have increased at a slower rate since week 17 reaching 89% in week 25 when there were only 19 cases reported for that age group. The vaccination of community -based (not residing in healthcare facilities, not healthcare workers and not clinically extremely vulnerable) adults 40 to 69 years of age star ted in weeks 15 -19; by week 25, coverage reached 85%, 80 %, and 77% reflecting case counts of 27, 28, and 50 for the 60 -69, 50 -59, and 40 -49 year -olds, respectively. The vaccination of community -based adults 20 to 39 year of age started in weeks 19 -20; b y week 25, coverage was 72% and 69% with 65 and 70 cases for the 30 -39 and 20 -29 year -old groups, respectively. The lowest coverage was in children 12 -19 years o f age at 61% coverage in week 25 . Overall, single -dose vaccine coverage for all age groups 12+ years reached 77% by week 25, a 1% increase since week 24 . Figure 9.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of weekly hospital admissions peaked in week 15 (384) and has declined by 87% since then, reaching 50 admissions in week 24 , followed by an increase in week 25 with 65 hospitalizations reported (Table 3 , Figure 9 ). Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions decreased b y 90 % since week 15 (107 admissions), reaching 11 admissions in week 25 . The number of deaths decreased by 81% since week 19 (31 deaths) with 6 deaths rep orted in week 24, followed by a slight increase in wee k 25 with 10 deaths reported . These numbers may increase in future reports as more data become available. Cumulatively, there have been 16 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (M IS- C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 25 . The median age of these cases is 7 (range 1 -15) years. Table 3.

Age profile, severe outcomes Table 4 displays the distribution of cases and severe outcomes. In week 25 , median age of hospital admissi ons, ICU admissions and deaths was 61 years, 69 years and 65 years, respectively based on health authority case line lists only (data not shown). As shown in Figure 11 , since week 6, death counts have been low and stable in elde rly adults with an average of 10 deaths per week in the 80+ year -olds, 6 in the 70 -79-year -olds, 4 in the 60 -69-year -olds, and 2 in the 50 -59-year -olds.
