The School continued to carry out important applied clinical and public health research while continuing to enhance its teaching program. We had another successful year in obtaining National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funding. Research income of $28 million was generated from NHMRC, Australian Research Council (ARC), National Institute of Health (NIH) and other national and international funding bodies. $11 Million was generated in NHMRC project grants. Associate Professor Damon Eisen, Professor Jane Fisher, Professor Kate Leslie, Associate Professor Yahya Shehabi, Dr Yuanyuan Wang and Professor Christopher Reid headed these project grants. Our NHMRC success continued with Professor Jamie Cooper receiving funding for a Centre for Research Excellence (CRE) in patient blood management in critical illness and trauma. Associate Professor Sophia Zoungas was successful in securing funding from the NHMRC Partnership Grant Scheme to investigate better outcomes for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. I would like to offer my congratulations to the following NHMRC Fellowship recipients: Professor Helena Teede and Professor Jamie Cooper (awarded Practitioner Fellowships), Professor Christopher Reid and Professor Susan Davis (awarded Research Fellowships), Associate Professor Belinda Gabbe (awarded a Career Development Fellowship) and Dr Judy Lowthian (awarded an Early Career Fellowship). Research conducted within the School continued to receive significant media interest. In particular, the study headed by Dr Deborah Glass, looking into cancer and death rates among the Country Fire Authority (CFA) members at the Fiskville base in Victoria received considerable publicity. ASPREE continued to attract attention from the media following a publication in The Lancet of studies linking aspirin to cancer prevention. Our staff authored or co-authored more than 500 peer-reviewed journal articles, a number of which were published in high impact journals such as The Lancet and the Journal of the American Medical Association. My special congratulations go to Professor Andrew Tonkin, Professor Rinaldo Bellomo, Professor Rachelle Buchbinder, Associate Professor Belinda Gabbe, Associate Professor Michael Bailey, Professor Paul O'Brien and Associate Professor Wendy Brown, for their high profile publications during the year. The School continued to grow and evolve, with the Jean Hailes Research Unit, headed by Professor Jane Fisher, moving to the Burnet building adjacent to the ASPREE site. 2012 also saw the creation of the new Monash Applied Research Stream (MARS), under the leadership of Professor Helena Teede, based at the Monash Medical Centre. This division will encompass Women's Public Health Research, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Research, Centre of Clinical Effectiveness and Clinical Research Support Service Units. We anticipate strong further growth in this division over coming years. SPHPM continued to develop and expand its teaching curriculum. Our flagship program, the Bachelor of Health Sciences, under the supervision of Associate Professor Catherine Joyce, attracted over 300 enrolments in 2012, a 24% increase on 2011. The program continued to grow with a number of students undertaking Honours research projects in different parts of the School. Postgraduate enrolments also continued to grow, with more than 250 students enrolled in 2012. The School also recorded its highest number of PhD completions (19), reflecting the strength of our doctoral program. Research Governance continues to play a strong role within the School. In 2012 we re- launched the new self-audit tool to allow efficient review of projects administered by the School. The School also launched a new on-boarding process to induct new staff into our research culture. We welcomed several new staff members in 2012. We were particularly pleased to welcome Associate Professor Erica Wood, previously a blood transfusion specialist at the Australian Red Cross, who will now head the Transfusion Research Unit. We farewelled 27 staff members whose contributions to our school have been greatly valued, included Dr Louise Phillips, Professor Helen Keleher and Associate Professor Caroline Brand. I wish them all the very best in their future endeavours. I would like to thank our wonderful school administrative staff for their skill, patience and forbearance in supporting our work through 2012. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the senior staff of the School for their continuing support and outstanding contributions to our teaching and research activities.

Photo includes Dr Evan Hadley (via video conference), Professor Alan Finkel, Prof John McNeil and Associate Professor Robyn Woods ASPREE (ASPirin in R educing Events in the Elderly) is investigating whether low dose aspirin can delay or prevent the onset of common age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, dementia and certain cancers in healthy people aged 70 and over. The trial aims to recruit 19,000 participants - 16,000 from Australia and 3,000 participants across the USA. ASPREE, an international collaboration between researchers, universities, general practitioners and the community, continued to reach new milestones throughout 2012. The NHMRC funded SNORE-ASA ( S tudy of Neurocognitive Outcomes, Radiological and Retinal Effects of A spirin in S leep Apnoea), was launched in 2012, inviting the first of 3500 ASPREE volunteers across Victoria to participate. SNORE-ASA will help determine if sleep apnoea adversely affects concentration and memory in older people and if aspirin can help slow down associated changes in small blood vessels in the brain. ASPREE also secured $900,000 in funding in the 2012 NHMRC grant round, to determine whether treatment with low dose aspirin influences the incidence or the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in otherwise healthy older people. AMD is a major cause of visual impairment in developed countries, and is responsible for nearly half of all legal blindness in Australia. This sub-study will commence in 2013. Further NHMRC equipment grants helped purchase a new mobile laboratory and a nitrogen tank to store biospecimens for the ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank. Lead Investigator in Australia, Professor John McNeil, and the Executive Officer, Associate Professor Robyn Woods, were invited to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported inflammation symposium in August. During their visit they met with members of the National Cancer Institute and secured funding to investigate the association between aspirin and cancer prevention. The US $2.2 million funded ACES (ASPREE Cancer Endpoint Study) will explore the potential mechanisms of aspirin's hypothesised cancer protective effect through the examination of DNA molecules. This sub-study will commence in 2013. ASPREE hosted a successful Monash Business Breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Melbourne. Monash Chancellor, Professor Alan Finkel chaired the event, with presentations by Professor John McNeil and Associate Professor Robyn Woods. Dr Evan Hadley, Director of the Division of Geriatric and Clinical Gerontology with the National Institute on Aging (NIA), which funded the main ASPREE study, attended via videoconference. ASPREE also hosted several morning teas to update participants, family and friends on the trial's progress. The events, which were held across Victoria, the ACT and Tasmania were very well received and attended. The ASPREE trial broadened its reach across Australia during 2012. Federal Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Mark Butler MP , officially launched the ASPREE Clinical Trial Centre in Adelaide. Another new centre in Albury/Wodonga will service the border region and southern NSW, while the trial made inroads into establishing a new site in Wollongong which will begin recruiting in 2013. ASPREE's regional sites are among the fastest growing recruitment areas, with country Victoria almost doubling participant numbers in 2012. ASPREE Clinical Trial Centres have created new employment and training opportunities, developed working relationships with local health service providers and laid the foundations for future clinical research. Website: www.aspree.org/AUS6National Study to Improve Workplace Practices of Firefighters Fire fighting is an important occupation in Australia which involves more than 260,000 paid and volunteer personnel. In order to improve workplace practices and maximally protect firefighters from exposure to dangerous and toxic substances, it is important to understand the morbidity and mortality patterns of this workforce. A study of Australian firefighters is currently being undertaken by the Monash Centre for Occupational & Environmental Health (MonCOEH). This retrospective cohort study has been commissioned by the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC). Led by Associate Professor Deborah Glass, the national study is assessing cancer, mortality and other possible health outcomes in Australian firefighters. The Australian Firefighters' Health Study is assembling a cohort of current and former firefighters by extracting data from existing computerised records held by nine participating firefighting agencies and the Department of Defence. The cohort of approximately 225,000 firefighters will include men and women, career, part-time and volunteer firefighters. Cancer and mortality outcomes will be obtained through data linkage with the Australian Cancer Database and the National Death Index. Existing historical occupational and incident data will be used to investigate any links between occupational firefighting and later cancer and death outcomes. In 2012, MonCOEH commenced the data collection phase. Each agency was asked to provide essential information such as names, dates of birth and postcodes of firefighters, together with service history information such as job title, number and type of fires attended. Data has so far been received from 8 of the 10 participating organisations. It is anticipated that the linkage to the Australian Cancer Database should be completed by the end of 2013, subject to all state and territory Ethics approvals and the agencies' data being received in a timely manner. No previous published study has undertaken analyses based on contemporary exposure incident data, therefore the use of this data is likely to result in more refined exposure assessment methods than those previously used. The study will give insight into differences in the overall cancer and death rates in Australian firefighters compared to those of the general population. The study will also compare cancer incidence and death rates for subgroups within the cohort, e.g. by agency, type of firefighter, duration of active firefighting, types of incidents attended and other exposure types. It will help to identify exposures which may be associated with increased risk of cancer and/or mortality among firefighters. Such findings will then be used to inform preventive strategies to better protect the health of future firefighters. www.coeh.monash.org/ausfireftr.html7New Research Centre of Critical Importance (Blood-CRE) Professor Jamie Cooper will lead the Centre of Research Excellence for Patient Blood Management in Critical Illness and Trauma The Centre of Research Excellence for Patient Blood Management in Critical Illness and Trauma at Monash University - the Blood-CRE - was established in 2012, with the announcement by the Federal Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Mark Butler MP , of $2.5 million in funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The Blood-CRE, led by Intensive Care physician Professor Jamie Cooper of the University's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine (DEPM), represents a consortia of national research and key organisations responsible for the regulation, manufacture, supply and surveillance of blood products, including the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, National Blood Authority, Transfusion Outcomes Research Collaborative (TORC), Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre (ANZIC-RC), Australian Defence Force, Australian and New Zealand Society for Blood Transfusion, and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcomes and Resource Evaluation (ANZICS-CORE).Transfusion of blood products is one of the most common medical procedures in hospital patients. Despite common usage, there is considerable uncertainty about the relative risks and benefits of transfusions, with a large and growing body of literature that questions the appropriateness of many common transfusion practices in terms of patient outcomes. In addition, current guidelines are based on inadequate evidence, and compliance with their recommendations is reputedly poor. The Blood-CRE coordinates a research strategy to evaluate current clinical practice through existing and extended clinical registries, conduct preliminary observational research and large multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and direct and evaluate the translation of evidence into policy and practice. Through their research findings, the Blood-CRE investigators strongly believe that their research strategy will drive policy and practice, increase blood transfusion research capacity, enhance and expand collaboration, improve patient outcomes and reduce costs for transfusion services.The Blood-CRE provides a solution to the critical problem of an unmet need with regard to the transfusion evidence- practice base. It provides a pathway by which the implementation of Patient Blood Management Guidelines can be optimised and monitored, and the transfusion evidence base improved. Transfusion policy will also be informed by knowledge generated by the Blood-CRE. This will assist in optimising transfusion practices to ensure demand does not outpace supply and that the outcomes for critically ill patients, for whom blood transfusion is vital for survival, are not compromised. In addition, it will develop greater research capacity in the fields of transfusion, critical care and military medicine by expanding established networks of current collaborators and creating new research partnerships that will maximise our ability to effect change in transfusion practice and improve patient outcomes. www.anzicrc.monash.org/blood-cre.html 8ASCEND Launched in Sri Lanka Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and their associated conditions are the fastest growing causes of disease burden in Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has predicted that the largest increases in deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes will occur in low and middle income countries. Monash University and its institutional partners in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India and the USA recognise that despite considerable public health, behavioural and social science research in the area of non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control, much of this research evidence is still to be adapted and applied in low-to middle income countries. In 2010, Professor Brian Oldenburg, along with his collaborators at Monash University Sunway, University of North Carolina in USA, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology in India and University of Colombo in Sri Lanka were awarded a grant from the US National institutes of Health, to develop and deliver a research training and capacity building program to improve the prevention and control of NCDs in Asia. In line with the WHO Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020, the Asian Collaboration for Excellence in Non-Communicable Disease (ASCEND) Program provides research training to early career researchers across Asia to strengthen their research capabilities and build a regional network of researchers who will lead research in the prevention and management of NCDs in the future.The ASCEND Training Program is coordinated and delivered on behalf of the ASCEND Research Network. The first ASCEND Program was launched in June 2011 at Monash Sunway with 25 trainees from Sri Lanka, India and Malaysia. An international network of researchers and institutions joined Sri Lanka's Health Minister, The Honourable Maithripala Sirisena, and acting Australian High Commissioner, Ms Sonya Koppe to launch the second program in Sri Lanka in June 2012, with 26 trainees from across the region. At the commencement of their program, trainees participate in a 3-week teaching block facilitated by experts in NCD prevention and control from Monash University and other collaborating institutes. Trainees also refine a research proposal with the support of the ASCEND faculty for conducting a 'real world' research project that is directly related to their current work and which will lead to practical outcomes for their home organisation and country. Trainees then return to their own country where they continue to develop their research projects whilst participating in fortnightly online sessions on research methods, leadership, writing for publication and health systems research. After 12 months, trainees return for a one week teaching block where they focus on the dissemination of their research findings and translation of evidence into policy and practice. The trainees' projects tackle important public health issues in their countries. Research projects have included the investigation of junk food advertising on television in Sri Lanka, the effectiveness of peer support interventions for physical activity in India and health seeking behaviours of patients in Malaysia. So far, a number of trainees have gone on to enrol in doctoral programs both in their own countries and internationally, including Monash University. Over a third of trainees have published in inter(national) journals and/or presented their research at national and international conferences. This blended model that combines face to face and online learning has proved attractive for participants who want to further develop their skills but who do not want to live overseas for extended periods of time. By conducting the majority of training in their own country and by encouraging and supporting the trainees to participate in local research, they learn how to tackle NCD prevention and control issues in their own context. The ASCEND Program model has attracted attention from the WHO, the International Diabetes Federation and institutes and universities across Africa and Asia. Individuals and institutes alike recognise that promoting and building capacity for quality research in low-to-middle income countries for the prevention and control of NCDs is vital. The ASCEND Program is playing a significant role in addressing the growing burden of disease in these countries. Website: www.med.monash.edu/ascend. Cohort 2 trainees from Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong in their 1st teaching block, Colombo, Sri Lanka, June 2012 9Jean Hailes Research Unit (JHRU) Moves to AMREP The Jean Hailes Research Unit (JHRU) is an innovative formal partnership between a community-based knowledge translation and clinical service, Jean Hailes for women's health (JH), and Monash University. Jean Hailes for women's health is a not- for-profit organisation founded in 1992 and named for Dr Jean Hailes, a medical practitioner who instigated one of the first menopause-specific health services in 1971: a multidisciplinary clinic focused on women's health at midlife. Dr Hailes was committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of women not only through comprehensive health care but also through the provision of high-quality, accessible health information. Jean Hailes died in 1988 and the Jean Hailes Foundation (JHF) was formed by a group of colleagues in her honour. JHF has evolved over the intervening two decades and now, in addition to the clinical service, it has an expert health education and health promotion arm with a primary focus on knowledge translation for the benefit of women, their families, and clinicians. It is a highly trusted entity with wide reach into both community and health professional groups. The importance of participating in knowledge generation as well as dissemination was understood by the JHF Board from the outset. The Jean Hailes Research Unit was established four years after JHF opened and was first led by Professor Susan Davis and later by Professor Helena Teede, both now SPHPM Professors of Women's Health. Research focused on identifying interactions among endocrine functioning and lifestyle factors in governing women's health, with the goal of translating evidence to optimise prevention. Recognising that there is 'no health without mental health', the Jean Hailes Chair in Women's Mental Health was established jointly by JHF and Monash University in March 2011. Jane Fisher was appointed as the first incumbent and, in September 2011 following the resignation of Professor Teede, Jean Hailes Professor of Women's Health and Director of the JHRU. The current JHRU program addresses the links between women's reproductive health and mental health from adolescence to mid-life, particularly related to fertility, infertility, pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period, and chronic non-communicable conditions. Current streams include: Mental health promotion in pregnant women and women who have recently given birth; women's mental health in the resource-constrained countries of the Asia-Pacific region; fertility management in Australia; the ramifications of cancer and its treatment for reproductive, sexual, and mental health; and the consequences of caring for children with special needs. In 2012 JHRU research was supported by competitively awarded grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC) with support from industry partners including the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne IVF, Family Planning Victoria, the Victorian Department of Health, the Australian Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, the Parenting Research Centre and the MLC, Besen Family, and Eirene Lucas Foundations. All projects benefit from the diverse capabilities of this collaborative entity, which ensures that women's perspectives inform all research and that findings are disseminated through multi-stranded strategies to women, their families, health professionals, and policy makers. In November 2012, JHRU staff were delighted to relocate to new offices on the ground floor of the Burnet Building. The School celebrated this occasion by hosting a morning tea attended by Janet Hailes Michelmore, a board member of the foundation and daughter of Dr Jean Hailes. www.jeanhailes.org.au/research Jean Hailes Research Unit10MARS: A New Division Within the School Graeme Schofield Oration MARS team Funeral cortege in Peru for missing persons recovered 25 years after their deaths during internal conflict. Copyright: CICR/ATAUJE, J.Established in 2012 under the direction of Professor Helena Teede, the Monash Applied Research Stream (MARS) delivers better health outcomes through applied research, education, clinical care and advocacy, with a strong focus on prevention and lifestyle related diseases including obesity, diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, mental health, and women's health. MARS has three research programs: The Women's Public Health Research Program which includes a Reproductive Women's Health unit, a Healthy Lifestyles unit, an Indigenous Women's Health unit and a Midlife and Menopausal Health unit. The diabetes and cardiovascular research program is closely integrated with the Southern Health Diabetes and Vascular Medicine Clinical unit and has a strong focus on health services research. The Clinical Research Support Program attracts a diverse array of clinical and research teams from across Southern Health. The Department of Forensic Medicine and the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM) jointly hosted the biennial Graeme Schofield Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine Oration this year. The Oration, named to honour the contributions made by Professor Graeme Schofield to the VIFM and to the advancement of forensic medicine generally, was entitled Hell's Kitchen: Post- conflict recovery and justice and featured two eminent speakers: The Honourable Kevin Parker AC RFD, former Judge and Vice President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Hon. K. Parker was a Permanent Judge on the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague from 2003 - 2011. His talk was Partners in Crime - Justice and Forensic Science. Dr Morris Tidball-Binz, Forensic Coordinator for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is based in Geneva, Switzerland. Dr Tidball-Binz spoke about the application of forensic sciences to human rights and humanitarian investigations, based on his forensic case-work in more than 40 nations. The Department of Forensic Medicine and the VIFM wishes to acknowledge the Schofield family's generous bequest to support forensic medicine. In time, this gift will expand to enable the Institute and the Department to assist forensic medicine capacity development internationally.More information can be found on: http://www.vifm.org/education-and-research/oration/The MARS Clinical Research Support Program provides a platform of expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial design, health services research and evaluation, data management and registry capability. In response to the success of the clinical research support program, a new Centre - The Monash Centre for Clinical Applied Research and Translation (MCART) - is being established. Investment has been secured from Southern Health as a partnership initiative and we look forward to building capacity for clinical applied research and translation at the Southern Health site of the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine and Monash University. www.med.monash.edu/sphpm/divisions/ mars11Infrastructure Platforms Data Management The Clinical Informatics and Data Management Unit (CIDMU) within the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (SPHPM) was established in 2003 to - manage large clinical datasets, develop web based and desk top applications for the collection and management of clinical information conduct randomised trials, clinical registries and public health projects. Commencing with a single full-time database manager in 2003, the Unit has grown over the past 10 years and now employs 30 highly trained software development, clinical research project and data management professionals. The current suite of services offered through the Unit includes: Electronic forms-based data capture systems (scan, fax and email). Web-based data capture and reporting systems. Desk-top based data capture and reporting systems. Web-based clinical trial randomisation services. Telephone based randomisation services. Case record form design. Clinical trial and registry development and management. Clinical trial design and statistical consulting services. Secure clinical file transfer services. Current activities of the Centre include the development of clinical data management systems for supporting clinical registries and high risk occupational cohorts and clinical trials with a client base. These include internal Monash research centres and external clinical organisations, government and non-government organisations. The Clinical Registry Program includes a number of registries for the Centre of Research Excellence Patient Safety (CREPS) such as the Prostate Cancer Registry and Victorian Lung Cancer Registry. External registry clients include The Alfred Hospital, Cabrini Hospital, Australian Rheumatology Association, the Colorectal Surgical Society of Australia, the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons, the Victorian Department of Health and Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC). Multinational cinical trial management systems have been developed for the US National Institute of Ageing sponsored ASPREE Study, the Asia Pacific Chest Pain Study, and the NHMRC sponsored POLAR, EPO-TBI, TRANSFUSE and PHARLAP trials for the ANZ Intensive Care research Centre. Observational epidemiological and cohort studies data management systems have been developed for the Monash Centre for Occupational Health, the Peter McCallum Cancer Institute (Cancer 2015), WorkSafe Victoria (Victorian Healthy Worker Project) and the Road Traffic Authority (Live-tribe, P Drivers Project). Professor Chris Reid12Registries The School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine is a leader in the establishment, management and analysis of clinical registries. What are Clinical Registries? Clinical registries collect a small amount of key information about people treated in hospitals for conditions such as trauma, cancer and heart disease. The information is collected in an identical fashion from each participating clinician and hospital. Outcomes of treatment are also measured in a systematic fashion and analysed statistically to allow different units and clinicians to compare the success of their treatment. Registries are also used to monitor the safety of new drugs, devices and surgical procedures so that problems can be identified and fixed at the earliest opportunity. The importance of registries as a strategy for improving safety and quality of healthcare is being recognised internationally. They are increasingly seen as indispensable for measuring access to and appropriateness of care. In Sweden about 25% of medical encounters are captured on a registry. How do Registries work? SPHPM has developed particular expertise in developing and maintaining clinical quality registries; a subset of registries which focuses on improving the safety and quality of healthcare. This is achieved by providing high quality outcome data to clinicians which may stimulate competition and help with the early identification of problems. High quality data Clinical registries pay meticulous attention to collecting complete, accurate and epidemiologically sound data. This means that results generated from clinical registries are respected by clinicians and stimulate action when outliers are identified. Registry governance Clinicians, epidemiologists, consumers and administrators all play a key role in managing a registry. Through the governance committee of each registry they address the multitude of legal, ethical, organisational and financial issues that affects every registry.Operating Principles for Clinical Registries SPHPM worked with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare to develop national operating principles for clinical quality registries. These operating principles have been endorsed by Australian Health Ministers. Their purpose was to: provide a means of improving existing clinical registries and enhancing the value of the information they provide; provide guidance for the establishment and maintenance of new Australian Clinical Quality Registries aiming to measure quality of care; and suggest a best practice model to which both new and existing Australian Clinical Quality Registries should adhere. Funding agencies such as the Department of Human Services and Human Research Ethics Committees are using this document as the basis for determining the standard of clinical registries they review. SPHPM Registries The School houses the following registries monitoring procedures, diseases or healthcare services: Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) National Database Program* Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD)* Bi-National Burns Registry (Bi-NBR) * Breast Device Registry* Massive Transfusion Registry Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) Registry Prostate Cancer Registry* REACH Registry Surveillance of Australian workplace based respiratory events (SABRE) Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Registry Venous Thromboembolism Registry Victorian Lung Cancer Registry* Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR)* Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR)* Bariatric Registry Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (VCOR*) Thromboembolism cohort School collaborates strongly with the following registries: Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Registry* Colorectal Cancer Registry (with Cabrini Health)* Victorian Cardiac Arrest Registry Australian & New Zealand Intensive Care Adult Registry * Denotes a clinical quality registryDr Sue Evans, Head of the Registries Program13Biostatistical Consulting Service It is well recognised that regardless of discipline, research depends on statistical methods, both in the design of experiments or surveys and in the analysis and interpretation of results. We offer our biostatistical services to doctoral students and academic staff across Monash University and researchers located at the Alfred Hospital, other Monash-affiliated hospitals and external health service groups. Staff within the Biostatistical Consulting Service are actively involved in teaching biostatistics to medical, biomedical and health science undergraduate and postgraduate students and to students in postgraduate degrees specialising in biostatistics. ASPREE Professor John McNeil Associate Professor Robyn Woods ASPREE (ASPirin in R educing Events in the Elderly) is a primary prevention aspirin study of 16,000 healthy Australians (and 3,000 from the US) aged 70 plus to determine if aspirin can keep older people healthier and disability-free for longer. By December 2012, almost 10,000 healthy elderly had volunteered to be in ASPREE, forming the largest and one of the most ambitious clinical trials ever undertaken in the country. The Adelaide ASPREE Clinical Trial Centre was the last to open in 2012. It was yet another addition to 12 existing ASPREE clinical trial centres established in metropolitan, regional and rural areas in Victoria, Tasmania, SA, NSW and the ACT. ASPREE has become one of the largest resources available for researchers to examine issues associated with healthy ageing in Australia. Of note is a major sub- study, ALSOP (ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Ageing Persons), which has involved sending social and medical questionnaires annually to ASPREE participants. Almost 90% of the questionnaires were returned completed. ALSOP will link clinical information collected in the main ASPREE study with participants' social circumstances, diet, dental health, vision and hearing, medication use and other lifestyle, social and environmental factors that may influence the ability to age well. ALSOP will also capture participants' past and current vocational activities, transition to retirement and their current participation in volunteer and unpaid caring roles. The result is an unprecedented scope and depth of information to identify factors that influence healthy ageing in Australia.

The Award is named in honour of Professor Frank Fenner, an Australian pioneer of viral research who played a central part in the global eradication of smallpox, chairing the World Health Organization Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication. Professor Fenner was an active member of ASID and was the patron of the society from 2000 until his death in late 2010. The Fenner award is the premier award recognized by ASID and is based on a substantial portfolio of original research. Associate Professor Cheng's research papers were selected from over 100 published papers and 17 book chapters since 1997, including 29 publications arising from his doctoral studies. The papers comprised a diverse range of areas within infectious diseases, including tropical medicine, severe sepsis, epidemiology, influenza, infection control and antibiotic pharmacokinetics. Associate Professor Cheng has also contributed to the field of infectious diseases as foundation member of the Clinical Guidelines Committee (and current Co-chair) and the Clinical Research Network. He has led the writing of national guidelines for the clinical management of H1N1/09 influenza and Clostridium difficile infection and is one of two infectious diseases physicians on the Australian Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM; formerly Australian Drug Evaluation Committee). In addition to serving as the current ASID representative on the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia (CDNA), Associate Professor Cheng is a member of the Influenza Surveillance Strategy Working Group (ISSWG) and has been a technical advisor to World Health Organisation initiatives, including the Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness Clinical Manual and the Epidemic Alert and Response Clinical Network. Roger Wurm Award for Health and Wellbeing after Breast Cancer Study Professor Robin Bell received the Roger Wurm Award in 2012 for the best scientific presentation at the Australian Society for Psychosocial Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ASPOG) conference in Melbourne. The Award, named after Adelaide obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr Roger Wurm, who founded ASPOG in 1973, recognises the psychosocial aspects of women's health, particularly in the field of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive medicine. At the conference, Professor Bell presented her findings in relation to the psychological wellbeing of women with breast cancer, their sexual function, their beliefs about what caused their cancer and the lifestyle changes they made after diagnosis. Professor Bell's paper covered various aspects of the Bupa Health Foundation Health and Wellbeing After Breast Cancer Study. The prospective cohort study of 1683 women with their first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer were recruited through the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed using annual questionnaires for a minimum of 5 years from the time of their diagnosis. The study was initially funded through the NHMRC Centre of Clinical Research Excellence for the study of Women's Health at Monash University and has been supported in more recent years by a range of organisations including the Bupa Health Foundation and the Victorian Cancer Agency. The study has also received philanthropic support from Connie and Craig Kimberley, Roy Morgan Research, the L.E.W. Carty Trust and the Jack and Robert Smorgon Families Foundation. The 38 th annual ASPOG conference was important for the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine as several groups within the school are working in women's health research. There were a number of presentations from SPHPM staff and students at the conference, including Professor Helena Teede, Professor Jane Fisher, Dr Sara Holton, Dr Maggie Kirkman, Ms Samantha Kozica and Dr Karin Wynter as well as Dr Heather Rowe, who was also the Conference Convenor. The objectives of ASPOG are: To promote the scholarly, scientific and clinical study of the psychosomatic aspects of obstetrics and gynaecology including reproductive medicine. To promote scientific research into psychosocial problems of obstetrics and gynaecology. To promote scientific programs designed to increase awareness of and understanding of psychosomatic problems affecting women and men during their reproductive years.15Ambulance Study wins Stawell Prize (L to R): Dr Richard Stawell on behalf of AMA (Vic) presenting Stawell Prize to Professor John McNeil, Dr Judy Lowthian and Professor Just Sotelwinder Professor Helena Teede inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll A study investigating the increasing demand for ambulance services by an ageing population was awarded the Australian Medical Association's (Vic) prestigious 2012 Stawell Prize. The study was part of Dr Judy Lowthian's doctoral research program which investigated the underlying drivers of demand for emergency ambulance and emergency department services across metropolitan Melbourne. 'The challenges of population ageing: accelerating demand for emergency ambulance services by older patients, 1995-2015' (Med J Aust 2011; 194 (11): 574-578) analysed data collected by Ambulance Victoria for all emergency ambulance transportations in metropolitan Melbourne over a 14-year period from 1995 to 2008, and also modelled demand in the financial year 2014-15. A rise in emergency transportations was identified over the study period, beyond that expected from demographic changes. The increase was disproportionately driven by older patients, with the very elderly (aged 85 years or more) eight times as likely to be transported as those aged 45-69 years over the time period. Study authors included Dr Judy Lowthian, the late Associate Professor Damien Jolley, Dr Andrea Curtis, Alexander Currell, Monash Researcher on a Roll Professor Helena Teede was inducted onto the 2012 Victorian Honour Roll of Women at Parliament House on March 6th, as a part of 2012 International Women's Day activities. The Minister for Women's Affairs, the Hon Mary Wooldridge presented the award, recognising Professor Teede's commitment to improving the health of the Australian community through best practice clinical research, prevention and treatment programs, strategic planning and health care leadership. Each year, the Honour Roll acknowledges and pays tribute to women from across Victoria who have succeeded through vision, leadership, commitment and hard work. It is a reminder of the significant contribution women have made to Victoria. Since its inception in 2001 as part of Victoria's Centenary of Federation celebrations, 498 women have been inducted onto the Honour Roll. Professor Teede is committed to the health of the community through a cross sector approach including world class research, best practice in clinical care, education and translation of evidence into practice with a focus on engaging with policy makers. She leads and mentors young researchers and multidisciplinary clinicians. Professor Teede is a tireless advocate for optimal wellbeing, prevention of disease, patient centred care and for translation of research evidence into practice to improve quality health care outcomes on behalf of women vulnerable to chronic disease. As a female clinician and researcher with a young family she also provides a flexible and supportive work environment and is a role model for young women in these fields. She is an active clinician in diabetes, obesity and women's health and consultant at Jean Hailes for women's health (JH). She has contributed vastly to improve quality and health outcomes for Australians through leading edge research and practical health education of evidence into practice. She led the development of the first evidence- based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in 2011.Professor Peter Cameron, Professor Johannes Stoelwinder and Professor John McNeil. The annual Stawell Prize is awarded for a piece of research 'on a medical subject of clinical significance, which is original, evidence-based and likely to advance knowledge, influence clinical practice and improve the health of Australians'. It is hoped this new knowledge will contribute to better understanding the reasons for the increase in demand for ambulance services and the associated issues.

Uncertainty persists around the balance of benefits versus risks of low dose aspirin for primary prevention in the elderly. The primary aim is to determine if regular, low dose aspirin prolongs healthy, disability-free life in those aged 70 years and over. The trial will, for the first time in the world, weigh the potential benefits versus the risks, such as bleeding, in healthy older people. ASPREE is a large-scale, double-blind randomised, placebo-controlled trial of low dose aspirin that aims to recruit up to 19,000 people (16,000 from Australia and 3,000 from the US). Participants are randomly assigned to take 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin or a placebo tablet daily and will undergo annual health checks for an average of five years.

We continue to work on understanding the pathogenesis of knee OA. This has been underpinned by the ability to non-invasively examine joint structures with magnetic resonance imaging. The use of this technique has enabled us to explore the relationship between obesity and body composition and the association of these factors in OA. The results of some very exciting new work have provided evidence for the role of metabolic factors in knee OA. This offers potential for novel approaches to the treatment of knee OA. Parallel work is also continuing that explores the effect of physical activity on joint health. We also commenced an NHMRC funded study aimed at determining whether Vitamin D prevents progression of knee osteoarthritis. Following the success of the work in the knee, we are turning our attention to the hip, foot and back. These areas are relatively under-investigated but are major causes of pain and disability in the ageing population. Website: www.med.monash.edu.au/ epidemiology/units-centres/muscskel/ Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology - Cabrini Institute Professor Rachelle Buchbinder (Director) The focus of the Department of Clinical Epidemiology is to perform high quality clinical research with an emphasis on answering clinically important questions that can be translated into better quality patient care and outcomes. We have performed an array of randomised controlled trials of promising new treatments for a range of musculoskeletal conditions. We manage the Australian Rheumatology Association Database, which is assessing the long-term health of patients with arthritis and particularly the outcomes of new therapies. The Department also houses one of the editorial bases for the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (the other base is in Ottawa, Canada). Other major focuses have included determining interventions directed at the patient and the healthcare provider and at a policy level that have the potential to improve the ability of patients to function effectively in the health care system (health literacy). We have also been involved in the World Health Organisation Global Burden of Disease project to estimate the global burden for musculoskeletal conditions, particularly back and neck pain. Various local, national and international bodies support the Department's Unit Associate Professor Karin Leder (Head) The research of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit (within the Division of Clinical Epidemiology) covers a broad range of topics. These include the burden of communicable diseases, vaccination, modelling of infectious diseases, traveller/ immigrant health, and communicable disease surveillance. The Unit is also involved in studies of specific infectious diseases (such as nosocomial infections, influenza and measles) that represent important problems in clinical practice and in the development of national and international management guidelines. Part of the work of the Unit falls under the Division of Occupational and Environmental Health, which addresses issues around environmental impacts on infections, water quality and public health.

Website: www.med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/ cidmu/Professor Andrew Forbes Professor Chris Reid VCOR site data management training in progress.33Epidemiological Modelling Unit Professor Andrew Forbes (Acting Head) This Epidemiological Modelling Unit focusses on developing epidemiological modelling to improve the effectiveness of chronic disease and disability prevention in Australia. The costs and benefits of preventive health interventions will often occur many years into the future. This is well beyond the maximum five to six years that is studied by most prevention trials. Prediction of long-term benefits requires statistical epidemiological modeling. This is modelling that integrates information from a variety of data sources, including clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The aim of the Unit is to develop epidemiological models that can assist policy-makers to make more informed choices about which preventive programs to fund, and to improve the ability of clinicians to provide accurate preventive advice and increase the ability of consumers to make decisions about preventive activities (that may relate to themselves or their communities).

The unit also manages the NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Australian Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (Aus-ROC), the NHMRC funded RINSE trial (The rapid infusion of cold normal saline by paramedics during CPR) and the Safe Emergency Elderly Discharge (SEED) project funded by an Alfred Health Research Grant. Website: www.med.monash.edu.au/ epidemiology/traumaepi/index_traumaepi. html Transfusion Research Unit Associate Professor Erica Wood (Head) The Transfusion Research Unit (TRU) was formed at the beginning of 2010. TRU is the home of the Transfusion Outcomes Research Collaborative (TORC), a partnership between the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and Monash University's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine (DEPM). This collaboration has been pivotal to the design and progress of pioneering transfusion research in Australia. Under the auspices of TORC, TRU has worked with clinical leaders to establish new national registries to collect information about conditions requiring major transfusion support, including the Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Registry and a bi-national Massive Transfusion Registry. TORC has also collaborated in data linkage activities with other large established clinical registries to better understand transfusion practice in trauma, cardiac surgery and ICU and develop models to predict and monitor blood use. In collaboration with the Epidemiological Modelling and Infectious Diseases Units, TORC is developing a model of clinical demand for blood products, which will enable the study of the impact of major blood shortages, such as during disasters or pandemics. New activities include the establishment of a registry for haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease) and exploration of the implementation of new national patient blood management guidelines. TORC holds educational seminars to bring together clinicians, policy makers and researchers, and is also collaborating with Oxford's Systematic Reviews Initiative to conduct systematic reviews of the evidence base for transfusion practice. The TRU also manages other blood-related activities such as the venous thromboembolism cohort study, and the myeloma and related disorders http://www.med.monash. edu.au/epidemiology/units-centres/ transfusionresearch/index_transfusion.html and www.torc.org.au' Associate Professor Belinda Gabbe Associate Professor Erica Wood 43 Monash Applied Research Stream Women's Public Health Research Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Research Centre for Clinical Effectiveness (Monash Innovation & Quality, Southern Health) Clinical Research Support Services: Monash Biostatistical Research Support 44Women's Public Health Research Professor Helena Teede (Head) The research team encompasses research fellows, students and staff with a variety of backgrounds including medicine (endocrinology, obstetrics, vascular medicine), basic science, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, nursing and health promotion.

This investment is evidenced by the establishment of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency in 2011, the Victorian Government's contribution under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, and Medicare Locals. A wide range of organisations require people to analyse health data, plan for health needs, and deliver population health programs. Bachelor of Health Science provides knowledge of the health sector and the factors influencing health, as well as skills in information management and analysis, program development, delivery and evaluation. The course is a generalist three year degree in health, suitable for a range of students, including those interested in health but unsure of their career pathway, those interested in health promotion and health research careers and those who are using the course as a pathway to clinical roles. Many graduates go on to further study in health, for example by doing an Honours year with our School in order to develop research skills, or undertaking studies for specific clinical roles such as nursing. In 2012, we ran the full program of the new Bachelor of Health Science (BHSc) for the first time, with 28 units running across Semesters 1 and 2, including five third year units which ran for the first time. While most of the teaching staff moved from Caulfield Campus to the Alfred, we have retained a suite of offices and a reception desk at Caulfield campus, where students come into contact with staff. An increasing number of academic staff from across the School are now teaching within the program. We experienced the largest ever number of student enrolments (311) in 2012. This represents a 24% increase on 2011, and includes 189 BHSc, 96 BHSc /Bachelor of Social Work and 26 BHS/Bachelor of Business students. An increasing number of students in other degrees are also undertaking Health Science units, including those enrolled in Nursing, Biomedical Science and other courses within the Faculty (36 students) and from outside the Faculty (36 students). 2012 also saw our first cohort of 22 graduates from the new BHSc program. We will follow the progress of these graduates with interest. Many have progressed to further study in our own Honours program, and in a range of health related and other programs. In 2012 the Honours degree of Bachelor of Health Science (BHSc(Hons)) which commenced in 2010 was relocated from the Caulfield campus to the Alfred precinct, and course content was revised and enhanced. This move allows students to more readily engage with the very active research environment within the Alfred precinct, and to be located near their supervisors. Six students undertook the program in 2012, and all successfully completed their Honours degree, with some excellent results obtained. Enrolments have almost doubled in 2013, consolidating the degree and its significance as a pathway to research careers. In 2012, Honours students undertook projects supervised by a range of SPHPM (and other) academic staff, in areas including pulmonary rehabilitation, health promotion program evaluation, access to reproductive health services for women with special needs, and the mental health of prisoners. A range of projects are available to students in 2013, drawing on the wide research interests represented in SPHPM. We anticipate that the BHSc(Hons) program will become the most significant of the three Honours programs currently offered within SPHPM. Most enrolments in the BHSc(Hons) programs are from students who have completed the Bachelor of Health Science or the BHSc/BSW double degree, however students from the MBBS program undertaking the BMedSci(Hons)(Global) program may also enrol in the BHSc(Hons) program, and students who have completed other undergraduate degrees to the required academic standard are also able to undertake the BHSc(Hons) program, and have successfully done so. Website: www.monash.edu/study/coursefinder/course/3882/ Bachelor of Health Science Students48 With a keen interest in public health, social justice and human rights, Ame Pocklington has recently returned from Timor Leste where she volunteered for three weeks. Ame is keen and ready to start the Honours year of her double degree (Bachelor of Health Science and Bachelor of Social Work). Ame is involved in a volunteer organisation, Friends of Baguia, a community organisation that supports the people of Baguia in a number of local projects. On her second volunteer trip to Timor Leste, Ame helped install water tanks to provide clean drinking water, supported a computer skills training program and taught classes about malaria. \"I always wanted to gain skills and knowledge that would allow me to work with disadvantaged communities and to make a difference in the world,\" says Ame. \"The Bachelor of Health Science and Bachelor of Social Work is enabling me to work in public health and to make real changes at a community level.\" Ame believes the disciplines of health science and social work complement each other. \"Social work provides good perspectives on individual counselling, working with disadvantaged people and how to be considerate of difference,\" says Ame, \"while Health Science has given me the tools to work in a community development context, and to understand what makes some populations healthier than others.\" \"The best part of my course is its diversity,\" says Ame. \"I've studied units in public health, global health, population health, program management, social policy and biology. I have acquired a broad range of skills which I can use when I enter the workforce.\" Ame says that learning about the determinants of health has been the best part of her course. \"I have a really strong framework for analysing health issues from a population level.\" Ame adds that understanding global health and patterns of health and disease around the world is important in addressing disadvantage. \"The Bachelor of Health Science has not only given me insight into public health issues but has also provided me with program development and program management skills to make a positive contribution to communities.\"Ms Ame Pocklington: A 3rd year Bachelor of Health Science and Social Work StudentBachelor of Health Science/Bachelor of Social Work Student Making a Difference in Disadvantaged Communities49Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery A number of SPHPM staff are actively involved in teaching the MBBS programme, including Professor Robin Bell, Dr Robert Hall, Professor Just Stoelwinder, Associate Professor Dragan Ilic, Dr David Goddard, Dr Helen Ackland and Professor Robert Burton. The School mainly teaches into Theme 2, 'Population, Society, Health and Illness' of the MBBS programme. This theme includes units in Health, knowledge and society Population health Community based practice and health promotion Occupational and environmental medicine Evidence-based clinical practice Health systems, management and policy Health Knowledge and Society and Population Health Dr Helen Ackland coordinates the Health, Knowledge and Society unit in the first semester of the first year and Professor Robin Bell coordinates the Population Health Unit in second semester of the first year. Ms Penny Robinson coordinates the tutors for the Population Health unit as well as contributing to the lecture program and curriculum development. Community Based Practice and Health Promotion Second year students at Clayton and Sunway undertake a unit in the community based practice program on health promotion. Professor Robin Bell coordinates and teaches this unit, together with Dr Craig Hassed from the Department of General Practice. This unit introduces students to community based organizations and is their first contact with patients and clients where they learn about their professional role. A key component in this unit is learning about the place of health promotion in modern health care. Students undertake a group research project with the community based organization. The Chris Silagy Award is presented each year for the best project. Occupational and Environmental Medicine Dr David Goddard and Dr Andrea James coordinate the unit in occupational and environmental medicine in the second semester of Year 3 and Year B of the graduate entry medical course. Evidence Based Clinical Practice (EBCP) EBCP is coordinated by Associate Professor Dragan Ilic. The unit aims to equip students with the skills to identify, appraise and integrate the best available evidence to their clinical training and practice. Associate Professors Dragan Ilic and Elmer Villanueva have worked together to develop the program which is delivered to graduate entry medical students. The EBCP program was also exclusively delivered as online teaching to over 400 4 th year MBBS students across all metropolitan Melbourne and rural sites in the Gippsland region, Australia and Malaysia. Health Systems Management and Policy (HSMP) HSMP is delivered to over 450 students in the 4th year of the MBBS course in Clayton and Sunway Malaysia, and in Year C of the graduate entry program. The aim of this program is to provide background knowledge and understanding about health systems and policy issues that affect clinical practice. Issues covered include the coordination of clinical care through mechanisms such as guidelines and pathways, team work and case management, patient safety, risk management, clinical governance, accountability and strategies to change clinical practice. Teaching materials are presented online and weekly discussion groups are moderated by senior medical administrators and practitioners50Undergraduate and Graduate Entry Medical Law Programs The Department of Forensic Medicine teaches medical law to both the undergraduate and graduate stream medical students at Monash University. It covers ten key areas of law relevant to clinical practice and uses over 60 medical lawyers, clinicians to deliver small group tutorials to students in most years of the two medical degrees. In 2012 Associate Professor David Ranson took over the coordination of the medical law tutorial programs. A number of changes to the teaching methods were initiated to update the program including the gradual introduction of on-line methods and more content in the latter years of the medical degrees. Bachelor of Biomedical Science The School taught four units of the BBiomedSc program in 2012, including two core units, Biomedical Science and Society and Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology: NCD, obesity and injury. Two elective units were also taught - Introduction to the Health System and Contemporary Health Challenges. The School hosted 3rd year BBiomedSc students for short-term rotations and research placements, providing exposure to public health and applied clinical research, and to public health practice, learning how health is maintained and how illness is controlled at local, regional and national levels. We continued to teach into the BBiomedSc Honours program in conjunction with the Baker IDI and the Burnet. Elements of Forensic Medicine For 23 years, the Department of Forensic Medicine and the Faculty of Law have jointly offered teaching to undergraduate law students in the Elements of Forensic Medicine unit, a unique option in the Law curriculum. Each year Emeritus Professor Louis Waller and Professor Stephen Cordner provide current and relevant information to students using a variety of sources. The unit continued to be popular with 44 students enrolled in 2012 Each year the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine Prize for Elements of Forensic Medicine, which is sponsored by the Department of Forensic Medicine, is awarded to the student who achieves the highest mark. This year the $500 prize was awarded Ms Irene Drossinos for being the best student in 2011. The 2012 prize will be announced in 2013. Honours Information night at SPHPM51 The SPHPM Summer Vacation Program This year, 27 students received scholarships from the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine to experience medical research first hand by participating in the summer vacation program. The program attracted a wide range of students currently completing degrees in Bachelor of Health Science, Biomedical Science, Medicine and Surgery, Engineering, Science, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing and Emergency Health. Each of the students worked with a senior researcher within the school to undertake a small research project or contribute to current research in applied clinical and public health research. As part of the program, the students visited the Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department and the William Buckland Radiotherapy Centre at the Alfred Hospital and the Department of Health. This year they also spent time with ambulance staff and observed the pressures faced by the pre-hospital and emergency teams in their day to day work. The overall consensus was that the program provided students with a better idea of the work involved in establishing and completing a research project, as well as honing their statistical and applied research skills. They were also able to meet with physicians doing both research and clinical practice which demonstrated to students that there are many career options within medicine. The highlight for many of the students was completing a research paper and being listed as a co-author of a published work. \"As well as learning new skills, I will be presenting a paper in April 2013 where I get to show others how my research contributes to new ideas,\" explained student Stephanie Di Palma, Top Student of the Year. \"I love reading and learning, and this program has shown me that there are alternatives to being a doctor,\" said Jihan Ibrahim-Dost.

What we hope will be the end resolution, Is maintaining ventricular constitution. Patients must have a big heart attack, With the left ventricle having copped a fair whack! But an AMI of the right kind, Is not as easy as you'd think to find. Recruitment criteria is strict and specific, Troponin rise, ST changes, the list is not terrific! Time limits, echos and PCI, EF values and blood results, all of which apply. It's not very often that these patients present, English speaking, under 70 and willing to consent. But to make it happen and chase this dream, Who else better than the Clin Pharm team? With Captain Henry, Susie and Marina, Robyn, Ingrid, Carolyn and Sarina. We are team awesome, we are the best, And with these superstars, you'd expect nothing less. Heart attacks can have grave complications, With infarcts upsetting important foundations. The heart tries to pump with increased vigour, But alas, the ventricle just keeps getting bigger.But what can be done to stop this outcome, To which the heart will eventually succumb? With patients and doctors all in dismay, Along comes seaweed to save the day! Into the coronaries the seaweed's injected, With heart remodelling to then be affected. By forming a structure around the ventricle, The seaweed helps keep the heart symmetrical.Provided we can see the heart silhouette, It is injected within five days of on-set. It starts off a liquid and becomes a gel, Calcium is what converts it, in a heart-muscle cell.You'd wonder from something so bazaar, How good the results have been thus far. The study is being conducted world-wide, And thankfully no one is yet to have died.We hope one day this'll be part of the norm, With patients post-MI in tip-top form. To be involved in this study, I am very grateful, And of promising results, I am very faithful.

It especially focuses on developing skills in the quantitative methods of the population-based health sciences and their problem solving application for primary care provision both in Australia and developing countries. Students were offered specialisation by the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine (DEPM) in the following areas: Public Health Biostatistics Clinical Research Methods Health Services Management International Health Occupational and Environmental Health DEPM's postgraduate courses attracted students from a wide range of medical and allied health backgrounds, including medical, nursing, physiotherapy, pharmacy and health management. The majority of specialisations offered courses as Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma or a Masters program. The department taught over 80 units, mainly in an off campus mode i.e. on-line plus block days. The most popular program within the School is the Master of Public Health under the coordination of Professor Flavia Cicuttini. The Department of Forensic Medicine offered the Master of Forensic Program. This program, catering for medical and dental practitioners working (or proposing to work) in the field of forensic medicine, is the only course of its kind in the English speaking world. The course fills a unique niche in the educational domain of clinical forensic medicine and enables forensic medical practitioners and forensic odontologists to practice within the framework of ethical, medical and legal principles, standards and rules. 53 Jeff Davey, a former CEO of one of Victoria's largest aged care not for profit organisations, was often frustrated by the lack of evidence to support policy decisions. To position his organisation as a value added provider to government, he realised that it was vital to conduct epidemiology research to enhance service quality. Initially wanting to develop his ability to properly manage the research team, Jeff commenced a Master of Public Health (MPH) at the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Looking at the various offerings, he chose the Monash MPH because of its reputation as a top tier course which teaches the evidence based quantitative skills required to better interface with government and evaluate public health delivery outcomes. \"The Monash MPH offered me convenience of online delivery, excellent content and the academic rigour that I require to develop my skills in epidemiological research\", Jeff said. \"My experience, particularly within the aged care sector, is that there are lot of people doing a lot of good things, but much of it is not evidence based. I believe there is a tremendous opportunity for managers and leaders to have a much more rigorous basis for their management and professional practice and the MPH is a fantastic way to get that.\" Drawing on his 20 years of experience within the aged care sector, Jeff acknowledges that his MPH has changed the way he thinks about health service delivery. He now feels better able to engage with practitioners on both a strategic and operational level as well as contribute to policy development, work with government and use evidence to evaluate service delivery efficiencies. \"I just wish I had these skills years ago. The evidence based and epidemiological based approach I have gained from the MPH will really help me and the industry.\"Mr Jeffrey Davey: MPH StudentApplying Epidemiological Skills Gathered Through the MPH Course in Industry54Doctoral Training Our doctoral program has trained many health professionals for senior careers in public health. The program has continued to grow and attracts students from around Australia and globally. In 2012, we had 133 continuing and 26 new PhD students enrolled, including 12 Doctor of Public Health (DPH) students. Ten of these DPH students were in the Victorian Public Health training Scheme. Nineteen PhD students were examined and passed. The students are from many backgrounds, including medicine, science, physiotherapy, public health, psychology and nursing. The progress of students is facilitated by a very strong research environment, with an extensive program of NHMRC funded research and access to extensive infrastructure. Support includes assistance in biostatistics, data management, computing and support from experienced staff and a large student body. We also have a coordinator of Good Research Governance, who advises doctoral students on the development of protocols and adherence to strict research guidelines. Dr Elizabeth Douglas (elizabeth.douglas@monash.edu) coordinated the 2012 PhD program, and Ms Lindy Friswell assisting in her role as doctoral program administrator. The following doctoral students won awards during the year: Ms Melanie Gibson-Helm International Journal of Endocrinology Travel Grant (1 of 16 awards from a conference of over 2000 abstracts) to attend the International Congress of Endocrinology/European Congress of Endocrinology held in Florence, Italy in May 2012.

Mr Victor Hoe (L) receiving his award for the 'best oral presentation ' at the 1st APCEEBM conference55 For Marsha Ivey, growing up in the Caribbean made her realise the importance of tackling public health issues at a global level. Non-chronic communicable diseases are a major issue, both globally and in her region, yet the research was lacking. \"I was always interested in maths and health so I completed a BSc, majoring in mathematics. Looking for a way to apply my skills to help solve public health problems, I worked as a research assistant and became fascinated with statistics.\" She completed an MSc in statistics and commenced work at the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, initially as a data manager and then statistician. This work required Marsha to interact with public health professionals from different countries. Passionate about a career in public health, Marsha finished a second Masters degree, this time in Public Health, and decided to undertake a PhD at Monash University. \"PhDs are not always about going into academia, they are about building skills for life. As such, a PhD can take you on another path such as business, non-government organisations or, in my case, working at either an NGO or a regional public institution.\" For Marsha, the most important thing is being able to give back to her region by contributing to the development of public health. \"I am hoping that with my skills and past experience, I will be able to work with a new institute that is being established in my region. My Monash PhD gives the credibility to take my career to a new level where I can influence public health decision making and implement changes that will help my region.\" As well as academic skills, Marsha's PhD has connected her with leading researchers around the world. \"For me, my PhD is more than skill building. It's people building and establishing links with other international researchers which I can tap into when I return home.\"Ms Marsha Ivey: PhD Student at SPHPMPhD Student at SPHPM, Developing a Network of Collaborators for her Future56Short Courses The SPHPM Short course program consists of specialised courses delivered by experts in a variety of research areas.
