I didn't even think it was possible to feel as good as I do now! She ran very specific tests that helped reveal issues no other doctor had ever addressed and helped me work on some dietary and lifestyle improvements as well. I really prefer the holistic approach since she focuses on getting to the root of your symptoms, not just throwing some antibiotics at you that just ultimately make things worse. She is extremely thorough and helpful each time I see her and really gives me her full attention. I can tell she really cares. Yes, visits and treatments tend to be more expensive than a traditional doctor, but it's true that you can't put a price on your health, and she has definitely been a testament to that. The best money I have every spent has been at Trio, my quality of life has significantly improved since seeing her. I don't know where I would be without Dr. Morgan! - 5/4/2021 I needed to post this review to explain how thankful Iam to have found Dr Morgan! I was in terrible shape suffering from continuous UTIs, I could barely get out of bed and had brain fog all day everyday, I also had gut issues and was constipated all the time! I had seen so many doctors which whom all had told me everything was fine, yet I felt terrible! Dr Morgan was a great listener and brought me so much comfort immediately. She ran my blood work and immediately treated the causes, because I had a lot! C\u00e1ndida, adrenal fatigue, hormonal in balance, thyroid to mention a few!! I felt immediate progress as soon as I started to follow her protocol and drinking my supplements she suggested. If anyone is going through similar issues I highly recommend going to trio ASAP! Dr Morgan once again thank you for all that you do! - 12/13/2020 Dr Kelly Morgan--and the entire team at Trio Natural Medicine are a first class act! Dr. Morgan is not only knowledgeable, but very kind, accommodating, & thorough. She is both patient & understanding. Her bedside manner immediately put me at ease. I did quite a lot of research seeking out a top rated naturopath and was delighted to learn Trio Natural Medicine was less than 10 minutes from my home. Dr. Morgan's education, training, & experience give me great confidence that she will help me get to the root cause of my health issues (I.e. chemical sensitivity & GI/food sensitivity). I am very optimistic that with her wisdom & proper testing (I love that she tests and doesn't just guess) we will resolve my lingering health issues. - 5/30/2019 I have been on bioidentical hormone replacement for 20 years. Moving to different states is not easy when you need to find a good Dr. That knows what they are doing. I moved from the east coast several years ago and it took me awhile to find Dr. Morgan. She balanced everything and helped me loose 30 lbs. Then I moved again! I could not find anyone in the south that understands bioidentical hormone therapy. Now we have phone visits and I go to see her when I visit my kids. Thank goodness! Highly recommend - 1/11/2019 I went there after years of suffering with IBS and fatigue. I just received my diagnosis and it was explained in detail and understandable. I am starting treatment and finally feel like there is hope to feeling normal again. The staff is responsive and very courteous and professional. - 7/20/2021 I have been to Trio Natural Medicine several times now and the service has always been great. I was greeted with a smile and always received excellent service. So far I have only had the vitamin injections but plan to try more services in the future. It's great to have a place like this in the South Bay. - 8/10/2020 Normally I am not one to write negative reviews online, but when it comes to medical care I think it is incredibly important so that people are receiving proper care. When I came to Trio Natural Medicine my health was in absolute disarray and I was rapidly deteriorating. The doctors here missed SO many things that were glaringly obvious. The blood tests that they did run were completely insufficient and every doctor I saw after commented how the blood tests ran here were no where near enough. The fact that they did not test me for autoimmune and run an ANA is mind blowing to me as it is such a basic test. Ironically there were many things wrong with my health, but they did not properly look for any one of them. I was referred here by another professional whom had a patient who had a great experience. After hearing about my experience and seeing the tests that were run, she said she is no longer going to refer. There are other naturopaths/ functional medicine doctors/ integrative doctors in the South Bay and I highly urge you to do some more searching especially if you're not in a good place with your health. - 1/6/2020 Kelly Cohn is a knowledgeable and intuitive naturopathic practitioner. I've been seeing her for periomenopausal and GI issues that the Western physicians dismissed. Her treatment plans have been easy to follow and effective. I feel great. Thanks! - 11/29/2018 I have been going to Trio for several years and have sent clients. My Grandson and I have been getting vitamin injections weekly and paying nearly $200 a week. I just noticed on the counter a membership for injections and the cost is savings of more then 50% of what I have been paying. No one at Trios ever mentioned to me an opportunity to save hundreds of dollars a month. I am really disappointed with the staff at Trios. You would think they would want to be supportive of their clients. CLIENTS ask for their discounted programs because apparently they WON'T tell you!! Business owner information Kelly C. 11/29/2018 Hi Carole, I'm so sorry you were not made aware of our vitamin membership. We have sent out multiple newsletters to our patients promoting our vitamin membership and have a sign at the front counter showcasing our vitamin membership to inform every client that comes in that we offer a savings on weekly injections. We have had this sign on our counter since we started the vitamin injection program 1 year ago. The front office staff try to remind every client coming in regularly for vitamin injections that we offer the membership and we apologize that you were not informed. You are a very loyal client and we appreciate your business. Please give us the opportunity to make this right. We will be reaching out to you shortly to connect. - 5/6/2019 I enjoyed my appointment with Dr. Morgan. She's very attentive and a great listener. I am also so glad I started the vitamin shots. They're really making a difference for me.
