Although universal testing for HIV among pregnant women has been an accepted national recommendation sinceshortly after the introduction of prophylaxis to reduce mother-to-child transmission, 11,12studies have shown that screening rates often remain well below 100%.13-17 To decrease barriers to testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) has recommended an \"opt-out\" prenatal HIV testingpolicy since 1999, whereby a pregnant woman will be screenedunless she actively refuses testing. 18Opt-out testing has been shown to increase prenatal HIV screening.19 Prenatal HIV screening is considered important enough that it has been included as a core quality indicator in theGovernment Performance and Results Act (GPRA), throughwhich the Indian Health Service (IHS) is accountable to the USCongress. IHS measures, and reports via GPRA, the percent ofpregnant women who are screened for HIV during theirpregnancy. The nationwide rate of prenatal HIV screening inIHS increased from the baseline October 2005 rate of 54%, lowbut similar to estimates in other US groups, 20to 74% in October 2007. This project's goals were to understand the process of prenatal HIV testing in IHS; efficiently and accurately estimateHIV screening rates among pregnant IHS American Indiansand Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) nationwide; and to improveprenatal HIV screening rates in Indian Country. The projectwas supported and funded by the Minority AIDS Initiative(MAI), and implemented by the Division of Epidemiology andDisease Prevention in collaboration with the National IHSHIV/AIDS Program. Methods We randomly selected service units nationwide. The sample was weighted by geography and user population, so larger service units in Areas with a larger user population weremore likely to be selected. We sent selected service units a standardized set of computer commands to draw up a list of patients who wereseen in prenatal care during March 2005 - March 2006 butwere not screened for HIV , making them GPRA \"misses.\"These patients were put into random order and the first 25available charts on the list were reviewed. Some small clinicshad fewer than 25 GPRA misses during the study period, inwhich case all available misses were reviewed. We used the standard IHS definition of prenatal care: at least two visits with Purpose of Visit (POV) of pregnancyduring the past 20 months, with one diagnosis occurring duringthe reporting period, and with no documented miscarriage orabortion occurring after the second pregnancy POV . A standardized data collection instrument was used to record patient data, including date of birth, estimated date of In this Issue... 245 Prenatal HIV Screening: Gaps and Best Practices 249 Assessment of InternetAccessAcross the Indian Health Service 254 IHS Child Health Notes258 OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest268 Meetings Of Interest270 PositionVacanciesconfinement, dates of HIV and other routine infectious disease tests (syphilis, gonorrhea/chlamydia, and hepatitis B), andother relevant aspects of care such as transfers ordocumentation of a declined HIV test. Data from eitherphysical charts or electronic health records (EHRs) wererecorded in a database that contained no patient identifiers. Nopersonally identifiable data left any site. Investigators also gathered qualitative data about patient and data flow during on-site interviews with clinical healthproviders, administrative officers, and health technologists forrecommendations on improvements. Each service unit in the sample was given facility-specific results of our investigation within two weeks of our visit. Results We reviewed 598 records from 27 sites, of which 41 (7%) were not pregnant and removed from further analysis. Of the remaining 557 charts, 290 (52%) were not screened for HIV ,and 267 (48%) had been screened for HIV , as per figure 1. Figure 1. Prenatal HIV GPRA \"Misses\" Not tested for HIV: Among the 290 pregnant women not screened for HIV , the majority had no HIV screening despite having had 2 prenatal care encounters (167/290, 58%).These women represent \"missed opportunities,\" patientswhose care fell outside of current recommendations and couldnot be otherwise explained. It was difficult to determine underlying causes of the missed opportunities in chart review. However, a majority ofmisses (118/167, 71%) had prenatal testing for other infectiousdiseases, so providers appeared to have specifically (andincorrectly) excluded HIV from these patients' prenatal testing. Fifty misses (50/290, 17%) were women who declined or had a miscarriage/termination. If documented in RPMS,GPRA logic removes women who declined an HIV test or hada miscarriage/termination from the prenatal pool, so thesepatients should not be a miss, and instead represent data error. Tested for HIV: Of the 267 charts that had a documented HIV test, 176 (66%) had a test ordered by the service unit withthe result in the chart, but not recorded in RPMS. This type ofdata entry error is the result of either omission or miscoding.Ninety-one (34%) charts had prenatal HIV tests that had been faxed or e-mailed to the service unitby a previous prenatal provider(usually another IHS facility) thathad not been entered into RPMS. In sum, according to GPRA, the testing rate of the patients in thissample was 0% (0/598). However,with exclusions from thedenominator of women who did notneed to be tested (not pregnant,miscarriage, declined testing), andadditions to the numerator (womenwho were tested, but the result wasnot recorded), the true testing rate inthis sample was 53% (267/507). Limitations This project did not seek to determine what proportion of data entry errors were a result oflaboratory tests done off site and notentered into RPMS (the time periodof chart review preceded the releaseof the reference laboratoryinterface), lack of data entry, or datamiscoding. Similarly, the reasonsfor clinical gaps are often notapparent in chart review, and so werelied on qualitative data to attemptto determine the reasons for misses.Qualitative data cannot beextrapolated to determine preciselythe contributions of different August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 246categories of apparent clinical or data-related misses, only the range of types and underlying causes of misses. The sample was weighted towards larger facilities, which may under-represent the types of misses seen at smallerfacilities. Discussion Sites with the best performance often had protocols in place that tended to include HIV screening by default. These protocols included 1) testing as soon as possible in pregnancy,ideally immediately upon discovery of a positive pregnancytest, by the same nurses who performed the pregnancy test; 2)using opt-out methods to make an HIV test as routine as theother tests done during prenatal care; and 3) bundling HIVtesting into a prenatal panel rather than ordering the testseparately, either by pre-marking lab order forms or as thedefault order code with a contract lab. These safeguardseffectively extend the opt-out principle to provider behavior,ensuring that the provider screens for HIV unless he or sheactively withdraws the test. In this sample, bundling HIV withother routine prenatal infectious disease tests would haveprevented most missed opportunities. Opt-out needs to beemphasized, as 5 of 27 (18.5%) service units in this samplewere still not using opt-out, and instead used written consent. The primary reason for apparent GPRA misses is not a lack of testing but rather data integrity. Patients in this samplehad a screening rate according to GPRA of 0%, when in fact itwas over 50%. Most facilities assumed, often correctly, thatlow prenatal HIV screening rates were data errors, with twodetrimental effects: 1) low GPRA rates demoralized medicalstaff who felt they were performing better than the dataindicated, and 2) data entry errors made identifying andrectifying clinical errors difficult. Once a site understood ithad a proportion of clinical misses, they were generally quickto react and close the gaps. Many sites with low rates quicklyrealized double-digit gains in screening rates once theyinstituted some of the aforementioned clinical and datasafeguards. Most notable was a large hospital seeing hundredsof prenatal patients each year that increased its score from 1%to 88%. It is critical that providers have data on key screeningresults and understand the reasons underlying those rates inorder to take effective action. Recommendations Clinical practice: 1. Ensure all staff understand opt-out testing, including contract workers. 2. Ensure HIV is bundled into a larger prenatal test panel. 3. Offer prenatal panel in the first visit -- the same visit as HCG+ result. 4. Make HIV test the default option unless the patient declines. If still using hard copies to order laboratorypanels, pre-mark the master copy of intake slips withthe routine prenatal ID tests. 5. Ensure women who present in term labor with no testing history are screened for HIV . 6. Consider testing for a second time during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as per CDC guidelines in high-risk communities. 7. Ensure service units have a clear plan, including medical and social referrals, in the case of a positiveHIV test result. RPMS/ Data entry8. Link reference laboratory directly to RPMS for automatic data entry, using the reference laboratoryinterface software application. If this is not possible,ensure sent out laboratory tests are entered into PCCas historical lab tests so they can be counted by CRSfor GPRA reporting. 9. Review the standard ways that CRS looks for HIV testing results, and ensure that your medical staff isaware of the appropriate ways to record HIV testingdata in RPMS. 10. Ensure the CRS taxonomy for HIV screens (i.e., BGP HIV TEST TAX) includes all HIV screening lab teststhat are used at the facility. 11. In hard charts, standardize the location for HIV test results, and ensure that results are entered into thelaboratory file. 12. Enter HIV tests from other facilities into RPMS.

August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 248Assessment of InternetAccessAcross the Indian Health Service ChristopherLamer,PharmD,ClinicalInformaticistforHealth Education,IndianHealthService,Cherokee,NorthCarolina; Mary Wachacha, Lead Consultant, Indian Health Service HealthEducationProgram,Rockville,Maryland;andTheresa Cullen,MD,MS,Director,OfficeofInformationTechnology, IndianHealthService,Rockville Background Health care communications is an essential part of the clinician and patient relationship. Good communication between the patient and the provider increases the patient's comprehension and self-management skills, improvesadherence to treatment decisions, and leads to improved health outcomes. 1,2,3 Good health care communication has a significant and positive impact on patient satisfaction and medical costs, and reduces the likelihood of a physicianexperiencing a malpractice claim. 4,5,6,7,8 Improvement of health care communication is an objective of Healthy People 2010, a nationwide health promotion and disease prevention plan with goals to increase quality and years of healthy life and to eliminate healthdisparities. It is a framework that is composed of 28 focus areas and related objectives. Healthy People 2010 Goal 11-1aims to increase the proportion of households with Internet access at home. The increase in the use of the Internet is becoming more integrated by business organizations and consumers, and its use creates a new potential medium of communication between health care organizations, patients, and clinicians. Although increasing in many areas of the United States, 9there are few data available on the number of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) who have Internet access. To assess Internet access for AI/AN patients, a new data field was added in February 2007 to the Patient Registration package, (version 7.1, patch 2). This is a component of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), the clinical information system used by the majority of IHSfacilities. Patient registration clerks are prompted to ask patients if they have access to the Internet. If the patientconfirms that they can access the Internet, the registration clerk asks a second question: where is the Internet accessed (fromhome, work, school, health care facility, library, or tribal/community center)? This information is then documented in the patient's medical record (see Figure 1).IHSREGISTRATIONEDITOR T TRIBAL/COMMUNITYCENTER ACCESSTHEWEBFROM:Figure 1. Sample Patient Registration Screen for collecting Internet access information August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 249Methods The Tally of Patient Internet Access is a new RPMS management report that retrieves the number and percentage of patients who were screened for Internet access through the RPMS patient registration system. Results are displayed by gender, age, and community (see Figure 2) for a selected time- period. Although the report has national importance, it is generated at the local level. Since the data from this report provide essential information for health care planning within the IHS, a letter was distributed to each of the twelve IHS Areas in November 2007 requesting voluntary submission of the PINT report for inclusion in an aggregated national report on patient access to the internet. Uses for these data include: Assisting the CDC in collecting information for the Healthy People 2010 report. Goal 11-1 is updated bythe CDC from the National Household Education Survey. We believe that our data will be more accurate for the IHS population than the survey currently in use. Assisting the IHS Office of Information Technology in prioritization and identification of appropriate direction for the development of future healthinformation tools such as Personal Health Records (PHR). Assisting the IHS Health Education program in identification of potential resources for increasingconsumer access to health education materials. Assisting the IHS Health Literacy program in identification of resources for improving consumer health literacy. Results More than 75 sites screened 356,748 patients for Internet access, representing 23.8 percent of the IHS user population of 1.5 million. From those patients who were assessed, 20.9 percent (n=74,560) had access to the Internet at home, work, library, or tribal/community center. When further stratified by geographical area, the greatest Internet access was observed in locations that are closer to urban centers and information technology resources such as Portland, Phoenix, and the Oklahoma Area (reporting Internet access rates of 37, 28.6, and 30.8 percent, respectively). Areas that are predominantly rural such as Alaska, Navajo, and Aberdeen reported having the lowest rates (5.1, 16, and 15.5 percent). Details pertaining tothe location, (home, work, school, health care facility, library,or tribal/community center), where the Internet is accessed were not examined at this time. Discussion The 2004 Nielsen/NetRatings, a marketing and research firm, reported that 3 out of 4 Americans have Internet access, with more than 50% being broadband connections. 10Results from the 2003 Census report show that 54.7% of Americanscan access the Internet from home. 11The number of AI/ANswho have access to the Internet was not provided in these reports. These reports are in contrast to the results collected by the IHS through the RPMS PINT report that shows significantly lower rates of Internet access for AI/ANs as compared to the national data. Barriers to Internet access listed in the Healthy People 2010 report include cost of Internet service, lack of service, limited literacy, lack of familiarity with different technologies(especially for those with disabilities), and inaccessible formats that limit appropriate and effective technology use. These are all potential reasons for the dramatic difference between reported access for the general population (3 in 4 people having Internet access) and those who seek health care services at IHS locations (1 in 5 people having Internet access). These data further highlight the need for initiatives to increase universal access to the Internet especially for AI/AN populations living in rural areas. Figure 2.

IHS Child Health Notes Quoteofthemonth \"The beginning is the most important part of any work.\" Plato Introduction This spring and summer most IHS clinics have had requests for blood lead level testing for children entering Head Start. This is an attempt to explain why blood level testing ismandatory for Medicaid eligible AI/AN children even if therisk of elevated lead levels is likely small in our patients. Blood Lead Screening inAmerican Indian/Alaska Native Children In March 2008 the Office of Head Start issued an Information Memorandum that reaffirmed the requirement within the Head Start Program Performance Standards for allchildren entering the program to be screened for lead poisoningas per the schedule of well child care utilized by the EPSDTprogram. 1It appeared that many Head Start programs that serve American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children wereencountering difficulty in obtaining documentation of therequired screening blood lead levels (BLLs) performed at 12and 24 months of age. The Health Director of the IHS HeadStart Program asked the Indian Health Service for guidance onthis issue. This request prompted a review of current standardsfor screening BLLs in children < 6 years old. Lead is a potent neurotoxin. At higher levels (>70ug/dL) lead poisoning can cause encephalopathy and death. Suchextreme lead toxicity is now rare as primary prevention effortsin the past few decades mandated the removal of lead fromgasoline and consumer products. Lead exposure from paint inolder buildings remains a persistent source of exposure to lead.Recently there has been concern over lead toxicity in toysimported from China. Unfortunately, even small amounts oflead can have irreversible effects on brain development inyoung children. It is estimated that every 10ug/dL incrementin BLLs can decrease IQ scores by 3 to 7 points. 2At present, the accepted definition for elevated BLLs is >10ug/dL.However, there is recent research that BLLs even below10ug/dL may be deleterious. 3Since BLLs <25ug/dL are clinically undetectable, only screening can detect these cases. Who should be screened for lead exposure? Data showthat lead poisoning is overwhelmingly a disease of youngchildren in poverty. In the NHANES III survey in 1994, theoverall prevalence of elevated BLLs (>10ug/dL) in 1 - 5 yearolds was 4.4%. However, the prevalence of elevated BLLswas only 0.9% in upper income children, while the rate was ashigh as 21% in poor children who lived in older homes.Further analysis showed that 10% of children enrolled inMedicaid had elevated BLLs. Medicaid enrollees alsoaccounted for 60% of the total children with BLL >10ug/dLand 83% of the children with BLLs >20ug/dL. 4 Many AI/AN children potentially would fall into the high- risk group because of widespread poverty in many AI/ANcommunities. However, few AI/AN communities havecommercial homes built before the 1950s, which would tend todiminish the likelihood of exposure to lead paint. The current prevalence of elevated BLLs in AI/AN children is unclear. A review of Pubmed for the past 20 years with the search terms, \"American Indian,\" \"children,\" and\"lead\" disclosed only one article on mining exposures inOklahoma. The IHS has unpublished data from the mid 1990son lead levels in 7 of 12 Areas. The percentage of childrenscreened in each Area varied widely, and not all tribal groupswere included. However, in this limited data set the overallrate of elevated BLLs after confirmatory testing was < 1%,which was lower than the national rate. Given the low prevalence of lead poisoning in AI/AN children tested, it was agreed that targeted screening of AI/ANchildren at high risk for lead exposure was a better strategythan universal testing. Universal testing was also discouragedby the United States Preventive Services Task Force. 5No lead screening or targeted lead screening became the standard inmost clinics, but was never explicitly made a policy for theIHS. A summary of the costs and benefits of lead screening in AI/AN children was published in The IHS Primary Care Provider in 1994. 6 An informal survey of IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) clinics suggests that most practitioners have assumed that lead exposure is not a problem in their communities. This lack oflead screening is hardly unique for I/T/U clinics. Despite thedemonstrated elevated risk in poor children, only 20% ofMedicaid enrollees nationwide were screened for BLLs in arecent evaluation by the Office of the Inspector General. 7 However, a review of federal standards indicates BLL August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 252testing is a mandated service for allchildren eligible for Medicaid and Head Start. The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) requires that all Medicaid-eligible children receive a screening blood test at 12 months and 24months of age. 8Children between the ages of 36 to 72 months must also have a BLL test if lead screening has not been done previously. Head Start is also required to follow the standardof care set forth by CMS. CMS made this decision based on the demonstrated risk of elevated BLL in Medicaid enrolleescompared to the general population. Data show that up to 80% of AI/AN children < 6 years of age in reservation communities are eligible for Medicaid and Head Start. With this high percentage of Medicaid enrollees, it is likely more efficient to screen all AI/AN children < 6 yearsold for elevated BLLs. The risk of elevated BLLs in AI/AN children is likely low, but there are no recent, comprehensivedata, and there are no data that include all tribal groups. Given the high incidence of iron deficiency anemia in AI/AN children, many I/T/U clinics already screen for anemia with a complete blood count (CBC) at 9 months and 18 months. Testing at 9 months is preferable to testing at 12 months, as this will result in the earlier detection of iron deficiency anemia and earlier treatment. It is also known that iron deficiency promotes lead absorption, and that repletion of iron stores will diminish absorption of lead. 9,10 Therefore, timely treatment of iron deficiency is one of the best preventive measures to minimize lead poisoning. BLLs tend to peak at age 24 months, so this is the optimal time for the follow-up test to be done. To minimize the number of blood draws, CBC and lead testing could be combined in the following schedule: 9 - 12 months: draw a CBC and lead level 24 months: draw a CBC and lead level 36 - 72 months - draw a lead level if not done previously Management of elevated BLLs (>10ug/dL) is beyond the scope of this report. Follow-up should be based on theguidelines published in the AAP policy statement on lead poisoning published in 2005. 2 Lead testing will cost I/T/U sites money. This test is usually performed in a reference lab, and a BLL usually costs about $15. Medicaid pays a global fee for outpatient visits tomost I/T/U clinics, so the cost of the test is not recoverable. However, BLL is a CMS mandate: failure to perform amandated test could jeopardize Medicaid reimbursement.Money may need to be reprogrammed to I/T/U laboratory budgets to cover this cost. Lastly, each clinic will need to track BLLs in their patient population over the next year. This will let us answer the question, Which, if any, AI/AN children are at risk for leadpoisoning? Tribal groups with low lead levels may be able to request a waiver of BLL testing from CMS in the future. As important, if some tribal groups are found to be at elevated risk, appropriate environmental investigation and ameliorationcan begin. References 1. Lead Screening ACF-IM-HS-08-07.

May not be Better for American Indian/Alaska Native Infants. A new combination vaccine, Pentacel\u00ae (DTaP-IPV- Hib [PRP-T]), was recently licensed for use in the US. Thisvaccine is not ideal for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) infants served in federal, tribal, and urban Indianclinics. Pentacel\u00ae is a vaccine that protects against five serious infections: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). It is the first combination vaccine in the US that includes both poliovirus August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 253and haemophilus antigens. The vaccine is administered to children at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age. There are currently several Hib vaccines available that vary in the protein used to make the vaccine moreimmunogenic. In Pentacel\u00ae, the Hib component of the vaccine is a purified polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsular polysaccharide covalently bound to tetanus protein(PRP-T). The current Hib vaccine recommended for AI/AN infants has a meningococcal outer membrane protein (OMP) bound to the PRP molecule, and is designated as a PRP-OMP Hib vaccine. The Redbook of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that for AI/AN infants, the first dose of a Hib conjugate vaccine should contain PRP-OMP. For AI/AN infants \"the administration of a PRP-OMP-containing vaccineleads to more rapid seroconversion to protective concentrationsof antibody within the first 6 months of life, and failure of use has been associated with excess cases of Hib disease in young infants in this population.\" 1 In 1996 Alaska switched from a PRP-OMP Hib vaccine to combination HbOC-DTP vaccine (Tetramune\u00ae). During 1996 - 1997, 17 Hib cases occurred in Alaska Native children <5 years of age, increasing the rate of Hib disease from 19 to 91cases per 100,000 per year. Eight of the cases occurred in partially vaccinated children who had received 1 or 2 doses of HbOC. Since 2001, Alaska has adopted a schedule using PRP- OMP alone, and the subsequent rate of Hib disease in AlaskaNative infants decreased to 5.4 per 100,000 per year. 2 Physicians, pharmacists, and immunization coordinators who work for federal, tribal and urban Indian clinics need to be aware of this change and insure that their state's VFC program continues to supply a PRP-OMP Hib vaccine to their AI/AN patients.

Addendum Questions have arisen about whether this recommendation applies to all AI/AN children. The above update was written for an audience that works in federal, tribal, and urban Indianclinics. Private clinics near reservation communities may serve significant numbers of AI/AN patients and may wish to have a PRP-OMP containing Hib vaccine available. The riskof invasive Hib disease for AI/AN infants who do not live on or near reservation communities is unknown. This issue of increased risk for invasive Hib disease was addressed in the MMWR in December 2007 due to a decrease in the supply of PRP-OMP Hib vaccine due to productiondifficulties. The pertinent summary of the risk for AI/AN infants is below. Each practitioner should make a decision based on their assessment of risk of invasive Hib for their patients. The full posting with references is available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5650a4.htm. AI/AN children also are at increased risk for Hib disease, particularly in the first 6 months of life. Before the use of Hib conjugate vaccines, the incidence of Hib disease among young AI/AN children in AI/AN communities was approximately 10times higher than among children of comparable age in the general population. Compared with PRP-TT conjugatevaccines, the administration of PRP-OMP vaccines leads to a more rapid seroconversion to protective antibody concentrations within the first 6 months of life. Failure to usePRP-OMP vaccines for the first dose is associated with excess cases of Hib disease in AI/AN infants living in communitieswhere Hib transmission is ongoing and exposure to colonized persons is likely. Although PRP-OMP and PRP-TT vaccines are equally effective after completion of the primary series, availability of more than one Hib vaccine in a clinic could leadto administration of the wrong vaccine for the first dose in these populations. For these reasons, CDC recommends that providers who currently use PRP-OMP-containing Hib vaccines (PedvaxHIB and Comvax) to serve predominantly AI/AN children in AI/AN communities continue to stock and use only PRP-OMP-containing Hib vaccines not affected bythe recall and vaccinate according to the routinely recommended schedules, including the 12 - 15 month booster dose. In its vaccine stockpile, CDC has PRP-OMP-containingHib vaccines not affected by the recall and will prioritizedistribution of available PRP-OMP vaccines for use in AI/AN communities. AI/AN children not in AI/AN communities orwho already receive PRP-TT conjugate vaccines should continue to be vaccinated with available vaccines according tothe routinely recommended schedules, including the 12 - 15month booster dose. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaskan Native HealthMichaelL.Bartholomew,MD Brim SN, Rudd RA, Funk RH, Callahan DB. Asthma prevalence among US children in underrepresented minority populations: American Indian/Alaska Native, Chinese, Filipino, and Asian Indian. Pediatrics. 2008 Jul;122(1):e217- 22.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18595967?ordinal pos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_Resul tsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Asthma continues to be a prevalent childhood disease in the US. Recent studies estimate that 8.9% of US children ages 0 to 17 years of age have asthma. 1Asthma prevalence among Asian Americans, specifically subgroups of Asian Americans,and American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) has largely been unknown. Anecdotal reports of the 1960s and 1970s suggested that August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 254asthma in American Indians was rare.2In the 1990s, Clark et al showed that asthma was more prevalent than once believed when he documented the asthma burden in the Jemez Indian childhood population.3Between 2004 - 2005, the prevalence of asthma in AI/AN children was estimated to be 9.9%.1 Many recent studies defining asthma prevalence rates among children have yielded varied results in regards to age, race, and socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. Due to small sample sizes in large scale studies, the national prevalence of diseases has thus far been difficult to determine for certain ethnic groups or subgroups. This study investigates the prevalence of current asthma, lifetime asthma, and asthma attacks among subpopulations (Chinese, Filipino, and Asian Indian) of Asian American and AI/AN children ages 2 to 17 years and place of birth by analyzing aggregate data from the 2001 - 2005 National HealthInterview Surveys. The prevalence of lifetime and current asthma and the prevalence of 12-month asthma attacks were calculated from responses to questions posed during thesurvey. Logistic regression models were used to determine theassociation of current asthma prevalence with race and place of birth by controlling for certain confounding demographicvariables. Estimates of current asthma prevalence according to race and place of birth ranged from 4.4% for Asian Indian children to 13.3% in black children. AI/AN children had an asthma prevalence of 13.0%, while Filipino and Chinese children had a prevalence of 10.7% and 5.1%, respectively. White children had a current asthma prevalence of 8.4%. Lifetime asthmaprevalence estimates among races showed a similar trend. The lifetime prevalence among the races ranged from 9% in Chinese children to 18.1% for black children. The lifetimeasthma prevalence estimates for AI/AN children was 18% and for Asian Indian and Filipino was 9.4% and 15.7%respectively. A higher prevalence of current and lifetime asthma was noted in children born in the US than in childrenborn outside the US (current asthma: 9.4% vs. 4.3%; lifetimeasthma: 13.6% vs. 7.3%). The prevalence of asthma attack in the past 12 months did not vary among races or place of birth. After controlling for place of birth, gender, age, ethnicity, region, household income, and health insurance coverage,AI/AN children are 1.82 times more likely to report havingasthma than their White counterparts. Black children are 1.57times more likely, while Filipino children are 1.64 times more likely. Additionally, children born inside the US were twice as likely to report having asthma as children born outside the US. This study is not without limitations. The authors cite small sample sizes of the study populations to be problematic,requiring aggregate data for 5 years to provide limited statistical power. There is also the potential for selection biassince the survey was administered in either the English orSpanish language. Lastly, additional risk factors (BMI and environmental tobacco smoke exposure) for asthma were notanalyzed due to lack of inclusion in the survey model. Despitethese limitations, the authors concluded that the results supportprevious assertions that certain ethnicities including black, AI/AN, and Filipino children as well as those born in the US tend to have a disproportionately higher prevalence of asthma.

Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the use of interventions such as a peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) lines or nasogastric (NG)/nasoduodenal (ND)tube with the use of medications alone in the management ofpregnancies with hyperemesis. Study Design: Subjects were identified with confirmed intrauterine pregnancy, admitted with hyperemesis gravidarum(HEG) between 1998 and 2004. Medical records were thenabstracted for information with regard to therapy. Subjectswere assigned on the basis of the management plan:medication alone, PICC line, or NG/ND tube. Outcomes werecompared between groups. Results: Ninety-four patients met study criteria and had complete outcome data available. Of those, 33 had a PICC lineplaced (35.1%), 19 had a NG/ND placed (20.2%), and 42 weremanaged with medication alone (44.7%). These groups weresimilar with respect to gestational age at delivery, Apgar score,and mean birthweight. Maternal complications weresignificantly higher among those with PICC lines. Of patientsmanaged with PICC lines, 66.4% (P < .001) required treatmentfor infection, thromboembolism, or both. Adjusted odds ratiofor a PICC line complication was 34.5 (5.09, 233.73). Conclusion: Maternal complications associated with PICC line placement are substantial despite no difference in neonataloutcomes, suggesting that the use of PICC lines for treatmentof HEG patients should not be routinely used. OB/GYNCCCEditorialComment 66.4% of women managed with a PICC line requiredtreatmentforthromboembolismorinfection,orboth. Holmgren et al conclude that enteral feeding for women with hyperemesis gravidarum is safer than parenteral feeding and is accepted by patients. Obstetricians should make everyeffort to use enteral feeding for women with hyperemesisgravidarum and persistent weight loss. For a more completediscussion about management options for hyperemesisgravidarum, please review the answer to this month's MedicalMystery Tour. Another possible resource can be found in T.Murphy Goodwin, MD's OBG Management discussion, linkbelow. Holmgren et al expands on the observations of previous authors who have pointed out the numerous complications ofPICC line access for parenteral nutrition during pregnancy.The vast majority of such interventions during pregnancy arefor the diagnosis of HEG. That some form of nutritionalsupplementation is needed for women who experiencepersistent weight loss with hyperemesis is clear. Although it israre, maternal mortality still does occur and comes almostexclusively from this group of women. The same is true formajor maternal morbidity such as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Fetal effects such as growth restriction are limited to women who have HEG who also lose weight. Apart fromgrowth restriction, which can be recognizable at birth,substantial data in both humans and experimental animalssuggest adverse consequences later in life as a result ofmaternal calorie restriction for even a few months ofpregnancy. Interestingly, in this study, there were no SGAinfants in either the group treated with medication alone or thegroup managed with NG/ND tube placement. The major complications of peripheral and central venous access for nutrition in pregnancy are thrombosis and infection,and the prevalence is now well established to be around 50%.Maternal death from complications of line access has also beenreported. This study is important because it represents the largest report of women who have received total nutritional supportvia an enteral feeding tube. Previous reports were limited tosingle cases or small series. There is little evidence indicatingthat the better safety record of enteral feeding and greaterefficacy compared with parenteral feeding via a PICC linehave led to increased usage. In our own survey of 792 womenwho self-reported hyperemesis gravidarum from 2000 to 2004,16.7% reported parenteral nutrition, compared with only 2.3%who reported enteral tube feeding. It is hoped that this studywill help reverse this ratio. Have you taken advantage of the free Perinatology Corner August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 256CME/CEU module we offer on this topic?

ScottGiberson,HQE One of the guiding principles of the IHS HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan is to improve the collaborative nature and transparency of the program to maximize effectiveness. That said, we would like to share two recent announcements. In April 2008, the IHS HIV Program and the Native Capacity Building Assistance Network (CBA), comprised of the Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity(CASAE), the Intertribal Council of Arizona (ITCA), and the National Native American AIDS Prevention Center(NNAAPC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)to continue open communications, collaborate to raise awareness, and mutually augment efforts. This partnership demonstrates mobilization of both the Native community and IHS for HIV prevention efforts. NNAAPC is offering and funding regional training grants to host trainings on a variety of HIV-related topics. This NNAAPC initiative will assist communities in capacity-building efforts from readiness to grant writing.

Adversities with the strongest associations with adiposity (e.g., physical abuse) tended to be associated with glycosylated hemoglobin levels of 6, but in most cases associations were explained by adjustment for adulthood mediators such as adiposity. Effects of other adversities reflecting less severe emotional neglect and family environment were largely explained by childhood socioeconomic factors. Conclusions: Some childhood adversities increase the risk of obesity in adulthood and thereby increase the risk for type 2 diabetes. Research is needed to understand the interrelatedness of adversities, the social context of their occurrence, and trajectories from adversity to adult disease. Thomas C, Hypp\u00f6nen E, Power C.

ChronicDisease Intensive glucose control does not prevent major cardiovasculareventsintype2diabetes. Two recent studies published in the NEJM addressing intensive glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes failed to demonstrate a decrease in major cardiovascular events, although the second study did show a decrease in nephropathy. ACCORDStudyAbstract Background : Epidemiologic studies have shown a relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels andcardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. We August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 257investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: In this randomized study, 10,251 patients (mean age, 62.2 years) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1% were assigned to receive intensive therapy (targeting aglycated hemoglobin level below 6.0%) or standard therapy(targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9%). Of these patients, 38% were women, and 35% had had a previous cardiovascular event. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The finding of higher mortality in theintensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensivetherapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up. Results: At 1 year, stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4% and 7.5% were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group, respectively.During follow-up, the primary outcome occurred in 352patients in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.04; P=0.16). At the same time, 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died, as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group(hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.46; P=0.04).Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group (P<0.001). Conclusions: As compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study group.

ADVANCEStudyAbstract Background: In patients with type 2 diabetes, the effects of intensive glucose control on vascular outcomes remain uncertain. Methods: We randomly assigned 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes to undergo either standard glucose control or intensive glucose control, defined as the use of gliclazide(modified release) plus other drugs as required to achieve a glycated hemoglobin value of 6.5% or less. Primary end points were composites of major macrovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ornonfatal stroke) and major microvascular events (new or worsening nephropathy or retinopathy), assessed both jointlyand separately. Results: After a median of 5 years of follow-up, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was lower in the intensive-control group (6.5%) than in the standard-control group (7.3%). Intensive control reduced the incidence of combined major macrovascular and microvascular events (18.1%, vs. 20.0% with interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.98; P=0.01), as as that of microvascular events (9.4% vs. 10.9%; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.01), primarily because of a reduction in the incidence of nephropathy (4.1% vs. 5.2%; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 P=0.006), with no significant effect on retinopathy (P=0.50). There were no significant effects ofthe type of glucose control on major macrovascular events(hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.06; P=0.32), death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.04; P=0.12), or death from any cause (hazard ratio with intensive control, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P=0.28). Severe hypoglycemia, although uncommon, was more common in the intensive-control group (2.7%, vs. 1.5% in the 1.42 to 2.40; P<0.001). Conclusions: A strategy of intensive glucose control, involving gliclazide (modified release) and other drugs as required, that lowered the glycated hemoglobin value to 6.5%yielded a 10% relative reduction in the combined outcome of major macrovascular and microvascular events, primarily as a consequence of a 21% relative reduction in nephropathy.

AHRQAgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality \"RealMenWearGowns\" The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has joined with the Advertising Council to launch a national public service campaign designed to raise awareness among middle-aged men about the importance of preventive medical testing. The new campaign, \"Real Men Wear Gowns,\" tells men over 40 to learn which preventive screening tests theyneed to get and when they need to get them. According to AHRQ's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, men are 25 percent less likely than women to have visited the doctor within the past year and are 38 percent more likely than women to have neglected their cholesterol tests. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that men are 1.5 times more likely than women to die from heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. The campaign encourages men to visit a comprehensive website, www.ahrq.gov/realmen/ . The site provides the recommended ages for preventive testing (as well as a list of tests), a quiz designed to test knowledge of preventive health care, tips for talking with the doctor, a glossary of consumer health terms, and links to online resources where men can findmore medical information. BehavioralHealthInsights PeterStuart,IHSPsychiatryConsultant ChronicPainManagement101:SayingNotoPatients Ms. Howard has been followed in your clinic for several years for a variety of complaints including chronic neck and arm pain. She has a history of rotator cuff surgery that did not substantially improve her pain status. Her rehab participationcould be characterized by the words \"erratic to none.\" She also has a history of periodic drinking episodes, depression andseveral overdoses while intoxicated, and previous tolerance development to narcotics and drug-seeking behavior. She is involved in a chaotic relationship. You do believe she has some physiologic basis for her pain but her compliance with your recommendations is erratic at best and you have on several occasions assisted her in detoxing from narcotics only to have her go to another provider and be restarted on them. She can be quite dramatic when claiming to suffer from painand has accused you previously of \"not doing enough to help me with my pain.\" She is also on an antidepressant andgabapentin and cannot tolerate NSAIDs due to GI complications. You have a pain contract in place. She presents today telling you she needs a refill of her Percocet one week before they were supposed to run out. Shehas been taking \"1 or 2 extra a day because I was cleaning house last week and twisted my shoulder again.\" She has a fairly recent history of prior \"lost meds\" that she has been counseled on in line with the pain treatment contract she signed. She appears mildly anxious and exhibits some discomfort with the shoulder even when non-obtrusivelyobserved. The daily quantity is sufficient enough that you areconcerned about withdrawal symptoms. At this point most providers start grinding their teeth. How do you approach her? Refer her to the psychiatrist or chronic pain committee (if you're fortunate enough to have either)? What about her current needs? In the murky world of real human beings, this amalgam of physical, social, and emotional issues is not uncommon. The patient is likely to genuinely need some type of pain management, but is clearly out of control of her life and herself-care. She has demonstrated worrisome tolerance development, and there certainly is an addiction component active. She is clearly stepping outside of the boundaries set by the treatment contract. What is a reasonable goal here?Do we, as providers, have a commitment to provide compassionate and effective care no matter what the circumstances? If so, what exactly does that look like in thiscase? Is the appropriate overall approach \"harm reduction\" or \"abstinence-based,\" or something else? For me in situations like this, it is helpful to go back to some basic clinical principles. First, the overall clinicalsituation always trumps any absolute clinical rules about specific issues (i.e., if the pain contract says \"no more meds after you lose a prescription\"). Borrowing a little fromrabbinic tradition, each patient presents a unique set of predispositions, current symptoms, and possible outcomes that require the provider to exercise discernment and judgment in determining what the appropriate course of action is. For this patient, that means understanding that my goal is long-term pain relief and life management; the path I'mlooking for keeps the patient in my practice, but also provides enough incentive for her to make some necessary changes for her benefit. Second, sometimes the right answer is \"no.\" Asphysicians, the principles of beneficence and minimal malfeasance are in play here. She is presenting in a situationwhere contingency management can be helpful in shifting behavior. In this case it might be worth using the positive contingency of getting her pain meds to decrease her discomfort both from withdrawal symptoms and pain in order to get her attending rehab and counseling. The challenge hereis often a systems one - lack of access to these services at the time of presentation. If the system is broken and doesn't work well, it is incredibly important to acknowledge that reality. An appointment in rehab is available in three days time. In order to involve her in the process you negotiate with her to walk to rehab, schedule the appointment in person, and returnto your office, at which time you will provide her with aprescription for the three days. Further refills will be August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 259contingent on showing up at rehab, and will be filled after she has her rehab appointment. Here is where saying \"no refill until . . .\" can be very important. Alternatively, you believe the big issue here is that she is not managing her meds appropriately (she is not following thecontract, you have given her prior \"chances\" to learn the system, the system has done its part by providing her with the full prescription when she comes in, and is available to her if she has been debating about increasing her dose at home). In this case, the challenge becomes saying \"no\" without breakingthe treatment relationship. Third, \"no\" can be said in a supportive way. The principles for saying \"no\" in a supportive way are as follows:1) start with empathizing and putting yourself in the patient's shoes, for example \"I hear from what you're saying and can see by looking at you that you are very uncomfortable right now,and I'm guessing you're also worried about what withdrawal is going to be like if you don't get something. Is that close to what's going on?\" 2) align yourself alongside the patient andlook at the problem together and the potential consequences of different approaches together; for example \"Help me look at the options from your perspective. First option - I just refillthe meds, no further questions asked, what happens then? And after that? And what's happened before when we've done that? And how was that experience? Second option - I tell you no more meds . . . (repeat). Third option - can you think of a thirdoption?\" 3) summarize the options preferably using similar language to the patient; 4) tell the patient what you personally are comfortable doing and why, and 5) acknowledge that the patient may be angry, frustrated, annoyed, scared, etc. and that you appreciate and understand that response and will continueworking with her on her care. Part 4 is the most difficult part because it is where you may be choosing an option different than the one the patient prefers. It is very important to be prepared for strong reactions. In Ms. Howard's case she initially tells you to \"I'll just go somewhere else then.\" You reply, \"Yes, I think I'd be upset and scared too, and at the same time I hope you will continue to work with me.\" If the strong feelings can be safely tolerated and tested with the patient, you have just successfully improved the relationship bond with the patient and the ability of the patient to tolerate further conflict with you - for the best interest of the patient. In summary, the key ingredients here are an ability to see the big picture with the patient, to align yourself alongside thepatient rather than against, and to support movement towardshealth sometimes by setting firm limits and boundaries but always in a context of compassion and caring. What else does this approach require? Time and focused attention . . . and if you can't hold the system accountable for providing thesebasic human needs, you're not going to get far in holding the patient accountable.Breastfeeding SuzanMurphy,PIMC A new look at what works to support breastfeeding in hospitals On June 13, 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in its weekly Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), \"Breastfeeding-Related Maternity Practices at Hospitals and Birth Centers - UnitedStates, 2007.\" The article is the result of the first nationalMaternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC -called \"m-pink\") survey. The survey used questions from seven categories of practice that are known to support breastfeeding, such as those found in the Ten Steps for BabyFriendly Hospitals. The categories and typical questions were: 1. Labor and delivery - Do mothers and newborns routinely experience skin-to-skin contact and earlybreastfeeding initiation? 2. Breastfeeding assistance - Is assessment, recording, and instruction provided to new families on infantfeeding? For example, are pacifiers not provided to breastfeeding infants? 3. Mother-newborn contact - Is the separation of mother and newborn avoided? 4. Newborn feeding practices - What and how are breastfed babies fed while in the hospital or birthing center? For example, is supplementation common andwhy? 5. Breastfeeding support after discharge - Are resources provided for the new family when they are discharged? Where can they go for assistance ifproblems or concerns arise? 6. Nurse/birth attendant breastfeeding training and education - What kind of breastfeeding supporttraining and on-going education does staff receive? 7. Structural and organizational factors related to breastfeeding -a. Does the facility have a breastfeeding policy and how is it communicated to staff? b. Is there support for breastfeeding employees? c. Does the facility receive free infant formula? d. Is prenatal breastfeeding education available? e. Is there coordination of lactation care? The survey was mailed to 3,143 hospitals and 138 birth centers; of these, 2,690 hospitals and 121 birthing centers responded. The survey was structured to be completed by the person most knowledgeable of the facility's intra-partum practices related to breastfeeding. To encourage true answers to survey questions, the responders and their administrationwere assured that their location and name would be kept confidential. The only potential identifier was the name of thestate where the facility was located. The data were summarized by state and region. The results of the survey were based on a maximum score August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 260of 100. For each category from above, the mean subscale scores from highest to lowest were: 80 2. Breastfeeding assistance77 4. Newborn feeding practices70 3. Mother-newborn contact66 7. Structural and organizational factors related to breastfeeding 60 1. Labor and delivery51 6. Nurse/birth attendant breastfeeding training and education 40 5. Breastfeeding support after discharge State survey results strongly correlated with their breastfeeding prevalence rates. This suggests that where there are more evidenced-based breastfeeding support maternitypractices in place, there are positive impacts on breastfeeding.Unfortunately, the reverse is also true.

Background : Progestin-only injectable contraceptives continue to gain in popularity, but uncertainty remains about pregnancy risk among women late for reinjection. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) recommends a \"grace period\" oftwo weeks after the scheduled 13-week reinjection. Beyondtwo weeks, however, many providers send late clients home toawait menses. Study Design: A prospective cohort study in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Thailand followed users of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for up to 24 months.Users were tested for pregnancy at every reinjection, allowinganalysis of pregnancy risk among late comers. Results:The analysis consists of 2290 participants contributing 13,608DMPA intervals. pregnancy risks per 100 injections were low and virtually identical. Conclusion: Extending the current WHO grace period for DMPA reinjection from 2 to 4 weeks does not increasepregnancy risk and could increase contraceptive continuation.

Epub 2008 unintended pregnancies among adolescentsandyoungadults Results: Those randomized to a bridge method were 1.8 (1.1, 2.9) times more likely than Depo Now subjects to return for their 21-day repeat pregnancy test, but only 55% (n = 125)of these young women actually received their first DMPAinjection. Continuation rates at the third injection were 29.7%(n = 30) for those in the Depo Now group and 21.1% (n = 49)for those assigned to the bridge method (p = .09). Three factorswere significantly associated with adherence to the thirdinjection: randomized to Depo Now group, knowing morewomen who use DMPA, and returning to clinic for the 21-dayrepeat pregnancy test visit. Finally, 28 pregnancies werediagnosed during the study period, and those in the bridgemethod group were almost 4.0 (1.2, 13.4) times more likely tobe diagnosed with a pregnancy than those in the Depo Nowgroup. Conclusions : Immediate administration of DMPA is associated with improved adherence to DMPA continuationand fewer pregnancies. Rickert VI, Tiezzi L, Lipshutz J, et al.

CCCEditorialComment The first article provides reassurance that a woman who is late, even as late as four weeks, for her scheduled Depo- Provera injection faces a low risk of unintended pregnancy andshould receive the next injection without additional barriers.The second article provides more support for a \"quick start\"approach to Depo-Provera initiation. A \"quick start\" protocolcan also be used for resuming Depo Provera use for those whoare more than 2 to 4 weeks past the recommended date for theirnext dose. Frequentlyaskedquestions ProgesteroneforthePreventionofRecurrentSpontaneousPretermBirth Q. My patient is asymptomatic with a documented history of one prior spontaneous preterm birth at 33 weeks who is now 18 weeks gestation by a good LMP and an ultrasound at 12weeks. Should she be give progesterone therapy? A. Yes, but first make sure she agrees to return weekly until 36 weeks of pregnancy. The incidence of preterm birth has risen progressively over the last decade from 9% to 12% of all births in the US.Preterm birth is the second leading cause of infant mortality inthis country and a significant proportion of survivors haveresidual disabilities. Despite multiple trials of tocolytics,antibiotics, and other preventive strategies, no effectivemethod of preventing preterm birth has been found. Recently, prophylactic treatment of high risk women with a history of one or more prior spontaneous preterm births with August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 261progestational compounds have demonstrated efficacy.1,2A prior meta-analysis3has also demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of preterm delivery with the use of 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) has recommended that when progesterone is used, it be restrictedto women with a documented history of a previous spontaneous birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation. 4 Extensive experience with progesterone has shown it not to be a teratogen,5and its use in this protocol will not involve administering it during organogenesis in the first trimester. As a referral center, ANMC renders care to a large number of women who have experienced preterm birth, and an effective preventive treatment would be most advantageous tothis population. Referral of these women and/or their infants to Level III centers for delivery and prolonged level III newborn intensive care generates significant expenditures for the institution that could be avoided by prevention of the problem. Eligible Patients: 1) Asymptomatic women with a documented history of one or more prior spontaneous preterm births (less than 35 weeks gestation) who are identified prior to 20 weeks gestation, who are dated by ultrasound prior to 20 weeks, and who agree to return for weekly injections from 16 weeks (may enroll up to 20 weeks) to 36 weeks of pregnancy. 2) Consult with Maternal Fetal Medicine to establish eligibility and monitor outcomes. Ineligible Patients:1) Women with a history of prior preterm birth due to a known cause such as a uterine malformation orcervical insufficiency requiring cervical cerclage. 2) Women who present with symptoms of preterm labor (symptomatic uterine contractions, short cervix on ultrasound, uterine bleeding, ruptured membranes) after 20 weeks gestation. 3) Women with a multi-fetal gestation. 4) Women with a known fetal anomaly. 5) Women with a prior indicated preterm birth (as a result of severe preeclampsia, placenta previa, fetal demise, or threatening maternal medical illness). Drug Treatment Protocol: 1) Weekly intramuscular injection of 17- hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) 250 mg* from 16 through 36 weeks of gestation (available through many pharmacies as 10mL vials (250mg/mL) at a costof approximately $120/vial (if >6 vials are ordered); be sure to check out availability before you discuss the possible therapy with your patient). 2) Fetal growth ultrasounds every 4 weeks while the patient is being treated.Outcomes for Quality Assurance: 1) Incidence of preterm birth prior to 35 weeks.2) Infant weights and Apgar scores.3) Incidence of preterm labor requiring inpatient treatment but not resulting in preterm birth. 4) Any adverse maternal effects while receiving the therapy. CCCEditorialComment: Shortcervix,multiplegestation,pretermlabor There is as yet no consistent evidence that this drug is effective in women with preterm labor, a short cervix, or other high risk conditions. 6On the other hand, progesterone supplementation did notreduce the rate of preterm birth in multiple gestations randomly assigned to receive this therapy.7 References 1.

InternationalHealthUpdate ClaireWendland;Madison,WI Newevidenceonlead'slong-termeffects Lead has been back in the news lately. A potent neurotoxin, lead damages the brain by altering neurotransmitter release in a way that leads to accelerated apoptosis (cell death). It is a known toxin for adults, but appears to be a particularly bad actor in the developing brain. Though it hasn't typically been a problem in the rural parts of Indian country, urban AI/AN people living in dilapidated housing stock are at risk for chronic lead toxicity. Two new August 2008 THE IHS PROVIDER 262articles based on longitudinal research from the Cincinnati Lead Study (CLS) may heighten the stakes of the debate overacceptable childhood lead levels. The CLS birth cohort was recruited in the womb between 1979 and 1984 from urban inner-city neighborhoods known tohave high lead levels. These children got detailed exposurehistories from the prenatal period on, frequent neuropsychiatricexams and serum lead levels, and have now been followed intoyoung adulthood. One of the two new reports shows a smallbut significant correlation between childhood lead levels andadult arrest records in this cohort. After careful adjusting forpotential confounders, John Wright and colleagues found thatfor every 5 mcg/dl increase in prenatal (maternal) andchildhood blood lead, total arrests and arrests for violent crimewent up by roughly forty percent. In the second report, KimCecil and colleagues used MRI to assess brain volume in 157members of the CLS cohort. Regression analysisdemonstrated a linear dose-dependent correlation betweenchildhood serum lead levels and reduction in adult brainvolume, a result that was highly statistically significant. Mostinteresting, the reduction was specific to grey matter in theanterior cingulate cortex and portions of the prefrontal cortex.(White matter and CSF volume were not affected.) These arethe regions responsible for judgment, focusing attention,regulation of mood, and executive functions. Grey-mattervolume loss in these areas was also much more pronouncedamong men than women, even at similar lead levels. Thisfinding suggests a mechanism for the links previously exploredbetween childhood lead exposure and adult anti-socialbehavior, criminal activity, and poor intellectual performance. Some of you may be scratching your heads over why this is an international health problem. Unfortunately, themeasures put in place to mitigate lead toxicity in the UnitedStates years ago - screening programs, mandated transitions tounleaded gasoline, abolition of lead-based paints and ceramicglazes - never happened in much of the Third World. In fact,some gasoline sold today in South America, the Middle East and Africa has more lead additives than leaded gas in our country ever did; paint sold for residences, toys, and playground equipment still contains high levels of lead inAfrica and several countries in Asia. In Central and SouthAmerica, unregulated industrial processes are the majorculprits. Some experts argue that an unrecognized epidemic oflow- to moderate-level lead poisoning is occurring in much ofthe Third World, and a few small pilot studies of lead levelstend to confirm this assessment. Improvements in screening,policy and enforcement are urgent. Cecil KM et al. Decreased brain volume in adults with childhood lead exposure.
