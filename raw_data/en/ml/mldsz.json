No. COVID19 vaccine is Emergency Use Authorization, or \"EUA\". This is a fast-track process that bypasses the long-term safety and efficacy assessment of normal vaccine approval, and relies heavily on manufacturer input.

How many shots are needed and why? 2 shots. - 1st shot helps the immune system to recognize the COVID 19 virus and start to produce immunity. - 2nd shot to strengthen immunity. 6. What are the adverse reactions? Myalgia, local swelling and irritation, joint pain, fever, chills, body ache, severe allergic reaction, facial paralysis 7. How soon will I be immune after vaccination? After 1st shot, 10-14 days will provide 50% immunity After 2nd shot, will provide 95-99% immunity 8. Do I still have to wear masks? Yes.

How does Vaccine Work Injection of mRNA vaccine into patient Body will absorb the mRNA vaccine and starts to produce viral spike proteins on our cell's surface The spike proteins will elicit the body to start to produce antibodies and Killer T cells in preparation to fight off the virus When our body encounter COVID virus, it will quickly recognize and ready to neutralize them Different Types of Vaccine We wish you all the very best in 2021.

Sincerely, Everyone at Pucillo Family Practice Vaccines Type Companies mRNA Vaccine messenger RNA, (viral genetic software that instructs cells to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein. That will get the attention of the immune system. The mRNA is coated in soft fatty lipids to protect it. Pfizer Moderna Vector Vaccine Vector vaccines use another virus to carry in the genetic instructions to make the spike protein. For coronavirus they all use adenoviruses, a type of common cold virus. They attach to cells and inject DNA that tells the cells to make coronavirus spike protein. Astrazeneca Janssen Sputnik Protein subunit vaccine Protein subunit vaccines just get little pieces of the target virus circulating in the system for the immune system to find and recognize.
