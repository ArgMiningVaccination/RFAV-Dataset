Additionally, foods are basic for nutrients, survival and growth of organisms, and are a good source for antioxidants. E'jiao Gao (EJG, made up of E'jiao, walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine) is a well-known traditional food in China, however, little nutritional and bioactive information is available. Therefore, in the present study, nutritional compositions of EJG, including protein, amino acid, vitamins, fatty acid and mineral contents, were investigated. Furthermore, 55 female aging ICR mice were used to evaluate the anti-aging activity of EJG in vivo, and their antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD, GPx and CAT, and MDA contents were determined. Results EJG is abundant in protein, amino acids, vitamin E, essential fatty acids (linoleic acid and linolenic acid), mineral elements (calcium, potassium, magnesium,) and other biological nutrients (selenium, zinc and iron). After administrated with EJG, the activities of SOD, GPx and CAT were remarkably improved (P<0.05) and the content of MDA remarkably decreased (P<0.05). Conclusion Overall, EJG is a functional food for supplementation of protein, vitamin E, amino acid or calcium, and is a potential food for promoting the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzyme to fight against aging. Therefore, these data are essential theoretical basis for the development of the traditional food of EJG and useful for encouraging people to pay attention to the nutritional composition and bioactivities of food they consume. Aging is a major public health issue, and the elderly population will be expected to grow from 17.4% to nearly 30% worldwide by 2060 [1]. In the process of aging, the risk of many chronic diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson's and cardiovascular diseases increase [2]. Numerous studies indicate that nutrients, food components and whole diets can influence cognitive and ageing [1]. Nutrients are basic for survival and growth of organisms. However, people usually consume foods that are available or palatable. In addition, with the development of food processing technology, nutritional composition of food can be largely affected by the processing. Therefore, it is urgent to produce foods that are palatable, nutritional and capable to fight against aging process. Colla corii asini (E'jiao), a solid glue prepared from donkey (Equus asinus) skin, has been considered as a health-care food and used as a traditional Chinese medicine in life-nourishing and clinical antianemic therapy for more than 2000 years [3]. E'jiao is mainly composed of amino acids, low molecular weight hydrolyzates of collagen proteins, polysaccharides, volatile substances and inorganic substances [4]. It has attracted great attention due to its biological activities in hematopoiesis, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-ageing, improving immunity, etc [5-8]. E'jiao Gao (EJG), one of the popular edible forms of E'jiao, is made up of E'jiao, walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine. The walnut is a high nutritional food containing high contents of protein, essential fatty acids, polyphenols and to copherols, which has been reported to reduce risk of cancer, coronary heart disease and to improve antioxidant as well as antiproliferative activity [9,10]. Semen sesame nigrum not only benefits in nourishing the liver and anti-ageing, but also in anti-wrinkling, keeping the balance of nerves and beautifying [11]. Rice wine is popular in China and is not only for drinking but also for medical use in traditional Chinese medicine all over the country. Rice wine has been claimed to have physiological functions in preventing aging, cancer and cardio cardiovascular diseases [12]. Free radicals are one of the reasons that associated with aging. In organisms, there are two antioxidant defense systems, antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds, preventing organisms from damages of free radicals [2]. However, oxidative stress occurs when antioxidant defense systems is too weak to scavenge the excessive free radicals, which is harmful for organisms. It has been reported to suppress the aging process through enhancing antioxidant activity, scavenging free radicals, and modulating expression of aging-related gene [5]. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the nutritional composition of EJG and evaluate the effects of EJG on antioxidant enzymes in aged mice. | | Constituents | | Per 100g | | RDI | | %CS | | Moisture (g) | | 9.47 | | | | | | Lipids (g) | | 29.00 | | 78a | | 3.72 | | Protein (g) | | 20.90 | | 50a | | 4.18 | | Ash (g) | | 3.40 | | | | | | Total dietary fiber (g) | | 2.96 | | 28a | | 1.06 | | Lnoleic acid (g) | | 10.42 | | | | | | Linolenic acid (g) | | 1.35 | | | | | | Amino acids (mg) | | Per 100g | | RDI | | %CS | | Essential | | | | | | | | Isolecucine | | 387 | | 1400b | | 2.76 | | Lysine | | 484 | | 2100b | | 2.30 | | Methionine | | 196 | | 700b | | 2.80 | | Leucine | | 778 | | 2730b | | 2.85 | | Phenylalanine | | 789 | | 1750b | | 4.51 | | Tryptophan | | 71 | | 280b | | 2.54 | | Threonine | | 464 | | 1050b | | 4.42 | | Valine | | 546 | | 1820b | | 3.00 | | Non-essential | | | | | | | | Arginine | | 1330 | | | | | | Aspartic acid | | 1109 | | | | | | Alanine | | 1.157 | | | | | | Cysteine | | 146 | | 280b | | 5.21 | | Glycine | | 2307 | | | | | | Glutamic acid | | 2287 | | | | | | Histidine | | 274 | | 700b | | 3.91 | | Proline | | 1474 | | | | | | Serine | | 676 | | | | | | Tyrosine | | 394 | | | | | | Vitamins (mg) | | Per 100g | | RDI | | %CS | | Vitamin E | | 6.525 | | 15a | | 4.35 | | Vitamin C | | 1.100 | | 90a | | 0.12 | | Minerals (mg) | | Per 100g | | RDI | | %CS | | Ca | | 454.09 | | 1300a | | 3.49 | | P | | 295.00 | | 1250a | | 2.36 | | K | | 283.00 | | | | | | Mg | | 157.95 | | 420a | | 3.76 | | Mn | | 1.59 | | 2.3a | | 6.91 | | Zn | | 2.05 | | 11a | | 1.86 | | Fe | | 3.24 | | 18a | | 1.80 | | Se | | 0.013 | | 0.055a | | 2.36 | | I | | 0.004 | | 0.150a | | 0.27 | | Groups | | n | | 0 days | | 30 days | | 60 days | | HE | | 11 | | 42.8\u00b13.17 | | 41.3\u00b12.75 | | 43.1\u00b14.17 | | ME | | 11 | | 42.6\u00b11.90 | | 41.6\u00b13.06 | | 42.2\u00b13.68 | | LE | | 11 | | 42.6\u00b11.80 | | 41.5\u00b12.48 | | 41.7\u00b13.38 | | VE | | 11 | | 41.7\u00b13.35 | | 44.2\u00b14.02 | | 43.9\u00b14.66 | | MC | | 11 | | 41.1\u00b14.07*** | | 43.0\u00b14.77*** | | 43.3\u00b14.87*** | | YC | | 10 | | 25.8\u00b10.66 | | 27.2\u00b11.28 | | 29.7\u00b10.88 Table 2: Effects of E'jiao Gao (EJG) on the weight gain of experimental mice.

Macro-nutrients, including carbohydrates, fiber, fats, protein and water [28], is an energy provider for metabolism of an organism, while micro-nutrients, including at least iron, vitamins, cobalt, copper, manganese, chromium, iodine, selenium, zinc, and molybdenum take part in building and repairing of tissue and regulating body processes. Organisms obtain nutrients from environments and their growth and health conditions are largely influenced by what they eat. A poor diet, especially a Western pattern diet, is associated with many diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even deficiency disease of blindness [29-32]. Food intake is greatly influenced by availability, the processing and palatability of food. However, with the development of food processing technology, the nutritional components in food can be largely affected by the processing. Nowadays, nutritional value becomes an important factor in people's choice of food. EJG is a snack that is mixed with walnut, semen sesame nigrum and rice wine, which is delicious and nutritional and is popular with women in China. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals [33], which can be found in many fibrous tissues, and is believed to be the main active component in E'jiao. It is widely used to nourish the blood. A previous study isolated two collagen-derived peptides from E'jiao and confirmed exhibition of strong hematopoietic activity by elevated CFU-E (colony-forming units-erythroid) and CFU-GM (colony-forming units granulocyte-monocyte) of mouse bone marrow cells [6]. Collagen is important for women, which is not only because of its ability to treat gynecologic diseases but also its importance in delaying natural ageing process by tightening and smoothing the skin internally [34]. Nowadays, many people use the cosmetic products of collagen, such as creams and lotions, to keep skin health. However, these products can only treat some lines and smaller wrinkles on the surface, and to do some substantial effect was considered to take oral applications [35]. From nutrients analysis, protein was a dominated component in EJG and it was mainly from E'jiao. It is known that E'jiao contains about 80% collagen; therefore EJG can be a good supplementation of collagen to fight against aging. EJG contains many essential or non-essential amino acids that have various biological functions. For example, glycine has been considered an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain stem and medulla [36]. Hydroxyproline is an important component of the synthesis of the connective tissue collagen. The deficiency of L-arginine is frequently associated with aging, and L-Arginine supplementation can improve endothelial function and decreased systolic blood pressure by normalizing plasma L-arginine and L-argining/L-ornithine ratio [37]. Recently, many studies suggest that vitamins, minerals and botanicals are natural ingredients to improve antioxidant activities and anti-ageing. In the present study, Vitamin E was extremely abundant in EJG, which suggested that EJG was a potential antioxidant. Vitamin E is considered to be a good peroxyl radical scavenger and has been developed as a commercial antioxidant, protecting tissues from damage of free radicals, protecting lipids and preventing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [30]. In addition, many macro-elements and trace elements of mineral that are beneficial for humans have been found in EJG. Among these detected mineral elements, selenium is an essential nutrient for its important antioxidant functions and neuroprotective actions [38]. Human usually obtain natural selenium from dietary, such as meat, eggs and vegetables [39]. EJG contains about 0.013mg/100g selenium, which would be another choice for humans. Reactive oxygen species or free radicals, including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, are unstable and reactive. In general, they play an important role in signal transduction, leukocyte adhesion, gene transcription and many other critical cellular reactions. However, though the excess of free radicals can be detoxified by cell-produced antioxidants, such as catalases, peroxidases and superoxide dismutase, the oxidative stress will happen with aging or other pathological conditions. Oxidative stress can damage many critical molecules, increase DNA mutations and cause cell death [40]. Supplementation with antioxidants can decrease cellular damage from excess reactive oxygen species. After administrated with EJG, the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in aging mice (SOD, GPx, and CAT) were remarkably improved and the content of MDA was decreased, when compared to the model control group. SOD is the first line of antioxidant-defense systems, the best characterized, to catalyze the dismutation of O2 into non-toxic of H2O2 and O2 [41]. GPx protects the organism from oxidative damage mainly by reducing lipid hydroperoxides [42]. CAT is also a very important enzyme that catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules [43]. Therefore, it is essential for the organisms to keep the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The capability of EJG in improving SOD, GPx and CAT activities in aged mice, may be due to the containment of some potential antioxidant nutrients. For example, zinc and manganese are critical cofactors for superoxide dismutase; vitamin E and other vitamins reduce reactive oxygen species [44]. In conclusion, EJG is a nutritious snack food, which is abundant in protein, essential amino acids, vitamins, essential fatty acids and minerals. In vivo experiments, EJG exhibited a good ability to improve the activities of SOD, GPx and CAT in aged mice. In addition, it decreased the content of MDA in aged mice. It indicated that EJG was a healthy food, containing potential anti-ageing capacity, for consumption. Authors have no conflict of interests. Citation: Cao F, Chen Y, Chang C, Ru W, Chen J, et al.
