From a report: The Chinese government had [issued a censorship notice to broadcasters and online publishers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/24/china-censored-googles-alphago-match-against-worlds-best-go-player), warning them against livestreaming Tuesday's game, according to China Digital Times, a site that regularly posts such notices in the name of transparency. \"Regarding the go match between Ke Jie and AlphaGo, no website, without exception, may carry a livestream,\" the notice read. \"If one has been announced in advance, please immediately withdraw it.\" The ban did not just cover video footage: outlets were banned from covering the match live in any way, including text commentary, social media, or push notifications. It appears the government was concerned that 19-year-old Ke, who lost the first of three scheduled games by a razor-thin half-point margin, might have suffered a more damaging defeat that would hurt the national pride of a state which holds Go close to its heart.
