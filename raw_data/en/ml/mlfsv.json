We suggest slowly decreasing the intake of caffeine and alcohol the week prior to starting your program. - Skin symptoms - some people experience increased acne / blemishes, or other mild skin eruptions. These symptoms will pass! Stick with it and give your body grace to adjust. Although this detox program is not meant to be a weight loss journey, it does involve the elimination of known inflammatory foods. Fast food and other processed options are definitely on the \"What Not to Eat\" list and should be avoided. By switching to a more nutrient dense and diverse food plan, we can encourage improved gut function and a healthier mix of gut bacteria. No.You may substitute any plan-appropriate recipe for the suggested meal to suit your taste, or make substitutions with ingredients from the \"What to Eat\" list. Just make sure you are excluding the foods on the \"What Not to Eat\" list. Continuing your normal level of exercise is totally ok. Pay attention to your body and don't over do it. Switching things up to a more gentle routine such as walking, yoga or stretching daily is an acceptable shift during a detox. This is definitely not the time to ramp up your fitness routine. There are a number of supportive practices that you can incorporate into your plan to boost effectiveness, which include: - Get plenty of deep and restorative sleep. We suggest a minimum of 8 hours per night. - Drink plenty of fluids. We suggest a minimum of a 1/2 oz per pound of body weight of purified water each day for the entire program. - Infrared sauna can also assist in moving things out through the skin. Please consult your doctor regarding the do's and don'ts of sauna use. - Supportive IV therapy with glutathione, which supports liver detoxification pathways, is a great way to boost your detox program. Herbal teas specifically formulated to support detoxification can also be helpful. We like the Cleanse & Detox Tea by Gaia Herbs. "}
