The guidelinesprovide a reference for research laboratories to assess risk and establish protocols for the safe handling ofarthropod vectors of human and animal disease agents. The guidelines were originally published in 2004 and have been updated here to reflect the spectrum of vector taxa under investigation, and the demands of working with vector arthropods in the context of the Select Agent Rule. Keywords: guidelines, vector-borne disease, laboratory safety, risk assessment, containment, arthropod Introduction Laboratories in which living arthropods are reared and maintained for research purposes have been in existence for decades with few reports of harm to their workers or to the communities in which they are located. Many of these organ-isms are associated with potential risks should they escape, since many are vectors of infectious human diseases. When they are experimentally infected with a human pathogen, the arthropodsrepresent an immediate risk to those who come into contact with them. Even when they are uninfected, they can represent a risk to the community if, by escaping, they become the crucial linkcompleting the transmission cycle for a pathogen. There are two prominent examples of initially small exotic vector introductions that resulted in signicant disease in- creases. In the early 1900s, anopheline mosquitoes weredrastically reduced in northeastern South America because of eradication campaigns. The concomitant drop in incidence of malaria and other human infectious diseases was reversed afterAnopheles gambiae was discovered in the port city of Natal, Brazil, in 1930 (Soper and Wilson 1943). The African malaria vector was accidentally introduced into the area, probably byrapid marine mail service. Although the release was not from a laboratory, the introduction of a highly efcient vector is widely thought to be responsible for the resurgence of malariain Brazil. Fortunately, an aggressive effort to eradicate An. gambiae by conventional means was successful. A second example concerns the current distribution of the Chagas disease vector, Rhodnius prolixus , throughout ruralCentral America. Whereas this insect is considered indigenous to northern South America, it is thought to have been introducedinto Central America through a laboratory escape that occurredin El Salvador in 1915 (Schoeld 2000). While there are a number of other triatomine species throughout Central America that transmit the agent of Chagas disease to humans, the estab-lishment of R. prolixus was especially important because of its close association with humans and domestic dwellings. R. pro- lixus is considered the most important vector of Chagas disease in Central America and the species targeted for elimination by the Central American Chagas Disease Control Initiative. Past editions of the reference manual ''Biosafety in Micro- biological and Biomedical Laboratories'' (BMBL) (Centers forDisease Control and Prevention [CDC] 1999) noted that de- spite the long history of accidental laboratory infections of workers and their immediate contacts, ''laboratories workingwith infectious agents have not been shown to represent a threat to the community'' referring to reviews of laboratory-acquired infections at CDC and the National Animal Disease Centerwhich documented that there were no instances of secondary transmission (Richardson 1973, Sullivan et al. 1978). Never- theless, the historical accidental introductions An. gambiae and R. prolixus suggest the possibility for community impacts of introduced arthropod vectors, even when uninfected. The advent of transgenic technology in which vector ar- thropods are now routinely genetically modied requiresarthropod containment recommendations with a particular view to preventing inadvertent escape and establishment. These guidelines are intended to do that. They have been Presented as a project of the American Committee of Medical Entomology of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. /C211American Committee of Medical Entomology and American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

The Committee mem-bership and drafting procedures are summarized in Appendix1-3. These guidelines represent the position of the committee as a whole, not that of all individuals nor of the membership's individual institutions. Transgenic arthropods and those containing microbes modied by recombinant DNA technology are addressed here solely in the context of public health signicance. Theemphasis is therefore on the phenotypic changes resulting from the modication rather than ecological and environ- mental issues, which are addressed elsewhere (WHO/TDRand FNIH 2014, Marshall 2010). Background Several documents particularly influenced the effort to create these guidelines and shaped their content 1980. The Subcommittee on Arboviral Laboratory Safety, a subcommittee of the American Committee on Arthropod-Borne Viruses (ACAV), a sister organization of ACME, published guidelines in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (The Subcommittee on Ar- bovirus Laboratory Safety 1980). These were developed on the basis of a survey of almost 600 laboratories and covered awide range of pathogenic viruses. They addressed issuesrelevant to the safety of laboratory workers and assigned each virus to one of four ''levels of containment and practice'' based on the severity of the associated human disease, themethod of transmission, and the amount of experience han- dling the organism. The document addresses containment of the arthropod vector for each level, but only when it is in-fected by the viral agent. It did not address nonviral ( e.g., eukaryotic or bacterial) agents or their vectors, transgenic animals, nor did it take into account biological containmentthat may be provided by the climate or other characteristics ofthe location in which the research is conducted. 1984. BMBL was published in response to a series of surveys, beginning, for example, with reports of laboratory- acquired infections (Sulkin et al. 1949, Richardson 1973,Sullivan et al. 1978). Now in its fth edition, this PublicHealth Service document describes the practices, facilities, and equipment suggested to safely work with potentially dangerous agents in a laboratory (Centers for Disease Controland Prevention [CDC] 2009). 1995. The American Mosquito Control Association adopted a position that containment of genetically manipu- lated arthropods be addressed by funding and regulatory agencies. A letter sent to the Directors of the National Sci-ence Foundation, the CDC, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Pan American Health Organi- zation, and the Administrator of the U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA) urged that ''guidelines for research be developed to ensure that no exotic agents are accidentally released, and to ascertain the potential for the released or-ganisms to alter vector-borne disease transmission patterns.'' 1996. Hunt and Tabachnick (1996) prepared a forum article on containment of very small arthropod vectors. Thisprovided a means to test the efcacy of containment and addressed the peculiar containment needs of laboratories working with arthropods too small to be restricted by con-ventional insectary precautions. Higgs and Beaty (1996) authored a chapter entitled ''Rearing and Containment of Mosquito Vectors.'' The chapter gives practical advice and illustrations for the design,construction, and operation of insectaries. 1997. The Molecular Biology of Disease Vectors was published (Crampton et al. 1997). It contains several chaptersdescribing methods for the experimental infection of a wide variety of insects. Although most of the emphasis of this textbook is methodological, safety aspects are also addressed. 1998. The USDA, through its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), developed draft guidelines for the containment of nonindigenous, phytophagous arthropodsand their parasitoids. These guidelines include standards for construction, equipment, and operations when handling ar- thropod pests of plants. While the document focuses onpreventing environmental detriment, the general containment principles for this class of arthropods are relevant to hema- tophagous arthropods. 1999. The Department of Health and Human Services, through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), issued re- vised guidelines for the safe handling of organisms thatcontain recombinant DNA, including arthropods (NIH Guidelines 2016). Paralleling the BMBL, these guidelines also specify that an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) reviewall nonexempt research protocols involving recombinant DNAand approve the level and implementation of appropriate containment. Section III.D.4 of the Guidelines specically addresses arthropods that contain recombinant DNA and as-sign them to a minimum of biosafety level (BSL)-2. The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH), ACME, adopted a resolution to develop theseArthropod Containment Guidelines. The guideline's form is directly based on the structure and wording of BMBL (American Committee of Medical Entomology and Ameri-can Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2003) (see Appendix 2). Intent This document supplements BMBL by providing safety principles for handling arthropod vectors. Readers should refer to BMBL for standard and special microbiological practices appropriate for the agents with which they work.These have been repeated here when they would apply to thevector alone as well as the agents. Throughout, the authors have attempted to formulate guidelines that are consistent with those of BMBL, yet recognize the fact that biologicalcontainment ( i.e., location- and season-specic fate of es- caped arthropods in the environment) signicantly confounds risk assessment and therefore appropriate safety practices.Furthermore, the flying, crawling, burrowing, and reclusive habits of arthropods, combined with the agents they may carry, introduce an element of risk-increasing behavior notcovered by BMBL.ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 153 This document describes the arthropod handling practices, safety equipment, and facilities constituting Arthropod Con- tainment Levels 1-4 (ACL-1 to -4). These are recommendedby the ASTMH/ACME for work with a variety of uninfectedarthropods and those carrying infectious agents, and for work with transgenic vector arthropods in laboratory settings. The principles of risk assessment, specic practices, and equip-ment will also be useful in nontraditional arthropod research settings such as tents, greenhouses, and outdoor cages. Field sites at which research with such arthropods is conducted aredened by the type and duration of activities that occur there and the risks to the participants and inhabitants, but they are not the focus of the document. Although plant pathologistsand entomologists may nd this document useful, the focus ofthis document is on arthropods that transmit pathogens of public health importance. More details specifying the ar- thropods that are generally excluded from these guidelinescan be found under ''Arthropod Containment Levels.'' This document is strictly concerned with laboratory research that involves arthropods of public health importance and risksassociated with pathogen transmission. Arthropods to be con- sidered include among others: insects (Diptera\u2014mosquitoes, flies, Phthiraptera\u2014lice; Siphonaptera\u2014fleas) and arachnids (Acari\u2014ticks, mites). All life cycle stages, eggs, larvae, nymphs, adults, must be considered under the term arthropod.The small size, highly motile characteristics of some arthro-pods (especially flying and jumping), and relative long life and resistance of some stages make the containment of arthropods a unique problem. The diversity of these organisms and theircomplex life cycles often mean that procedures and practices to safely contain the animal are species-specic. Conversely, the specic culture requirements of some species make mainte-nance difcult, but containment relatively straightforward since they cannot survive outside of the preferred habitat. Al- though noninsects (ticks and mites) are also considered here,the designated area in which these organisms are maintainedand cultured will hereafter be referred to as an insectary. From the above, it follows that many arthropods ( e.g., fruit flies, cockroaches, and various Lepidoptera and Coleoptera)that have been collected locally, or have been purchased from pet stores or commercial vendors for study or educational purposes, are usually exempt from these guidelines. How-ever, experiments planned with nonvector arthropods that are deliberately infected with a disease agent might be informed by these guidelines. Arthropods are an important educational tool in many schools and colleges, and are collected and cultured for many different purposes. These guidelines should not impact in-terest in and research on uninfected arthropods that pose nodanger to the surrounding environment and public health. In these circumstances, maintenance and rearing techniques are at the discretion of the student or instructor, and do not fallwithin the containment criteria described in these guidelines. It should be noted that although these guidelines are in- tended mainly for U.S. research institutions and those pro-grams in other countries receiving NIH funds, there are many institutions outside of the United States or the European Union, particularly in resource-limited sites, where admin-istrative constructs such as institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC), IBC, biosafety ofcers, and occupa- tional health clinics do not exist. Small institutions even inthe United States may not have the infrastructure or funds to renovate laboratories, and therefore, any alternatives to mit- igate these realities have to be thoroughly vetted in a riskassessment to ensure that research on vector arthropods issafe and fully contained. These recommendations are advisory. They provide a voluntary guide or code of practice as well as principles forupgrading operations. They also offer a guide and reference in the construction of new laboratory facilities or the reno- vation of existing facilities. The application of these recom-mendations to any particular laboratory must be based on a risk assessment of the particular vector species, disease agents, activities, and geographic location of the laboratory. Field Sites Sites at which vector arthropod research is conducted necessarily span a wide range of sophistication and infra-structure from modern structures that are clearly ''laborato- ries''\u2014the primary focus of this document\u2014to primitive eld sites that do not. To clearly dene the characteristics thatdistinguish a laboratory from a eld site, we describe char-acteristics of these activities to enable researchers, IBCs, and granting organizations to determine whether these laboratory guidelines apply at all. A eld site is a temporary facility, thework is performed with indigenous arthropod vectors that are collected locally, and in the event of escape, there is likely only a small risk that released arthropods would modify thegenetic structure of resident arthropod populations or in- crease the risk of human or animal infection with locally transmitted pathogens. Maintenance of indigenous vectorsfor local research may occur in these facilities. Field labo-ratories usually do not require structural modication of ex- isting buildings for vector containment, rather arthropod escape is minimized by appropriate primary containment(caging) and handling practices. Field laboratories are often located in places where the species under study is involved in pathogen transmission.Because vectors brought from the eld into the laboratory may be naturally infected with a pathogen, appropriate pre- cautions should be taken to minimize researcher exposure toinfectious organisms. On the contrary, the risk within the laboratory by manipulating collected samples may be less than working outside. The risk assessment process will de-termine what precautions, if any, are warranted, for example,vaccines, prophylaxis, and repellents. Authorities Importation and transport of exotic arthropods of public health importance fall under the purview of the Public Health Service/CDC, Ofce of Health and Safety (United States Public Health Service [USPHS] 42 Code of Federal Reg-ulations [CFR], Part 71.54). Many arthropods transmit both human and animal diseases and may therefore also be regu- lated by the USDA APHIS. Arthropods modied by recom-binant DNA methods or containing similarly modied microbes are addressed in the NIH Guidelines and may be regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) and/or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).154 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 Risk Assessment for Arthropod Vectors The intent of this section is to provide guidance and to establish a framework for selecting the appropriate ACL (facilities, equipment, and practices), reducing risks of re- lease and exposure of laboratory workers and the public to avector and associated agents. ''Risk'' in the context of this document implies the prob- ability that harm, injury, or disease will occur among labor-atorians or the general public because of accidental release ofa competent disease vector and/or associated agents. In the context of vector research laboratories, risk assessment considers two kinds of effects: direct effects such as biting,infestations, and myiasis, and indirect effects of morbidity and mortality due to the pathogens transmitted. The latter is by far of higher concern, and direct effects are not consideredhere. Therefore, in this document, ACLs are directly corre- lated with the appropriate BSL of the agents with which they are naturally or experimentally infected or may transmit inthe event of accidental release (see BMBL Section VI). While the focus of this document is human health risk, effects on animals because of arthropods known to transmitanimal disease are to be considered. Researchers are en-couraged to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and USDA-APHIS regarding risks and regulation before completing a risk assessment. The laboratory director or principal investigator (PI) has primary responsibility for assessing risks to set the appro- priate BSL for the work. This is done in close collaborationwith the IBC, if there is one, to ensure compliance with established guidelines and regulations. Development and review of the risk assessment and the planned safety pre-cautions by consultation with experts in the biology andpublic health signicance of the arthropod are essential. In performing a qualitative risk assessment, all the risk factors are rst identied and explored considering relatedinformation available such as BMBL, the NIH Guidelines, the Canadian Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines (Public Health Agency of Canada 2004), the WHO Biosafety Guidelines(World Health Organization (WHO) 2004), and the ACAV Catalogue of Arboviruses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 1985). In many cases, one must rely onother sources of information such as eld data, the literature concerning aspects of vector competence, and environmental requirements through consultation with recognized experts inarthropod and pathogen relationships. The greatest challenge of risk assessment lies in those cases where complete information on these factors is un- available. A conservative approach is advisable when insuf-cient information forces subjective judgment. Principles of Risk Assessment Arthropod risk assessment is primarily a qualitative judg- ment that cannot be based on a prescribed algorithm. Several factors must be considered in combination: the agents trans-mitted, whether the arthropod is or may be infected, the mo- bility and longevity of the arthropod, its reproductive potential, biological containment, and epidemiological factors influ-encing transmission in the proposed location or region at risk. Arthropod vectors of infectious agents can be assigned to the following discrete categories. Each category has a range ofrisks that need to be assessed.Arthropods known to be free of specic pathogens Risk from these materials to laboratorians is similar to that experienced by the general public: nuisance due to conse- quences of escape and temporary or permanent establish- ment. Consequently, the public health risk is likely to be lowunless epidemiological conditions exist that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase in transmission of an endemic disease in that particular region, or establishment ofthe released vector leads to signicant risk of future trans-mission potential for an exotic pathogen. In the event that establishment is likely, the arthropod must be handled under more stringent containment conditions. If an accidental release occurs, followed by even tran- sient establishment of an uninfected arthropod, the proba- bility of increased transmission must be considered in thecontext of the location in whi ch the work will be performed or in regions to which escaped arthropods could likely migrate. For example, escape of an exotic malaria vector ina malarious region has a signicantly higher probability of increasing transmission and therefore a higher risk than escape in a nonmalarious region. The pathogenicity of theagent and availability of treatments and drugs should alsobe considered. Answers to the following questions will affect the level of risk due to accidental escape of uninfected arthropods: /C15Is the arthropod species already established in the locale? /C15If the arthropod is exotic, is it likely that the arthropod would become temporarily or permanently establishedin the event of accidental escape? /C15Does the arthropod have a known or characterized insecticide-resistant genotype or phenotype? /C15Could the arthropod be realistically controlled or lo- cally eradicated by traditional methods ( e.g., spraying, trapping) in the event of escape? /C15Are the agents that the arthropod is known to transmit cycling in the locale, or has the agent been present in the past? /C15Are agents that the arthropod could reasonably be ex- pected to transmit to animals present in the locale? /C15Would accidental release of the arthropod signicantly increase the risk to humans and animals above thatalready in existence in the event of introduction of exotic pathogens in the area? /C15In the case of zoonotic diseases, does the animal res- ervoir exist in the locale, and, if so, what is the infec-tion status? /C15Was the exotic arthropod derived from a subpopulation (strain, geographically distinct form) whose phenotypeis known or suspected to vary in ways that could rea- sonably be expected to signicantly increase its vector competence? If so, it should be handled under the morestringent conditions within ACL-2 (described below) even if uninfected. /C15Are disabled strains available, whose viability after escape would be limited ( e.g., eye-color pathogens Arthropods that are known to be, or reasonably suspected of being, infected with infectious agents always have risksARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 155 that must be identied, and appropriate precautions must be taken for worker and public health safety. The characteristics of most known infectious agents have been well-dened andare the starting point for determining risk from these ar-thropods. Information useful to risk assessment can be ob- tained from laboratory investigations, disease surveillance, and epidemiological studies. Infectious agents known tohave caused laboratory-associated infections are included in the BMBL agent summary statements (Section VII). Other sources include the American Public Health Association'smanual, Control of Communicable Diseases (Benenson 1995). Literature reviews on laboratory-acquired infections also may be helpful (Sulkin et al. 1949, Richardson 1973,Sullivan et al. 1978). The pathogenicity of the infectious or suspected infectious agent, including disease incidence and severity ( i.e., mild morbidity versus high mortality, acute versus chronic dis-ease), is the most important consideration in assessing the risk due to accidental exposure to an infected arthropod vector. As the initial criterion, it is clear that the more severethe potentially acquired disease, the higher the risk. Readers will observe that ACL-2 has broad latitude in specic practices. This reflects, in part, the widely differingdegrees of effects of arthropod-borne agents, many of which fall within the BSL-2 level. Considerable variation in mor- bidity and mortality exists within the level 2 classication.For example, level 2 arboviruses are exemplied by LaCrosse virus with a 1% or less mortality rate and limited, mild neurological sequelae. Higher containment levels are re- commended for agents that cause disease in humans con-sidered potentially severe, life threatening, or cause residual damage. Our general approach in formulating these guide- lines has been to include a wide range of ACL-2 features thatreflect this broad range of agent potency. Moreover, the possible natural and articial modes of infection ( e.g., par- enteral, airborne, ingestion) of the agent are considered. Thisis essential to prevent infections in laboratorians. The established availability of an effective prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention is another essential factor to be considered. The most common form of prophylaxis is im-munization with an effective vaccine. In some instances, immunization may affect the BSL or ACL; for example, Central European Tick Borne Encephalitis virus has beenreclassied to BSL-3/ABLS3 (from BSL-4/animal biosafety level [ABS]-4) when laboratory personnel are vaccinated (BMBL5, p. 236). Although IBCs once could permit cer-tain tasks and procedures with eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) to be conducted at BSL-2 (from BSL-3) when personnel were vaccinated, recent regulations appear to pro-hibit such a downgrading (www.selectagents.gov/guidance-encephalitis.html). At any rate, the availability of therapeutics and vaccines only serves as an additional layer of protection beyond engineering controls, proper practices, and procedures,and the use of personal protective equipment. Occasionally, immunization or therapeutic intervention (antibiotic or antiviral therapy) may be particularly important in eld conditions. Theoffer of immunizations is part of risk management to protect laboratory workers and vaccination may be demanded, as a condition of employment, for any laboratory worker working with yellow fever virus, or any pathogens for which an ef- cacious vaccine is available. Such a policy may vary from institution to institution.Medical surveillance is encouraged to ensure that the in- stituted safeguards provide the expected health outcomes. Surveillance may include serum banking, monitoring em-ployee health status, and participating in postexposure man-agement. However, as with vaccination, the implementation of medical surveillance may vary by institution. In the ar- thropod vector laboratory, this must be combined with regularmonitoring for escaped arthropods, for example, inventory of infected arthropods, an effective arthropod trapping program, and regular inspection of the facilities for disrepair that couldresult in escape. Risk assessment must also include an evaluation of the experience and skill level of at-risk personnel such as la-boratorians, maintenance, housekeeping, and animal carepersonnel. Additional education may be necessary to ensure the safety of persons working at each BSL. Arthropods containing unknown infectious agents or whose status is uncertain: diagnostic samples The challenge here is to establish the most appropriate containment level with the limited information available. Some questions that may help in this risk assessment include the following: /C15Why is an infectious agent suspected? /C15What route the arthropod transmits transferred horizontally? /C15Are there reasons to believe that a novel or unknown agent is present? /C15What epidemiologic data are available? /C15What is the morbidity or mortality rate associated with the agent? Bringing eld-collected arthropods into a laboratory may be associated with the possibility that personnel who wouldnot otherwise be exposed to any risk because they do not work in eld sites might be placed at risk. Researchers working in eld sites often handle arthropods of unknowninfection status under conditions that do not allow im-plementation of typical laboratory precautions, but they are in the eld and understand that their actions may expose them to associated risks. Answers to the questions above will assistresearchers in determining potential risks and reasonable solutions. Although the most conservative approach would be to consider all eld-collected arthropods as potentially infec- tious, it should be recognized that the prevalence of infection for most vector/pathogen relationships is small. With manyarboviruses, a prevalence of 1 in 1000 may be typical. In- fection may not be viable, or the quantum of infection (po- tential dose) may be below that required to produceproductive infection. There may be strains or populations ofinfectious agents that are avirulent. Delivery of an agent by contamination (exposure to aerosol or arthropod tissues) may be signicantly less efcient in producing infection than bybite, in which immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory molecules in salivary secretions may promote infection. For those agents with complex arthropod developmental cycles,the stages that are present may not be capable of productive infection. There are thus many factors involved in assessing risk associated with unknown or diagnostic samples, and aconservative approach may not be warranted.156 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 The recent guidelines for clinical laboratories (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2012) provide an excellent approach to risk assessment that may be applied todiagnostic or unknown arthropod samples. Diagnostic clini-cal samples (humans or animals) are mainly handled at BSL- 2, although specic scenarios (suspected viral hemorrhagic fever, tuberculosis, generation of aerosols, larger volumes)may require additional safety practices and procedures. This publication provides particularly detailed and nuanced dis- cussion of risk assessment in the clinical diagnostic settingthat places into context a risk assessment that allows for other than the very conservative recommendation that if an ar- thropod is suspected to contain a certain agent, the corre-sponding BSL should be applied. Vector arthropods containing recombinant DNA molecules The purpose of this section is to present principles of risk assessment of vector arthropods that have been genetically modied, typically via recombinant DNA technology. Thisincludes both vector arthropods that contain modied mi- crobes and which themselves are genetically modied. These principles primarily address the public health signif-icance of the modied organisms rather than environmental concerns. These technologies continue to evolve rapidly, and experimental procedures designed to derive novel modi-ed symbionts and recombinant arthropods are becomingcommonplace. The NIH Guidelines (2016) are a key reference in estab- lishing an appropriate BSL for work involving recombinantorganisms, including microorganisms for use in arthropods and genetically modied arthropods themselves. In selecting an appropriate ACL for such work, the greatest challenge is toevaluate the potential biohazard change resulting from a particular genetic modication relative to the unmodied arthropod. In the context of public health, the selection of anappropriate level begins by establishing the phenotypic change in the arthropod and/or microorganism due to DNA manipulation, and potential impact of escaped arthropodscontaining the modication. Among the points to consider in work with recombinant arthropod vectors and those containing recombinant mi- crobes are the following: /C15Does the inserted gene encode a product known or likely to alter the vector capacity or competence for pathogens it is known to transmit? /C15Does the inserted gene cause phenotypic changes that could signicantly affect the ability to control the ar- thropod if there were an accidental escape, for exam- ple, an insecticide resistance marker? /C15Does the modication have the potential to alter the range or seasonal abundance of the arthropod? /C15If so, would the new range increase the likelihood that the vector could transmit new pathogens? /C15Is the modied strain disabled in a way that viability after escape would be limited ( e.g., eye-color mutants, cold-sensitive)? /C15Does the modication have the potential to increase the reproductive capacity of the arthropod that carries it? /C15Is the phenotype conferred by the modication, in- cluding its marker and other expressed genes, if any,consistently expressed after numerous generations of propagation? /C15Is the modication undergoing rearrangement or other mutations at a measurable rate? /C15Can the DNA transgene vector be mobilized in natural populations? /C15Is the host range of the symbiont known? /C15Would the modied symbiont pose increased risk to immunocompromised persons relative to the native symbiont? /C15Is the entire sequence of the DNA insertion known, and are the coding sequences dened? /C15Is horizontal transfer of the transgene to other microbes with which the modied microbe is likely to come intocontact possible? /C15Is the original insertion site known so that stability can be assessed later? This list of questions is not meant to be exhaustive; expert discussions and guidelines are now available for this partic- ular aspect of vector biology (Booij 2013, Benedict 2014,WHO/TDR and FNIH 2014). Rather, the list illustrates the information needed to provide an accurate and conservative assessment of risk to judge the appropriate containment level.Since in many cases the answers to the above questions will not be denitive, it is important that the organization has a properly constituted and informed IBC, as outlined in theNIH Guidelines, to evaluate risk assessment and provideprudent adherence to appropriate safety guidelines for the assigned risk. Arthropod Containment Levels The Arthropod Containment Level (ACL) guidelines were rst published over a decade ago (American Committee of Medical Entomology and American Society of TropicalMedicine and Hygiene 2003) (see Appendix 2). In the in- terim, new pathogens have been described, BSL-3 laborato- ries have proliferated, and the Select Agent Rule has evolvedto include thorough biosafety assessment in addition to bio-security. This revision of the guidelines was initiated with the objective of clarifying and modifying or strengthening rec- ommendations to ensure the safety of researchers as well asthe community without hindering the pursuit of knowledge and development of vector control methods and life-saving solutions to vector-borne disease issues. We particularlyemphasize the absolute need for local risk assessments to complement the regulatory framework as opposed to a checklist approach based on these guidelines. Where appli-cable, we point out critical aspects of the Select Agent Rule. When arthropods are used in research, facilities, trained staff, and established practices must be in place to ensureappropriate safety, and the protection of health and well-being of workers and the environment. This article provides guidelines for laboratory work with hematophagous arthro- pods and arthropod vectors of pathogenic agents, and wasoriginally drafted in response to concerns related to the consequences of an accidental release of arthropods. These consequences are basically answering the question ''Whathappens if the arthropod escapes?'' and the suggested con- tainment levels address the question ''How do we prevent escape?''

For u ninfected arthropods, containment guidelines take into account the consequences of accidental escape from a laboratory, in which the arthropod would be (1) inviable as a result of expos ure to unfavorable conditions; (2) transient because conditions vary such that the arthropod would die during typical year climate cycle; or (3) has potential for establishment becaus e escaped arthropods could reasonably be expected to persist through a typical climatic year. Arthropod containment specics for each BSL should always be reviewed in the context of a laborat ory-, vector-, and pathogen-specic risk assessment that is based on consultation between the investigator and the appropriate institutional oversight committee(s) and according to the co nstraints of the infrastructure available. aAdditional restrictions apply for work with arthropods in association with Select Agents.

It should be noted, though, that the local IBC is an essential component in establishing the appropriate ACL. It is responsible for reviewing a research protocol anddecides at what level of containment the experiments must beperformed. Accordingly, a ''one-size-ts-all'' checklist based on these guidelines is not appropriate for risk assess- ment; local IBCs may, for example, allow research to proceedeven if it is not possible to adhere to all recommended guidelines, such as those of the BMBL. In such cases, alter- native means of mitigating risk would be evaluated in thesite-specic risk assessment (Cauchetaux and Mathot 2005). One signicant practice emphasized as a result of the original ACL guidelines is that when an arthropod is infectedwith an agent, the containment level required is automaticallyincreased to at least that required for the agent, regardless of factors such as the competence of that arthropod for the particular pathogen. Containment levels for most infectiousagents, the rationale for categorizing them at such contain- ment levels, and recommendations for their safe manipula- tion are specied in the BMBL. An example is the use of malemosquitoes to propagate dengue viruses. Although they cannot transmit by bite, the presence of the viable agent re- quires that they be held at BSL-2. Injection of male mos-quitoes with dengue virus or homogenizing them afterward to assay for viral replication might expose personnel to infec- tion. Even if the actual infection status of each individualmale mosquito inoculated with dengue virus is not known,the standard of practice with diagnostic materials that may contain an infectious agent is to manipulate them at BSL-2. Another practical example of the utility of the ACL guidelines relates to the use of exotic arthropods. Biological introductions are to be prevented by all reasonable means, and handling exotic arthropods at ACL-2 or higher greatlyreduces that risk. At any rate, even before the formal ACL guidelines, USDA import and possession permits would stipulate the equivalent of the ACL-2 recommendations foruse of most exotic arthropods. It is impossible to prescribeuniversal levels of containment for a particular species since the risks associated with accidental release from a laboratory are determined by several factors, for example, the climateat the facility and history of transmission in that location. For example, the accidental release of an uninfected anthro- pophilic tropical vector species, during the winter in Wis-consin, should be considered signicantly less of a risk than the release of the same species in a tropical area in which it could become permanently established and act as a bridgevector of an established zoonotic pathogen to humans. Thus, one of a number of possible approaches to reduce the risk of a release might be to perform relatively high-risk experimentsduring the winter when any escaped arthropods wouldquickly be killed by adverse environmental conditions; or a rainforest species could be used in a laboratory located in a xeric environment. IBCs might even use such biologicalconsiderations to ''downgrade'' a particular protocol from ACL-3 to ACL-2, providing that experiments are performed during a particular period or in a particular site. On thecontrary, the possibility of zoonotic transmission or pro- moting a risk to domestic animal production means that we have to consider in risk analysis those pathogens that arepredominantly an animal health issue; USDA Guidelines may need to be considered when assigning a containment level to a particular vector species.The current research and applied focus on genetically modied arthropods also mandate recommendations that reduce the risk of accidental environmental release. Althoughthe ACL guidelines can be used as one basis for risk as-sessment and mitigation, the science of transgenic vectors is an evolving one and the reader is directed to specic docu- ments that provide experience-based guidance on such ex-periments (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 1985, Benenson 1995). Although specic recommendations are not made herein because they depend on site-specic details, all IBC proto- cols should outline an emergency response procedure that is appropriate in case of an accidental release. The ideal re-sponse would be one in which all released arthropods arekilled almost immediately after the escape. This may be impossible if the escaped arthropods get outside of the lab- oratory, and hence, redundant facility and practice barriersare recommended to maximize the opportunities for location and destruction of the escapees. Arthropod Containment Level 1 ACL-1 is suitable for work with uninfected arthropod vectors or those infected with a nonpathogen, including (1) arthropods that are already present in the local geographicregion regardless of whether there is active vector-borne disease transmission in the locale and (2) exotic arthropods that on escape would be nonviable or become only tempo-rarily established in areas not having active vector-bornedisease transmission. This category would include most ed- ucational use of arthropod vectors. A summary of the con- tainment levels is provided in Table 1. Standard practices Location of arthropods. Furniture and incubators con- taining arthropods are located in such a way that accidental contact and release are minimized. This may be achieved bylocating arthropods out of the flow of general trafc, avoiding hallways, or placing them in closets. Supply storage. The area is maintained to allow detec- tion of escaped arthropods. For example, materials unrelated to arthropod rearing and experimentation ( e.g., plants, unused containers, clutter) that provide breeding sites and harborages are minimized. General arthropod elimination. Accidental sources of arthropods from within the insectary are eliminated. This may be accomplished by cleaning work surfaces after a spill of materials, including soil or water that might contain viableeggs. For example, personnel in mosquito laboratories should immediately eliminate any standing water. Primary container cleaning and disinfestation. Practices should be in place such that arthropods do not escape by inadvertent disposal in primary containers. Cages and otherculture containers are appropriately cleaned to prevent ar- thropod survival and escape ( e.g., heated to, or chilled below, lethal temperature). Primary container construction. Cages used to hold ar- thropods effectively prevent escape of all stages. ScreenedARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 159 mesh, if used, is durable and of a size appropriate to prevent escape. Nonbreakable cages are recommended. Bags, rearing trays, and so on effectively prevent leakage and escape. Disposal of arthropods. All life stages of arthropods must be killed before disposal. Arthropods may be killed with hot water or freezing before flushing down drains or placed into trash bags. Primary container identication and labeling. Arthropods are identied with descriptive labels to include the species, strain/origin, date of collection, responsible investigator, and so on; labels are rmly attached to the container (and cover ifremovable). Vessels containing stages with limited mobility (e.g., eggs, pupae, hibernating adults) are likewise labeled and (if applicable) housed or stored to prevent progression to,and escape of, a mobile life stage. Prevention of accidental dispersal on persons or via sewer. Personnel take appropriate precautions to prevent transport or dissemination of live mobile arthropods from theinsectary by practicing appropriate disposal methods and preventing escapees at every level of containment (primary container, environmental chamber, laboratory, etc) to preventdispersal on persons. Escaped arthropod monitoring. Investigators assess whether escapes are occurring. An effective arthropod trap- ping program is recommended to monitor the escape pre- vention program. Pest exclusion program. A program to prevent the en- trance of wild arthropods ( e.g., houseflies, cockroaches, spiders) and rodents effectively precludes predation, con- tamination, and possible inadvertent infection. Source and harborage reduction. Harborage and breed- ing areas are reduced as appropriate. Furniture and racks are minimized and can be easily moved to permit cleaning andlocation of escaped arthropods. Notication and signage. Persons entering the area may be made aware of the presence of arthropod vector species by signage if recommended by an institutional research over- sight committee. Special practices: vertebrate animal use Institutional approval. Investigators should consult with their institutional research oversight ofce if vertebrate ani- mals will be used to feed hematophagous arthropods. Therequirement for IACUC and/or IBC review is an institutional decision, although highly recommended. Housing of vertebrate animals. Animals used as hosts or blood sources should be housed according to institutional laboratory animal guidelines. If necessary, vertebrate animalsmay be housed within the insectary but need to be adequately protected from access by escaped arthropods. Animals not necessary for maintaining arthropods should not be accessi-ble to hematophagous arthropods in the laboratory setting.Containment during blood feeding. Special consider- ations should be taken when hematophagous arthropods are fed on host animals. The primary container must be sufciently robust to prevent escape during feeding. When handling/re-moving vertebrate animals after exposure to arthropods, pre- cautions must be taken to prevent arthropod escape through screens, covers, and by flying. Host animals are inspectedclosely ( e.g., concealment in fur, ears, axillae, or other possible hiding places). Finally, all precautions should be taken to prevent arthropods fed on host animals from accidental transferto host cages and therefore dispersal outside of containment, ifanimals and their cages are returned to a holding room. Blood source. The blood source should be considered a possible source of inadvertent arthropod infection and transmission. Whenever feasible, use of sterile blood or bloodfrom sources known to be specic pathogen free is re-commended, whereas use of blood from animals or humans whose disease status is uncertain should be avoided. In some instances, a vector colony is specically adapted to and willnot propagate without human blood acquired directly by feeding on a volunteer. Such arthropods should not be fed a second time on a different volunteer; those fed initially bymembrane on animal or human blood should not be allowed to subsequently feed on a human volunteer. Safety equipment (primary barriers) Gloves. Latex or nitrile gloves should be used when handling host animals or blood used to feed the arthropods, but local risk assessment and institutional policy may provide exceptions. Torso apparel. White laboratory coats, gowns, and/or uniforms should be worn at all times in the insectary when handling blood and vertebrate animals, but local risk as- sessment and institutional policy may provide exceptions. Arthropod-specic personal protective equipment. Per- sonal protective equipment is worn as appropriate, for ex-ample, respirators for arthropod-associated allergies, particle masks, and head covers, but local risk assessment and insti- tutional policy may provide exceptions. Facilities (secondary barriers) Location of insectary. The insectary area is separated, if possible, from areas that are used for general trafc within the building. Insectary doors. Door openings, whether covered by ri- gid panels, glass, screens, plastic sheets, or cloth, minimizeescape and entrance of arthropods or pests. Insectary windows. Windows, if present, effectively prevent escape of the smallest arthropods contained within as well as prevent entry of wild arthropods and pests. Lack of an insectary. Arthropods may be maintained at ACL-1 in rooms other than those specically designed asinsectaries. If the facility does not have secondary barriers that would minimize escape or entry of pests, and is not separated from general trafc, specic operating proceduresmust be developed and tested to mitigate such risks. For160 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 example, mosquitoes might be held by a ''cage within a larger cage''; removal of adult mosquitoes accomplished by the aspirator manipulated through cage sleeves placed per-pendicular to each other and the sample container loadedentirely within the outer cage. Alternatively, entire mosquito containers may be chilled before aspirating individual mos- quitoes. Plexiglas glove boxes might also be used for ma-nipulations, particularly if exotic species are maintained. Nonflying species may be manipulated on designated tables or benches in pans within moats of water, and housed in vialsor other containers held within a secondary storage container such as a lidded plastic food container. Arthropod Containment Level 2 ACL-2 should be practiced if working with exotic and indigenous arthropods infected with BSL-2 agents associated with animal and/or human disease, or that are reasonablysuspected of being infected with such agents (diagnostic samples). The PI must perform a risk assessment when de- ciding whether arthropods are reasonably suspected of beinginfected with a pathogen. For example, live mosquitoescollected during the course of a disease outbreak and main- tained in the laboratory would present more of a risk to lab- oratory personnel than those that are cold-immobilized orkilled before sorting and identifying them for standard surveillance purposes. Uninfected genetically modied ar- thropod vectors also fall under this level provided the mod-ication has no or only negative effects on viability, survivorship, host range, or vector capacity. ACL-2 builds on the practices, procedures, containment equipment, and fa-cility requirements of ACL-1. It is more stringent in physicalcontainment, disposal, and facility design requirements. Moreover, access is more restricted than ACL-1. The deci- sion to propagate infected exotic arthropods under ACL-2conditions in active transmission areas or in cases in which establishment is a possibility typically requires that measures that otherwise would only be recommended or preferred mustbe instituted as policy. Standard practices Location of arthropods. Furniture and incubators con- taining arthropods are located in such a way that accidental contact and release by laboratorians, custodians, and service persons are unlikely. This may be achieved by locating ar-thropods in dedicated rooms, closets, incubators located outof the trafc flow, or similar measures. Nonflying arthropods such as ticks are typically held in primary containers (vials) that are placed within an environmentally controlled con-tainer such as a desiccator or plastic food container; often, this in turn is held within an environmental chamber. Although a dedicated space is recommended for long-term storage ofticks, appropriate risk assessment by the local IBC or other institutional entities, informed by the PI or other experts, may allow for the housing of ticks in noninsectary settings. Supply storage. The area is designed and maintained to enhance detection of escaped arthropods. Equipment andsupplies not required for operation of the insectary should not be located in the insectary. All supplies for insect mainte- nance that must be kept within the insectary are located in adesignated area and not on open shelves. It is recommendedthat a closed storage room, cabinets with tight-tting doors or drawers, be used. Doors and drawers are opened only for access. Insect diet should be kept in sealed containers. Primary container cleaning and disinfestation. In addi- tion to cleaning cages and culture containers to prevent ar-thropod escape as in ACL-1, containers are disinfected chemically and/or autoclaved if used for infected material, according to an IBC-approved protocol and/or laboratorystandard operating procedures. To reduce the risk of mixingup uncontaminated with potentially contaminated waste by having different methods for disposal, a laboratory may want to consider routine autoclaving, incineration, or other ap-propriate decontamination of all primary containers. Primary container construction. Cages used to hold ar- thropods are shatter-proof and screened with mesh of a size to prevent escape. Containers are preferably autoclavable or disposable. Openings designed to prevent escape during re-moval and introduction of arthropods are recommended. Disposal of arthropods. All life stages of arthropods must be killed before disposal by freezing or other suitable meth- ods. Infected arthropods should be autoclaved, or deconta- minated with chemical disinfectants such as 10% bleach or70% ethanol based on an agent-specic risk assessment. The lack of an autoclave or means of incineration should be evaluated by local risk assessment and appropriate substitutessought. Isolation of uninfected arthropods. Spread of agents to uninfected arthropods is usually a low risk, given that most infections occur via hematophagy. Containers must be clearly marked to easily distinguish infected from uninfectedarthropods. It is good practice to separate infected arthropods in a separate room, if possible, to prevent them from being mistaken as being uninfected. Primary container identication and labeling. As per ACL-1. Prevention of accidental dispersal via sewer or on per- sons. Before leaving the insectary and after handling cul- tures and infected arthropods, personnel wash their hands. Care should be taken to not disperse viable life stages into the drainage system. No infected material is disposed through thesewer unless it is decontaminated. Physical barriers (over- lapping sheets and screens) or air curtains are recommended as appropriate; personal protective equipment that is reused(laboratory coats, gowns) should be checked for infestationbefore exiting the insectary. Pest exclusion program. As per ACL-1. Escaped arthropod monitoring. Investigators assess whether escapes are occurring by instituting an effective ar- thropod trapping program to monitor the escape prevention program. Oviposition traps, ground-level flea traps, oil-lledchannels surrounding tick colonies, light traps for mosqui- toes, and so on are recommended. Particularly in the case when exotic arthropods are used, exterior monitoring is re-commended. Records of exterior captures are maintained.ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 161 Any evidence of escape should trigger a review of practices and procedures before resuming work. Source and harborage reduction. Harborage and breed- ing areas are eliminated. Furniture and racks are minimized and can be easily moved to permit cleaning and location ofescaped arthropods. Equipment in which water is stored or might accumulate ( e.g., humidiers) is screened to prevent arthropod access, or contains chemicals to prevent arthropodsurvival. Laboratory sharps. Disposable sharps should be dis- carded in puncture-proof containers or as mandated by in- stitutional policy. Forceps, dissecting probes, and other sharps that are reused should be frequently disinfected bychemical disinfection or flame sterilization. Routine decontamination. Equipment and work surfaces in the insectary are routinely decontaminated with an effec- tive chemical disinfectant. Notication and signage. Persons entering the area should be made aware of the presence of BSL-2 agents in arthropod vectors, but institutions may vary in their policiesfor security or other reasons. If infected material is present, typically a BSL-2 biohazard sign is posted on the entrance to the insectary, listing all species handled within and is updatedwhenever new species are introduced or pathogenic infec-tious agents are present. The hazard warning sign typically identies the arthropod species, agent(s) known or suspected to be present, lists the name and telephone number of theresponsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for entering the insectary ( e.g., the need for immunizations or respirators). Procedure design. All procedures are carefully designed and performed to prevent arthropod escape. Safety manual. A site-specic safety manual is prepared, approved by the IBC or other institutional review entities, andadopted. The manual contains emergency procedures, stan- dard operating procedures, waste disposal, and other infor- mation necessary to inform personnel of the methods for safemaintenance and operation of the insectary. If the institution does not have formal review committees, the PI or department head should develop laboratory-specic safety manuals. Training. Laboratory personnel are advised of special hazards and are required to follow instructions on practicesand procedures contained in the safety manual. Adherence to established safety procedures and policies is made a condition of employment and is part of the annual perfor-mance review, if applicable, of every employee. Personnel receive annual updates and add itional training as necessary for procedural or policy changes. Records of all training aremaintained. Medical surveillance. An appropriate medical surveil- lance program should be considered, although institutional policy may vary with this requirement. At the minimum, all personnel should be educated by the PI about the risks as-sociated with the specic tasks and experiments, as well asthe signs and symptoms of any illness caused by the agent(s) under study. Specialty immunizations or a serum surveillance system may or may not be part of an institutional occupa-tional health program. In general, persons who may be atincreased risk of acquiring infection, or for whom infection may be unusually hazardous ( e.g., immunocompromised), are not allowed in the insectary unless special personal pro-tection procedures are in place to eliminate extra risk. Access restrictions. Routine access is limited to trained persons and accompanied guests. Service persons are made aware of the hazards present and the consequences of ar-thropod release and contact with agents that may be present. Special arthropod handling containers and areas. Infected arthropods are prevented from release into the laboratory area. A dedicated area for handling infected material is re-commended. This is preferably a separate cubicle, walk-in incubator, or screen room. Additional physical barriers ( e.g., glove box, biosafety cabinet) or procedures (incapacitatedarthropods, e.g., removing a wing from a mosquito) may be required depending on the local risk assessment. BMBL and other sources (Crampton et al. 1997) may provide specic recommendations that can be adopted or modied accordingto the local risk assessment. Safe transport in the laboratory. All infectious and po- tentially infectious samples are collected, labeled, trans- ported, and processed in a manner that contains and preventstransmission of the agent(s). Transfer of arthropods between manipulation and holding areas is in nonbreakable secure containers. Special practices IBC and IACUC approval: as for ACL-1. Microbial agents classied at BSL-2 require at the minimum registration withthe appropriate institutional entity (Biosafety Ofce) and many institutions require IBC review and approval before starting any work. Work with recombinant organisms willusually need review and approval. If applicable at the insti- tution, IACUC review may also be required for work with vertebrate hosts. There may be some institutions, for exam-ple, in low- or middle-income countries, where these ad-ministrative entities are absent or less formally structured, and hence, this guidance may not easily be applied. In such cases, PIs and department leaders benet from the existenceof these guidelines and could institute site-specic policies of their own to ensure the safety of researchers and the sur- rounding community. Housing of nonarthropod animals. Other animals are not accessible to the arthropods. Animals used as hosts or blood sources generally are not housed with arthropods. If present, they are adequately protected from access by escapedarthropods. Containment during blood feeding. Recommendations for ACL-1 containment of arthropods during blood feeding are more stringently assured by special practices and con-tainer design, as recommended by the local risk assessment.162 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 Blood source: as per ACL-1. To prevent inadvertent contamination of the clean colony, sources of infection, such as a tube of infected blood, should not be stored in the same refrigerator as a tube of uninfected blood for maintaininguninfected colonies by membrane feeding. Colony arthro- pods should be maintained in an ACL-1 area and transported to an ACL-2 area for infection; there should be no transport ofliving arthropods from ACL-2 to ACL-1 without specic local risk assessment. Escaped arthropod handling. Loose arthropods must be killed and disposed, or recaptured and returned to the con-tainer from which they escaped. Infected arthropods must not be killed with bare hands and must be manipulated using ltered mechanical or vacuum aspirators or other appropriatemeans ( e.g., forceps, paintbrushes, gloved hands). Accidental release reporting. A release procedure is de- veloped and posted. This includes contacts and immediate mitigating actions. Accidents that result in release of infectedarthropods from primary containment vessels or that result inovert exposure to infectious material must be reported im- mediately to the insectary director (PI) who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate and documented action is taken tomitigate the release. The room where the incident occurred is closed off, a warning sign indicating the location, number, and type of material released is prominently posted, and otherlaboratory personnel are informed until the source is elimi- nated. Follow-up medical evaluation, surveillance, and treat- ment are provided as directed by institutional policy and localrisk assessment, and written records are maintained. Movement of equipment. All equipment must be appro- priately decontaminated and disinfested before transfer be- tween rooms within the insectary, and before removal fromthe insectary. Safety equipment (primary barriers) Personal protective equipment should be evaluated as part of the local risk assessment. It should be noted that very few infected arthropods are directly infectious by handling; vir-tually all require exoskeleton disruption or the act of feeding to be hazardous although there are exceptions (body lice excrete feces that contain Rickettsia prowazekii orBartonella quintana ; newly fed mosquitoes may diurese infectious vi- rus). Clothing (primary as well as safety) should conform to institutional policy, if any, and to the risk assessment by the local IBC. As an example, entering a room containing anenvironmental chamber holding plastic food containers with tick vials would not require personal protective equipment (PPE), unless the vials were opened and the ticks manip-ulated. The use of latex or nitrile gloves, although highly recommended, may not be required as a result of risk as- sessment by the local IBC or equivalent; manipulation ofarthropods within a glove box tted with Hypalon gloves, forexample, would not necessarily require additional gloves. Eye and face protection. Appropriate face/eye and re- spiratory protection is worn by all personnel entering theinsectary, if recommended by the local risk assessment.Gloves. Gloves (latex or nitrile) are worn when handling potentially infected arthropods, blood, and associated equip- ment and when contact with potentially infectious material is unavoidable. Local risk assessment may provide for excep-tions, for example, the need for dexterity or tactile control (e.g., during the inoculation of suckling mice). Torso apparel. White laboratory coats, gowns, and/or uniforms are typically worn at all times in the insectary whenhandling vertebrate animals and infected materials. Universal blood precautions (BMBL5) are recommended when blood is manipulated. Personal clothing. Clothing should minimize the area of exposed skin ( e.g., skirts, shorts, open-toed shoes, sandals, and tee shirts are inadvisable), since this can increase the risk of attracting and being bitten by a loose arthropod. Arthropod-specic personal protective equipment. Other equipment may be required as determined by the local riskassessment. Homogenization of infected arthropods, for ex- ample, may require an appropriate respiratory protective device if the procedure is not performed within a biosafetycabinet or glove box. Facilities (secondary barriers) An insectary may simply be a room with a door that may be closed tightly; it may or may not have environmental con- trols. Dedicated spaces to be used as insectaries are highlyrecommended, but resources may not exist to permit such arrangements. The use of infected arthropods may be per- mitted after risk assessment by the local IBC even in theabsence of a dedicated space. Ticks, for example, may be safely manipulated within general BSL-2 laboratory settings that are otherwise not considered to be insectaries. Location of insectary. The insectary is separated from areas that are open to unrestricted personnel trafc within the building. It is recommended that this be accomplished by at least two self-closing doors that prevent passage of the ar-thropods. Increased levels of physical isolation are re- commended, for example, separate buildings, wings, and suites. However, the lack of a dedicated insectary should notimply that infected arthropods may not be manipulated; site-specic risk assessments may provide mitigating alternative arrangements. For example, nonflying infected arthropods such as ticks or fleas may be safely manipulated in a dedi-cated area within a BSL-2 laboratory using a moat system (pan within a pan of water) and accounting for all specimens. Insectary doors. Recommended entrance to the insectary is via a double-door vestibule that prevents flying and crawling arthropod escape. For example, the two contiguousdoors must not be opened simultaneously. Internal doors may open outward or be sliding, and are kept closed when arthropods are present. Self-closing doors are highly re-commended. Additional barriers ( e.g., screened partitions, hanging curtains) may be required by the local risk assessment. Alternative arrangements may be specied by local risk as-sessment in the absence of a dedicated insectary.ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 163 Insectary windows. Windows are not recommended, but if present cannot be opened and are well sealed. Windows should be resistant to breakage ( e.g., double paned or wire reinforced). Vacuum systems. If a central vacuum system is installed, each service outlet is tted with suitable barriers/lters toprevent arthropod escape. Filters are installed to permit de- contamination and servicing. Other vacuum devices are ap- propriately ltered to prevent transfer and exhausting ofarthropods. Interior surfaces. The insectary is designed, constructed, and maintained to facilitate cleaning and housekeeping. The interior walls are preferably light colored so that a loose ar-thropod can be easily located, recaptured, or killed. Gloss nishes, ideally resistant to chemical disinfectants and fu- migants, are recommended. Light-colored floors are alsohighly recommended, smooth and uncovered. Ceilings are as low as possible to simplify detection and capture of flying insects. Inability to conform to these recommendations maybe mitigated by other physical or procedural methods as in- dicated by the local risk assessment. A static glove box with a light-colored interior, for example, may be used to manipu-late infected arthropods where the color of walls and floorscannot be easily changed. Floor drains. Floor drains are modied to prevent acci- dental release of arthropods and agents. If present, traps mustbe lled with an appropriate chemical treatment to preventsurvival of all arthropod stages ( e.g., mosquito larvae). Plumbing and electrical xtures. facility appur- tenances ( e.g., light xtures, pipes, ducting) are minimal since these provide hiding places for loose arthropods. Pe- netrations of walls, floors, and ceilings are minimal and sealed/caulked. Ideally, light xtures are flush with the ceil-ing, sealed, and accessed from above. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). Ven- tilation is appropriate for arthropod maintenance, but does not compromise containment of the agent or arthropod. Examplesinclude the following: exhaust air is discharged to the outsidewithout being recirculated to other rooms; appropriate l- ter/barriers are installed to prevent escape of arthropods; the direction of airflow in the insectary is inward; a progressivelynegative pressure gradient is maintained as distance from the main entrance increases; fans located in the vestibule and in- ternal corridor can be used to help prevent escape of flyingarthropods; and hanging or air curtains are located in vesti- bules and doorways. Local risk assessments may provide site- and task-specic alternatives to these recommendations, forexample, the use of a static glove box in which infected ar- thropods are manipulated may provide adequate security if directional airflow is not possible. Sterilization equipment. An autoclave is available, con- veniently located in rooms containing arthropods within the insectary building. If an autoclave is not available, an appro- priate decontamination system or set of practices and proce-dures may be recommended by the local risk assessment.Sink. The facility has a hand-washing sink with hot water and with suitable plumbing to prevent arthropod escape. Illumination. Illumination is appropriate for arthropod maintenance, and does not compromise arthropod contain- ment, impede vision, or adversely influence the safety of procedures within the insectary. Lighted (or dark) openingsthat attract escaped arthropods are avoided. Facility compliance monitoring. The facility should be evaluated annually for compliance to ACL-2. The PI or in- sectary director inspects the facility at least annually to en- sure that alterations and maintenance have not compromisedthe containment characteristics. Adequacy of the practices and facility in view of changes in research protocols, agents, or arthropods is considered. Arthropod Containment Level 3 ACL-3 involves practices suitable for work with potential or known vectors that are or are likely to be infected with BSL-3agents associated with human disease. Arthropods that are infected or potentially infected with BSL-3 pathogens may pose an additional hazard if the insectary is located in an areawhere the species is indigenous, or if alternative suitablevectors are present, as an escaped arthropod may introduce the pathogen into the local population. ACL-3 builds on the practices, procedures, containment equipment, and facilityrequirements of ACL-2. It differs in that access is more re- stricted, and the microbiological containment takes a more prominent role in determining the practices and facilities. In the United States, the Select Agent Rule (www .selectagents.gov) restricts access to certain pathogens of hu- man or veterinary importance, all classied at BSL-3 or BSL-4.Many of these Select Agents are naturally maintained by ar-thropods. All possession and use of these restricted agents must comply with the biosecurity requirements promulgated by the United States Title 42 CFR Part 72. Violations are criminaloffenses. These revised guidelines do not review the require- ments of the Select Agent Rule other than those that may affect practices and procedures needed for safe research with ar-thropods containing these restricted pathogens. Other countries may have similar restrictions and these should be kept in mind when planning for the development of an ACL-3 facility. Comments An aspect of working with BSL-3 pathogens that needs clarication is the use of biological safety cabinets. TheBMBL states that ''All procedures involving the manipula- tion of infectious materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices, or bypersonnel wearing appropriate protective clothing andequipment.'' Most workers with BSL-3 agents utilize bio- safety cabinets and seem to regard this approach as the standard. Many medical entomologists and vector biologistshave therefore been introduced into BSL-3 research under the impression that they must perform all work involving BSL-3 agents within a biosafety cabinet. Manipulating small ar-thropods in a biosafety cabinet can be extremely difcult. The airflow can blow small arthropods around the cabinet, into the lters, and into inaccessible locations. If working with cold-anesthetized mosquitoes on a chill table, for example, the164 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 arthropods can be blown from the table, recover, and then fly around. The airflow may also disrupt the presentation of cues such as body temperature that stimulate host seeking andfeeding. The use of a biological cabinet can thus increase therisks associated with working with arthropod vectors. Whereas a cabinet might safely be used to prepare infectious material, the best option may be to perform infectious pro-cedures in a secure area (glove box) within a containment room and not exposed to strong air currents. Hunt and Tabachnick (1996) recommend that ''insects are never manipulated on an open bench.'' These workers provide plans to construct a purpose-designed glove box for such work. SALS (The Subcommittee on Arbovirus Laboratory Safety1980) stated ''infection, anesthetization with carbon dioxide,and transfer of arthropods are done in such a manner that risk of infection of workers by aerosols is minimized. This can be accomplished by use of (a) protective clothing and respira-tors/masks, (b) a biosafety cabinet, or (c) a plastic isolator with sleeve openings with or without an air exhaust.'' There may be alternative approaches, such as the use of disposable plasticglove bags; or using an entire room as primary containment with enhanced PPE and multiple physical barriers ( e.g., nested moats for ticks). Again, the local risk assessment may weighthe costs and benets of alternatives to the accepted or typical recommendations. To prevent arthropod escape, arthropod work is performed in a designated area, preferably small and self-contained within thelaboratory, for example, a cage-like room constructed of ne mesh (see Arthropod Containment Levels 2, facilities (second- ary barriers) ). In the event of escape, the search area is therefore small, and the chances of loca ting the escaped arthropod are correspondingly high. When manipulating arthropods that re- quire ACL-3, biosafety cabinets may be inappropriate becauseof the airflow and reduced humidity. Safe containment of the arthropods is thus achieved through the use of several levels of containment (cages within incuba tors, and designated insectary areas) within the BSL-3 laboratory, and appropriate procedures(traps, etc.) including those des cribed below. It is recommended that where possible, the researcher take advantage of the safety provided by working within a biological safety cabinet. Proce-dures such as virus isolation from frozen mosquito pools can be easily performed in a biosafety cabinet (BSL). Glove boxes may also be useful for manipulating small infected arthropods. Field-collected arthropods from sites of active transmis- sion of BSL-3 agents do not necessarily require manipulation at ACL-3. Such material is considered diagnostic and may bemanipulated at BSL-2/ACL-2; identication of specic samples containing viable agents would prompt transfer to BSL-3/ACL-3. Enhanced practices and procedures, however,should be instituted to prevent escape of living samples whilethey are assayed, or if aerosols may be generated. Detection of Select Agents within arthropods, animals, and clinical samples requires prompt reporting of the detection tothe Select Agent Program and such samples, if viable (or those containing a regulated positive strand RNA virus, which is potentially directly infectious), require secure storage untiltheir disposition as mandated by the Select Agent Program. Standard practices Location of arthropods. Furniture and incubators con- taining arthropods are located in such a way that accidentalcontact and release by laboratorians, custodians, and service persons do not occur. This is usually achieved by locating arthropods in dedicated BSL-3 rooms, wings, or suites,preferably in incubators, which would serve as an additionallayer of containment. Ticks or other less mobile vector ar- thropods may be held within vials contained in desiccator cabinets or other escape-proof secondary or tertiary housingother than a dedicated incubator. Site-specic risk assess- ment may provide for other practices. Supply storage. Equipment and supplies not absolutely required for ongoing ACL-3 work are removed from the in- sectary after appropriate decontamination or are stored in adesignated area and n ot on open shelves. It is recommended that a closed storage room, cabinets with tight-tting doors or drawers be used. Doors and drawers are open only during access. General arthropod elimination. In addition to measures for general arthropod elimination within the insectary, ma-terials used to wipe or mop are autoclaved before disposal. Only persons trained to work with arthropods and BSL-3 agents and equipped with appropriate PPE clean up spills. Primary container cleaning and disinfestation. Care is taken to disinfest primary containers in a manner that doesnot create aerosols. All primary containers are autoclaved or incinerated for disposal, or as specied by the site-specic risk assessment. Primary container construction. Cages used to hold ar- thropods are nonbreakable and screened with mesh of a sizeto prevent escape. Containers are autoclavable or disposable. Openings are designed to prevent escape during removal and introduction of arthropods. Disposable containers are re-commended. Disposal of arthropods. In addition to ACL-2 disposal practices, the outer surfaces of containers are decontaminated before moving the material. All arthropod waste materials are autoclaved or incinerated. Living, infected arthropods shouldbe killed by freezing or other appropriate methods, followed by autoclaving or incineration; those not being used in an experiment should not be allowed to persist alive. An ex-ception would be long-lived or developmentally delayed ar-thropods such as ticks, which may require extended durations before they may be physiologically capable of feeding again and hence must be kept for weeks or months. The lack ofaccess to an autoclave or incineration device should be handled during local risk assessment to identify the best substitute available. Isolation of uninfected arthropods. Where possible, only arthropods requiring ACL-3 procedures are housed in theACL-3 insectary. If it is necessary to house ACL-2 or lower arthropods in the ACL-3 insectary, all procedures and prac- tices must meet the ACL-3 standards. Primary container identication and labeling. As per ACL-1. Prevention of accidental dispersal on persons or via sewer. Viable potentially infected arthropod life stages mustARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 165 not leave the laboratory. PPE is doffed as specied by the risk assessment and IBC protocol. Hands are washed on exit; showering out may or may not be required depending on therisk assessment. No material is disposed through the sewerunless appropriately decontaminated, for example, by treatment with 10% hypochlorite or by heat, autoclaving, or incineration. Escaped arthropod monitoring. Ideally, risk assessments identify practices, procedures, and equipment that will pre-vent escape of any infected arthropod. ''Count-in, count-out'' procedures have been recommended for ACL-3 and should be implemented if possible. Although this practice can beimplemented well for studies of winged adult insects in the absence of a vertebrate host, there are a number of scenarios where such a practice is logistically difcult. For example,ticks, mites, fleas, and lice may be groomed by an infestedhost and eaten if they are not contained within a feeding capsule. Feeding capsules themselves may partially detach and liberate some of the nonattached arthropods within andthus should not be considered as the only way to safely contain a feeding nonflying arthropod. ''Count-in, count- out'' also poses difculty for studies trans-mission. Eggs may be laid but few hatch; larvae may start to develop but then die and be consumed by the remainder. Pupae may develop but adults may not emerge. Finally,motile diminutive arthropods such as mites might be easily miscounted and lead to a false conclusion that an escape had occurred. The risks that might be associated with not using a''count-in count-out'' protocol might be balanced by addi-tional barriers to escape, for example, one or more moats containing the cage with the infested animal, as provided by a local risk assessment. Strong suspicion of an escape by infected arthropods may require facility shutdown and disinfection, or treatment with insecticide. The ACL-3 PI is usually required to promptlynotify institutional authorities such as the biosafety ofcer if an escape is likely. The appropriate response would be the outcome of deliberations by institutional authorities advisedby the PI. Additional measures are taken to measure the effective- ness of the arthropod surveillance program and these are documented. As part of the review and commissioning pro-cess of a new facility, the physical integrity and security practices might be tested by a simple release/recapture study. A known number of noninfected arthropods would be re-leased and then these would be recaptured to assess the physical integrity of security barriers. Such an experiment is described by Hunt and Tabachnick (1996). Exterior andwithin-building monitoring should be considered. Records of exterior captures are maintained. The Select Agent Rule poses a specic quandary and ad- ditional preparations during initial risk assessments as it re-lates to arthropod escape: the rule requires that all Select Agents be accounted for. Even a simple miscounting may trigger a federal investigation. Arthropods deliberately in-fected by Select Agents are themselves considered Select Agents and they must be entered into a written inventory and record of disposition must be made for each individual in-fected arthropod. The failure to account for all infesting in- fected arthropods (e.g., 1 of 10 infecting ticks is not found when recovering the replete ticks in a moat surrounding amouse cage) would be considered an environmental release(or theft) and subject to investigation by the Select Agent Program. It might reasonably be concluded that the host may have eaten the infecting arthropod and such a conclusionneeds to be recorded in writing and the reasoning or evidencepresented. If this contingency is not approved in advance by the institutional oversight committee during the IBC protocol review, the failure to recover all infecting arthropods wouldbe considered a release and an emergency response would likely be triggered, including prompt notication to the Select Agent Program. Hence, ACL-3 work with Select Agents canrepresent a particularly onerous and difcult scenario for which there is no easy solution. Pest exclusion program. As per ACL-1. Source and harborage reduction. As per ACL-2. Microbiological and medical sharps. As per ACL-2. Routine decontamination. As per ACL-2. Notication and signage. As per ACL-2. Procedure design. All procedures are carefully per- formed to prevent arthropod escape and the creation of aerosols or splatters. Protocols are practiced with noninfected arthropods/animals and modied before implementation. Safety manual. As per ACL-2. Training. The training required for laboratory personnel under ACL-3 is more detailed and extensive, particularly if the pathogen in use also is a Select Agent. Specic training incontainment practices and procedures may be required by institutions and is highly recommended if personnel are not previously experienced. Such training, and annual refreshertraining, is a requirement of the Select Agent Program and must be documented. Medical surveillance. An institution with an ACL-3 fa- cility should have a medical surveillance or occupational health program. This is a requirement of the Select AgentRule and is the standard of practice for many U.S. institu- tions. It is possible, though, that some institutions do not have a formal medical surveillance or occupational health plan andthis may apply to programs in resource-poor sites as well. Insuch cases, the PI should develop a medical response plan and arrange with local health care providers for education of workers or providing care in the event of an exposure. Wherethere is a formal occupational health program, institutional policies and the specic (usually independent) program dic- tate the extent of surveillance, whether prophylaxis may berequired, and the appropriate response to exposure. Hence, a one-size-ts-all recommendation on surveillance or occupa- tional health is not advisable. Access restrictions. The insectary director limits access to the insectary to the fewest number of persons possible.Personnel who must enter the insectary for program or ser- vice purposes when work is in progress are accompanied by trained laboratorians and are advised of the potential hazardto themselves, coworkers, and the potential consequences of166 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 arthropod release. Because of the increased risk to nontrained personnel, laboratory staff should perform general cleaning activities that would otherwise be performed by custodialstaff. The Select Agent Rule has specic requirements forpersonnel access to restricted agents, including background checks and suitability assessment. In addition, any laboratory registered to possess and use Select Agents must keep themsecure, with at least three physical barriers (locks or other restrictions) in place to deter theft. Special arthropod handling containers and areas. All work is done within a primary barrier. Appropriate biologicalsafety cabinets, other physical containment devices, and/orpersonal protective equipment are used whenever conducting procedures to infect arthropods with BSL-3 agents, or when handling arthropods. Appropriate designs will consider thelife history and behavior of the arthropod and may differ from that required by the agent alone. Such modications should be made in consultation with biosafety experts. Manipulationof arthropods and, for example, rearing of transovarially in- fected immature stages are performed in a designated area. SALS suggests ''a separate room or double screened area thatis separated from the main insectary by rooms having two screened or solid doors that open inward and closing auto- matically.'' Safe transport in the laboratory. As per ACL-2. Special practices IACUC and IBC approval: as per ACL-2. Note that the Select Agent Program now requires that all experiments andactivities with Select Agents be outlined as part of the reg-istration process and will be reviewed by their administration. Housing of nonarthropod animals. As per ACL-2. Containment during blood feeding. Recommendations for ACL-1 containment of arthropods during blood feeding are strictly assured by special practices and container designsthat prevent escape of arthropods. Blood source. As per ACL-1. Escaped arthropod handling. Loose arthropods must be killed and disposed, or recaptured and returned to the con- tainer from which they escaped. Infected arthropods are not killed with hands and must be transferred using ltered me-chanical, vacuum aspirators, forceps, or other appropriate tools. Only personnel properly trained and equipped to work with designated arthropods and BSL-3 infectious agents areto recover and/or kill escaped arthropods. Accidental release reporting: as per ACL-2. Institutions may have specic reporting requirements. The Select Agent Program must be notied by the institution of any accidental release of a Select Agent. Movement of equipment. As per ACL-2. Inventory of arthropods. In addition to appropriate pri- mary containment cages, when possible, the number of ar-thropods must be included on the label, and records are maintained to account for all arthropods from the time of transfer to the ACL-3 insectary to the time of termination.The Select Agent Rule has specic inventory requirementsfor arthropods infected by Select Agents. The naked nucleic acids of positive strand RNA Select Agent viruses are con- sidered by the Select Agent Program to comprise SelectAgents and must be stored and documented as required. Safety equipment (primary barriers) BMBL recommends enhanced PPE for BSL-3 studies. Laboratory surfaces and floors, however, should be consid- ered noninfectious because all procedures and manipulationsof infectious material must be within a biosafety cabinet or equivalent primary containment device (and hence any con- tamination of the laboratory should be considered a breach ofoperating procedures and trigger institutional review). Nonetheless, many institutions and authorities follow a strict policy that the entire BSL-3 facility is to be consideredhazardous and maximum PPE must be used for any and allentry. The cornerstone of biosafety is the site- and task- specic risk assessment and ideally this should guide the requirement for PPE. It should be noted that the maximal PPEmay impair dexterity that is essential for performing proce- dures such as the dissection of small arthropods. In such cases, the local risk assessment should carefully weigh therisks presented and the benets of using the recommended protective gear and identify other means of mitigating risk if the recommendations are modied. If enhanced PPE is re-quired, workers should rehearse procedures working with uninfected arthropods. Indeed, a good safety practice for all BSL-3 work is to practice all procedures within the BSL-3facility using a BSL-2 substitute agent before undertakingthem at BSL-3. Some ACL-3 facilities may be designed so that the room itself is the primary containment. Special practices and pro-cedures, including specic PPE, would be mandated by the local risk assessment. No recommendations are made herein as to the details of such practices, procedures, or PPE becausethey would be site and task specic and should be developed as a result of a discussion of risk assessment by institutional ofcials and the PI. External biosafety consultants andmedical entomologists experienced with containment workmight be consulted to help develop such recommendations. Eye and face protection. As per ACL-2. Gloves. Personnel wear latex or nitrile gloves when handling infected arthropods or host animals and associatedequipment. Gloves are removed aseptically and are changed frequently. Under specic circumstances, and as allowed by institutional review of practices and procedures specic tothe site and task, gloves may not be required, for example, in restraining suckling mice for inoculation (tactile cues and dexterity are required for safe execution of this procedure, aswell as for humane purposes). Torso apparel. Changing out of street clothes into scrubs, to be worn under PPE, is highly recommended, although such a requirement should be a result of local risk assessment. Whitelaboratory coats, gowns, or jumpsuits should be worn at allARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 167 times by all personnel entering the insectary. Wraparound or solid-front gowns are typically worn over this clothing. Front- button laboratory coats alone are unsuitable. The gowns areremoved and left in the insectary. Before leaving the insectary,scrub suits are removed and appropriately contained and de- contaminated before laundering or disposal. Foot apparel. Boot, shoe covers, or other protective footwear and disinfectant foot baths (with appropriate anti-arthropod measures) are available and used where indicated. Footwear dedicated for use in the ACL-3 facility is highly recommended. Personal clothing. As per ACL-2. Arthropod-specic personal protective equipment. As per ACL-2. Pesticide. Pesticide for emergency use is available in areas in which escape of arthropods is likely. Facilities (secondary barriers) Location of insectary. The insectary is strictly separated from areas that are open to unauthorized, untrained personnel within the building by locked doors. These are opened, for example, by key lock, proximity reader, or card key. Insectary doors. Access to the facility is limited to trained, approved personnel by a self-closing and self-locking door. The external insectary entry doors are con- trolled by a key lock, card key, or proximity reader. Entry into the insectary is via a double-door entry that includes a changeroom and shower(s). Showers are plumbed to prevent ar- thropod escape. An additional double-door access (air lock) or double-door autoclave may be provided for movement ofsupplies and wastes into and out of the facility, respectively. The two contiguous doors must never be opened simulta- neously. Internal doors may open outward or be sliding, butare self-closing, and are kept closed when arthropods are present. Additional barriers ( e.g., hanging curtains) are re- commended. Insectary windows. Windows are not recommended. Any windows present are resistant to breakage ( e.g., double paned or wire reinforced) and well sealed. Vacuum systems. As per ACL-2. Interior surfaces. In addition to the recommendations for ACL-2, spaces around doors are sealed to facilitate decon- tamination. Troughs surrounding door frames may be in-stalled and lled with sticky or greasy material that will trapcrawling arthropods, depending on the species in use and local risk assessment. Floor drains. Floor drains are not recommended. If present, traps must be lled with an appropriate treatment toprevent survival of any arthropod stage ( e.g., mosquito lar- vae). Ideally, all drains are plumbed to a holding tank to facilitate heat or chemical treatment to kill all stages of ar-thropod before disposal into the waste system.Plumbing and electrical xtures. As per ACL-2. HVAC. Ventilation is appropriate for arthropod mainte- nance, but does not compromise containment. Exhaust air isdischarged to the outside without being re-circulated to other rooms. Exhaust must be dispersed away from occupied areas and air intakes, or the exhaust must be high-efciency par-ticulate air (HEPA)-ltered. The USDA requires that airsupply vents also be HEPA ltered if working with BSL-3 veterinary agents. Appropriate lter/barriers are installed to prevent escape of arthropods. The direction of airflow in theinsectary is inward. A progressively negative pressure gra- dient is maintained as distance from the main entrance in- creases. Personnel must verify that the direction of the airflowis proper (a visual monitoring device/meter is recommended to conrm directional inward airflow). Audible alarms alert personnel to system failure. Sterilization equipment. An autoclave is available within the suite of rooms containing arthropods. If an autoclave is not available within the suite, local risk assessment may provide fora suitable alternative (heat treatment, tissue digester) or provide protocols for transport of materials to a nearby autoclave. Sink and shower. In addition to the ACL-2 recommen- dation, an appropriately plumbed shower is available within the insectary suite. If a shower is not available within the suite,local risk assessment may provide for a suitable alternative. Illumination. As per ACL-2. Biosafety cabinets. HEPA-tted exhaust air from Class II biological safety cabinets can be recirculated into the in- sectary provided it is certied annually. If Class III cabinetsare used they must be installed appropriately and also certi- ed annually. Static glove boxes for arthropod manipulation (Plexiglas or other more expensive materials) do not requirenegative air pressure, although accommodation for interiorair pressure may be needed ( e.g., 0.22 lm lter vent). Facility compliance monitoring. The completed ACL-3 insectary design and operational procedures must be docu-mented by the PI and reviewed by the IBC. In some cir- cumstances, ACL-3 insectaries are not built de novo and must be retrotted into existing space. The PI should be a memberof any design team and the space modied to reflect the likelyuses. If certain ACL-3 recommendations are not practical or cannot be implemented, the local risk assessment may pro- vide site- and program-specic mitigation by alternativephysical design or added procedural/practice stipulations. The insectary must be tested for verication that the design and operational parameters have been met before operation.ACL-3 insectaries are reveried by the PI and by the insti- tutional biosafety representatives where applicable at least annually against these procedures. Laboratory design, prac-tices, and procedures may need to be modied iteratively byoperational experience. Arthropod Containment Level 4 ACL-4 safety guidelines are for the most dangerous pathogen-infected arthropods. All of the Standard Practicesof ACL-3 should be in place, with the additional caveats168 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 described here. No compromise is acceptable at this level of work. BSL-4 agents are associated with a high risk of in- fection from aerosol exposure, and cause life-threateningdisease. Certain other pathogens such as those listed as ''re-stricted animal pathogens'' may also necessitate BSL-4 containment if used in vectors. For vector work, production of aerosols is a potential risk when preparing infectious mealsor inocula, and can also result from analytical practices in- volved in virus isolation. If work with vectors must be per- formed in a BSL-4 facility, then BSL-4 requirements must bestrictly followed. As described below, vectors must be safely contained at all times possibly by use of specially designed apparatus that is tested and approved before use. Although arthropods collected from sites where BSL-4 agents are known to occur should be handled with extreme care, they are by denition diagnostic samples and can be handled at ACL-2 in eld laboratories. It would be excessiveto suggest, for example, that malaria entomology programs within Ebola virus endemic sites be required to handle eld- collected parous Anopheles spp. within ACL-4; of course, appropriate caution should be taken to prevent exposure to blood regardless of source (universal precautions). Any identication of a BSL-4 agent within such samples requiresthat the sample be transferred to an ACL-4 facility or treated so that the agent is no longer viable. It should be noted that RNA from a Select Agent that is a positive sense RNA virusis considered to be a Select Agent because of a theoreticalconsideration of infectivity (by transfection into cells). Be- cause BSL-4 agents are exotic, importation of eld-derived materials into the United States will require import permitsfrom CDC and USDA/APHIS, which will have specic stipulations, perhaps including the need for unpacking and manipulating imported materials only within ACL-4 re-gardless of diagnostic status. Of the 12 infections requiring BSL-4 containment in the United States, 5 are transmitted by arthropods: Congo/Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, tick-borne encephalitis, and Siberian tick-borne encephalitis. All of these viruses are Select Agents. Only ticks have been implicated in their nat-ural transmission cycles, although other arthropods have been experimentally infected with BSL-4 agents ( e.g.,Aedes aegypti with Marburg, and mesostigmatid mites with Junin). With this information one might only consider measures and protocols that safely contain species of ticks as relevant to BSL-4 research with arthropods. However, new infectionsmay emerge, and thus, it is necessary to consider other ar- thropods that might require high containment, particularly flying insects. Furthermore, research on newly discoveredpathogens often requires experimental attempts to infect ar-thropods in an attempt to determine the life cycle. As the number of BSL-4 laboratories is quite limited, the reader should refer to the appropriate sections of the BMBL. Forarthropod work, a simple, minimalist approach is adopted. An area designated for arthropod research is small, light colored, and contains only items required for the study. There are twotypes of BSL-4 laboratories: (1) the cabinet laboratory where the agent is handled in a Class III biological safety cabinet and (2) the suit laboratory. Personnel working in a BSL-4 suit fa-cility don one-piece positive pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life support system. Construction of a BSL-4 facility, and required operating procedures, is sufcient to guarantee that nolife stage could survive, and escape from primary containment is mitigated by efcient secondary containment. Ideally, under ACL-4, an infected arthropod must never be handled outside of a primary containment barrier; for example,cages are opened only in an arthropod-secure glove box (Hunt and Tabachnick 1996). Although a glove box is highly re- commended for all manipulations of live arthropods at ACL-4,wearing a positive pressure containment suit would make such a recommendation difcult in pr actice. Well-lit, stand-alone handling tables incorporating a moat to prevent escape could beused in the open BSL-4 laboratory for manipulating ticks or mites. Flying insects would pose a containment difculty and the specic experiment may need to custom practices, proce-dures, and equipment to safely carry out the required tasks. At ACL-4, every arthropod is counted and accounted for throughout the experiment. No one enters or leaves the room until all arthropods are accounted for and, if living, secured indouble-taped cages or vials and placed in secondary sealed holding trays. Infected arthropods will be discarded (killed and decontaminated), processed for analysis (preferably kil-led and held under conditions that inactivate the agent), or held alive in primary and secondary secure containers. If one arthropod is missing and cannot be found, the facility is shutdown and treated with a pesticide. The nature of this research and the protective equipment required dictate that staff must be trained to the very highestlevel. Since working with arthropods often requires the use ofsmall instruments and hence considerable dexterity, it is re- commended that a specic person be designated for this work and be trained extensively using a space suit so that they arewell rehearsed before actual ACL-4 work. Equipment that is used for ACL-3 work will be specially adapted for ACL-4 research, and such work would require extensive practice. Transportation and Transfer of Biological Agents and Arthropod Vectors Transportation refers to the packaging and shipping of materials by air, land, or sea, generally by a commercialconveyance. Transfer refers to the formal process of ex-changing these materials between facilities. Biological agents include infectious agents of humans, plants, and animals, as well as the toxins that may be producedby microbes and by genetic materials potentially hazardous by themselves or when introduced into a suitable gene delivery agent. Etiologic agents and infectious substances are closelyrelated terms that are found in the transfer and transportation regulations. Biological agents may exist as puried and con- centrated cultures and may also be present in a variety ofmaterials such as body fluids, tissues, and soil samples. Ar- thropod vectors are organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas that may transmit infectious agents to animals or humans.Biological agents and materials and vectors that are known orsuspected to contain them are recognized by federal and state governments as hazardous materials, and their transportation and transfer are subject to regulatory control. Transport andtransfer of live, uninfected vectors may also be subject to federal and state regulatory control. Transportation Regulations on the transportation of biological agents and live vectors are aimed at ensuring that the public and theARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 169 workers in the transportation chain are protected from ex- posure to any agent that might be in the package, and that the package prevent escape of the agent or live vector. Protectionis achieved through (1) the requirements for rigorous pack-aging that will withstand rough handling and contain all liquid material within the package without leakage to the outside; (2) appropriate labeling of the package with the biohazardsymbol and other labels to alert the workers in the transpor- tation chain to the hazardous contents of the package; (3) documentation of the hazardous contents of the packageshould such information be necessary in an emergency situ- ation; and (4) training of workers in the transportation chain to be able to respond appropriately to emergency situations.Regardless, nonmotile forms such as eggs or nonflying stagesshould be shipped if possible.

Dangerous Goods Regulations: International Air Transport Association. These regulations provide packaging and la- beling requirements for infectious substances, materials, clinical specimens that have a low probability of containingan infectious substance, and live vectors. These are the reg-ulations followed by the airlines and are therefore of partic- ular relevance for express shipment of arthropods. These regulations are derived from the Committee of Experts on theTransport of Dangerous Goods, United Nations Secretariat, and the Technical Instructions for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by air provided by the International Civil AviationOrganization (ICAO). A copy of the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) may be obtained by calling 1-800-716- 6326 or through the Internet: www.iata.org/publications/pages/index.aspx (accessed 12/8/2017).General packaging requirements for transport of live arthropod vectors Transport of live arthropod vectors requires packaging that prevents the escape of arthropods and agents, maintains their viability, and protects personnel in the transportation chainfrom exposure to the contents. This is true regardless of whether or not the arthropods are infected. Fortunately, un- like many larger animals, most arthropod vectors do not re-quire large containers, ventilation, feeding, or added waterduring their transport. Most are shipped without free water so the possibility of leaking is rare, and the container tempera- tures normally maintained during shipments are adequate. This means that appropriate physical packaging of vector arthropods is fairly simple and, for infected arthropods, can be similar to that which is appropriate for the agents theycontain. The following section is intended to provide specic instructions for determining the type of container and label- ing required for shipment of vector arthropods. International Air Transport Association (IATA) Live An- imal Regulations (LAR) 42nd edition (available for purchase at www.iata.org/publications/pages/index.aspx, accessed 12/8/2017) describes containers that are appropriate for theshipment of arthropods, including insects and arachnids. The design of these, while not as demanding, is consistent with containers used to ship etiologic agents (see Container Re-quirement 62 of LARs). It is therefore possible to select containers that satisfy the requirements of LARs, DOT 49 CFR Part 173.196: Transportation of Etiologic Agents, andUSPHS 42 CFR Part 72\u2014Interstate Shipment of Etiologic Agents. According to the IATA DGR, a live, intentionally infected animal that is known to contain an infectious substancecannot be transported by air unless it cannot be transported by any other means. A specic exemption from DOT must be obtained. It should be noted that although infected vectorspose different kinds of risks than do infected vertebrates, any hazard does not exceed that of the infectious agents that are allowed for transport under the DGR. Consulting withtransportation authorities or transport companies is strongly suggested in advance of shipping of any infected arthropods. Three packaging scenarios are considered: /C15Arthropods free of infection by specic containing a arthropods containing a select agent. Denitions. Domestic arthropods. Those that are extant in the 49 continental United States. Note that this differs from thedenition used in Risk Assessment and Containment Levels. Exotic arthropods. All others. Select agent. Etiological agents listed in 42 CFR Part 72. Nonselect agent. Agents other than those above that are known to cause disease in humans. /C15Noninfected exotic and domestic arthropods that vector disease are packaged consistently with the minimum packaging requirements of 42 CFR 72.2. This requiresthat the container must prevent ''leakage ( i.e., escape,170 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 note added) of the contents, shocks, pressure changes, and other conditions incident to ordinary handling in transportation.'' We recommend that this consists threelevels of containment, including a primary receptacleconsisting of a sealed plastic bag or tube surrounded by padding, a secondary container such as an insulated chest whose lid is sealed with tape, and a durable -berboard, wood, plastic, or wooden outer container. The container may bear the ''live animal'' label nam- ing the species within. If aquatic stages are shipped, thecontainer should also contain sufcient absorptive material to absorb and contain all of the water. /C15Domestic and exotic arthropods containing a nonselect agent are packaged as above. The outer container bearsa ''biohazard'' label as described in CFR 72.3. An itemized description of the contents is placed between the outer and inner containers. /C15Domestic and exotic arthropods containing a select agent are packaged, labeled, and tracked as required for the agent they are known or suspected to contain. Thisincludes all attendant regulations required for the agent alone, including notice of delivery and failure to re- ceive, and laboratory registration. Transfer Regulations on the transfer of biological agents and live vectors are aimed at ensuring that the change in possession ofbiological materials is within the best interests of the public and nation. These regulations require documentation of the personnel, facilities, and justication of need for the bio-logical agent in the transfer process, and subsequent approvalof the transfer process by a federal authority. The following regulations t in this category. Importation of Etiologic Agents of Human Disease and Live Vectors 42 CFR Part 71 Foreign Quarantine Part 71.54 etiologic agents, hosts, and vectors. This regulation requires an import permit from the CDC for im- porting etiologic agents of human disease, any materials thatmay contain etiologic agents, including live animals and live vectors. This regulation also requires that an import permit be obtained by the recipient for transfer from the original per-mit holder of an imported etiologic agent or live vector within the United States. An application and information on im- portation permits may be obtained at: www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/importapplication/agents.htm (accessed 12/8/2017). Interstate transfer of biological agents and live vectors may also be restricted by state regulations. Shippers and recipients of these materials may obtain additional information directlyfrom state health or agriculture departments. Importation of Etiologic Agents of Livestock, Poultry, and Other Animal Diseases 9 CFR Parts 92, 94, 95 96, 122, and 130 These regulations require an import permit from the USDA, APHIS, and Veterinary Services to import or domestically transfer etiologic agents of livestock, poultry, other animals, and any materials that might contain these etiologic agents.Information may be obtained at (301) 734-3277, or from the Internet: www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/ animal-and-animal-product-import-information/ct_organisms_and_vectors (accessed 12/8/2017). Transfer of Select Biological Agents of Human Disease 42 CFR Part 72.6 additional requirements for facilities transferring or receiving select agents Facilities transferring or receiving Select Agents must be registered with the CDC and each and every transfer of a Select Agent must be approved by the Select Agent Program.Information may be obtained on the Internet: www.select agents.gov (accessed 12/8/2017). Export of Etiologic Agents of Humans, Animals, Plants, and Related Materials Department of Commerce: 15 CFR Parts 730-799 This regulation requires that exporters of a wide variety of etiologic agents of human, plant, and animal diseases, in-cluding genetic material, live vectors, and products that might be used for culture of large amounts of agents, must obtain an export license. Information can be obtained by calling theDepartment of Commerce (DoC) Bureau of Export Adminis-tration at 202-482-4811 or through the Internet: www.bis.doc .gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations- ear (accessed 12/8/2017).

Drafting Process v.3.1 A subcommittee appointed by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH)/American Com-mittee of Medical Entomology (ACME) at the 1999 meetingin Washington, DC (above), consisted of persons selected or who volunteered to serve on the committee. They werecharged with the task of formulating Draft Guidelines172 ARTHROPOD CONTAINMENT GUIDELINES, VERSION 3.2 reflecting the containment principles of documents that are currently circulating both in the United States and interna- tionally. The document was intended to address the followingitems: scope and intent, principles of risk assessment, de-nition of risk levels considering diseases vectored, phenotype and genotype including that of transgenics, biological con- tainment, risk relative to that in existence due to accidentalescape, and containment facilities, practices, and shipping methods appropriate to each risk level. During the spring of 2000, the Draft Committee for- mulated a rst draft and circulated it among the member- ship of the committee for comments and revision. After comments were received and considered, a second draftwas written (v 2.1). This draft was circulated electron-ically in numerous places, including the Vector, Mosquito-L, and Biosafety listservers, and was also posted on ProMED. Additional copies were distributed electroni- cally to individuals identi ed by the Draft Committee as being influential and knowledgeable in the area. Severalpersons were identied to review and comment on the Guidelines to the Draft Committee at the 2000 ASTMH meeting in Houston, TX. That meeting was held as an open meeting both to present the guidelines and to receive comments. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (CDC) Ofce of Health and Safety personnel and other biosafety experts examined the document and revised it before ACME approval. Theguidelines were published in June 2003 as a special issue ofVector Borne Zoonotic Diseases, volume 3, number 2. Appendix 3. Description of Revisions Draft 3.2 October 15, 2015 Noting that it has been nearly 15 years since the last revi- sion, at the 2013 American Committee of Medical En-tomology (ACME) Council meeting, a subcommittee was formed to examine and update the guidelines. The subcom- mittee comprised Sam Telford (Tufts Kevin Macaluso (Louisiana State University); and Philip Armstrong (Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station). The entire document was examinedand the actual recommendations edited and modied toreflect the experience accumulated with operating under version 3.1. Additional edits were made by Lyric Bartholomay (UW-Madison) and Philip Armstrong (Connecticut Agri-cultural Experiment Station) and were reviewed and approved by the ACME taskforce on advocacy. The ACME Executive Council unanimously endorsed its publication in 2018. Changes since Draft 3.1 Minor editorial and grammatical changes were made throughout the text. The major additions and deletions includethe following: (1) The major effects of the Select Agent Rule on work with arthropods were specically incorporated. (2) Recommendations were modied or added to better address nonflying arthropod vectors (ticks, fleas,mites, fleas), a gap in the prior versions. (3) Language has been added and grammar modied to reemphasize that the arthropod containment level(ACL) guidelines are recommendations and not reg- ulations and that site- and task-specic modications are based on a local risk assessment.(4) Language has been added to address diagnostic sam- ples. The recent publication of guidance for clinicaldiagnostic laboratories is referenced because it con- tains excellent discussions of risk assessment and mitigation. Draft 3.1 December 20, 2001: changes since Draft 3.0 Removed ACL-F designation and text. Moved eld site information to the Intent section. Removed section Im- portation of Plant Pests. Minor changes in grammar andwording. Removed citation to Sullivan, Songer and Estrem. Submitted to the ACME Executive Council for consideration regarding publication. Submitted to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Ofces of Health and Safety for consideration and comment. Resubmitted to Mary Bartlett (CDC/DPDeditor) for detailed editing. Draft 3.0 February 15, 2001: changes since Draft 2.3 Added ACL-F designation and text. Added language in risk assessment regarding autonomous transposable elementsin transgenic arthropod experiments. Minor grammatical er- rors corrected. Draft 2.3 November 14, 2000: changes since Draft 2.2 Added URLs, minor wording changes.
