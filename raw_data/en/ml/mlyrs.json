The requirements included in this guidance should be considered when documenting COVID- 19 vaccine redistribution for facilities operated by the IHS, Tribal Health Programs, and Urban Indian Organizations. The facility conducting r edistribution (the sending facility) must sign (1) CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement for Tribal Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations - Vaccines Coordinated through IHS , and (2) the IHS Supplemental Redistribution Information Worksheet . Also, the receiving facility must sign CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Profile Information form (Section B of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Tribal Health Program or Urban Indian Organization Agreement - Vaccines Coordinated through IHS o r COVID -19 Vaccination Program for IHS - operated Facilities ). The Redistribution Agreement is required to be complete prior to redistribution. There are two redistribution scenarios: IHS, Tribal Health Programs, and Urban Indian Organizations are allowed t o redistribute vaccine to IHS, other Tribal Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations (I/T/U) in the vaccination program coordinated through IHS, after notification to the IHS National Supply Service Center (NSSC) and if validated cold- chain procedure s are in place in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and CDC's guidance on COVID- 19 vaccine storage and handling. If the Tribal Health Programs and Urban Indian Organization intends to redistribute to providers not being coordinated through IH S, such redistribution may only occur after notification to IHS and approval by the relevant jurisdiction's immunization program. Redistribution Considerations Because of sensitive cold -chain requirements, the I/T/U facilities should closely coordinate tr ansport and delivery with the receiving I/T/U facility to minimize vaccine loss due to temperature excursions. Redistribution costs are the responsibility of the receiving facility. Ultimately, the facility requesting the vaccine is responsible for obtaining the vaccine, though the redistribution (sending) facility can coordinate and assist with packing and transport, if desired and able. Vaccine will only be redistributed according to manufacturer guidance. Vaccine will only be redistributed via loc al personnel trained in vaccine cold -chain management and transport. Vaccine will not be redistributed via commercial couriers. The receiving facility is responsible for ensuring: o Transport of vaccine in appropriate containers and packing. o Appropriate moni toring of temperature during transport. o Considerations of a backup plan in the case of unexpected circumstances (vehicle trouble or other). Redistribution Requirements The I/T/U facility redistributing (sending) vaccine and appropriate ancillary kit must submit an email notification to the Area Vaccine Point of Contact (AVPOC) containing the following documents. The AVPOC will upload the following documents to the VTF CDC Agreements folder in ICS SharePoint and email them to NSSC at: IHSCOVIDVaccine -Distribution@ihs.gov . o Completed CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement for Tribal Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations - Vaccines Coordinated through IHS; agreement is to be completed by the sending facility . o Completed IHS Supplemental Redistribution Information Worksheet including the following required information: vaccine, manufacturer, lot numbers, initia l expiration, any modified expiration due to storage conditions, number of vaccine doses, and matching ancillary kits (and adjuvant or diluent, if appropriate), as well as dates and times of redistribution and sending and receiving locations and the VTrckS Partner Order Portal (VPoP) PIN. The attached IHS Supplemental Redistribution Information Worksheet includes the required information and a checklist for redistribution. Inventory will be adjusted by the sending and receiving I/T/U facility to reflect the inventory change and details of the transfer in the VPoP. Records must be maintained by sending facility for six (6) years.

Ultra-cold thermal shipping container was not used to redistribute vaccine. (OR) Ultra-cold thermal shipping container used to redistribute vaccine. Ultra-cold thermal shipping containers require return to the manufacturer. By accepting the ultra-cold shipping container, the sending facility requires confirmation from the receiving facility that the ultra- cold shipper was returned to the manufacturer. Once thermal shipping container is returned, notify (sending facility POC name) ______________________________via email at:_ _________________________________________________________________________________________.
