Integrative medicine (IM) can be defined as an approach to the practice of medicine that makes use of the best available evidence taking into account the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. Integrative medicine emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of both conventional and complementary/alternative therapies. Within the practice of Integrative Medicine there are multiple modalities which are available to the patient and the practitioner. These are commonly broken down into these broad categories: Our program at Elliot's Pediatric and Adolescent Care Unit is designed to cross all aspects of primary and specialty care in our health system. We combine state of the art conventional medicine with holistic treatment modalities to optimize children's health. The primary concept is that all patients, regardless of disease, have more wellness than disease and our mission is to emphasize the wellness and augment the healing process. The program works directly with all our pediatric primary care, inpatient services and specialty physicians along with doing individual consults. Our goal is that all pediatric patients who enter our health care system have access to comprehensive, wellness based holistic medicine. At Elliot's Pediatric and Adolescent Care Unit, our Pediatric Integrative Medicine division can help your child receive the best possible integrative care regardless of their disease. All close to home. Inpatient and outpatient Integrative consults: Mind body therapies including inpatient guided imagery, hypnosis in the pediatric pulmonary and urology programs.
