One of our favorite ways? Moxibustion! Chinese medicine practitioners the world over are using moxibustion to boost immune system function right now. Moxibustion is the practice of using herbs to create a warming effect on the skin. One of the most common ways is burning the herb mugwort (aka ai ye or Artemesia argyi folium) over the surface of the skin to introduce a deeply warming, moving, supportive energy to the body. Moxibustion is used for lots of things, like pain, digestion, fertility and reproductive system issues, immune system support, allergies and sinus issues, fatigue, the list goes on. In East and Southeast Asian cultures, it's very common that people use moxibustion at home for general health. The most common way that many patients would use moxa at home here in the U.S. is with a moxa pole. Moxa poles come in two forms - smoky or smokeless. The smoky pole produces more smoke, more aroma, and is easier to light. The smokeless moxa has undergone a charcoal process to produce a stick that produces less smoke, making it ideal for use at home - but it lights a little more slowly. One of the best points for boosting immunity with moxibustion is Zusanli Stomach-36. From a Chinese medicine perspective, moxibustion on this point increases vitality, supports immune and digestive system function, tonifies qi and blood, and improves energy. Research has shown moxibustion on this point actually increases white blood cell count, which helps your body fight infection. Cool, huh? In this video, Kim describes how moxibustion supports your health, shares important safety considerations so you don't burn yourself or start a fire, and demonstrates how to do moxibustion at home! Moxa poles can be purchased through our clinic's [Emerson Wellevate account](https://wellevate.me/constellationacu#/), as well as many online retailers and some food coops and herb shops. If you buy something through our link you won't pay a single cent more, but we'll get a small commission that helps keep the content flowing. How to do moxibustion: Before using moxa you will need to prepare the following: A cigarette lighter or candle A small ceramic or glass dish to place any ash in that may form on the moxa stick during treatment A small towel to place under the area being treated in case any ash is dropped A glass screw-top jar to with a layer of rice or salt in the bottom to extinguish the moxa when the treatment is finished A small glass of water - just in case something starts on fire! Safety first. We suggest opening a window, or turning on a fan, to help circulate air while doing moxibustion. Moxa can be smoky and aromatic. If you have asthma or another lung condition, please use caution when burning moxa, as it may irritate your lungs. How to use the moxa stick: Simply light one end with a cigarette lighter or hold over a candle. With smokeless moxa it may take several minutes to light but when the stick is correctly lit, you will be able to hold the lit end two to three centimeters from the back of your hand and feel a pleasant radiating warmth. Hold the lit end of the stick over the area to be treated, maintaining a distance of at least two to three centimeters so that there is never any direct contact with the skin. Move the moxa stick slowly, in small circles, over the area being treated, this will begin to feel pleasantly warm. To avoid burns, monitor the heat levels closely and ash the pole onto the heat resistant bowl/plate regularly. Use for 5-10 minutes on each side, alternating between left and right legs as the skin becomes warm. Any ash that forms on the end of the stick can be gently brushed off by using the edge of the small dish, so that the moxa stick remains hot. If you suspect there is no longer any heat coming off the moxa stick, check by holding it two to three centimeters away from the back of your hand. Re-light if there is no radiating warmth. Never touch the lighted end of a moxa stick even if it no longer appears to be glowing. When treatment has finished place the moxa stick in a glass jar lined with dry rice to prevent the heat cracking the glass bottom. When the lid is screwed on firmly the moxa stick is deprived of oxygen and cannot continue to burn. If you do not have a large enough jar to fully cover the pole, take care in fully snuffing out the end of the pole in the rice/salt, or just by pressing it firmly against a heat-resistant surface. Alternatively, the lit tip of the pole can be run under water, and left to dry until the next use. The moxa stick can then be re-lit for repeated treatments. How to find Stomach-36: St-36 is located four finger widths below the knee, near the outer edge of the shin. St-36 is incredibly nourishing and energizing, and is one of the most commonly utilized acupoints. There is a story in TCM lore that regular stimulation of this acupoint allowed ancient Chinese soldiers to walk an extra three miles. Whether or not the story is true, this point is appropriate for anyone anytime to increase vitality, support immune and digestive system function, tonify qi and blood, and improve energy. To locate this point: Stomach-36 is located on your shin, a few inches below your knee. Measure four of the patient's finger widths down from the bottom edge of the knee cap. The point is at this level, one finger width out from the height of the shin bone. The point might feel slightly sensitive. Are you a more of a visual learner? Check out [this video by Amy on Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9-RjdbnhGN/)for more instructions on locating St-36! Please note: Please use caution when doing moxibustion at home. It is possible to burn yourself using moxibustion. If you do get a burn, please keep the area clean, covered, and avoid breaking any blisters that may form. Seek medical care from your primary healthcare provider if you have concerns about any burns you may receive as a result of doing moxibustion. Moxibustion is a fire hazard; do not leave a burning moxa stick unmonitored, and make sure the stick is fully extinguished at the end of a treatment. *The information provided on this site is intended for your general knowledge only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment for specific medical conditions.
