[Plazervil2500](https://vestibular.org/participant/hisrichess/)and [Plazervil2500](https://vestibular.org/participant/hisrichess/)reacted Hi! I just started developing these symptoms and I'm freaking out. To give a bit of context:I took my first pfizer shot on sunday. I was extremely anxious because I was raised by an extremely religious anti vaxxer mom who recently told me that if I would get it it would be the biggest betrayal for her. I am 20 years old and I did it behind her back. I cannot talk to people about this because everyone knows I am a hypochondriac and they dont take me seriously. Last night, I woke up 8 times with my arms numb. In the morning the numbness went away I remained with only a subtle tingling feeling. I spent hours researching this and I have no hope. Is there really nobody who only experienced it for a few days? Can someone give me a positive perspective? I have severe Generalized Anxiety disorder so I guess its the best combination.

Ditto...I also had a really bad feeling in the days leading up to my jab. I nearly didn't go to my appointment. I sat and watched the clock for my 5:15pm appointment all day with a sense of impending doom. I went ahead and took the jab against my better judgement, I was in a blind panic due to family pressure and media scaremongering. Looking back my senses where screaming out to me not to go ahead with it but sadly I ignored my sixth sense. It's amazing how so many of us all had a bad feeling about the jab, it seems like our sixth sense is more awake/in tune to something and has the ability to perceive something before it actually happens. Really wish I had trusted my instincts.

You are correct, VeDA's Forum is a place for those with vestibular issues to share their experiences and the treatments that have worked for them. It is simply a place to share.

VeDA does not have healthcare professionals on staff so we are not able to diagnose or give treatment advice.

Good to hear things seem to be getting better, albeit as we know, it takes time and perseverance. Somehow intuitively I feel that what the naturopath said is true, meaning that the vaccine triggers some underlying condition or brings out our \"weak spots\".. Especially when talking about \"boosters\" , people seem to experience more adverse symptoms. Have heard many friends / close relatives share their experience with the booster, luckily thought they all have said that the symptoms didnt last long... best wishes Hi, it does make sense, otherwise why would the majority of the population be okay after 3 shots? I was in a room on clubhouse the other day (it's a social media audio app) and they were talking about Covid 19 and Vaccines. This doctor said that the vaccine should stay into the arm muscle, he said that if the vaccine goes into the bloodstream, that's when it will cause problems. So I wonder if that's what happened to us. Anyways, who knows at this point! [@sara90]I have the same question! A woman came into my workplace yesterday who was disabled with Lupus and Fibromyalgia. She said the second dose of Pfizer \"knocked her down\" for two weeks - but then she got better. She'd decided to get her booster. Why would someone with a pre-existing autoimmune disorder recover more quickly than a healthy person with NO pre-existing conditions? I was 27, healthy, regularly hiked several miles, vegetarian, worked full-time. . .and the second dose of the Moderna has kept me down for nine weeks and counting. I don't understand. Exactly! Most people with health conditions are fine, even cancer patients are taking this vaccine. My friend has Crohn's disease, she was hesitant of getting the vaccine and she finally did because it was mandated by her employer. She's fine!! Like you, I'm 31, exercised 3-4x a week and the most careful with my diet. May God heal us. Hi. Good to hear things seem to be getting better, albeit as we know, it takes time and perseverance.

What are you experiencing? I have floaters but sometimes I have dryness that comes on. [@medee]Hi Dee, Ive been following up with a Naturopath since September. She also thinks that the people who have experienced adverse reactions to the vaccine is caused by some type of underlying condition. She said she has treated a young woman who experienced dizziness and similar side effects to the people in this forum. This lady had mono twice in her life so apparently the virus was dormant in her body. I think that's makes a lot of sense. The Naturopath suggested that I stick to an anti-inflammatory diet and told me to get Black cumin seed oil, electrolytes and liposomal glutathione. Ive been taking the supplements for 3 months now. I can share the list she has provided me if you want. Im 6 months post vaccine, Im much better than what I was but still have some lingering side effects. If you want to go ahead with the functional practitioner, you should. I'm not sure if mine has made a difference but I like following up with her because she's the only one that seems to care (she's very comforting and compassionate compared to the doctors I've seen). So it's your choice! I think sticking to a clean diet and time is what will heal us. Please share the list...I would love to follow it...thanks [@jkro](https://vestibular.org/participant/jkro/) Did you read all of those you linked? One of them said there is no reason to believe the shots are causing ear issues. The other two were the same article that really didn't say anything. Not trying to be crappy just saying those all don't really say anything. Do you have experience in reading medical research? Some of those are from peer reviewed journals. But I'm medicine they discount anything that is not from peer reviewed journal articles as not relevant. NIH stuff is relevant too. I'm not trying to roast anyone I'm just saying I read all of the links and I did t get any closer to answers by reading them. Same here... [@sickofthis](https://vestibular.org/participant/sickofthis/) yes, the brain fog and disorientation started first and ended last unfortunately. I would say all in all it took about 5 months for me to return to mostly normal. During the last month I returned to work but was still dealing with some brain fog/disorientation when I would go outdoors. The days got fewer and farther in between until it eventually just stopped. [Plazervil2500](https://vestibular.org/participant/hisrichess/), [Dee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/), [DrL](https://vestibular.org/participant/nresearcher/)and 3 people reacted [@sickofthis](https://vestibular.org/participant/sickofthis/) also it was a slow process. I got to where I could start going in my backyard, then I could do a short run to a store, then longer outings. and I would have weeks where I was totally fine and then the next week I would be stuck at home. It was all very confusing. [@sara90]I saw in a previous post that you had vision issues. What are you experiencing? I have floaters but sometimes I have dryness that comes on. I did, two months post vaccine I had dry eyes, light sensitivity, shaky vision, eye floaters and blurry vision. Most of it has subsided but I still have floaters, eye twitching and occasional blurry and shaky vision. Did your floaters improve? For the dryness my neuro ophtalmologist made me buy eye drops and eye gel. Eye drops every 3 hours and eye gel before bedtime. "}
