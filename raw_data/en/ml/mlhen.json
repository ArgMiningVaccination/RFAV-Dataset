Inspired by \"Shizuku-cha,\" a style of Gyokuro tea from the Yame region in Japan, it helps us appreciate the umami and depth of the tea at various temperatures. It does not require any special tea leaves - it is a very laid back ritual that can be practiced with any type of tea leaves and do not need to be prepared over the stove. The idea is to tune in to your senses as you watch the tea leaves slowly unfurl and release their flavor and color. It does not require any special tea leaves - it is a very laid back ritual that can be practiced with any type of tea leaves and do not need to be prepared over the stove. The idea is to tune in to your senses as you watch the tea leaves slowly unfurl and release their flavor and color. In a heated cup, place one teaspoonful of tea leaves, and pour enough hot water to cover the leaves. Then wait for two minutes. Pick up the cup, and focus your attention not only on the flavor but also the color, shape of the tea leaves and how they shift and change. Bring the cup to your nose. Inhale deeply, taking in the state of your mind and body today as you would when you meditate, and enjoy the tea with your whole body. When the cup is empty, you may notice that the leaves keep unfurling, that they are still releasing an aroma. When you are finished, the tea leaves can be put in a water bottle with water to enjoy as cold brew tea. Tea meditation can be practiced whenever you have time for a cup of tea - whether in the morning, when taking a break from work, or winding down at night - and can help us reconnect with our minds and bodies ourselves through a moment of peace.
