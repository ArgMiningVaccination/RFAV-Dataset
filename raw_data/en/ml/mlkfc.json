This is a time of great change both inside and outside your body. You may already be starting to connect with your baby. This will help you form a strong bond with your baby after they are born. Bonding with your bump Your voice Use everyday activities to talk to your bump. Encourage your partner to talk too. You may notice that your baby gets quiet or starts to move when they hear certain voices.Songs and music Singing songs and lullabies to your baby may help soothe them. Playing calm and soothing music can also have the same effect. Gently rock and move in time to music. This will help your baby develop good motor skills and balance. You may notice that the same music will help your baby to calm down and relax after birth. Touch Touching and stroking your bump gently is another good way to bond with your baby. Notice how your baby responds to your touch. Imagine you are meeting your baby for the rst time. Visualise your baby. What image comes to mind when you think of your child? Did you know? Your baby can sense how you are feeling by your heartbeat and by the hormones you release. For example, when you are calm and relaxed, your baby will be calm also. 9The birth of a parent As well as being a time for babies to grow and develop, pregnancy is also a time when parents are born. Even if this is not your rst baby, your family is growing and changing. Your parenting style will need to adjust to accommodate the needs of a new baby in addition to older children. Your time As parents, pregnancy is your time. It is your time to think, to grow and to prepare. The physical changes of pregnancy become obvious as time passes. The emotional journey taken by a parent is more private and occurs in the mind. Emotional changes You will experience emotional changes during pregnancy. Tiredness, nausea and hormones during pregnancy can affect how you feel. It is normal to have a range of feelings and emotions. These could be positive and negative. They may include: joy excitement uncertainty feelings of upheaval \u2014 like your world has been turned upside-down anxiety or worrying ambivalence \u2014 not entirely sure you want to become a parent Support your mental wellbeing Try to do things that will support your mental wellbeing during pregnancy. This includes eating healthy foods, taking exercise, getting enough sleep and doing something you enjoy, like reading, music or yoga. You may need extra support. Talk to your GP , midwife or obstetrician if: your initial feelings of uncertainty and ambivalence do not settle you have high levels of anxiety your mood is low You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 10Thoughts and feelings you may have: What will it be like to be a parent? What kind of parent will I be? What type of parent will my partner be? What type of grandparent will my mother or father become? If you have a partner, you may feel more like a family now that one of you is pregnant. At work, or socially, you may nd yourselves identifying more with colleagues and friends who are pregnant or have children. Your feelings and emotions Pregnancy is a time of change for your body, your mind and your life. It is normal to have a range of emotions during your pregnancy. Your body is changing. Your emotions are changing. People may be treating you differently. You may think differently. You may be thinking more about your new baby and your future. You may feel anxious. You may be having mood swings. All of this is normal.Dealing with change You and your partner or support person may have lots of thoughts and feelings about change. The more support you have, the easier you may nd it to process the positive and the negative thoughts and feelings that you have. Think about your support network (family, friends and neighbours). When you become a parent you need practical support. You also need understanding and sensitivity to help you adjust to this change.11What you can do Take care of yourself Eat well. Take a multivitamin with folic acid suitable for pregnancy. Be as active as you can. Get enough sleep. Talk to people Talk to the people you feel closest to about your feelings. It's ok to ask questions. If you are worried about anything, ask your GP , midwife or obstetrician. Be kind to yourself Rest when you need to, reduce your household chores and get help when you can. Do something you enjoy, like reading, listening to music, yoga. Take time to laugh and enjoy life. Your support network Build your support network. Some people have more support than others. Your support network could be your partner, your family or your friends. Not sure you want to be pregnant? If you are pregnant but not sure you want to be, you can talk to your GP or a HSE- funded crisis pregnancy counselling service. Visit sexualwellbeing.ie for information.

Some women may nd previous mental health issues resurface during pregnancy. Others may experience mental health difculties for the rst time while pregnant. If either of these applies to you, talk to your midwife or GP at any time during pregnancy. There is help, support and treatment available. Some women worry about telling healthcare professionals about mental health difculties. They can be afraid that they will be judged or that their baby might be taken away from them. Do not let this fear get in the way of nding help. Healthcare professionals like your GP or midwife will be sympathetic and supportive. They will work hard to help you to get well. This will help you to care for your baby. Remember: It is not your fault. You are not alone. There is help available.13Getting support on your journey Your support network \"It takes a village to raise a child\" is a traditional African proverb. It refers to our need for help from other members of the community to support our children as they grow. Nowadays life is highly pressured, fast-paced and more stressful than ever. Navigating parenthood can be a difcult and overwhelming task. Never has our village been more needed, yet more difcult to nd. Think about your 'village'. Who is your support network? If possible, identify one or two people you can call on for help at any hour, even if it's just for a chat. It is okay to ask for help. People want to help out at this special time. Be specic about what you need. Talk to the people you feel closest to about your feelings and concerns. This will help you to put things in perspective and help you to cope. Ways your friends and family can help after the baby is born Bring food - nutritious meals that you can just heat up. Bring healthy snacks like fruit and water. Do laundry. Take your other children out for a few hours. Encourage you to leave the house - for example, meeting you for a cup of tea or a walk. Hold the baby while you take a nap. Give you space to talk and allow you to share your joy but also to complain if that is what you need. We all need the chance to celebrate but we also need a good moan at times!

Every year thousands of people experience pregnancy alone. This can happen for many reasons: Maybe your relationship with your partner has ended, through death or divorce or because they no longer wish to be involved. Maybe you are single and have chosen to have a baby alone using donor sperm or another method. Maybe you are geographically separated from your partner. Whatever your unique story, you are setting off on this journey without a partner. This may seem like an overwhelming task at times. Build a support system Remember, you may not have to travel this journey alone. Build a support system. Do you have close family, or friends you could lean on? Your family and friends will often be more than willing to support you. Sharing your news Sometimes sharing the news of your pregnancy can be difcult when you are a lone parent. For example, if you are in your teens and it happened earlier than planned, or if there are difcult circumstances. Finding out you are pregnant is a life-changing experience. Tell a friend or two before the news becomes obvious. This means you are in control of who you share your news with. Local support groups Unfortunately, not all of us can be near loving family and friends. If this is the case, speak to your midwife. See if your local hospital offers support groups for lone parents. As well as being educational, antenatal classes are a great way of meeting other expectant parents. For fathers and partners Pregnancy can be a wonderful and exhilarating time, but sometimes it can be difcult. Partners, your role is important. You can provide support, advocate for your partner, provide a shoulder to cry on and, of course, get the (healthy) snacks! 15Getting support on your journey How partners can help Ask and provide support Ask her how you can help. Get informed by doing some research about pregnancy and birth - this book is a great place to start! Talk to your partner about breastfeeding and encourage it. Breastfeeding is the healthiest way to feed your baby. Be there! Go with her to antenatal appointments and antenatal classes if possible. What you learn can help during the birth. Tell her she's beautiful. Pregnancy can cause many changes to a woman's body, and she may feel insecure about these changes. Listen to her. Be patient \u2014 she may be emotional at times. Understand that she may be less interested in sex, or her libido may increase at times. Talk about the birth and the baby Talk about how she wants to give birth. You can help support these wishes when she is in labour. Discuss your baby and how you want to parent. Think about your new role as a parent. This is an important role that is vital to your baby. Help out Share household chores and maybe do a few extra ones without being asked. Growing a baby is hard work and she may not have enough hours in her day. If you have a cat, change the cat litter tray. Bring out the bins. Carry things that are too heavy for her, for example food shopping. If you have other children, bring them out on trips to give her a break. Be healthy together New her, new you! The best way to help her quit smoking is to stop yourself. This will be healthier for you and your new baby. Don't smoke around her. Join your partner by eating healthily together. Help her not to drink alcohol by planning activities that don't revolve around drinking. Go on walks or to the cinema instead. Try not to drink around her too often. Encourage her to be active. Maybe exercise together?

Listen to your baby's heartbeat at antenatal appointments. Talk or sing to your baby - even in the womb, your baby will recognise your voice and react to it. Don't worry if it takes you longer than your partner to feel that special connection. This is normal.

Some people prefer to pay for private or semi-private care. Your GP visits will still be covered by the Maternity and Infant Care scheme.

Home births A home birth means giving birth at home with the support of a midwife. A planned home birth can be a safe alternative to a planned hospital birth for some pregnancies. Making the decision The decision can be made by you, your midwife, your GP and other medical advisors. You will need to talk about whether this option is safe for you and your baby.

Encourage your partner to attend This may help them feel more involved in the pregnancy. Ask questions When you go to see your doctor or your midwife it is quite normal to feel a little overwhelmed. Sometimes all of the questions that you had been planning to ask disappear from your head! If you have any questions or concerns, write them down on a list and bring this to the appointment. Be prepared Waiting times may vary. This can be difcult, especially if you have children with you. Bring a snack and something to read, and something to entertain the small people! Bear in mind that some hospitals do not allow children at antenatal clinics, so check this prior to your appointment. Additional needs Let your doctor or midwife know if you have additional needs. For example, language difculties, reduced hearing or eyesight or difculty moving. A note on students Some of the healthcare professionals you see will be accompanied by students. They may be at different stages of their education. As well as helping them to become a better doctor, midwife or nurse, you may nd that having students around enhances your experience.

Talk to your GP , midwife or your public health nurse about antenatal classes in your area. Start thinking about this early in pregnancy and book your place. Classes may be full at the time you wish to attend. In some areas there are private antenatal classes available. It is important to research the credentials of the course providers. Your midwife or GP may be able to advise if you nd it hard to decide which classes to attend. Speak to your midwife, public health nurse or GP if you cannot attend classes. They may have books, leaflets and DVDs that might help. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieGetting support on your journey 24When classes start Most antenatal classes start when you are between 26 to 32 weeks pregnant. If you are expecting twins or a multiple birth, consider starting classes early. Your babies may arrive early. Pregnant women are entitled to take paid time off work to attend one set of antenatal classes. This is allowed under Section 8 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004. Who is there Classes usually involve midwives, public health nurses and physiotherapists, depending on the location. Partners are usually welcome at classes. Check with your midwife before you go.Some areas may run special antenatal classes for lone parents, teenagers and young adults. Topics The sessions are participant-led. This means that the members of the class decide the pace and have a say in the topics discussed in the class. Topics may include physical and mental health during pregnancy, preparation for labour and birth, breastfeeding and becoming a parent.25Getting support on your journey Tests during pregnancy Blood tests You will be offered blood tests as part of your antenatal care. These are important to make sure your pregnancy progresses safely and that your baby is healthy. Talk to your doctor or midwife about these tests so you can make an informed choice about whether you want them or not. This may seem like a lot of tests, but normally only one needle-stick is needed. Full blood count This is to check for anaemia. Anaemia is a condition. It is usually caused by low iron and can cause you to become very tired. It may cause other symptoms like breathlessness. Blood group and antibodies This is to check your blood and test for proteins called antibodies. The most important one of these is Rhesus (Rh) Factor. If you are negative for Rhesus factor (Rhesus negative), and the baby's father is Rhesus positive, there is a chance that the baby could be Rhesus positive. This could lead to your body producing antibodies against Rhesus. This will usually not affect this pregnancy, but might affect future ones. Anti-D injections are safe and prevent Rhesus negative women from producing these antibodies. Immunity to rubella (German measles) If you get rubella in early pregnancy, it can be dangerous for your baby. If you have low immunity, you will be offered a vaccination after your baby is born. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieGetting support on your journey 26Immunity to chickenpox Many maternity units test your immunity to chickenpox, as this can be dangerous for pregnant women and babies. If you are not immune and come into contact with chickenpox, you need to contact your GP , obstetrican or midwife immediately. Syphilis You will be tested for this during pregnancy and offered treatment if you test positive. Hepatitis B If you have hepatitis B, there is a chance your baby could become infected. Vaccinating the baby at birth reduces this risk. Hepatitis C This virus can be passed to your baby. Unfortunately there is no way to prevent this. However, there are very effective treatments available for this virus. Your baby can be tested soon after birth. HIV If you are HIV positive, the birth will be managed to reduce the risk of infection to your baby. Your baby will be tested for HIV at birth and at intervals for up to two years. You will be advised not to breastfeed because HIV can be transmitted through breast milk. What if I am afraid of needles? Tell the person who is taking your blood for testing. They would prefer to know so that they can help to make it easier for you. There are things you can do to help, like breathing exercises or distracting your thoughts. You can get someone you trust to go along with you when you have these tests done. Ultrasound scans Ultrasound scans use sound waves to create a picture of your baby on a TV screen. The scans are safe and can be carried out at any stage of the pregnancy. They are not painful. Gel is placed on your tummy and a small probe gently rubbed over it. This produces the picture on the screen. Dating scan You will be offered a dating scan. Ideally this should be performed before 15 weeks. Dating scans will detect: your baby's heartbeat the expected due date if you are expecting more than one baby 27Getting support on your journey Fetal anatomy scan (anomaly scan) Some pregnant women will be offered a fetal anatomy scan at 18 to 22 weeks. This is also called an anomaly scan. Some hospitals offer this to every patient. Other hospitals only have the facilities to offer this to those with higher risk pregnancies. Foetal anatomy scans can detect: If your baby is developing normally. Some babies can be hard to scan, because of the way they are lying in the womb. Birth defects like spina bida and heart problems. Unexpected news Having a scan can be one of the highlights of your antenatal care. Finally you get to actually see your baby. You may even see their heart beating and limbs moving. You may even discover you are expecting two or even three babies. For most people having an ultrasound scan is a happy and exciting event, but occasionally they can detect that your baby is unwell. It is a good idea to bring your partner, family member or friend with you, in case you get unexpected news. Additional scans Scans are only performed when there is a medical reason for doing them. This means most pregnant women will probably only have one or two scans. Most maternity hospitals do not perform scans to determine the sex of your baby. You may have additional scans if: you have any bleeding there are any concerns about your baby's movements or growth You may be given a printed photo of your baby at a scan. Don't leave it in sunlight or laminate it. The heat could damage the image. Things to know before your scan A full bladder You will need a full bladder. In early pregnancy your womb can be quite small and lies quite low in the pelvis \u2014 that's the lower part of your body between your tummy and your thighs. A full bladder helps to push the womb upwards, making it easier for the scan to show what's inside it. Drink water beforehand and bring some with you.

See getirelandactive.ie39Pregnancy health Exercises during pregnancy Preparing your pelvic floor The pelvic floor is a layer of muscles that runs from your pubic bone in front to your lower spine at the back. What your pelvic muscles do These muscles are shaped like a hammock. They support and hold your pelvic organs in place (uterus or womb, vagina, bowel, rectum and bladder). Problems that can arise The pelvic muscles come under a lot of strain during pregnancy and childbirth. If these muscles are weak, you may have problems with bladder or bowel control. Weak pelvic muscles could also mean your pelvic organs are less supported. This could lead to problems like pelvic organ prolapse. How exercises help Pelvic floor exercises help to strengthen these muscles. In pregnancy, pelvic floor muscle training will help your body cope with the growing weight of the baby. Your muscles will mend more easily after the birth if they are healthy and t before your baby is born. How to do pelvic floor muscle exercises These long and short exercises can be done anywhere at any time. You should try to do them three times each day. Choose any comfortable position with the muscles of your thighs, bottom and stomach relaxed.

Exercise 3: Squeeze when you sneeze As you breathe in to cough or sneeze, quickly tighten your pelvic floor muscles. Hold while you cough or sneeze. This is called 'the knack'. Practice holding the muscle and coughing. Urinary incontinence Did you know? Research shows that women who do pelvic floor exercises during their rst pregnancy are less likely to have problems with bladder control (urinary incontinence) after the birth. Urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) when exercising, coughing and sneezing is common in pregnancy. This is because your pelvic floor muscles become relaxed because of hormonal changes in pregnancy and increased pelvic pressure. Talk to your GP or midwife about this. Ask them to refer you to a chartered physiotherapist who specialises in women's health if you have urinary incontinence.41Pregnancy health Thinking of using a birthing ball?Back care As your baby gets bigger, you may get back pain.

Most women with no pregnancy complications are able to continue having sex right up until their due date. You may notice that there are changes in your sexual desires. As your pregnancy advances, some positions may become uncomfortable. Positions For example, sex with your partner on top can become uncomfortable quite early in pregnancy. It may be better to lie on your sides, either facing each other or with your partner behind. Explore comfortable activities that work for both of you. Will having sex harm the baby? You cannot hurt your baby by having sex. The baby is protected by the amniotic sac (the balloon of water around the baby) which acts as a shock absorber. There is a thick mucus plug at the neck of your womb (cervix) that will also protect the baby. If you are having sex with a male partner, the penis does not go further than the vagina. It cannot reach your baby. Myth busters Some women have sex late in their pregnancy because they believe it will make them go into labour sooner. There is no evidence to support that belief. However, neither you nor your baby will be harmed if your pregnancy is normal and you decide to have sex.Sex in pregnancy is safe for most women.

Most of the weight gain during your pregnancy happens in the second and third trimesters. Eat 'twice as healthy', not 'twice as much'. Your body mass index (BMI) A healthy pregnancy weight gain depends on your Body Mass Index (BMI) before you became pregnant. Your BMI is a measure of your weight in relation to your height.

Alcohol can damage your baby's developing brain and body. Drinking while pregnant doesn't mean your baby will denitely be harmed, but it can happen. The effects may not be evident at birth. Alcohol passes from the mother's blood into the baby's blood through the placenta. The placenta does not act as a barrier to alcohol. How alcohol causes harm Drinking alcohol while pregnant can cause: miscarriage your baby being born premature or with a low birth weight foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) Foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) FASD causes problems with a baby's body, brain, behaviour and can cause problems throughout a person's life. For example: hyperactivity and poor attention learning difculties and a lower IQ difculty getting along with other people being smaller than expected problems with eating and sleeping emotional and mental health problems Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is more serious. It can happen when you drink heavily during your pregnancy at levels that exceed low risk alcohol use guidelines.

This is because your baby's brain develops throughout pregnancy. Drinking, especially drinking in excess of low risk guidelines during the rst three months of pregnancy, is particularly harmful. This is the time when your baby's body organs and facial features are developing. Will the occasional drink do any harm? There is no proven level of safe drinking during pregnancy. Heavy or frequent drinking is particularly dangerous. The safest thing you can do is not to drink alcohol at all during pregnancy. What if I have already drunk alcohol during my pregnancy? Stop drinking alcohol for the rest of your pregnancy. The less your baby is exposed to alcohol over the course of the pregnancy, the greater their chance for healthy brain growth and development. Try not to worry. The main thing is that you stop now. How others can help Your partner, family and friends can help by: avoiding drinking alcohol around you taking part in social activities with you that don't revolve around alcohol helping you reduce the stress in your life For more information and help to stop drinking alcohol, you can: talk to your GP , obstetrician or midwife visit askaboutalcohol.ie call the HSE Alcohol and Drugs Helpline for free on 1800 459 459 and speak in condence with a professional49Pregnancy health Smoking during pregnancy If you are pregnant and you smoke, the best thing you can do for your baby is to stop.

You can protect your baby by getting vaccinated any time from 16 weeks up to 36 weeks. You can still be vaccinated up to 36 weeks but this may not be as effective as getting it earlier on. Is the vaccine safe? Yes. The vaccine is widely used in the UK, Australia, the US and New Zealand with no reported safety concerns. A large study in the UK of over 20,000 women found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or babies. What are the side effects of the vaccine? The side effects are mild. You may get soreness or redness around the injection site. You may get mild fever and fatigue for up to 48 hours after you get the vaccine. If I can't get the vaccine or my baby comes early? Make sure all your other children are vaccinated. Ask relatives and friends not to visit if they have a cough.

Other vaccines during pregnancy It is safe to have many vaccines, such as a tetanus shot, while you are pregnant. However, some vaccines are not safe to receive while pregnant. Particularly 'live' vaccines such as the yellow fever vaccine or the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR).

Do not be afraid to ask questions. Your obstetrician, midwives and GP are there to support you. It may help to bring someone with you to appointments, and to write down any questions you may have. Your healthcare team should explain everything to you in a way that you can understand, but if they are using medical terms stop them and ask them to explain them. If English is not your primary language, ask for an interpreter. Be informed Try and gather as much information as you can from reliable sources. For some of the more common conditions, lots of information is available. For others, you may have to speak to specialised doctors like paediatricians or geneticists (specialists in inherited diseases). Ask what supports are available. Your maternity hospital may be able to refer you to see a counsellor.

Trust in yourself: you will arrive at the right decision for you, and it is normal to change your mind often until this occurs. If you choose to continue the pregnancy, you may have anxieties about the birth and what to expect when your baby is born. Talk to your healthcare team. They will give you information and support. Depending on your situation, it may be a good idea to meet with the neonatologist (doctor who will be caring for your baby) so they can discuss the care your baby will need. Many maternity hospitals also have specialist midwives who offer extra support and provide you with information. Sometimes the right decision for your family is to end the pregnancy. Your healthcare team will discuss this option with you. They will discuss the type of termination of pregnancy most suitable for your situation. They will also discuss your options in terms of where the procedure is performed. Think about whether you would like to see and hold your baby, and ask if this is an option.

Conditions are getting crowded but you should still feel denite movements from your baby. 81Pregnancy health Week 27 onwards: changes you may feel Braxton Hicks or uterine contractions During late pregnancy, your uterus may contract and relax. These are known as Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks are different to labour contractions because they: are not frequent are usually irregular don't last long, usually less than a minute and don't get more intense What to do Walk around. Relax and take deep breaths. If they do not stop or if they become more intense, call your maternity unit or hospital, obstetrician or midwife. Stretch marks You may notice red stretch marks on your tummy and breasts. They may be itchy and feel tight. Whether you get these or not depends on your genes and skin type. It is doubtful whether creams and oils will help. However, they can be pleasant to use and make your skin feel less dry. Usually stretch marks will fade after the pregnancy. Heartburn This is a burning feeling in your chest and throat. It is caused by the pressure a growing baby is putting on your stomach. What to do Eat smaller meals. Avoid spicy or fried food. Avoid eating for the couple of hours before you go to bed. Sleep propped up with lots of pillows. Talk to your GP , obstetrician, pharmacist or midwife about medication.

Drink plenty of water. Avoid standing for long periods. Take gentle exercise. Your pharmacist, GP , midwife or obstetrician may recommend a cream. Avoid becoming constipated or straining on the toilet. Straining Your poo can become hard when you are not pooing as often as usual. This can mean you have to push quite hard to get the poo out. This is known as straining. Straining puts pressure on the veins in your lower rectum (back passage) and causes piles. Straining can also damage piles and make them bleed. It can push internal piles to the outside. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by swelling in your hands that can cause a nerve to become squeezed. Symptoms of this include: pins and needles pain or numbness in your middle ngers and hands This is often worse at night. What to do Put your hands in cold water.

Avoid standing for long periods.83Pregnancy health Try support stockings. Sleep with your legs higher than your body. If your bump feels itchy Mild itching of your bump is normal as your skin starts to stretch. Pregnancy hormones can also increase the blood-flow to the skin. This makes it feel hot and itchy. What to do Wear loose clothing. Don't use strong detergents or very scented soaps and shower gels \u2014 these can irritate the skin. Moisturise your skin - try different ones to see what one works best for you. Contact your GP or obstetrician if the itch is severe or you notice a rash. Anxiety Anxiety is an unpleasant feeling of unease such as worry or fear. It can be mild, moderate or severe.

You may feel a fluttering in your tummy, or a rolling sensation that feels like wind moving in your tummy. Most babies settle into a pattern by 24 weeks. If your baby stops moving or moves less often Your baby's movements are important because: Feeling your baby move is a sign that they are well. When your baby's movements reduce or stop, sometimes this can be the rst sign that your baby is unwell. Talk to your GP or midwife if: you do not feel your baby moving you are feeling less movement than usual Even if this happens many times, get checked each time. Home dopplers and apps Do not use a home doppler or an app. They should never replace getting checked by your GP , obstetrician or midwife. How often should my baby move? There is no set number of movements that is normal. Every baby is different. You need to become aware of what is normal for your baby. From 16 to 24 weeks on, you should feel your baby move more and more up until 32 weeks. From week 32 onwards the movements stay roughly the same until you give birth. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 88Pregnancy health Reasons you may not feel your baby moving: You are very busy or active. Your placenta (afterbirth) is at the front of your uterus (womb). If you drink alcohol or smoke. If you are taking certain medications. It is not true that babies move less towards the end of pregnancy. You should continue to feel your baby moving throughout the pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, obstetrician or maternity hospital immediately if you are worried about your baby's movements. Do not wait until tomorrow. Premature labour Premature labour is labour that starts too early (before 37 weeks). It can cause your baby to be born too soon. Babies who are born too early are at risk of health problems. They often need special care in the hospital. One in 16 women will give birth prematurely. Over 4,500 babies are born preterm in Ireland every year. Signs of premature labour Fluid, discharge or bleeding a gush of fluid from your vagina or water leaking from your vagina a sudden increase in the amount of discharge from your vagina, or sudden change in the type of vaginal discharge bleeding from your vagina Aches or pains cramps like period painslow dull back-ache that feels different than usual pain in your tummy sudden feeling of increased pressure or the feeling that the baby is pushing down contractions - tightenings of your womb that come often and do not go away contractions that get stronger and are coming closer together the feeling that something \"is not right\"? !89Pregnancy health If you have any of these signs, contact your maternity unit or midwife immediately. How can I help my baby to be born at the right time? Try to stop smoking and ask others not to smoke around you. Prepare and store food safely (see page 35). Avoid the foods that are not recommended during pregnancy (see page 36). If you have had a late miscarriage in the past or treatments on your cervix, talk to your obstetrician. Sometimes a stitch can be placed around your cervix to stop it from opening too early. Take time to rest every day. See your GP or obstetrician if you have smelly vaginal discharge or pain or burning when you pee.

If your blood pressure is high, your heart has to work harder to pump blood around the body. High blood pressure or hypertension affects between 10% to 15% of pregnancies. A rise in blood pressure can be the rst sign of a condition called pre-eclampsia. Most cases of pre-eclampsia are mild. More serious cases can cause complications for mothers and for babies. As well as causing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia can cause: swelling of the hands, feet or face protein in the urine Pre-eclampsia can affect your baby's growth. Sometimes you may need to take medication. Pre-eclampsia can sometimes mean that your baby will need to be born early. Protein in urine Having some protein in your urine can be normal during pregnancy. However, high levels of protein could be a sign of pre-eclampsia. Tips for reducing blood pressure eat healthily reduce the salt in your diet keep active with exercise such as swimming or walking Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that occurs in pregnant women. It means that the insulin in your body is not working properly. Your body cannot get sugar from your blood into your cells. This can cause problems for mothers and for babies. 91Pregnancy health The good news is that eating healthily and staying active will help you to prevent gestational diabetes, and, even if you do develop it, it can be treated. Usually gestational diabetes will disappear after your baby is born. A specialised blood test called an oral glucose tolerance test can detect gestational diabetes. How gestational diabetes is treated Your blood sugars will be monitored. You may be referred to a clinical nurse or midwife specialist in diabetes. They will teach you how to monitor your blood sugars at home. Healthy eating and staying active during the pregnancy will help.Between 10 to 20% of women with gestational diabetes will need insulin injections. Placenta praevia During pregnancy, the placenta (also called the afterbirth) provides your baby with all the nutrients and oxygen they need. Placenta praevia means that your placenta is lying unusually low in your uterus (womb), near to or covering your cervix. This may increase your risk of bleeding during the pregnancy or at the time of birth. You may be advised to rest at home or to come into hospital at the end of your pregnancy. If the placenta is covering the cervix or is very near the cervix, it may block your baby's exit. If this happens, you may need a caesarean section. Babies who are small or growing slowly You may be told that your baby is \"small for gestational age\". This means they are smaller than expected at a particular stage of pregnancy. This might be noticed during a physical examination or an ultrasound scan. If your baby is small, your pregnancy will be monitored more closely. Smoking during pregnancy and some medical conditions can cause your baby to be small. Your obstetrician may suggest birthing the baby if there are signs that your baby is in distress or becoming tired.Placenta praevia You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 92Pregnancy health Breech presentation By 36 weeks, your baby's head should be facing downwards in the womb. If your baby is breech, this means their bottom is downwards, or their feet are downwards instead. This can make the birth more challenging. External cephalic version (ECV) You may be offered an external cephalic version (ECV) if your baby is breech. This is a procedure carried out by a specially-trained obstetrician. Gentle pressure is applied to your abdomen (stomach). This helps the baby turn from a breech to a head-down position. If ECV does not work, you will usually be offered a caesarean birth. See page 128. Did you know? If your baby is still breech after 36 weeks, they will need an ultrasound scan of their hips after birth. Ask your paediatrician or GP about this.93Pregnancy health Expecting twins or more? Expecting twins, triplets or even quadruplets? A 'multiple pregnancy' is the term used when you are pregnant with two or more babies. Almost 2% of births in Ireland are twin births. A woman is more likely to have twins if there are twins in her family. Advances in fertility treatments have led to twins, triplets and even quadruplets becoming more common. Most ultrasounds should detect multiple births by 14 weeks. Type of multiple pregnancyHow this happens Identical twins (33% of twin births)One fertilised egg splits in two. Each baby has the exact same DNA, so they will look very alike and be the same gender. Non-identical twins (66% of twin births)Two eggs are fertilised by two sperm at the same time. Babies may be different genders and will be no more alike than any other brothers and sisters. Triplets Triplets can be non-identical, two may be identical with one non-identical, or all three may be identical. Identical twins (left) and non-identical twins (right) You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 94Pregnancy health Why is carrying two or more babies different? Most women with twins or multiple pregnancies will have a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies but complications are more common. Problems more common Any problems that arise in pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and anaemia, are more common with twins. The most common risk is of premature labour which could mean that your babies are born prematurely. Close monitoring If your babies share a placenta, they will be monitored very closely to ensure both babies are growing well. The birth You will be advised to have the birth in a hospital and have consultant-led (obstetrician) care. You may also be advised to have your babies in a hospital that has a neonatal unit. Your labour will be monitored closely and there will be more healthcare professionals than usual present. There is a higher chance that you may be advised to have a caesarean birth (see page 128). How to cope with two babies at once? Consider going on maternity leave early. When your babies are born, it will be busy - take any help and support available. Establishing a routine early may also help. It is possible to breastfeed twins and even triplets.

You will notice some changes in your breasts during pregnancy. This is your body getting ready for feeding your baby. You may be planning to breastfeed your baby and wondering how it's done.It can help to prepare for breastfeeding to read some of the practical tips in this section and from page 138. These tips can help you to know what to expect when feeding your new baby.

It is a skill that you and your baby develop over the rst days and weeks. With the right support, most mothers can start breastfeeding and continue for as long as they want to. Changes to your breasts during pregnancy You may have noticed your breasts changing as your pregnancy progresses.97Pregnancy health Early on Early on in the pregnancy you may notice a tingling or tender sensation in your breasts. As your pregnancy progresses: the nipples and the areola (the area around the nipples) may darken in colour the veins on the surface of your breasts may become more noticeable Liquid gold From about 16 weeks, your breasts are ready to start producing milk. This is the rst milk or colostrum. It is yellow in colour and is often called liquid gold. Blood Sometimes blood may leak from your nipples. Always get your breasts checked by a GP if you notice blood-stained nipple discharge. Last few weeks In the last few weeks of pregnancy, your nipples and breasts become larger. Lumps Breast lumps can sometimes occur during pregnancy. Most of the time, these are benign and caused by hormonal changes. Always get checked by your GP if you get new breast lumps or an existing lump changes during pregnancy. Preparing your body Eating healthy food will help your body produce breast milk. Apart from this, you don't need to do anything differently to help prepare for breastfeeding. Nature takes care of all that! A note about bras As your breasts grow, your bra needs to t you well. Make sure: your bra is not too tight or loose the strap at the back doesn't cut in your breasts ll the fabric of the cup with no loose fabric there is no bulging over the top, at the sides or underneath the bra the shoulder straps stay in place without digging in the strap around the back and the front underband lie close to your body and are roughly at the same level You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 98Pregnancy health Breastfeeding myth-busters When you're pregnant, you may notice that everyone around you has an opinion, or has advice for you. This can continue right through your child's early years. It is a good idea to get used to it, and to develop some strategies to deal with it! Parenting choices Family and friends usually mean well, and genuinely want to help you. Try to remember that their parenting choices are not necessarily the right ones for you or for your baby. If you were born in Ireland, there is a good chance that your mother may have chosen to formula feed you. At the time, formula companies were allowed to market their products without the same restrictions as today. Mothers genuinely believed they were giving their babies the best start. However, years have passed since then. Research The research is stronger than ever about the importance of breastfeeding. Here are some common myths you may hear when talking about breastfeeding: MYTH MYTH\"It's not that popular in this country\" \"Your baby won't get enough\"Over 55% of women in Ireland choose to breastfeed their babies. Yes, this number is lower than other European countries but still represents over half. Almost all women are able to produce enough breast milk. The size and shape of your breasts or nipples doesn't matter. Early and frequent feeding is the best way to establish your supply.99Pregnancy health Establishing your supply means that your supply of breast milk matches exactly what your baby needs. Breastfeeding is a supply and demand system. The more you breastfeed, the more milk your body produces. There are still lots of ways partners can bond with the baby and plenty of ways they can help you. For example: holding and cuddling the baby changing nappies burping the baby bathing the baby bringing the baby to you to be fed They can also bring you water or snacks while you are feeding. You can still have a sex life while breastfeeding. No formula protects your baby from infections and diseases the way breast milk does. Formula is not sterile and needs to be safely prepared. If you decide to formula feed, your nurse or midwife will help you. MYTH MYTH MYTH\"Your partner will feel left out if you breastfeed\" \"Modern formula is just as good as breast milk\" \"Breastfeeding hurts\" Breastfeeding shouldn't hurt. If it does, it usually means the baby is not positioned or attached (latched on) correctly. Your midwife, neonatal nurse, public health nurse, GP practice nurse or lactation consultant can help with this. See page 139 for tips on positioning and attachment. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 100Pregnancy health Breastfeeding will not make your breasts sag. Sagging breasts are caused by pregnancy and by getting older. Pregnancy hormones can stretch the ligaments that support your breasts. The ageing process can also make breasts appear to sag. Wearing a well-tting bra during pregnancy and while breastfeeding can help to combat this. Questions about feeding your baby? Ask your midwife, neonatal nurse, public health nurse, GP practice nurse or GP any questions you may have about feeding your baby. You can also live chat with a lactation consultant for free on mychild.ie They may talk to you about: Your baby's rst few hours Safe skin-to-skin contact with your baby early after birth will help get the rst feed off to a good start. Holding your baby with their skin next to your skin will calm and relax you and your baby. Breastfeeding in the rst hour after birth provides food, comfort and a good start for your baby's immune system. Rooming-in Rooming-in means having your baby's cot beside your bed after the birth. Doing this for the rst 24 hours after birth helps you to start breastfeeding and to bond. Knowing when your baby needs to feed Responsive feeding means you will know when your baby is getting hungry. This is feeding when your baby shows early feeding cues (signs) (see page 139). Positioning and attachmentPositioning and attachment is sometimes called 'latching on'. The correct positioning and attachment of your baby to the breast will make breastfeeding much easier. There are lots of positions you can try. Soothers Avoid using soothers, especially in the early weeks of breastfeeding. These may decrease the number of feeds your baby wants. This in turn can interfere with how much breast milk your body produces. Formula top-ups Avoid giving your baby top-ups of formula milk if you are breastfeeding, unless you are told to do so for medical reasons. Local support groups Your local breastfeeding support group is a great way to get more information and advice and meet other parents at the same stage as you. See page 149.MYTH\"Breastfeeding will make your breasts sag\"101Labour and birth Birthing your baby Positive preparation for birth As your due date beckons, you may begin to feel excited, expectant or even a little anxious. You may be fed up of being pregnant and eager to meet your baby. Things that can help include: Talk about it Talk to: other mothers about their labours and births your doctors and midwives about the type of experience you might have Visit the hospital If you are giving birth in a hospital, you might nd it helpful to go on a tour of the birthing suite. There may be a video of this you can watch. Birth partner Think about who you would like as your birth partner. Talk to your birth partner about things they can do to support you. Childcare Think about childcare arrangements for your other children. Prepare your home Make a list of the things you may need for your baby. Things that you need can be bought gradually over time. Friends and family may be able to lend you things. See page 177.Prepare a safe place for your baby to sleep. For at least the rst six months, this should be in the same room as you. See page 182. You may nd it helpful to cook meals that can be reheated after the baby is born. Get ready to nish work Try and get things organised at work a few weeks before your maternity leave starts, just in case you go into labour before your due date. You may not have as much time as you think you have! Ask for help Ask family and friends for help, especially during those rst few weeks with a newborn. Be healthy Continue exercising and eating healthily. Get rest Rest when you can. Enjoy this time Do things that you enjoy and that you may not have as much time for when baby comes.

Contractions are strong but their peak is short and they will pass. There are many people to help you along the way. Trust yourself Trust in yourself - you are strong, you've got this. Know what to expect Educate yourself - we all fear the unknown. Once you know what to expect, your anxiety may reduce. Mentally rehearse what labour might be like for you. Be aware that sometimes complications can happen. Don't dwell on them, but be aware of them. Think about the need for a 'plan b' for a safe birth. Some people nd it helpful to write down their fears. Positive thinking Our minds are powerful painkillers. Practice positive thinking. Some women nd visualisation techniques help during labour. For example, picture a flower opening with every contraction. Pregnancy yoga, pregnancy pilates or hypnobirthing classes can be a great way to learn breathing and relaxation techniques. Support from others Surround yourself with support. Find people you can trust to talk to. Mental and emotional preparation to give birth Think about becoming a parent, whether for the rst time or to another child: How would you like your baby to see you? What kind of parent would you like to be? Are there any challenges? Can you think of solutions? Write a letter to your unborn baby.Get help if anxiety is: your main emotion affecting your life taking your joy Talk to your GP , obstetrician or your midwife.103Labour and birth Preparing your body for birth The best position for your baby to be in at the start of labour is with their head down and their back faced outwards towards your tummy. This is called the occipito-anterior (OA) position. Helping your baby get into the best position Sometimes babies may be head-down, but their back is facing your back. This is called the occipito-posterior (OP) position. The OP position may lead to a longer labour time. 'Optimal foetal positioning' is a theory developed by a midwife called Jean Sutton. This is about the movements and positions of a mother during the nal weeks of pregnancy. She found that this could influence the baby's position in the womb. Since then, many midwives and mothers are convinced that optimal foetal positioning techniques work. There is anecdotal evidence (individual stories) and testimonials, but not many clinical trials have been done. However, the techniques recommended are non-invasive and safe, and might be worth a try!Occipito-anterior (OA) Occipito-posterior (OP) You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 104Labour and birth Optimal foetal positioning techniques You can try these from 34 weeks onwards. Spend a lot of time kneeling upright, sitting upright or on your hands and knees. When you sit on a chair, make sure your knees are lower than your pelvis. Watch TV while kneeling on the floor.Sit on a dining chair. Lean on the back of the chair. Keep a wedge cushion in the car to tilt your pelvis forward. Don't cross your legs. Don't put your feet up. Sleep on your side. Swimming with your belly downwards may help - don't do the 'backstroke'. Perineal massage The perineum is the area of tissue between your vagina and your anus (back passage). Sometimes this area can be damaged during birth. Massaging your perineum from 34 weeks on may reduce this risk. A good time to try perineal massage is after a bath or a shower which makes the perineum softer. You could also use an organic oil such as grape seed oil to make the massage more comfortable. Do not use scented or synthetic oils. 1.Get comfortable. A mirror may help. 2.Place a thumb just within the back wall of your vagina, resting your forenger on your buttocks. 3.Press down a little towards your rectum (back passage). 4.Gently massage by moving your thumb and forenger together in a U-shaped movement. Your aim is to massage the area inside your vagina. 5.This should be comfortable - you should feel a stretching sensation. 6.Aim for 5 minutes most days. 7.Tell your midwife or physiotherapist if you had a signicant perineal tear in a previous pregnancy. Do not do perineal massage if you have: genital herpes thrush bacterial vaginosis any vaginal infections!105Labour and birth Preparing your other children During the pregnancy \"It might help me if you read me stories about baby brothers and sisters.\" \"Please know that I will have lots of feelings. Sometimes I might even be angry or sad but that's ok. It doesn't mean I don't love my new baby brother or sister.\"\"Bring me to the GP for some of your appointments later in the pregnancy. I might hear the baby's heartbeat!\" \"I love helping, let me help when the baby comes! I could fetch nappies for the baby or do other tasks depending on my age.\"\"Chat to me about the pregnancy. Let me help you get ready! I'd love to pick out an outt for the baby.\" \"Talk to me when you are feeding the baby or changing their nappy.\"\"Maybe bring me with you when you are visiting friends who have babies.\" \"Try and have some special time just for me, even 10 minutes is enough.\"After the birth \"The love you give me teaches me how to love others.\" You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 106Labour and birth How your birth partner can help Your midwife will be with you during your labour and birth. You can also have another person stay with you throughout. They can be your own personal source of support. This person can be your partner, your mother, your sister, your friend, but ideally someone you know and trust. Research shows that women who have good support in labour: use less pain-relieving drugs have a more satisfying childbirth experience have a better chance of a natural vaginal birth A note for birth partners - how you can help Just be there! You are sharing this special journey. You are an important part. You are not in the way. Your support can help your loved one even in the early stages of labour before you go to the hospital. Birth wishes Talk to her during early pregnancy about her wishes. During labour, you may need to talk about these wishes for her if she is busy focusing on breathing. Discuss techniques to deal with contractions. Practice them. During labour, respect her wishes. She will know at the time what she needs the most. Plan ahead Before the labour, have a plan in place for how you will get to the birth. For example, keep some change handy to pay for hospital parking. Bring snacks for yourself and perhaps a change of t-shirt.107Labour and birth When labour starts Make sure she is well supported and relaxed. Help her by practising any relaxation techniques you have learned. Try not to talk or ask questions during a contraction. She may need to focus and talking could distract her. Maintaining eye contact can help as it may focus attention away from the pain. Massage can help during labour. However, some women become very sensitive and nd any touch annoying. The birth Remind her about different birthing positions. You may need to support her in some of these positions. Ask questions, support her wishes, be aware that plans may need to change depending on how events unfold. Together, as a team, share decisions. When the baby is born Think about whether you would like to cut the umbilical cord. Sometimes newborn babies look very different to babies who are a few weeks old. If you are not prepared for this, it can come as a surprise. Be prepared for them to be wrinkled. They may have skin redness or dryness or a white coating (called vernix) on the skin. The baby's head may be an unusual shape after passing through the birth canal. This is all normal. Your birth wishes and preferences Writing a list of your birth wishes may help you to think about the choices you may have and explore the options. This is sometimes called a 'birth plan'. Your birth wishes will depend on: what you want your medical history your own circumstances the maternity options available locally You should always talk about your wishes with your midwife or obstetrician. What may be safe and practical for one pregnant woman, may not be a good idea for another. Discuss your wishes early. Keep an open mind when writing your birth wishes - sometimes plans may need to change. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 108Labour and birth Things to include in your birth wishes: Where to give birth Your GP or midwife will discuss your choices. Birth partner Think about who will be your birth partner. Do you want them in the room when your baby is being born? If you had to have a caesarean birth, would you like them there? Birthing equipment List any equipment you want to use, such as TENS machines, yoga balls or birthing mats. You may have to bring your own equipment. Check with your midwife. Maternity hospitals may have guidelines on their use. Monitoring during labour Every baby is monitored during labour to make they are not in distress. There are different ways of doing this. Write down if you want to discuss how you would like to be monitored during labour. Keeping active during labour and birth positions Keep active for as long as you feel comfortable. Make it clear in your birth wishes if you want to move around during labour. Try out various positions, such as sitting, standing, kneeling, squatting. List the ones you might like to try during labour. Dealing with contractions There are many options to help with contractions. Some women try a combination of methods. You might like to list your preferred methods.Bear in mind that you may need more, or less, medication than you had planned. Episiotomy An episiotomy is a cut in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus). This may be needed if the baby needs to be born quickly. Write down if this is something you would like to discuss with your obstetrician or midwife. Skin-to-skin contact Your baby is dried immediately after the birth and placed onto your chest. A towel is then placed over your baby's back to keep them warm. This is called skin-to-skin contact. Your midwife will be there to help you. This is so important for mother and baby that it is on everyone's list. Birth of the placenta (afterbirth) Talk to your midwife about the birth of your placenta and any special requirements you may have. Vitamin K for your baby Vitamin K is needed to make the blood clot properly. All babies are given vitamin K with your consent. You might like to state whether you consent to this. Breastfeeding If you are planning to breastfeed your baby, it is very important to include this. Many newborn babies breastfeed soon after birth.109Labour and birth Packing for the hospital Below is a list of suggested items to pack if you're giving birth in a hospital. Hospitals have limited space for personal items, so try to pack lightly. It is best to leave valuables at home. What to pack for you Files and medication pregnancy records, including birth wishes or plan any prescribed medication Clothes for hospital stay 2 comfortable maternity bras, nursing bras or support vests dressing gown 3 to 4 nightgowns or pyjamas (light ones - hospitals can be warm) a front-opening nightshirt or pyjamas if you want to breastfeed an old t-shirt or shirt for labour underwear - choose large cotton or disposable a pair of socks for labour (your feet can get cold) Footwear slippers flip-flops or other waterproof sandals for showerHair clips and bands hair clips and hair bands to keep your hair off your face during labour Towels and toiletries towel (choose dark colours to avoid staining) for each day you're in hospital toiletries: lip balm, toothbrush, hairbrush, face cloth, tissues breast pads and nipple cream 2 large packs of maternity sanitary towels small bottle of hand sanitiser Snacks and water bottle healthy snacks (such as fruit and rice cakes) rellable water bottle Birthing equipment any birthing equipment like a birthing ball or TENS machine if you plan on using one You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 110Labour and birth Other items phone and phone charger camera things to help you pass the time and relax (books, magazines, newspapers or music and earphones) You might also consider bringing your own pillow to hospital. If you do, use a coloured pillowcase so it is not mistaken for a hospital pillow.

They will need a change of clothes, toiletries, change for the car park and a phone charger. You'll have enough to think about! Things to do Plan your route to the hospital - do you know the parking arrangements? Arrange childcare for your other children. Have the number for the maternity ward or admissions ofce - save it on your phone and stick it up at home. Learn your Eircode - this will help an ambulance nd your home quickly if you need one.111Labour and birth Recognising labour The word labour means 'work'. Labour is the work your uterus (womb) does to help the baby come out. This involves the uterus tightening ('contracting') and resting. It then tightens or contracts again. This helps the neck of your womb, known as the cervix, get thinner ('efface') and open ('dilate'). How long does labour last? Every labour and birth is different, and labour can be unpredictable. Be prepared to be flexible with your plans. It is hard to know how long your labour will last. Most rst babies arrive after 12 to 20 hours. The signs of labour Most women go into labour within 7 to 10 days of their due date. If you are not sure whether you are in labour or not, call your midwife or maternity unit. There is no one denite sign that tells you when labour is starting. The following are examples of what you can expect: Regular contractions During a contraction, your uterus (womb) tightens and rests. When these contractions last for more than 30 seconds, and begin to feel stronger, labour may have started. These contractions become more frequent, stronger and longer as labour progresses.Uterus Cervix Vagina You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 112Labour and birth Some women get mild or less strong contractions throughout pregnancy. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions (page 81). Back ache This is aching heavy feeling in the lower back. It is similar to what some women experience during a period. A 'show' During pregnancy, a plug of mucus forms at the cervix (the neck of the womb). This helps to seal the womb during pregnancy. In early labour, this may come out of the vagina. This small amount of sticky pink mucus is called the 'show'. It may be mixed with a small amount of blood. If a large amount of blood is present, go straight to your maternity unit or hospital. Your waters breaking or releasing In the uterus (or womb), your baby is inside a bag of fluid. This is known as the amniotic sac. When the baby is ready to be born, it is normal for the bag of water to release. Sometimes this can happen before labour begins. 113Labour and birth You may notice fluid leaking from your vagina or a gush of fluid. Call your maternity unit or hospital when this happens. Do not use tampons. Other signs When to go to the hospital or call your home birth midwife There is a particular point in labour when you will need to: go to your maternity unit or hospital call your midwife if having a home birth This is when your contractions are 5 minutes apart and are getting stronger or your waters break. You may be asked to go to hospital or contact your home birth midwife earlier if you live a long distance away. You will also have to go to hospital (regardless of home birth plans) if: you are bleeding from your vagina your baby is not moving as much as usual How to time your contractions Timing your contractions may help you decide if you are in true labour or not. Start timing your contractions when you feel they are getting stronger or closer together. Time three contractions in a row. Use a mobile phone app or a watch which has a second hand for minutes. Write down: the start time of each contraction the end time of each contraction the time when the next contraction starts how strong they feel This will help you to know: how long each contraction lasts how far apart the contractions arenausea vomiting diarrhoea\"nesting\" excitement nervousness You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 114Labour and birth Ways to deal with early labour at home Use the focussed breathing you learned at antenatal classes. Have a bath. Go for a short walk. Try to nd something light to watch, read or listen to during contractions. Go to the toilet to pass urine (wee) regularly. Eat small amounts of food. Drink water. Chew ice cubes. Ask your birth partner to give you a massage. Use your TENS machine if you have one. Think positive thoughts, you'll be meeting your baby soon. Picture tiny ngers and toes. What will your baby look like? Let them know and bring your le Phone your midwife or maternity unit before going to the hospital. Bring your antenatal card or your pregnancy notes and your bag. (Some hospitals now have electronic records). What happens next When you get to the hospital A midwife will assess you. They will talk to you about what signs you may have. They may offer to do a vaginal (internal) examination to see how your labour is progressing. Early labour If you are still in early labour and live nearby, you may prefer to go home. You will then go to the hospital when labour gets stronger. 115Labour and birth Admitted to hospital If you need to stay in hospital, you will be admitted to the antenatal ward or to the birthing suite. Your partner may be asked to go home for a few hours if this happens during the middle of the night. This is because other mothers and babies in the ward may be sleeping. Your partner will be able to stay with you if you are: in strong active labour admitted directly to a single birthing suite room The phases of labour Initial Phase FetusUterus Fetus Uterus Crowning of the HeadCervix VaginaFetusUterus Vagina VaginaEffaced CervixActive Phase Umbilical CordPlacentaCervix Phase 1 of labour is... Labour! Your contractions become stronger, more frequent and the neck of your womb (your cervix) becomes thin and dilates to 10cm. Phase 2 of labour is... The birth of your baby.

Your baby will be born.Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 116Labour and birth Phase 3 of labour is... Birthing the placenta (afterbirth). During this stage you will be pushing the placenta out. Becoming a parent and recovery You will be resting and spending time with your baby. This is a good time to begin breastfeeding. See page 138. Ways to deal with labour Positions for labour and birth Use a birthing ball, mats and beanbags to try different positions. This can help your baby move down the pelvis. See page 118. Breathing and relaxation techniques Practice breathing exercises and relaxation techniques during pregnancy. These are a great way to relieve stress. See page 122. Bath or shower Water encourages relaxation and can make the contractions or birth seem less painful. It decreases pressure on your tummy muscles. Water relaxes the perineum (the area of skin between your vagina and your anus or back passage). Some hospitals may have birthing pools but a bath or shower can help too.117Labour and birth Aromatherapy and alternative therapies Aromatherapy oils can be used in massage, in the bath, on a tissue or by diffuser. These may increase relaxation and reduce pain. Women with asthma or other allergies may not be able to use these oils. Other options include hypnosis (hypnobirth), yoga, acupuncture or reflexology. These may not be offered in your maternity hospital or unit but may be available privately. Talk to your midwife if you are considering any alternative methods of pain relief like the above. Most maternity units do not provide these services but may accommodate you. TENS machine The word TENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. This involves passing a gentle electrical current through flat pads on your back. It works better if started early. You tape the electrodes to your back. These are connected to a small battery-operated stimulator. You can hold this and give yourself small doses of electric current. The small electric current may stimulate the body to produce endorphins. Endorphins are natural painkillers. Check if your maternity unit supplies TENS machines. If not, they can be rented. Gas and air (Entonox) You can be given gas to help with labour pain. The gas is half nitrous oxide and half oxygen. The name of the gas is Entonox. You breathe the gas through a mouthpiece. You should start breathing it as soon as the contraction begins. The gas can be used at any time, and you are in control. It may make you feel a little dizzy. Pethidine Pethidine is a strong painkiller. It is a similar drug to morphine and a type of opioid. Pethidine is an injection given into your leg or bottom. It may help reduce your pain, especially if used alongside other methods. The injection may make your feel drowsy, dizzy or sick. If given too close to delivery it may mean that baby is a bit sleepy after birth. Epidural An epidural is a local anaesthetic. You will have a drip put into your arm beforehand. You will then have a very small tube inserted in your back by an anaesthetist. Pain- relieving drugs come through the tube once it is in the right place. The midwife will need to check your blood pressure regularly as sometimes this can fall. It can usually take away all of your pain and has minimal effect on your baby. Taking an epidural may make the labour longer and reduce your urge to bear down. It may make it difcult to pass urine (wee). If you have difculty weeing, you will need a tube inserted into your bladder. This is called a catheter. 1 in 100 women develop a severe headache after an epidural. This can be treated. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 118Labour and birth Keep an open mind Bear in mind: You may need less or more medication than you had planned Your obstetrician or midwife may suggest a particular form of pain relief to help with the labour or birth Staying active during labour Being active in labour can distract you from any discomfort you may be feeling. It can also shorten the length of your labour. You may feel the urge to stay upright and to move around. Listen to your body.Being upright means using any position other than lying flat. Benets of staying upright rather than lying down Gravity will help your baby move down the birth passage. Pregnant women who are upright and active need less pain relief or interventions to get the baby out. Better contractions and less pain When you are upright, your womb tilts forward during labour. This means you will have better contractions and less pain. Contractions are stronger and more effective when you are upright. This could mean your labour is shorter. Wider birth canal The lower part of your spine (sacrum) can move better when you are upright. This means the birth canal can widen and make room for your baby's head. Pelvic joints can expand and move which means less pressure on nerves. Better for the baby Your baby may get a better oxygen supply. They may get into a better position for birth. Did you know? Walking in labour may help to shorten the early phase of labour. When labour is more established, you might need support to walk between contractions.119Labour and birth The 'slow dance' position The 'slow dance' is a childbirth position that may help. Put your arms around your birth partner's neck and shoulders. Your birth partner can apply counter pressure to any particular spot, or simply hold you. You can rock backwards and forwards. Music may help. Ways to stay upright during labour standing sitting on a chair on a birthing ball kneeling squatting on all fours Your movement during labour could be limited by: an epidural drips (intravenous lines or infusions) electronic monitors Ask your birth partner and midwife to help you change position to stay as comfortable as possible.The 'slow dance' position You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 120Labour and birth Equipment you can use Using special equipment during labour can make you feel more comfortable. Practice with this equipment during your pregnancy. Getting used to equipment means you will feel condent using it when you go into labour. Birthing balls and peanut balls are two types of equipment used during labour. Birthing ball Sitting on a birthing ball can be a comfortable position when you are 'resting' during labour. It helps gravity to assist the birth of your baby. It also allows your birth partner to do some massage if you would like that. When sitting on a birthing ball, make sure it is inflated such that your hips are higher than your knees. This makes it easier to lean forward to widen your pelvis. Rocking back and forth can be soothing and helps your cervix stretch. Get a ball with an anti-burst valve. Sometimes pumps are sold with the ball or the ball can be inflated at the air pump at a petrol station. What size is right for me? Check your height below to make sure you buy the right size ball. You may need to get a larger ball than the one listed for your height if you have heavy proportions or particularly long legs. 121Labour and birth Your height (feet and inches) Recommended ball size 4 foot 8 inches 45 cm or 18 inches 4 foot 8 inches to 5 foot 3 inches 55 cm or 22 inches5 foot 4 inches to 5 foot 10 inches 65cm or 26 inches5 foot 11 inches to 6 foot 4 inches 75cm or 30 inches6 foot 4 inches and over 85cm or 34 inches Peanut ball A peanut ball is oval in shape and narrower in the middle. You may use a peanut ball if you need to remain in the bed, due to epidural use, tiredness or other medical reasons. The ball is usually placed between the legs to open your pelvis. You can be in a semi- reclined position with one leg over the ball and one leg to the side of the ball. Another recommended position is lying on your side with the ball in between your legs. Some research shows that women who use a peanut ball have a shorter labour. They are less likely to need a caesarean birth. It is thought that using the ball may help a baby's head rotate into the best position for passing through the birth canal. These balls come in different sizes, so it is important to try them before buying. For most women, a 45 to 50 cm ball is appropriate. You may prefer a 40 cm ball if you are very petite. Breathing and self-help techniques Learning the art of relaxation will help you during pregnancy and labour. It may also help you with the transition to parenthood. Practising breathing exercises during your pregnancy can be a great way of relieving stress. It will also help you to respond to discomfort during labour. Developing a relaxed state of mind takes practice. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 122Labour and birth Breathing techniques Focusing on your breathing requires you to concentrate. Focused breathing means that your thought process is directed away from any discomfort you may be feeling. This can help during a contraction. It helps reduce tension in your muscles. This may ease the birthing process. It may also help you to deal with any stress, anxiety or anger that you may be feeling. It reverses some of the physical symptoms of anxiety. How to do focused breathing 1.Practice taking deep slow breaths from your abdomen (stomach area). 2.Rest your hands at the bottom of your ribs, so that your ngertips are touching. 3.Your ngertips should move apart slightly as you breathe in, and then come together again as your lungs empty. 4.Breathe slowly, for example for a count of 5. 5.Breathe out slowly, as this ensures the diaphragm is pulling air into the bases of the lungs. Work with your body Contractions during labour are important. They are a positive force. By listening to your body, you will know what positions work best for you, how to move and how to breathe. Endorphins Every contraction is bringing your baby closer to you. As your contractions get stronger, your body will produce pain-relieving chemicals known as endorphins. Labour starts a sequence of events in your body. Your body produces hormones to help you bond with your baby and to breastfeed. You are strong. Your body was designed for labour.123Labour and birth Positive afrmations Thinking positive thoughts can help reduce feelings of discomfort and may make you feel more condent. Examples of positive afrmations (thoughts): I am doing well. My body was designed for this. I am strong and healthy; labour is normal. My body and my baby are working together for a safe birth. Each surge that I feel is bringing me closer to holding my baby in my arms. The birth The next phase of labour involves breathing out your baby. This begins when the cervix (the neck of your womb) is fully dilated (opened) to 10 cm. You are ready to give birth. Your midwife or obstetrician will guide you through this part of labour. Soon you will be meeting your baby for the very rst time. Find a birth position During your pregnancy, practice different positions and see what feels comfortable. Different positions include: standing kneeling on your knees squatting kneeling and hugging your birth partner lying on your side kneeling on all fours lying in bed propped up on pillows. Water births If you are having a water birth, you may feel more comfortable in positions where the water is covering you. You will also be able to use the sides of the birthing pool for support. This may give you more options to try different positions. Your midwife will support you. They and your birth partner can help you nd the position that feels most comfortable. Breathing out and pushing Once your cervix is open, you may feel the urge to push. You should work with your body at the start of a contraction. 1.Take a deep breath in. 2.When you breathe out, push down, into your bottom, as if you were trying to have a large bowel movement (poo). You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 124Labour and birth 3.Take a breath when you need to and push again. 4.Give several pushes until the contraction ends. 5.Rest between contractions. 6.Your midwife will advise you when to stop pushing Every birth is different, just as every mother and baby are different. You may have practiced a different method with your midwife or physiotherapist during your pregnancy. Use whatever technique feels more comfortable to you. Your midwife is there to support and guide you. Birthing your baby Soon your baby's head will move down, and the midwife will see it. The midwife will ask you to stop pushing and to pant or blow a few short quick breaths. Practice this before your due date. This is to allow your baby's head to be born slowly and gently. The skin around the birth passage usually stretches well. Occasionally it can tear. Panting and blowing helps to prevent this. Once your baby's head is born, give one small and gentle push for the body.Your baby can be lifted directly onto your tummy or chest if this is what you would like. This is the start of safe skin-to-skin contact. The umbilical cord will be clamped and cut by your midwife, obstetrician or birth partner.125Labour and birth Birthing the placenta (afterbirth) After your baby is born, your uterus (womb) can contract to push out the placenta (afterbirth). Your midwife may offer you an injection to help speed this process up. This injection is of a drug called syntocinon. The injection reduces the risk of severe bleeding after the birth (post-partum haemorrhage). It also reduces your risk of needing a blood transfusion. This is the method recommended by most obstetricians and midwives. Some pregnant women who have had straightforward pregnancies and births choose not to have the syntocinon injection. Your midwife or obstetrician will usually support your choice. But if they feel you are at high risk of having a bleed, they will advise you to get the injection. Your midwife and obstetrician will discuss the risks and benets to help you make an informed choice. Breastfeeding as soon as possible will also help your womb contract. When nature needs a hand Some babies need a little help to be born. There are a few medical procedures that may be needed to start off your labour or to help your baby be born. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 126Labour and birth When a procedure is recommended, never be afraid to ask questions. Why do I need this? What could happen if this is not done? Are there any risks to me from this procedure? What are the alternatives? Inducing (starting off) labour 'Induction' of labour describes ways that may be used to start your labour. This is generally needed if: your baby is overdue your waters have broken but labour has not started the health of you or your baby is at risk There are many ways of inducing labour. Prostaglandin gel This is a hormonal gel that is inserted into the vagina. It encourages the cervix to soften and open. It can take up to 72 hours to work. Once labour starts, it should continue normally. Membrane sweep Membrane sweeping involves your midwife or obstetrician putting a gloved nger inside your vagina until it reaches your cervix (the neck of your womb). They will place their ngertip just inside your cervix and make a circular movement. This may stimulate your cervix to produce hormones that may trigger labour.127Labour and birth Articial rupture of membranes Occasionally your midwife or doctor will need to break your waters. This is called an 'amniotomy'. The membranes may be ruptured using a specialised tool, such as an amnihook or amnicot. They may also be ruptured by the obstetrician's nger. Balloons Labour can be induced by placing a small tube with a small balloon on the end of it in the neck of the womb. This method avoids any risk of too many contractions. Oxytocin The body produces a hormone called oxytocin in labour. Sometimes you will need synthetic oxytocin during labour. This to induce your labour or to make your contractions more regular. One of the main risks of having your labour induced is that the contractions could become more frequent. Too many contractions can harm your baby. You are entitled to information about this. Do not be afraid to ask for extra information. Episiotomy This is not routinely done. An episiotomy is a small cut to make the opening of the vagina bigger. It is sometimes done to speed up the birth of the baby's head. The cut is usually made in the perineum. This is the area between the vagina and back passage. You will need stitches afterwards. Practicing perineal massage (page 104) during pregnancy may reduce your chances of needing an episiotomy. Stitches Small grazes and tears will not require stitches. If you have a larger tear or an episiotomy you may need stitches. Normally you will be holding your baby in safe skin to skin as this is being done. If you have an epidural, this can be topped up before the stitches are done, otherwise you will be given some local anaesthetic. Assisted births: forceps and ventouse (vacuum) An assisted birth is when forceps or a ventouse suction cup are used to help deliver the baby. Situations where assistance may be needed: If you have been pushing for a long time with no sign of imminent birth. When an immediate birth is needed for your baby's safety. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 128Labour and birth Ventouse A ventouse is a suction cup. It is tted to your baby's head. As you push, the obstetrician will guide your baby's head along the birth canal. Forceps Forceps are spoon-shaped instruments. They are curved to cradle your baby's head. Forceps are used to guide your baby's head through the birth canal as you push. Caesarean birth In a caesarean birth your baby is born through a cut in your abdomen (tummy). It is also known as a 'C-section'. A caesarean birth takes place in an operating theatre. Some caesarean births are planned. Others are emergency caesarean births, when complications happen during labour. Reasons for caesareans The most common reasons for an emergency caesarean: Labour is not progressing. The baby needs to be born quickly. The most common reasons for an elective (planned) caesarean: Your baby remains in the breech position. You have a low-lying placenta (placenta praevia).Ventouse (vacuum) birth129Labour and birth What happens during a caesarean A spinal anaesthetic or epidural is used in most caesarean births. This means you are awake during the operation and do not feel any pain. Birth partner Your birth partner will wear a gown and mask if they attend the birth. They may have to wait outside until the operation has started. If you have a general anaesthetic, your birth partner will normally not be allowed into the operating theatre. They can wait close by and will be updated as soon as there is news. How long it takes The entire procedure takes around 45 minutes. It can be quicker or slower depending on the circumstances. Usually your baby will be born in 5 to 10 minutes. When the baby is born Your baby may be checked by a paediatric doctor (a doctor specialising in children's health). Your midwife will help you and your partner to have safe skin-to-skin contact. Recovering from a caesarean You may feel uncomfortable after a caesarean. You will be: offered pain-relieving medication have a drip in your arm to give you fluids usually be in hospital for 3 to 4 days Catheter A tube called a catheter will be in your bladder. It is inserted at the time of the operation and left in for approximately 24 hours afterwards. Catheters are used to drain wee out of your bladder until you can go to the toilet yourself. Injections into your abdominal wall (tummy) You will usually receive injections into your stomach (tummy) to prevent blood clots. Everyday tasks You may have to wait a few hours after your caesarean operation before you are allowed to eat anything. You will be helped to shower the next day, and encouraged to be mobile as soon as possible. A chartered physiotherapist who specialises in women's health may see you to help your recovery. Usually you will not be allowed to drive for up to six weeks after a caesarean birth.

Your baby will be beautiful, but their rst appearance may be a little surprising. Newborns are often wet, wrinkled and red with an unusually long or pointed head! Initial examination of your baby Immediately after birth, your midwife or paediatrician will examine your baby. This is to see if you have had a boy or a girl. They will also look for any visible health problems that need immediate action. Vitamin K injection Most doctors, nurses and midwives recommend that all newborn babies get a vitamin K injection. This is to help their blood to clot and prevent bleeding disorders. You'll need to give your consent for this. Your baby will then get the injection immediately after birth. It is a small injection into your baby's thigh. There are no reported side-effects, but occasionally babies can have redness or swelling around the site of injection. 131131Your baby's rst 6 weeks Normal variations in the appearance of newborns Newborns can vary in their appearance. Some of the normal variations include: Colour Brand new babies often have a dark red or purple appearance. This begins to fade over a few days. Vernix This is a white greasy substance. It covers the skin of many newborn babies, especially in skin folds. Moulding This is when a newborn baby's head has a long shape. It is caused by bones overlapping in your baby's skull to help pass through the birth canal. The head returns to a more normal shape after one week. Skin Many babies born on or after their due dates may have dry and scaly skin. Some newborns have a red rash on their chest and back. This is known as 'erythema toxicum'. It will disappear after a few days. Lanugo Some babies are born with soft, downy hair all over their bodies. This is more common in premature babies. Milia or 'milk spots' These are tiny white and hard spots on a baby's nose. They look like pimples. These are caused by oil glands and will disappear on their own. Mongolian spots These are blue or purple spots, also known as 'Mongolian Blue spots'. They usually appear on your baby's lower back or buttocks. They can sometimes appear in other places like your baby's arms or legs. Most of the time, this discolouration disappears without any treatment by age 4, but occasionally it can last for longer. Mongolian spots are more common in dark-skinned babies. Bonding with your baby Skin-to-skin contact For most babies, skin-to-skin contact is just what they need to calm them and warm them after birth. During skin-to-skin contact, you and your baby will produce a hormone called oxytocin. This helps you feel close to your baby. After the birth Immediately after the birth, a midwife will dry your baby and place them on your chest. Your baby will be naked (except for a hat and nappy). You will get a blanket to keep you and your baby warm. Enjoy this time, rest and relax together. This is your chance to get to know your baby, to look at tiny ngers, toes and their nose!

If you or your baby are unable to try skin-to-skin contact after birth, for whatever reason, don't worry. You can have these moments at a later stage when you are both ready. Signs of wanting to feed During this time, your baby may start showing signs of wanting to feed. They may move towards your breast, or you may need to help them. They will try to latch or attach to your breast. Keep your baby skin-to-skin during this rst feed and afterwards, for as long as you wish. Watch your baby closely while you are having skin-to-skin. Make sure they have a normal breathing pattern and that their skin colour does not change. Benets of skin-to-skin contact for your baby Skin-to-skin contact helps your baby: stay warm feel less stress from being born adjust to life outside the womb stabilise their breathing regulate their blood sugar get protection from the 'good bacteria' that pass from skin to their skin - this helps protects against infection \"You are my universe. I could pick you out in a crowd.\" 133133Your baby's rst 6 weeks Building a relationship with your baby Responsive parenting is an important part of forming a healthy relationship with your baby. It means that you are responding to your baby while accepting their needs and signals. This type of parenting helps your baby form healthy brain connections and encourages feelings of safety and comfort. Tips to help with responsive parenting Hold them close Your baby loves when you hold them close. It comforts your baby and helps them feel secure. Too young for routines Newborn babies are not able to learn routines. A newborn baby does not know the difference between day and night. They also have very small stomachs, and need to feed little and often. It is normal for newborn babies to need to feed several times during the night. As your baby grows, they will gradually sleep for longer between feeds. This hopefully should mean less night awakenings! Body language Your baby will let you know in their own little ways what they need. It will take time to learn what your baby is trying to tell you. For example, your baby loves you speaking or singing to them but when they get tired they will turn away or rub their eyes. Soon you will learn to read these signals and know that your baby needs a break. Responding to their needs Remember, you are not 'spoiling' your baby by responding to their needs. Bonding with your body During pregnancy, your body worked very hard. You managed to grow an entire human being from one tiny cell! Just as it took time to grow your pregnancy, it will take time for your body to recover from pregnancy. Be patient and kind to yourself. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 134134Your baby's rst 6 weeks Common issues after pregnancy After pains After your baby is born, you may feel painful period-like cramps in your stomach. This happens as your uterus (womb) returns to the size it was before pregnancy. These cramps should go away after a few days. Your midwife or obstetrician will examine you to check that the womb is shrinking. You may feel these pains are more severe when you breastfeed. Breastfeeding stimulates your womb to contract to normal. Ask your midwife or obstetrician about what painkillers you can take to help with this. Perineum area Your perineum is the area of skin between the back of your vagina and your anus (back passage). During labour and birth, this area of skin stretches and may even tear. After giving birth, this area may be sore and swollen. If you have had stitches, this area may feel particularly tender. You will need to take care of the perineum. You should: change your pads frequently wash your hands (before and after changing pads) have a bath or shower each day to keep the perineal area clean do your baby's rst 6 weeks Call your midwife or GP if the wound becomes open or starts to ooze green or smelly fluid. Changes following a caesarean birth A caesarean birth is major surgery, so it will take time to recover. You will need extra rest. The blood you lost during surgery may mean that you feel very tired. Your wound can be quite uncomfortable. Talk to your obstetrician, GP or midwife about medications to help you feel more comfortable. Enlist your partner, family and friends to help you as you recover. Vaginal discharge or bleeding (lochia) After giving birth, it is normal for bloody fluid to discharge from your vagina for up to 6 weeks. This is called lochia. It is your body's way of getting rid of the extra blood and tissue that was in your womb during pregnancy. Colour of blood The colour of the blood flow is bright red at rst. This will change to brown and eventually to a yellow or whitish colour as the uterus heals. Changes to the blood It is normal to see an increase in the amount or a darkening in the colour of the blood if you do something physically tiring. This may be a sign that you need to take it easy. What to do Do not use a tampon. You can use a maternity pad or a sanitary towel. Call your midwife, public health nurse or GP if: the bleeding becomes heavy with clots or it starts to have a foul-smell You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 136136Your baby's rst 6 weeks Bladder and bowel problems Some women may have difculty controlling urine (wee) or faeces (poo) after childbirth. You may notice urine or poo is leaking. Contact your GP , public health nurse or physiotherapist if your symptoms are not improving after 6 weeks after the birth. Stinging when passing urine You may have some pain or stinging when you pass urine for a few days. Drink plenty of fluids. Constipation Some women have trouble having a bowel movement (a poo) after giving birth. Drink lots of fluids like water and eat foods that are high in bre. Talk to your GP or midwife if you go more than 3 days without a bowel movement. High-bre foods include oats, wholegrain bread and pasta, fruit and vegetables, potatoes with their skin on, peas, beans and legumes. Piles (haemorrhoids) Haemorrhoids are painful swollen veins around the back passage. These may get worse after giving birth. Drink plenty of fluids and eat foods rich in bre. Talk to your GP about medications. Pelvic organ prolapse Prolapse can happen when there is a weakness in structures which support your pelvic floor. This weakness allows one or more of the pelvic organs to move down into the walls of the vagina. The womb, bowel or bladder bulges into the vagina. The pelvic floor is usually weak after pregnancy and childbirth. Contact your GP , public health nurse or physiotherapist if you think you have symptoms of prolapse. Some symptoms of prolapse include: a dragging pain in your vagina or lower tummy seeing or feeling a bulge in your vagina or the sensation of 'something coming down' Sex after pregnancy Sex after pregnancy may be difcult and painful for women. If you have had a perineal tear or an episiotomy, this can make sex painful at rst. You may also nd your desire to have sex changes, particularly if you are exhausted or feeling low. This is normal. Talking to your partner about how you feel is important. 137137Your baby's rst 6 weeks Breast changes Your breasts will get bigger and more rm. They will produce the rst milk called colostrum. This is a yellow colour. Your milk then changes to a more white colour. Your breasts will make more milk about 3 days after the birth of your baby. Hair loss Your hair may have seemed thicker and fuller during pregnancy. It is common for hair to thin out after the baby has been born. You may even lose hair. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables. Be gentle with your hair. Remember Your body is amazing, it kept your baby safe.

Follow your baby's feeding cues. Your nurse or midwife is there to help and support you. Colostrum Every pregnant woman has milk ready for her baby at birth. This is known as colostrum. It is sometimes called 'liquid gold'. It is produced in small amounts by your body and is quite thick in consistency. Colostrum is full of antibodies that will help your baby ght off infection. Every breastfeed makes a difference. The rst few days How often A newborn baby can feed 10 to 12 times in 24 hours. In the early days, breastfeeding takes patience and practice. It is important to breastfeed your baby early and often. Every time your baby feeds, they are letting your body know how much breast milk you need to produce. Feed your baby as often as they want. This will help you stay comfortable.139139Your baby's rst 6 weeks 'Milk coming in' You may notice your breasts are beginning to make more milk and becoming fuller and rmer. This happens at some point from day 2 to 4. It is sometimes known as 'your milk coming in'. Leaks Sometimes breast milk may leak from your nipples. If you use breast pads, change them regularly or at every feed. Signs your baby is hungry Early feeding cues Signs your baby is hungry are called early feeding cues. They include: eyes fluttering moving their hands to their mouth making mouth movements moving towards your breast or turning their head when you touch their cheek Crying Crying is a late sign of hunger or late feeding cue. Try feeding when your baby gives you the earlier signs. It will often be easier as you will both be calmer and more relaxed. Breastfeeding positions You can breastfeed in a number of different positions. Find one that is comfortable for both of you. Remember to keep your baby safe at all times. Have a drink close to hand, and perhaps a snack. Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes practice. See mychild.ie for step-by-step guides on different breastfeeding positions you can try. Breastfeeding: positioning and attachment Positioning and attachment is about how you hold your baby at your breast so they can feed. This is sometimes called 'latching on'. When your baby is well positioned and attached, they will nd it easier to feed well and you will nd it more comfortable. In the early days, you may feel sensitive at the beginning of a feed as you get used to the new feeling. Feeding should not be painful. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 140140Your baby's rst 6 weeks How to position and attach Attachment: The key to successful breastfeeding Follow these steps to position and attach your baby well: 1.Hold your baby close with their nose level with your nipple. 2.Let your baby's head tip back so their top lip brushes against your nipple - this should help them open their mouth wide. 3.When your baby's mouth is wide open, bring them to your breast. 4.Aim your nipple to the roof of their mouth. 5.When they attach, your nipple and most of the areola (the area around your nipple) should be deep in your baby's mouth. 6.When your baby is attached properly, their chin will be pressed into your breast. 7.Your baby's nose should be clear for easy breathing. 8.If your baby's nose appears to be blocked, move their bottom closer to you. This will create a head tilt and free up their nose. 9.The deeper the attachment, the more comfortable you will feel and the better your baby will feed. 10.More of your areola will be visible above their top lip than below their bottom lip. 11.Their cheeks will appear fuller. 12.They'll suck quickly at rst, followed by longer sucks. 13.You will hear them swallowing.141141Your baby's rst 6 weeks How do I know my baby is getting enough? Newborn babies have small stomachs. It might seem you are only producing a small amount of colostrum. However, this is more than enough to ll a tiny tummy. What goes in, must come out! Your baby's nappies will help you to see if they are getting enough breast milk. Your baby should be producing wet and dirty nappies. Your baby's rst dirty nappies are black and tarry. This is called meconium. Over the next day or so, your baby's poos become greenish in colour. By day 5, your baby will have yellow seedy poos.Dirty nappies: Number and colour of stools Per day, on average over 24 hoursAt least 1 to 2 black or dark green stoolsAt least 3 yellow stoolsAt least 3 large, soft and seedy yellow stoolsNappies: How many? How wet? Per day, on average over 24 hoursAt least 1 to 2 wetAt least 3 wetAt least 5 wetAt least 6 heavy wet with pale yellow or clear urine Your baby's tummy size? Size of a walnut Size of an egg Size of a cherry Size of an apricotHow often should you breastfeed?At least 10 to 12 feeds per day Your baby should be sucking strongly, slowly, steadily and swallowing often.At least 8 to 10 feeds per day Per day, on average over 24 can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 142142Your baby's rst 6 weeks Day Wet nappies Dirty nappies 1 1 wet nappy or more (over 24 hours)1 stool (black) or more 2 2 wet nappies or more 2 stools (black) or more 3 3 wet nappies or more 3 stools (black or greenish) or more4 4 wet nappies or more 3 to 4 stools (greenish or yellowish) or more 5 5 wet nappies or more Stools should turn yellow6 days to 6 weeks 6 wet nappies or more (heavy and wet with pale, yellow or clear urine)3 to 8 stools or more (yellow, seedy, runny to loose) daily Other signs your baby is getting enough breast milk: Your baby: has a strong cry is active and alert is waking easily is satised and content after many feeds Your breasts should feel softer after feeds. Did you know? It's normal for babies lose weight in the rst few days after birth. After this they begin gaining weight and by 2 weeks of age they usually are back at their birth weight. Common breastfeeding questions Does breastfeeding hurt? In the early weeks, some mothers say they feel tenderness at the beginning of a breastfeed. You need to get help if soreness continues during the feed. See page 146. The main reason may be: your baby is not positioned correctly on your breast, or a different breastfeeding position might suit better Get help from your midwife, neonatal nurse, public health nurse, or your lactation consultant. You can get advice from lactation consultants on mychild.ie143143Your baby's rst 6 weeks What if my breasts feel sore and full? If your breasts become very full in the rst few days, this may feel uncomfortable. Tips include: Feed often Feeding your baby will ease the full feeling. The more often you feed your baby, the more comfortable you will feel. Warm your breasts Warm your breasts with a warm facecloth or in the shower if: your breasts are very uncomfortable your baby is nding it hard to attach This will help your milk to flow. Hand express before a feed Hand expressing some breast milk before the feed can also help. This will soften your breast and help your baby attach onto your breast. Can I use a soother? Try not to give your baby a soother, dummy or dodie until breastfeeding is established. This means that your supply of breast milk matches your baby's needs. Breastfeeding works by supply and demand. The more you breastfeed, the more milk your body produces. Breastfeeding takes a number of weeks to get established. Using soothers has been shown to reduce the amount of breast milk your body makes. It may also interfere with your baby attaching correctly onto your breast.Changing position If a position doesn't feel right, take your baby off the breast and start again. Slide one of your ngers into your baby's mouth to gently break the suction before taking them off the breast. Always wash your hands carefully before you begin breastfeeding your baby. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 144144Your baby's rst 6 weeks Do I need a special diet? There's no need to follow a special diet when you are breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is thirsty work so make sure you are drinking plenty of water. Being a new mother is busy and can be hard work. Try to have a healthy and balanced diet to make sure you are getting all of the nutrients you need. A healthy and balanced diet means: at least 5 to 7 servings of vegetables, salad and fruit each day wholegrain bread, pasta, rice or potatoes plenty of bre to prevent constipation - wholegrains, beans, lentils, fruit and vegetables protein such as lean meat, poultry, sh and eggs dairy foods such as milk, cheese and yoghurts Top tip: Try to have healthy snacks ready to grab for when you get hungry. Examples of healthy snacks are: fresh fruit yoghurts hummus and vegetables to dip in like carrots and celery sandwiches dried fruit like mangoes, apricots and prunes breakfast cereals or muesli that are fortied with vitamins baked beans on toast baked potato with cheese boiled eggs145145Your baby's rst 6 weeks Do I need to avoid certain things? Alcohol Avoid drinking alcohol in the rst month after your baby is born. This is because it is difcult to predict when a newborn baby might need to breastfeed. Alcohol could be present in small amounts in your breast milk. It is safe to drink alcohol and breastfeed after the rst month if you: feed your baby and express breastmilk before drinking wait 2 hours after each standard drink before breastfeeding your baby have a limit of 11 standard drinks a week spread your drinks over the week have at least 2 alcohol-free days per week 1 standard drink is a half a pint of beer, a single measure of spirits or a small glass of wine. Caffeine Drinks containing caffeine like tea, coffee and energy drinks may keep your baby awake. Keep your caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day, the same as when you were pregnant. Examples of caffeine containing foods and drinks include: 1 mug of lter coffee - 140 mg caffeine 1 mug of instant coffee - 100 mg caffeine 1 mug of tea - 75 mg caffeine 1 can of energy drank can have up to 160 mg caffeine, depending on the size 1 cola drink tends to have 40 mg caffeine Foods to avoid Oily sh contains special types of fats. These are called long chain omega fatty acids. These fats are really good for your baby's developing nervous system. But some oily sh can contain low levels of pollutants. These can build up in the body. If you are breastfeeding, don't have more than two portions of oily sh per week. You should not eat more than one portion of marlin, swordsh or shark per week. This is because these sh can contain high levels of mercury. There is no limit to how much tuna you can eat, as long as you are not pregnant. Medication Make sure any medicine, tablets or pills you take are safe for breastfeeding. Check with your GP , any doctor who is treating you or your pharmacist.

Once you and your baby have learned the skill of breastfeeding, it becomes easier every day. Every day of breastfeeding makes a positive difference for your baby. You don't need to decide at the start how long you will continue. The rst 6 months Exclusive breastfeeding with no other foods or drinks is recommended for the rst 6 months of your baby's life. After 6 months After the rst 6 months, your baby will start eating other foods and drinks. You can continue giving them breast milk for as long as you want. What about breastfeeding more than one baby? Twin, triplets and even more can be breastfed! As these babies may have been born small or early, breastfeeding is even more important for their health. How to do it You may nd it easier at the start to feed them separately. This will help you to build your condence. Triplets can be fed with two together and then one alone, or rotated one by one.Aim to give as much breast milk as possible to your babies. The amount of breast milk you produce depends on how often and how regularly your babies feed. Breastfeeding challenges Breastfeeding is a skill that mothers and babies must learn together. Like any skill, it takes practice and patience. Things that help to prevent breastfeeding challenges: Feed your baby frequently when they show early feeding cues (see page 139). Make sure your baby is positioned and attached deeply onto your breast (see page 139). If you do have any challenges, you are not alone. Ask for help. Almost every breastfeeding problem has a breastfeeding solution! Sore or bleeding nipples If your nipples are sore or bleeding, get help. 147147Your baby's rst 6 weeks Ask your neonatal nurse, midwife, public health nurse, GP practice nurse or lactation consultant to check that your baby is correctly positioned and attached to the breast. They will help you to: become more comfortable feeding treat sore nipples If positioning and attachment isn't the cause of the problem, they will advise you about treatment. Other causes may include tongue-tie or thrush. Tips If positioning and attachment is the cause, the following tips may help: Carefully wash your hands before feeding your baby. After each feed, hand express some milk. Gently rub the milk into the nipple area. Let this dry before covering again. Gently massage your nipples with warm ngers and 100% lanolin nipple ointment - follow the instructions and make sure you are in a warm room. Spread a small amount of 100% lanolin nipple cream on a clean dry breastpad and place over the nipple. Change the breastpad frequently (read the instructions) to prevent moisture staying on your skin. Use a hydrogel compress - ask your pharmacist for advice on which is suitable for breastfeeding women and follow the instructions. If it feels too painful to feed, you could pump milk for a day or two. This gives your nipples time to heal. Hand expressing may be more comfortable than using a pump. If using a breast pump, start on the lowest setting. Increase it slowly to the lowest setting at which your milk starts to flow well. Unsettled feeding Unsettled feeding means your baby is fussing or crying at the breast. Ask for help from your midwife, neonatal nurse, lactation consultant, GP practice nurse or public health nurse about the best ways to correctly position and attach your baby to your breast. When your baby has nished the rst breast, try offering your second breast at each feed. Engorgement Breast engorgement is when your breasts get too full of milk. This can leave them feeling hard and painful. Engorgement can happen in the early days of feeding. It can take a few days for your supply of breast milk to match what your baby needs. It can also happen later on, for example when you introduce solid foods to your baby. Ask your midwife, neonatal nurse, public health nurse, GP practice nurse or lactation consultant for help if you think your breasts are engorged. They can show you how to express a little milk by hand before a feed to soften your breast and help the baby to attach. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 148148Your baby's rst 6 weeks Other tips include: Wear a well-tting bra (nursing bra) designed for breastfeeding mothers. Apply warm flannels to your breasts before a feed or before you hand express. Keep cabbage leaves in the fridge and put them on your breasts after a feed. Ask your nurse or doctor if you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with the pain. Blocked ducts If you have a blocked duct, you will usually notice an area of your breast that is sore. You might feel a hard and tender lump when you press your breast. You will generally feel well. A blocked duct can happen when the milk is not flowing freely from that milk duct in your breast. Causes can include wearing a bra that is too tight, incorrect positioning and attachment or missing a feed. Mastitis Mastitis means you have an inflammation in one of your breasts. This can happen when a blocked duct is not relieved. If mastitis is not treated, it can become infected and you will need to take antibiotics. If you have mastitis, you may have: a red patch of skin on your breast that is painful to touch a high fever flu-like symptoms - feeling generally unwell, achy and tired. You may feel tearful too. Ask your midwife, public health nurse or lactation consultant to check that your baby is correctly positioned and attached to the breast. Tips Some tips to help a blocked duct or mastitis include: Feed more often and feed from the affected breast rst. If your baby cannot feed, express from that side. Warm up your breast with a hot wet flannel before feeding. If you have mastitis only, cool your breast with a cold facecloth or flannel after the feed. Massage your breast while baby is feeding. Rest and take a painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen (check with your nurse or GP if you can use this medication).149149Your baby's rst 6 weeks See your GP if there is no improvement after 12 to 24 hours or if things are getting worse. Tongue-tie Some babies with tongue-tie are not able to move and stretch their tongues freely and this may interfere with positioning and attachment. This can cause feeding challenges. It can also cause problems like nipple pain. Tongue-tie can reduce the amount of breast milk your baby gets. This can result in poor weight gain. It can also reduce a mother's supply of breast milk. What to do See your lactation consultant, public health nurse, neonatal nurse, midwife, GP practice nurse or GP if you think your baby has tongue-tie. There is more information on mychild.ie.

You can breastfeed your baby anywhere, anytime. There is very little you need to bring with you, just a nappy change. Building your condence Some mothers feel self-conscious breastfeeding out and about the rst time, particularly attaching the baby to the breast. This gets easier with time. Going to a breastfeeding support group and seeing other mothers breastfeeding can help with your condence. Try putting a light scarf or muslin cloth over your shoulder to give you some privacy while feeding or attaching your baby on to feed. As you get more comfortable feeding your baby out and about, you won't need these. Some babies don't like to be partially covered, so do what works best for you both. Breastfeeding offers comfort as well as food. That's why breastfed babies are often more easily settled. Tips for breastfeeding in public Bring your partner or a friend along for support until you become more condent. Wear a loose top over a vest or cami top so that you can lift up the outer top and pull down the strappy top. Wearing a nursing bra helps, as you can quickly click it open and attach your baby on your breast. Don't wait until your baby gets too hungry or distressed. Know your rights The Equal Status Act (2000) helps mothers to breastfeed comfortably in public places by protecting them from being discriminated against or harassed because they are breastfeeding. Discrimination is unfair treatment. For example, asking someone to leave a premises because they are breastfeeding. You are entitled to breastfeed in public places and you don't have to ask anyone for permission. Some places may offer a private area if you would like this, but you don't have to use it. Expressing breast milk Expressing means removing milk from your breast so you can store it and feed it to your baby later. You remove the milk by hand or with a breast pump. In the rst few days after the birth it is best to hand express. Expressing your breast milk is a very useful skill to learn.151151Your baby's rst 6 weeks In the early days, you may want to express milk if: your baby needs to be cared for in a special care baby unit, neonatal intensive care unit or paediatric hospital you or your baby are too ill to breastfeed after birth your breasts feel very full or uncomfortable your baby is having difculty attaching on to the breast As your baby grows, you may want to express milk when you are going to be away from your baby. Expressing means that during the time you're away from your baby: you'll be able to relieve the fullness in your breasts you'll have milk for your baby's carer Did you know? When you express, it can be helpful to close your eyes and imagine your baby is feeding at your breast. Thinking of your baby or looking at a photo or video of your baby can help you relax and connect with your baby before you begin expressing. Having their clothing or blanket with you can also help. If possible, spend some time together in skin-to-skin contact before you begin to express. Hand-expressing breast milk Getting ready Wash your hands. Have everything you need to hand - for example, a drink, snack and a small towel. Sit comfortably. Think about your baby. Warm your breasts - take a warm shower or put a warm facecloth (warm compress) on your breasts Massage your breasts before expressing - you can do this while in the shower. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 152152Your baby's rst 6 weeks Massaging and expressing Massage your breasts. This encourages the release of hormones and helps get your milk flowing. This can be done with your ngertips (as shown in image A) or by rolling your closed st over your breast towards the nipple (as shown in image B). 1.Work around the whole breast, including underneath. Don't slide your ngers along your breast as it can damage the skin. 2.After massaging your breast, gently roll your nipple between your rst nger and thumb (as shown in image C). 3.You can then press and release your breast. Use rhythmic movements. When you press down and release, a small drop of breast milk appears. Do not rub or slide along your nipple as this may hurt. 4.Continue to press and release. After a while, a few drops of breastmilk appears. Collect this in a clean container or syringe. This will be provided by a nurse or midwife if you are in a hospital. 5.Continue then to press, release and collect. The rst milk (colostrum) tends to drip slowly as it is thick, later milk may come in spurts or sprays. A B C153153Your baby's rst 6 weeks Using a breast pump If you're regularly separated from your baby or if there is a delay in breastfeeding after birth, your midwife, neonatal nurse or doctor may recommend using a breast pump to express your milk. You may also need to use a breast pump if your baby is unable to attach onto your breast. For example, if they are too sick, premature or have problems attaching to your breast. To make sure your breasts make enough milk, you will need to express 8 to 10 times in 24 hours. This includes during the night. Ask your midwife or neonatal nurse about having skin-to-skin contact (page 131) with your baby as soon as possible after birth. If your baby is being cared for in a special care baby unit, neonatal intensive care unit or paediatric hospital, they may have hospital grade pumps that you can use free of charge. If you want to use a hospital grade pump while you are at home, you will need to rent or buy one. You may be able to claim back on any breast pumps you rented or bought for your premature baby through Revenue (see revenue.ie). Use the med 1 form that covers expenses incurred on any medical, surgical or nursing appliance. Storing expressed breast milk In the hospital In the hospital, ask your midwife where your milk can be stored. Make sure to label your name, the date and time on each container. At home Use a washed container. Any container will do as long as it has an airtight seal and can be washed or sterilised and labelled easily. You may also choose to use disposable one-use breast milk storage bags. Label each container with date and time. You can keep stored milk: sealed outside of the fridge for up to 4 hours in temperatures less than 20 degrees in a fridge for up to 5 days (place it at the back of the shelf above the vegetable compartment and not inside the door) in the icebox in your fridge for up to 2 weeks in a fridge freezer for 3 months in a deep freezer for up to 6 months Heating expressed breast milk When you are expressing, the breast milk should be chilled or frozen as quickly as possible. Follow these guidelines for defrosting or warming up expressed breast milk. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 154154Your baby's rst 6 weeks Defrosting frozen milk Breast milk can be defrosted in the fridge, normally in around 12 hours. Alternatively, hold the bottle or bag of frozen milk under warm running water (a maximum of 37\u00b0C or 99\u00b0F). Don't leave frozen breast milk to defrost at room temperature.Once fully thawed, previously frozen breast milk may be kept at room temperature for a maximum of 2 hours or in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Don't thaw or heat frozen breast milk in a microwave or in boiling water. These can damage its nutritional and protective qualities and create hot spots that could scald your baby. Thawed breast milk left at room temperature should be fed to your baby within 2 hours or thrown away. Never re-freeze breast milk once thawed. Warming up milk Healthy full-term babies can drink breast milk at room temperature or warmed to body temperature. Some have a preference, others don't seem to mind. To warm your milk, place the breast milk bottle or bag into a cup, jug or bowl of lukewarm water for a few minutes to bring it to body temperature (37\u00b0C or 99\u00b0F). Alternatively, use a bottle warmer. Do not allow the temperature to go above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Do not use a microwave, as this can overheat your milk.Gently swirl the bottle or bag, without shaking or stirring, to mix any separated fat. How partners can help when you are breastfeeding All newborn babies need to feed frequently during the day and during the night. You can help your partner to breastfeed. Tips include: Praise your partner and tell her you love her. Give encouragement and listen to her. Ask her what she needs.

Make healthy meals for your partner - feeding the mother is feeding the baby! Help out with housework. Plan something fun to do with any older children. 155155Your baby's rst 6 weeks Bottle-feeding your baby Feeding is not just about giving your baby food. It is also a time when you hold your baby close. This helps them feel special, safe and secure. Your baby will love it when you look into their eyes. They will look back at you, delighted with the attention! If you decide to bottle-feed your baby with expressed milk or formula, the tips below will help keep your baby safe and healthy. See page 153 (breast milk) and page 157 (formula) for advice on cleaning and sterilising feeding equipment. Bottle-feeding tips Before the feed Get everything you need ready before you start feeding. Make sure the milk is at the correct temperature. It should feel warm to the touch, not hot. Never heat your baby's milk in a microwave. During the feed Make sure you and your baby are well supported and comfortable during feeds. Help your baby to avoid swallowing air while feeding - keep the teat full of milk. Wind your baby to help get rid of swallowed air if needed. After the feed At the end of the feed, sit and hold your baby upright - gently rub or pat their back for a while to bring up any wind. Formula feeds What is formula milk? If you are thinking about using formula milk, talk to your midwife, postnatal ward nurse or public health nurse. They will talk to you about the: type of formula used for young babies cost safety of local water supply equipment needed risks of incorrect use of formula Formula milk is also known as formula feed, baby formula or infant formula. Most formula milk is made from cows' milk. It comes in powdered form or in 'ready to feed' cartons. Like any food, powdered infant formula is not sterile and may contain bacteria. This is why equipment like bottles and teats need to be sterilised (page 157). You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 156156Your baby's rst 6 weeks Types of formula milk First infant formula First infant formula is the type of formula recommended for newborns. This should always be the formula you use and is recommended until your baby is 12 months old. Hungry baby milk Hungry baby formula contains more casein than whey. Casein is a protein that is harder for babies to digest. It's often described as suitable for 'hungrier babies'. There is no evidence that hungry baby milk helps babies settle better. Other types of milk Do not give a baby under the age of 12 months: regular cow's milk sheep's milk goat's milkcondensed milk plant-based milks like oat, almond or rice milk Soy formula Do not use soy formula unless it has been prescribed by your paediatrician or GP . Water supply Boiled tap water is usually the safest type of water to use. Know the safety of your local water supply (see epa.ie). Bottled water There may be times when you need to use bottled water, for example if travelling abroad. It is best not to use bottled water labelled as 'natural mineral water' to make up your baby's feeds as it can have high levels or sodium (salt) and other minerals. If this is the only water available, use it for the shortest time possible. It is important that your baby gets enough to drink. Bottled water is not sterile. Always boil bottled water to make up formula. Use a kettle or saucepan to get a rolling boil for 1 minute. Cool in the normal way. Do not boil the same water again. Automatic formula makers The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) does not recommend the use of formula preparation machines or automatic machines to prepare bottles of powdered infant formula. There is not enough research to support the safety of these machines.157157Your baby's rst 6 weeks What you need To prepare formula milk correctly, you will need: a clean work surface facilities to wash your hands and equipment at least 6 bottles, lids and teats formula powder suitable water and a way to boil it a bottle brush and a small teat brush sterilising equipment like a steam, chemical or microwave kit tongs to help you grip the equipment How to clean and sterilise equipment You must sterilise all feeding equipment until your baby is at least 12 months old. This is the same if you are using expressed breast milk or formula. Clean and sterilise all feeding equipment before you use it. Cleaning Follow these steps: Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Dry your hands with a clean towel. Wash all the feeding equipment in hot soapy water, such as the bottles, teats, lids and tongs. Use a clean bottle brush and teat brush to scrub the inside and outside of the bottles and teats to make sure your remove any leftover milk from the hard-to-reach places. Rinse the bottles and teats well in clean running water. You can use your dishwasher to clean bottles and feeding equipment that are dishwasher proof. Check with the manufacturer if you're not sure if the bottles or equipment can be used in a dishwasher. Dishwashers do not sterilise bottles or feeding equipment. Sterilising You can use boiling water, a chemical steriliser or a steam kit to sterilise equipment. A steam steriliser is the best. You can get plug-in or microwaveable sterilisers too. If using boiling water Fill a large saucepan with tap water and make sure all equipment is completely covered by the liquid. Make sure there are no trapped air bubbles. Cover the saucepan and bring it to the boil. Boil for at least three minutes. Make sure the feeding equipment is fully covered with boiling water at all times. Keep the saucepan covered until you need to use the equipment.

Touching only the outside of the collar, place it over the teat and use sterile tongs to pull the teat through the collar. Screw the collar onto the bottle and tighten fully. Place the cap over the bottle, being sure not to touch the inside of the cap when doing this. Store the bottles in a clean place. If put together correctly the empty bottles and bottles with sterile water will be safe for 24 hours. If not used within 24 hours, sterilise again. Once you open a bottle to add water or powder it is not sterile. Keep all sterilising equipment and hot water out of reach of children. Using formula milk safely 1.Empty your kettle and ll it with one litre (1l) of freshly drawn cold tap water and boil. Alternatively, boil one litre (1l) of water in a clean pan. 2.Leave the boiled water to cool in the kettle or pan. Cool it for 30 minutes, but no longer. This will make sure that the water is not too hot, but also that it is no less than 70\u00b0C. 3.Clean the work surface well. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them on a clean towel. 4.Read the instructions on the formula's label carefully to nd out how much water and powder you need. 5.Pour the correct amount of water into a sterilised bottle. Water that is 70\u00b0C is still hot enough to scald, so be careful. 6.Add the exact amount of formula to the boiled water using the clean scoop provided. Reseal the packaging to protect it from germs and moisture. Adding too much or too little formula could make your baby sick. 7.Screw the bottle lid tightly and shake well to mix the contents. 8.To cool the feed quickly, hold the bottle under cold running water or place it in a large bowl of cold water. Make sure that the cold water does not reach above the neck of the bottle. 9.To check the feed is not too hot, shake the bottle and place a drop of liquid on the inside of the wrist - it should feel lukewarm, not hot. Feed your baby. 10.Throw away any feed that your baby has not taken within 2 hours. If your baby is a slow feeder use a fresh feed after 2 hours. Before you leave hospital, your nurse or midwife will explain how to safely prepare your baby's formula feed. For more information, see mychild.ie and safefood.eu159159Your baby's rst 6 weeks For breast-fed and formula fed babies Vitamin D and your baby Our bodies can make vitamin D from the sun. But babies cannot safely get the vitamin D they need from the sun. Why your baby needs it Your baby needs vitamin D to help them build strong bones, muscles and teeth. It also helps the immune system. Low levels of vitamin D in children can cause rickets. This is a condition that leads to soft bones. Between 0 to 12 months babies grow very quickly and have a greater need for vitamin D to form strong bones. Due to a change in EU law (February 2020) there is an increase in the amount of vitamin D3 added to infant formula. As a result, the Department of Health has changed its recommendation on vitamin D supplements. All babies who are being breastfed should continue to get vitamin D3 supplement after birth, even if you took vitamin D3 during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. You do not need to give your baby a vitamin D3 supplement if they are fed more than 300mls or 10 fluid oz (ounces) of infant formula a day. Correct amount You should give your baby 5 micrograms of vitamin D3 as a supplement every day from birth to 12 months if they are: breastfed taking less than 300mls or 10 fluid oz (ounces) of infant formula a day Buying vitamin D3 supplements There are many suitable infant vitamin D3 supplements available to buy in Ireland. Use a supplement that contains vitamin D only. Talk to your pharmacist and read the information on the label carefully. Check the label on your vitamin D3 supplement for the number of drops or amount of liquid you need to give your baby. You may need to give your baby the supplement in a different way with each new brand. Bonding during feeds Make the most of this time to bond with your baby: Stay in close contact - consider opening your shirt and doing skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Look into your baby's eyes and your baby will look back at you - this helps babies feel safe and loved. Take it slowly and enjoy the cuddles. Resist the urge to multi-task. Don't prop the bottle \u2014 this increases the risk of choking as well as potentially affecting bonding.

Responsive parenting is an important part of forming a healthy relationship with your baby. It means that you are responding sensitively to your baby while accepting their needs and signals. This type of parenting helps your baby to form healthy brain connections and encourages feelings of safety and comfort. Your baby loves when you hold them close. It comforts your baby and helps them feel secure. You can do responsive feeding by responding to your baby when they are showing signs of: hunger (early feeding cues) - see page 139 distress Tips for responsive breastfeeding Feed your baby whenever they show signs of wanting to breastfeed. Respond to your baby's early feeding cues. Do not try to time the feeds or feed to a schedule. Remember that you are not 'spoiling' your baby by responding to their needs in this way. Tips for responsive bottle feeding Your baby will love it if you or your partner do most of the feeds - they know you best. Gently encourage the baby to root and invite them to take the teat. Pace the feed or go at your baby's pace - try not to rush. Never force your baby to take a full feed. For partners Here are some tips to help you bond with your baby, especially when they are being breastfed: Talk to them and sing to them. Cuddle, rock and lie with the baby on your bare chest - babies love skin-to-skin contact. Bathing, winding and nappy changing are all great ways to bond. Common concerns when feeding Contact your public health nurse (PHN) for support and advice on all aspects of feeding. Many health centres have regular well-baby clinics. These are run by public health nurses.161161Your baby's rst 6 weeks Colic Colic is excessive and frequent crying in a baby who appears to be otherwise healthy. It is not harmful. A baby with colic should still be thriving and gaining weight. Colic is a phase that lasts a few weeks. Talk to your GP or your public health nurse if you think your baby has colic. Allergies Formula is based on cow's milk. Some babies can be allergic to a particular formula. Talk to your GP if you are worried. They can prescribe special formula feeds for your baby. Your GP may also refer your baby to a dietitian. Allergies are less common when breastfeeding but can happen. Constipation Some babies may have one or more dirty nappies every day. Others may have one every few days. Constipation is when babies have difculty pooing. The poos may be rm dry pellets which do not soak into the nappy. When a baby is straining, their face will often become red. They may grunt or make other noises. Straining can be normal. However, straining with crying is often a sign of constipation. Breastfed babies rarely become constipated. This is because breast milk contains a natural laxative. If your baby is constipated, give 30 ml of cooled boiled water one to two times per day. A bath and gently massaging your baby's tummy may help. Talk to your GP if your baby has not had a bowel motion after 2 to 3 days, or is very distressed. Vomiting Small vomits are known as 'possets'. They are normal after a feed and common in young babies. Your baby will grow out of this. Some babies bring up more milk than others after a feed. It can be quite worrying when it happens. Make sure your baby is continuing to gain weight. Keep your baby upright (not lying down) for 20 minutes after a feed. If bottle-feeding, consider choosing a smaller teat. Your baby's gag reflex may be stimulated by milk flowing too fast. If you feel something might be wrong Trust your instincts. You know your baby better than anyone. If you are worried about anything, contact your GP or public health nurse.Contact your GP if: your baby is not thriving (losing weight or not gaining weight) the vomiting is forceful or projectile (sprays out of your baby's mouth for several feet) your baby seems to be in pain You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 162162Your baby's rst 6 weeks Babies who need extra care This can be a very worrying and confusing time for parents. When your baby arrives too soon, you may feel unprepared. You may also have mixed feelings towards your baby. This is normal. Reasons some babies need additional care: premature or low birth weight infection jaundice - a condition in newborns that causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to become yellow their mother had medical problems such as diabetes difcult birth they are waiting for surgery in a children's hospitalSome babies will need extra care after birth. They might need to stay in the postnatal ward, a special care baby unit (SCBU) or a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Sometimes this may mean your baby has to be transferred to another hospital. 163163Your baby's rst 6 weeks Physical contact with your baby Babies who are very small usually need to be cared for in incubators. This helps them keep warm. They may be on a breathing machine. There may also be tubes and wires attached to your baby. You can put your hands through the incubator's portholes and touch your baby. Always wash your hands before touching your baby. This is to prevent the spread of infections. Your baby will benet from hearing your voice and from contact with you. Once your baby is well enough, ask the staff to help you do skin-to-skin contact. Feeding your premature or ill baby When your baby is in special care, you may feel anxious and helpless. Breastfeeding is a very positive way you can help your baby's recovery. If your baby is too unwell to breastfeed, you can express your milk. Colostrum The milk you produce is tailor-made for your baby. It is full of antibodies to help them ght infection. The rst milk you produce is called colostrum ('liquid gold'). Every drop is of benet to your baby. Hand expressing The best way to collect your colostrum is by hand-expressing (see page 151). Your nurse or midwife will help you. Your colostrum can be given to your baby through a special feeding tube. Once your baby is strong enough, you can breastfeed or bottle-feed expressed milk. Understanding your baby's treatment For a period of time, your baby's hospital ward becomes the centre of your universe. Talk to staff there, learn the routines and nd out who will be caring for your baby. Ask the nurse or midwife in the ward to: explain what everything is for show you how you can be involved in your baby's care Your nurse or midwife is there to support and help you. It is important you understand as much as possible about your baby's treatment. This means you can work with hospital staff to make sure your baby gets the best care. You may need to give your consent for some of the treatments your baby needs.

They may easily feel startled, scared or upset. Your baby will feel reassured and loved if you comfort them. Simply being held close to you may calm them. You are not 'spoiling' your baby by picking them up when they cry. The more responsive you are to their cries in the early months, the less they cry when they're older. This is based on research. Why is my baby crying? Babies normally have at least one period of being unsettled each day. They cry for many reasons. Crying is your baby's way of telling you that they need something. Sometimes you need to think about all the possible reasons why your baby is crying to gure out what they need. It can take time to learn what your baby is trying to communicate. Try to be patient with yourself as you get to know your baby. Hungry or thirsty? Your baby may be 'rooting' around for your breast. They may be making sucking motions with their mouth. These are early feeding cues and the best time to feed your baby. What to try Feed your baby. Need a nappy change? Some babies don't like feeling wet or dirty. What to try Check the nappy and change it if needed. Wind? 'Wind' can happen when babies swallow. Air bubbles can become trapped in their tummy and cause a lot of discomfort.

The weight of a newborn baby is tiny compared to the weight of responsibility that you may feel. It is common to feel like you don't have a clue what you are doing. Even doctors, nurses and midwives feel like this when they have their own babies! Your public health nurse (PHN) is available to provide information and support on all aspects of caring for your baby. Your PHN will visit you at home within 72 hours of the birth. You will see them again as your baby grows (see page 199). Your PHN is usually based at your local HSE health centre. Nappy changing tips Whether you use disposable or cloth nappies, one thing is for sure. They all need to be changed! 1.Get everything ready before you begin. 2.If you are using a changing table, make sure everything you need is within reach. 3.Wash your hands before removing the nappy. 4.Clean your baby's genitals and bottom with cotton wool and water or an unscented wipe. 5.Gently lift your baby's legs by holding their ankles. This allows you to clean underneath. 6.For girls and boys, always wipe from front to back. 7.For a baby boy, there is no need to retract the foreskin. Point his penis downwards before replacing the nappy. 8.Let the area dry. There is no need to use powders. 9.Slide a new and open nappy under your baby by gently lifting their legs at the ankles. The new nappy should be snug but not tight. 10.Wash your hands after changing the nappy. Safe nappy changing Risk of falling Never leave your baby alone on a raised surface, even for a few seconds. Babies can roll off changing tables, beds and other raised surfaces. These falls can result in serious head injuries. Risk of suffocation from nappy bags or sacks Nappy disposal bags and sacks and other plastic bags are a suffocation risk.

It helps my body and brain develop in so many ways.\" Caring for the umbilical cord After the birth, your midwife, obstetrician or partner will cut the umbilical cord. This will leave a stump on your baby's tummy where the umbilical cord is cut. You need to keep this area clean and dry while waiting for the stump to fall off. Your baby's umbilical cord stump will fall off in its own time, usually 5 to 15 days after birth. Before the umbilical cord stump falls off: check the umbilical cord at every nappy change to make sure there is no redness there wash your hands before and after you touch the cord clean around the base of the cord if needed with cotton wool and cooled boiled water keep the belly button area dry after you clean it fold your baby's nappy down, away from the stump make sure that the nappy is not covering the cord After the stump falls off The umbilical stump will dry out, turn black and drop off. After the stump comes off, it usually takes about seven to 10 days for the belly button to heal completely. Ask your midwife or public health nurse for advice if you see any bleeding or discharge from your baby's belly button. Go to your GP if you see redness on the skin of your baby's stomach around the stump of the cord, or there is a foul smell. Bathing your baby Your midwife or public health nurse will show you how to bathe your baby for the rst time. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to see it done once or twice before you try. How often You don't need to bathe your baby every day, although you can if it relaxes and soothes them. Two or three baths a week is enough to keep your baby clean.

When you are more condent, you can wash your baby in the main bath or in the sink, or in their own small baby bath. 'Top and tail' wash Use pieces of cotton wool and a bowl of warm water. Wet each piece of cotton wool in the bowl and then squeeze it out so it is just damp when you use it. Use separate pieces of the cotton wool to clean: your baby's face and hands the folds or creases under the neck the folds and creases under arms the nappy area \"Bath time can be 'bond time'! Talk to me as you wash me. I love hearing your voice, it helps me relax.\" When to do it Choose a time when they are not too hungry or tired. It's best not to bathe them just after a feed. What you need Make sure the room you are bathing them in is warm. Have everything you need ready before you start: a baby bath or basin a clean nappy clean clothes two towels some cotton wool. Use plain water and no liquid soaps for babies under 1 month. Getting the water ready Put the cold water in the basin or bath rst. Then put the warm water in. If your bath has a single tap with a hot and cold feed, make sure you run the cold water again to cool the taps so they won't burn your baby. Fill the basin, bath, baby bath or sink until it has 8cm to 10cm or so of water in it.The temperature should be about 36\u00b0C. You can use a bath thermometer to test this.Always check the temperature of the bathwater with your elbow. Your hands are not heat- sensitive enough. Mix the water well to ensure there are no 'hot spots'. 171171Your baby's rst 6 weeks Your baby's skin needs cooler water than your own. Water that may not feel hot to you could be too hot for your baby. How to bathe your baby 1.Hold your baby on your knee and clean their face. 2.Hold their head over the basin and wash their hair. 3.Make sure their head is dried. 4.Slip off the nappy and wipe their bottom. 5.Get ready to lower your baby into the basin. Have one of your arms behind their shoulders and neck, holding their outside arm with your hand. 6.Place your other hand under their bottom. 7.Lower your baby slowly into the water so they don't feel as though they are falling. 8.When their bottom is resting on the floor of the basin or bath, you can remove that hand to wash them. 9.Use your other hand to keep your baby's head out of the water. 10.When nished, put the hand you used to wash them back under their bottom. 11.Hold their legs with that arm as they will be slippery. Then lift them out onto the towel. 12.Lift baby out and pat them dry, don't forget to dry their skin folds and creases. 13.Empty the basin, bath, baby bath or sink. Now is a good time to try baby massage, this can help soothe them. Don't use any oils on their skin for the rst month. Bath safety Babies under 12 months are at greatest risk of drowning in the bath. Drowning can happen in silence, in an instant and in a very small amount of water. Never leave your baby alone in the bath, not even for a second. Your baby's ngernails Your baby's nails are very soft in the rst few weeks after birth. You could easily cut baby's skin when you cut the nails. You may nd it better to gently peel the nails off or use an emery board to le the nails. After a week or two, buy special baby nail clippers or small round-ended safety nail scissors from a pharmacy.

Playing with your baby makes your bond stronger. It helps them to learn and develop. Even newborn babies learn from their parents. Soon they will respond to your touch and the tone of your voice. Tummy time Your baby should always be placed on their back to sleep. This helps to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (cot death). When your baby is awake, it is important that they spend time on their tummy. This helps their development. Tummy time from birth helps develop better head control and stronger muscles. \"Hold a toy over my pram or cot to help me learn.\" \"Cuddle me, touch me, talk to me, sing to me.

If you have a home birth, your midwife will do this at your home. They will ask about your baby's feeding patterns and wet and dirty nappies. They will check your baby for jaundice and will look at the umbilical cord area. Your midwife, nurse on the postnatal ward or care assistant will give you advice on caring for your baby. This includes bathing and nappy changing. Your midwife will also help you start breastfeeding. Jaundice Jaundice causes skin and eyes to have a yellow colour. It is a common and usually harmless condition in newborns. A baby with jaundice may be sleepy. Your midwife will encourage you to wake the baby for feeds. If your midwife is concerned about your baby's jaundice, they may perform a test called a 'bilimeter'. This is a small device that is placed on your baby's forehead. If this gives a high reading, a paediatric doctor will be called. They may take a sample of blood from your baby. If your baby needs treatment, the most common treatment is 'phototherapy'. This means your baby is placed under bright lights for a period of time. Full newborn clinical examination All babies will have a thorough physical examination. This is done by a paediatric doctor or a specialist midwife before you both go home from hospital. Babies born at home will be examined by a specialist midwife or your GP . The doctor or midwife examines your baby from head to toe. This will not hurt your baby although it is normal for babies to cry when they're being examined. This examination is done to check your baby's general health. It is also done to see (screen) if your baby might have certain conditions of their eyes, heart, hips and testes. The examination is done to spot any problems as early as possible so treatment can be started. However, sometimes screening does not identify all babies who are at risk. So if you have any concerns about your baby, talk to your GP or public health nurse.175175Your baby's rst 6 weeks Your baby's eyes The doctor or midwife will shine a light into your baby's eyes. This is to detect cataracts. Cataracts are a clouding of the lense of the eye. Your baby might need surgery if they have a cataract. Your baby's heart A probe will be placed on your baby's foot to check oxygen levels. The doctor or midwife will listen to your baby's heart with a stethoscope. They will check your baby's pulses. If the results of this examination are not normal, your baby might need extra tests. These might include a tracing of their heart (ECG) or a scan of their heart (echocardiogram). Your baby's hips The doctor or midwife will gently bend your baby's leg upwards and rotate their hips outwards. This test checks for dislocated hips. If this examination is not normal, your baby's hips will be checked in a few weeks using an ultrasound scan. Your baby's testes This examination is done on boys. It is to check that the testicles are in the right place. The testicles are normally in the right place by six months. If they're not, your baby may need surgery. Hearing test (newborn hearing screening) Every baby is offered a newborn hearing screening test. For babies born in a hospital, this is done before leaving. The test is done by a trained hearing screener. One to two babies in every 1,000 are born with a hearing problem. This can be hard to detect. Testing your baby's hearing means that any problems can be detected early. Every baby should have this test even if there is no family history of hearing loss. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 176176Your baby's rst 6 weeks What does the test involve? A soft earpiece is placed in your baby's ear. Clicking sounds are sent down the ear. These sounds usually cause an echo in your baby's inner ear. The equipment detects this echo. Will the test hurt my baby? This test does not hurt. You can stay with your baby while it is being done. When will I get the results? You will get the results immediately. What if the test detects a problem? A second hearing test will be done while your baby is sleeping. Heel prick (newborn bloodspot screening) Your baby will be offered newborn bloodspot screening in the rst week after birth. This is also known as the 'heel prick'. This is to see if they are at risk of having some rare but serious conditions. What does it involve? The midwife or public health nurse will gently prick the heel of your baby's foot. This is to collect some drops of blood onto a special card. Will it hurt my baby? Your baby may feel a little discomfort. You can help by: making sure your baby is warm and comfortable being ready to feed and cuddle your baby afterwards When will I get the results? You will be contacted if your baby is at risk of having one of the conditions. A repeat may be needed if the results are unclear. What if it detects a problem?

You'll need: a Moses basket or cot a mattress sheets cellular blankets (these have 'holes' in them allowing air to circulate and can help prevent your baby overheating) If you are borrowing or buying a second-hand cot or Moses basket, buy a new mattress. The mattress should be rm and flat. It should t the cot correctly and have a removable, washable cover. Pillows, cushion, sleep positioners and other similar products are not recommended. They are a suffocation risk. Something to take them out and about You'll need: a car seat a way to carry them when you're out and about - this could be a pram, pushchair, buggy, stroller, sling or baby carrier Car-seats must be safe and suitable to your baby's height and weight. See page 180. Pushchairs and strollers are only suitable for newborns if they recline fully. Most baby carriers or slings are attached by straps and your baby is carried in front of you. Many babies like this because of the sensation of being close to you and warm. Make sure you use them correctly for your baby's safety. 5-point safety harness Make sure all sitting devices like strollers, pushchairs, high chairs and car seats have a 5-point safety harness. Something for nappy changes You will need: nappies cotton wool or fragrance-free and alcohol-free wipes 179179Your baby's rst 6 weeks nappy bin or paper nappy bags - plastic nappy sacks and bags are a suffocation risk lotions - read the label to make sure they are hypoallergenic, dye-free and fragrance- free antibacterial hand wash so you can wash your hands before and after changing a nappy Changing bag A changing bag is useful for holding the nappies, wipes and anything else you need when not at home.

This is the safest position for them to be in. This means the car seat is facing the back of the car. Check it is suitable for newborns. Never put a rearward-facing car seat in the front passenger seat if there is an active front passenger airbag. This is illegal and very dangerous. Second-hand Avoid buying a second-hand car seat, unless you are sure of its safety history. If the car seat was in a vehicle during a crash, it may have damage you can't see.

Blankets Use blankets rather than bulky jackets to keep your baby warm in cooler weather. Keeping your baby safe on journeys Sleeping in a sitting position can cause your baby's head to flop forward. This can make it difcult to breathe. Regular breaks Do not leave your baby in a car seat for a long period. Take regular breaks (at least every 2 hours) on long journeys. Remove your baby from their car seat and allow them to lie flat on your lap. Once you have reached your destination, remove your baby from the car seat. Premature and low birth weight babies If your baby is premature or low birth weight, talk to medical staff in the hospital. Ask them if it is safe for your baby to travel in a car seat.181181Your baby's rst 6 weeks Sleep Some babies sleep more than others. Some sleep for long periods, others for short bursts. Some sleep through the night. Your baby is unique, and may sleep differently to other babies. A baby's sleep pattern is probably not going to t in with your sleep pattern. Try to sleep when the baby sleeps. Coping with disturbed sleep Newborn babies will wake up to be fed. This can be very hard to cope with. Remember, this will pass. It doesn't matter which feeding method you use. Newborn babies will wake regardless. Do not listen to people who tell you otherwise. Your body needs rest. If you have a partner, ask them to help. Get help with cooking and chores so you can grab a nap. Tips to help your baby be a 'good sleeper' Responsive parenting is about responding to your baby's needs. It is an important part of 'attachment' or bonding with your baby. Newborn babies are too young to follow strict routines. You can use responsive parenting tips to help your baby become a 'good sleeper'. It is never too early to start. Play with your baby when they are awake during the day. Have a relaxing bedtime routine like a bath and massage - your baby will soon link these activities with sleep. Put your baby to bed drowsy but awake. Give your baby time to settle down - they may fuss or cry before falling asleep. Expect frequent stirring at night - wait a few minutes to see if your baby falls back to sleep by themselves. Use a soft voice, gentle movements and dim lights with your baby if they wake during the night. Respect your baby's preferences - they may be a night owl or an early bird. \"It is not possible to 'spoil' me.

It is the sudden and unexpected death while sleeping of a baby who seems healthy. Cot death is rare. The cause is not known. But research has shown that you can take steps to signicantly reduce the risk. It is important to take precautions, while not letting fear spoil precious times with your baby. Share the tips on reducing cot death risk with everyone who looks after your baby. You may be given more advice from your paediatrician, neonatologist, neonatal intensive care nurse, special care baby unit nurse, midwife, GP or public health nurse if your baby has specic health needs. Safe sleep position Back to sleep Always place your baby on their back to sleep. Putting your baby to sleep on their back does not increase the risk of choking if they vomit. Babies who sleep on their tummies have a higher risk of cot death. It is not safe to place your baby on their side to sleep because they may roll onto their tummy. Head position If your baby always lies with their head in the same position they might develop a 'flat head'. This is called plagiocephaly. You can prevent this when putting your baby down to sleep on their back. When they are lying flat, you can alternate position their head so that sometimes they face left and sometimes they face right.Keep the head and face uncovered Keep your baby's face and head uncovered while asleep. Tuck blankets in loosely but securely, no higher than your baby's shoulders. Feet towards the foot of the cot Place your baby with their feet pointing to the foot of the cot, crib, Moses basket or pram. This means they can't wriggle down under the covers. Where your baby should sleep The safest place for your baby to sleep is in a cot in your bedroom. Their risk of cot death is lower there than for babies who sleep in a separate room. Keep your baby's cot in your room for at least the rst 6 months. 183183Your baby's rst 6 weeks Bed sharing or co-sleeping in the same bed can be dangerous. It can increase your baby's risk of suffocation and overheating. Do not share a bed with your baby if you or your partner: are smokers have taken alcohol, drugs (legal or illegal) or medication that may make you drowsy are over tired Bed-sharing is not recommended if your baby: is less than 3 months old was premature (born before 37 weeks) had a low birth weight - less than 2.5kg (kilograms) or 5.5lbs (pounds) If you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, get someone else to care for your baby until you are sober. Make sure the cot is in good condition and properly assembled. The mattress should be clean, rm and flat with no tears. It must t the cot correctly. Keep it clear Do not have any soft objects and anything loose or fluffy in your baby's cot. These could suffocate or smother your baby. This includes pillows, toys, cushions, sleep positioners and other similar products. Sitting and carrying devices Cot death does not only happen in a cot. It may happen in a pram, bed, car seat, baby seat or anywhere a baby is sleeping. Sleeping in a sitting position can make it difcult for your baby to breathe. Never leave your baby unsupervised in a sitting device. This includes a car seat, baby seat, sling, carrier or similar products. These sitting and carrying devices are not recommended for routine sleep in the home. If your baby falls asleep in a sitting position, they should be placed on their back to sleep as soon as possible.

A baby can overheat when asleep because of too much bedding or clothes, or because the room is too hot. Room temperature The room where your baby is sleeping should be between 16\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. You can use a room thermometer to check the temperature. Never place your baby to sleep next to a radiator, heater, re or in direct sunlight. Blankets Cotton cellular blankets are best. The tiny holes allow air to circulate. Checking your baby To check how warm your baby is, look for sweating or feel their tummy. Their tummy should feel warm but not too hot. Other signs of being too warm include flushed or red cheeks. It is normal for a baby's hands and feet to feel cool. No hats while sleeping Babies lose heat through their heads. Your baby could overheat if they wear a hat while sleeping. Do not let your baby go to sleep wearing a hat, unless advised to do so by your doctor or midwife. Hats are used immediately after birth to keep a baby's temperature stable. They are not needed for sleep after then. Smoke-free Create a smoke-free zone for your baby. Do not smoke during pregnancy and don't let anyone smoke in your home, car or around your baby. Breastfeeding Breastfeed your baby, if possible. If feeding in bed, always put your baby back into their own cot. Soothers and dodies Some research suggests using a soother (dummy) at the start of sleep may reduce the risk of cot death. If you choose to give your baby a soother: Offer the soother to your baby every time they are going to sleep. Do not force your baby to use a soother if your baby does not like it. Do not worry if the soother falls out while your baby is asleep. If you're breastfeeding, wait until this is well-established before introducing a soother. Do not use clips or chains to attach soother to your baby's clothes as this is a choking risk. 185185Your baby's rst 6 weeks If you're worried Get medical advice early and quickly if your baby seems unwell.

It is an infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can include a rash, but not always. The glass test can help you decide if a baby's rash is suspicious. Press the side or bottom of a glass rmly against the rash. This should cause the rash to fade and lose colour. If it doesn't change colour, go to your GP immediately.

Some nd that their periods do not return until after they have stopped breastfeeding. Mothers who do not exclusively breastfeed usually nd that their period returns within two months. Exercise Being active will improve your health and your mood. It may help your recovery. Try to t in a walk with your baby and any exercises the midwives or physiotherapists showed you. Start slowly Your body is still recovering from the pregnancy and birth. Start slowly and build up gradually. A slow 10 minute walk can be a good place to start. Slowly increase the time and the distance you walk. Low impact exercise like walking is recommended for the rst 6 to 12 weeks after birth. Leaking urine Contact your GP or midwife if you notice that you are leaking urine (wee). They can refer you to see a physiotherapist with an interest in women's health. Deep abdominal strengthening exercise You can try this deep abdominal strengthening exercise when you feel strong enough: 1.Lie on your side with your knees slightly bent. 2.Let your tummy relax and breathe in gently.205Your health and wellbeing after the birth 3.As you breathe out, gently draw in the lower part of your stomach like a corset, narrowing your waistline. 4.Squeeze your pelvic floor. 5.Hold for a count of 10, then gently release. Repeat 10 times. Healthy eating and weight Now is a great opportunity to get to a healthy weight, no matter what your pre-pregnancy weight was. This will improve your energy. No drastic measures It is better to be a healthy weight before becoming pregnant again. However, now is not the time for drastic attempts to lose weight. Do not do crash diets. Healthy food to hand Life with a newborn can be very tiring. Try and have healthy foods to hand for when your energy slumps or get hungry. Eat healthy foods and reduce your intake of sugary or fatty foods. Drink lots of water. Breastfeeding will help burn calories, which helps lose the weight you gained. It also makes you feel hungry, so have healthy food choices available. Try not to have junk food in the house - if it is not there, you can't eat it. Be patient. It took time for your body to grow a baby. It will take time to get back into shape! Having sex It is safe to have sex once the bleeding from your vagina has stopped and any wounds or stitches between your legs have healed. You may not feel ready immediately. The exhaustion of having a newborn baby can affect your sex drive initially. If it hurts Contact your GP , GP practice nurse or public health nurse if it hurts to have sex. They can examine you and refer you to a specialist women's health physiotherapist. Contraception It is possible to become pregnant again even if your periods have not returned.

The baby blues The baby blues are very common and are considered normal. They usually begin on day 3 after your baby has been born. You may be more tearful and emotional than normal. You may be irritable and feel isolated, vulnerable and lonely. You may feel like you are on an emotional rollercoaster, going between great joy and great sadness. Although unpleasant, these feelings are short-lived. They usually pass in 1 to 2 weeks. Postnatal depression You could have postnatal depression if: feelings of 'baby blues' get worse or last for longer, or your mood becomes very low several months after your baby is born You are not alone It is thought that 10 to 15% of new mothers will develop postnatal depression.

Talk to your partner, family and friends. Talk to your GP or public health nurse. Try and explain to them exactly how you feel. Trust that you will feel like yourself again. Eat well and try and get some exercise. Ask family and friends for help. Don't put too much pressure on yourself with housework and other chores, Focus on yourself and your baby. Your GP may refer you for counselling or may prescribe medication. Remind your GP if you are breastfeeding. Some medication is not suitable for women who are breastfeeding. Many public health nurses will screen for postnatal depression. They will tell you what support is available in your area. Postpartum psychosis Postpartum psychosis is a rare form of mental illness that affects 1 in 500 new mothers. It is also called postnatal or puerperal psychosis.

There are things you can do to help: Know the signs and symptoms of postnatal depression. Encourage your partner to get help and offer to go with her to appointments. Make sure she eats enough and gets rest. Encourage her to do some exercise. Take the baby out for a walk to give her a break. Plan activities as a couple away from the baby. Listen to her. Ask family and friends for practical support, like making meals or doing laundry. Limit the number of visitors. Tell her she is a great mother and doing great. Find out if there are any support groups or mother and baby groups in your area. Take care of yourself too. Life with a new baby is stressful, especially if the baby's mother is unwell with postnatal depression. Find someone to talk to. Take some time for yourself - you need a break too.209Your health and wellbeing after the birth Research has shown that up to 10% of partners experience depression after the birth of a child.

This may be done by your GP or obstetrician. It will be done at the same time as your baby's 6 week check if done by your GP . The aim of this check is to make sure you are recovering from giving birth and feeling well. It is a good chance for the GP to meet the newest member of your family. It is also a chance for you to voice any concerns you may have and to ask questions. Consider making a list of any questions you may have before the appointment. What to expect from this check Your doctor will talk you about: any concerns you have the birth how breastfeeding is going for you and your baby postnatal depression contraception Physical checks The doctor will check your blood pressure and, usually, your weight. A vaginal or 'internal' examination is not routinely done. However, your doctor will examine you if you have any concerns about how well you are healing. 211Your health and wellbeing after the birth Your questions Don't be embarrassed to talk to your doctor if you are leaking urine or poo, or if sex hurts. These are common problems that can be treated. Cervical screening If you are due a cervical screening test (smear test), you can discuss this. Normally a smear test is not done until 3 months after giving birth. Low rubella levels If your antenatal bloods showed low rubella levels, you will be offered the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Thinking about another baby? If you are hoping to get pregnant again soon, your chances are far better if you and your partner are in good health. It can take up to a year to conceive, even if you got pregnant quickly the last time. What to start doing if you want to get pregnant Take folic acid every day - ideally start at least 3 months before you become pregnant and keep taking it until you are at least 12 weeks pregnant. Be a healthy weight - this improves your chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy. Avoid crash diets. Follow a healthy balanced diet and do exercise. Stop risky habits like smoking and binge drinking. Speak with your doctor about any prescription medication that you are taking. Certain medications can be dangerous to take during pregnancy. Get the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine). If you are not immune to rubella, get it at least one month before you try to get pregnant. Rubella (German measles) can damage your developing baby. Talk to your GP or consultant if you have a chronic illness like diabetes, epilepsy or autoimmune disease.

Some prefer to leave several years between babies. For others, their family is complete and they do not desire another pregnancy. Contraceptives can be short-acting or long-acting.

These include: male condoms - these are the only form of contraception that will protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caps and diaphragms progesterone-only pill ('mini pill') combined oral pill ('the pill') contraceptive patch contraceptive ring Long-acting Long-acting contraceptive methods are much more than effective than short-acting.

Neonatal death is when a baby dies within the rst 28 days of being born. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 214Your health and wellbeing after the birth Coping with loss - stillbirth and neonatal death Every year in Ireland approximately 500 babies die around the time of birth. Often the causes of these deaths are not known. It is devastating to lose a baby in this way. When the baby dies in the womb Sometimes the baby dies in the womb but labour does not start immediately. If this happens, you will be given medications to induce the labour. This is the safest way for you to give birth to your baby and it means that you and your partner can see and hold the baby at birth if this is what you want. Emotions It is a shock for parents when their baby dies. You may be asked to make important decisions, which can be extremely difcult at such an emotional time. Emotions that you experience can include disbelief, anger, guilt and grief. Do not feel pressurised into doing anything you are not comfortable with. Give yourself time. You need to grieve. Everyone grieves in their own way. This may be a longer or shorter period of time for different people. Telling other children If you have other children, it is important to talk to them about their brother or sister who has died. Every child reacts differently. Sometimes feelings of grief are expressed through tantrums and other difcult behaviours.

It is very important to make the decision that suits you and your family best. Going back to work after maternity or paternity leave can be difcult. Here are a few tips to make it easier: Childcare Organise childcare well in advance. You will be less stressed if you are comfortable with your childcare arrangements. This might be at a cr\u00e8che, child-minder or family member. Settling in Introduce your baby to the childcare provider several weeks before you go back to work. Begin the process of 'settling in'. Make sure your baby has had plenty of time to settle in before you go back to work. Most childcare providers are well used to anxious parents. They will have routines for getting a baby used to their surroundings. Follow their advice, but ask for more time if you need it. Breastfeeding Try to get your baby used to taking milk from a bottle or a cup before you return to work. If you decide to express breast milk (see page 150) during work hours, think how you are going to pump and store the milk. You can nd more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie 218Benets and supports available Share the housework If you have a partner, they may have grown used to you being at home most of the time and doing many of the chores. Talk about this before you go back to work. Plan how to split household tasks fairly. See if there are ways to outsource some chores. Good quality time with your baby Make sure you t in ways to spend good quality time with your baby. This can be difcult when you are exhausted after work, and when your baby is tired too. Instead of delaying bedtime and then rushing, start the bedtime routine at your usual time. Take your time bathing them and reading to them. Enjoy the cuddles. Spend some time planning Anything you can plan in advance makes the morning rush less stressful. For example, plan meals or outts for you and your baby.219As one journey ends, another begins As the journey through pregnancy and birth ends, your journey as a parent is just beginning.
