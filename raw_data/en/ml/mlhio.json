Meditation pillows may help you get more comfortable as you meditate. Here are our top 12 picks. Due to its many purported health benefits, meditation has become increasingly popular. Data from 2017 shows that [10% more U.S. adults](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/nhis/2017) Meditation [has been linked](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth) - increased calmness - physical relaxation - blood pressure improvements - reduced symptoms of [anxiety](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/)and [depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/) [improved sleep](https://psychcentral.com/lib/tips-for-a-good-nights-sleep) While there are many types of meditation and positions you can meditate in \u2014 including standing, walking, or lying down \u2014 many require you to sit. While it sounds simple in theory, sitting for meditation can be a complex process. If you're sitting on the floor, you're going to want to work toward a position that you can maintain for some time while keeping still. Though research on their effectiveness is lacking, if you meditate for longer than a few minutes a day, your body may thank you for a supportive, well-fitting meditation cushion. A meditation pillow is a firm yet comfortable cushion designed to help you sit comfortably for meditation, especially for longer periods. Traditionally, there are two main types of sitting cushions: - Zafu. This is a round firm cushion usually filled with either buckwheat hulls or kapok tree fiber. - Zabuton. This is a rectangular cushion, generally placed under your zafu or meditation bench, or used on its own. - Best overall: [The Monastery Store KaBu Zafu Meditation Cushion](#overall) - Best meditation pillow set: [Halfmoon Essential Cotton Round Sit Set](#set) - Best Buddhist meditation pillow: [San Francisco Zen Center Zafu](#buddhist) - Best zafu: [Seat Soul Meditation Cushion](#buckwheat) - Best yoga meditation pillow: [Ajna Wellbeing Yoga Bolster Pillow](#yoga) - Best for travel: [BrightSpot Solutions Mobile Meditator](#travel) - Best for outdoors: [GoZafu Meditation Cushion](#outdoors) - Best for budget: [Alexia Meditation Seat](#innovative) We selected cushions that are best for the most common meditation postures of either sitting cross-legged on the floor or kneeling with your feet tucked under you.

You can sit on the kapok side for a softer seat or rotate to the buckwheat side for a firmer base. Also, you can turn it on its side (like a wheel) for added height or sit with it between your knees for a [seiza](https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/hero-pose/), or kneeling posture. This is a versatile meditation cushion sold by The Meditation Store at Zen Mountain Monastery in upstate New York. It's the zafu (round) cushion style, which is the most common and adaptable cushion.

Cushion sales support the work of the Zen Mountain Monastery. What to look out for - The KaBu Zafu cushion is a little higher than some zafus. You can remove some of the filling if you prefer a lower cushion. There is no inner lining, so if you remove the cover, be careful to preserve the filling. - Shipping usually takes about 2 weeks, as the monastery is a small religious nonprofit that cloisters 1 week every month.

Here are some pointers on how to find a pillow that works for you. - Position. Decide what position you prefer for sitting meditation. The cross-legged position is the most common, but remember you can also do sitting meditation while kneeling on the ground or sitting in a chair. - Height. The best starting point in choosing a meditation cushion for the cross-legged sitting position is to determine how far off the ground you need to sit for your knees to touch the ground. - Firmness. Decide what degree of firmness you prefer in the filling. Kapok fiber gives you a soft cushion, while buckwheat hulls tend to be firmer. - Shape. Decide if you want a traditional zafu-shaped cushion, or would you like to try something different like a crescent, wedge, or even a flower. Can I use a regular pillow for meditation? Yes, you can, but it most likely won't support you very well. Meditation traditionally uses a zafu-and-zabuton combination, which works quite well to support you in an upright, stable position. A good meditation pillow or set is often a once-in-a-lifetime purchase and may soon become a companion in your meditation practice. Do meditation cushions fit? Yes, meditation cushions do fit. You want them to be: - big enough for you to sit cross-legged comfortably - the right height to allow your knees to rest either on the floor or on added support cushions - firm enough to support your body for long periods of time - flexible enough to let you position and angle the cushion so that your hips flex forward to just the right pitch to comfortably support your body in a triangle shape Can I tweak the fit? Yes, you can. You can adjust the positioning of meditation cushions to accommodate your sitting style or squish them to mold them into the shape you want. Don't hesitate to keep experimenting. Over time, you'll hit the sweet spot. How do you sit on a meditation pillow? Sitting cross-legged on the ground or floor is one of the most common positions for sitting meditation, also called [zazen](https://psychcentral.com/health/zen-meditation/) in the Japanese Zen tradition. There is no one correct way to do this since bodies and flexibility vary greatly. However, a sitting position is considered to be most comfortable and supportive for cross-legged sitting meditation. To achieve a grounded, stable position: - Try to sit cross-legged on the front third of a meditation pillow to raise your behind just a little so that the cushion acts like a wedge supporting your hips and letting your knees angle downward. - Do your best to ensure your knees touch either the ground or added support cushions. In this way you form a firm tripod base with your lower body. - Aim to keep your spine straight but not rigid. You can also turn a zafu on its side, like a wheel, then place it between your legs and sit with your ankles tucked under you to meditate in a kneeling position. You can also meditate in a chair. Shosan Vicki Austin of the San Francisco Zen Center has a [video](https://www.sfzc.org/teachings/dharma-talks/zazen-instruction-video-1) showing detailed instructions for optimal sitting meditation positions on the floor and in a chair. She emphasizes that sitting postures are adaptable to all body conditions. What are these cushions filled with? The filling of traditional meditation cushions is usually either kapok tree fiber or buckwheat hulls. Some use polystyrene beads to avoid their tendency to become hard when sat upon. Buckwheat hull filling will generally make your cushion about twice as heavy as one filled with kapok tree fiber, which is extremely fine and light. When you sit on a cushion filled with buckwheat hulls, it will mold to your seating position and not compress much further over time. Kapok is softer but less firm overall. Some prefer it for its lightweight and softness. A good meditation cushion will help you sit in a comfortable, stable position and may very well last you a lifetime. Take time making your choice, but remember you can often tweak and adjust a cushion once you receive it. Also, time and regular sitting will give your cushion its unique shape. Consider height, shape, firmness, and type when you choose your meditation cushion. All of these will help you achieve the balance, awareness, and rest your meditation can bring. "}
