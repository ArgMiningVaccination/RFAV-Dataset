By Hilary Brueck and Andrew Dunn Update: US officials recommend [pausing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-plans-pause-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-rollout-blood-clots-report-2021-4) rollout immediately, citing blood clots. Americans have had two extremely similar authorized COVID-19 vaccines since December: one mRNA vaccine from Pfizer, and another mRNA vaccine from Moderna. But now, there is another coronavirus shot [authorized for use](https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-expert-panel-recommends-johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-for-ok-2021-2) across the US: Johnson & Johnson's adenovirus jab, which got a [green light from the US Food and Drug Administration](https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-expert-panel-recommends-johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-for-ok-2021-2) on Saturday after an expert [committee unanimously recommended on Friday evening that it should receive emergency-use authorization](https://www.businessinsider.com/expert-panel-recommends-fda-ok-jjs-coronavirus-covid-vaccine-2021-2). In trials around the world, J&J's shot was shown to be [66% effective at preventing coronavirus infections](https://www.businessinsider.com/jj-single-dose-covid-19-vaccine-full-study-results-2021-2) altogether, and 85% effective at preventing severe COVID-19 cases, when given four weeks to take effect. Taken at face value, that may not appear as good as Moderna's or Pfizer's two-shot vaccines, both of which had efficacy better than 94% in their 2020 trials. But [don't be fooled](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-scientist-kizzy-johnson-and-johnson-covid-shot-darn-good-2021-1) by the buffet of incomplete vaccine data we have. Comparing efficacy rates among different vaccine trials conducted at different times is like comparing apples to oranges. That's why [Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts have said they would just take whichever shot](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-would-have-no-hesitancy-taking-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-2021-2) they could get. And for some people, getting the J&J vaccine may be ideal. Young, healthy people, and those who can't necessarily afford to come back for a second jab, may prefer it, and others who don't tolerate vaccine side effects well might like it better too. Plus, you have to consider that J&J's shot was tested out at the height of the pandemic, which may have had an effect on the numbers in the trial. While it may not eliminate disease, J&J's jab holds its own in preventing the worst outcomes of COVID-19 \u2014 hospitalization and death. What's more, it's cheap to make, simple to give and get, and you'll gain some good viral protection in just a matter of weeks, without ever having to return for a second shot. As a... "}
